	<P>During the past week the European sovereign debt crisis has been growing by the day.  There are major conflicts between member states and also between European institutions.  Yesterday and today the financial press was and is full of very serious reports on the situation in Greece, Italy and Spain.  The only clear element is that there has been a comprehensive failure to take strong, comprehensive and resolute action on the issue at a pan-European level.  Europe and the markets are looking for certainty, but all they are seeing is indecision, in addition to receiving contradictory briefings.  Every day some anonymous person, on behalf of one of the institutions, manages to brief and increase the sense of crisis which is genuine.</P>
        <P>On 11 March the European Council agreed a definite statement on ensuring financial support for member states would be sustainable.  This followed three months of intensive negotiations in which there was unity of purpose which has now gone.  Why has the urgency shown in January and February disappeared?  Does the Taoiseach support the majority of countries in wanting to restructure the Greek debt and overhaul that country&rsquo;s financial support package?  It is clear that time has run out and that there is no more room for bickering through anonymous briefings.  What is the Government&rsquo;s position on debt restructuring for Greece and other countries, including Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Government&rsquo;s view on debt restructuring for Ireland, let me make the position clear for the umpteenth time.  This country will repay its debts and the money it owes.  It is included in a programme and package from the IMF and the European Union.  We are meeting the conditions of that package and will continue to look for improvements in it.  The bigger difficulties associated with other countries are obviously a source of serious concern for European leaders.  I agree it would be preferable if we had clarity of decision on the part of all European leaders on the crisis facing a number of countries.  From that point of view, it is perfectly obvious that officials at different levels are working intensively with the governments involved to determine what is the best thing to do.  As the Deputy is aware, in this country we are in constant contact with the troika as regards its observations on the programme for Government and how it is to be implemented.  Let me make it perfectly clear: we are not involved in this package in a voluntary capacity.  It is both challenging and difficult, but we are meeting our targets and on line to achieve them.  We will pay back the moneys and loans the Government led by the Deputy&rsquo;s party borrowed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We note that prior to the general election the Taoiseach&rsquo;s party and his colleagues in government were very enthusiastic about negotiating a restructuring of the debt and made many commitments in that regard.  Clearly, the position has changed dramatically since they entered government.</P>
        <P>I asked the Taoiseach what his position was on the Greek debt, which he did not clarify.  However, there is an element of confusion, even in regard to the Government&rsquo;s position.  In recent weeks the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, perhaps consistent with his pre-election position, articulated the idea of rescheduling the Irish debt, which the markets and analysts would define as restructuring.  He was firmly slapped down by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who stated definitively this was off the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>May I have a supplementary question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The main effect is that the people are more confused than ever.  Equally, the Government&rsquo;s negotiating position is unclear on the proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB.  The Taoiseach stated last week that the proposal was off the table, but we are now hearing reports that the Minister for Finance is in constructive negotiations with the German Government on the issue of corporation tax and the proposal for a CCCTB.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the corporation tax and CCCTB measures the Minister is negotiating with the German authorities?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That position is very clear.  The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, made some comments that were carried by Reuters but later changed by that organisation.  Clearly, they were misinterpreted.</P>

	<P>Can we allow the Taoiseach to answer, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy&rsquo;s use of the word &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; means we are looking for a longer term to pay back the money we owe, or that we are not going to pay back the money we borrowed, that is not the intention of the Government.  We will pay back the loans and the debts the previous Government incurred for the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow the Taoiseach to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me be clear.  The Euro-Plus Pact clearly states countries are entitled to involve themselves in enhanced co-operation if they so wish.  As I stated before, it is the legal responsibility of the European Commission to bring forward initiatives for legislation, as it sees fit.  One of the documents it has produced is on a CCCTB.  In that sense, do not expect this country to sit at that table and say nothing.  We have a healthy scepticism about the proposal made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an attempt to introduce tax harmonisation by the back door and I will be prepared to articulate that view, as will the Minister for Finance.  In that sense, although the Commission is perfectly entitled to introduce initiatives for legislation, as a country we are entitled to have our view.  As the Deputy is aware, other Governments and other countries are very much opposed to this.  It is part of a long tortuous process.  In so far as this country is concerned, our view on the corporate tax rate is clear and our view on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, is equally clear.</P>

	<P>What is the Government negotiating?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Chuir m&eacute; ceist ar an Taoiseach inn&eacute; faoi dhaoine aosta agus an fair deal.  Ba mhaith liom ceist eile faoi sin a chur inniu.  Yesterday, when I asked about the fair deal scheme the Taoiseach informed me that applications for approval under the fair deal scheme will continue to be processed and accepted and I welcomed this.  Last night, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, in answer to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, stated that decisions to grant approval will be subject to the availability of funding.  For its part, the HSE maintains that approvals are not being given.  The HSE has informed us that the computer system for processing applications has been shut down by it since 16 May.  This flies in the face of what the D&aacute;il was informed yesterday.  Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach to clear up the confusion and concern for the elderly people and their families and I accepted what the Taoiseach stated in good faith.  People are being prevented from taking up vacant nursing home places.  They cannot get final approval and are being given 24 hour, seven day care by their families or friends and others are on hospital beds in an already hard-pressed hospital system.</P>
        <P>People watching seek assurance from the Taoiseach that he will ensure this scheme is recommenced immediately.  There must be clarity but the answer given by the Taoiseach yesterday <Col N="268"/>did not clear up the confusion nor did the other responses given.  People are still scared and deeply distressed and they need clear assurance from the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a serious matter.  It affects the livelihoods of our elderly people and it is a matter of great concern to their families.  Deputy Adams is as interested as I am in finding out where the money went.  The Minister for Health and Children informed the House that at least &euro;100 million was diverted from the purpose for which it was intended.  The Minister for Health and Children has ordered an investigation to find out how and to where this money was diverted and to which subheads it was diverted, all being in the area of care for elderly people.  The Minister will have his analysis and examination completed in two weeks.  In the meantime, applications are being accepted and processed but the reality is this is a budget-capped scheme.</P>
        <P>I am keen to see the scheme continue and the Minister is keen to see the scheme continue.  However, Deputy Adams is entitled to know, as are the elderly people involved, where the public&rsquo;s money went.  When the Minister for Health and Children comes back here having found the answers to these questions we will be in a far clearer position to know how many more can be approved for the fair deal scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no laughing matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not good enough.  The Whip should show a little respect, if not for me or for our party then for the people for whom we are advocating a case.  It is not good enough.  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that the Minister would take two weeks to do this review.  I said that was fair enough.  However, we were also informed that these applications were being processed.  The applications are not being processed.  People are waiting for final approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That has happened.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>People are on hospital beds and, perhaps, in hospital corridors for all we know.  People in distressed circumstances are waiting for final approval but they are not being given final approval and it is not necessary to wait until the review is finished to do this.</P>
        <P>The Government is always clear about what it is doing when it comes to the big people in society, the big bankers and the big states.  However, when it comes to the small people and those who could be our parents or who could be us in ten of 15 years time the Government is not clear.  There are totally contradictory messages coming from the Minister for Health and Children, the HSE, the Department and the Taoiseach and this must be cleared up.  The Taoiseach must say, if he does not mind my putting words in his mouth, that this scheme will recommence immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy in that the Deputy purports to have a sole right in respect of the care and consideration of elderly people or the little people as he put it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should answer the question and stop trying to avoid it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a straight question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="269"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is why the Minister for Justice and Law Reform has brought forward the legislation to deal with white collar crime which is of such an interest to so many people and rightly so.  We must deal with the real world here as must those who are applying for the fair deal scheme.  The Minister for Health and Children informs me that applications are being processed and accepted.  I trust the Deputy does not expect that final approval should be given for any scheme if there is no money to meet it.  It is only right and in the interests of the taxpayer and the people, especially those who apply for the fair deal scheme, that they know where this money has gone and that we have a clear view of how the scheme can be continued.  The Minister for Health and Children has asked for two weeks, some days of which have already gone, to find out where at least &euro;100 million has been diverted from the fair deal scheme.  The answer to Deputy Adams&rsquo;s question is that applications are being accepted and processed.  In parallel, the Minister for Health and Children has called in the personnel dealing with the scheme to have a clear view of where the money has gone, how it has been spent and how the scheme can be continued as a consequence, in the knowledge that there is something there to meet it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It should be recommenced immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach is aware, pyrite is a mineral, an iron sulfide, which, when contained in the crush rock under concrete floors in new homes and exposed to moisture, oxygen and certain other minerals, expands slowly but with incredible force causing devastating structural damage, the splitting of walls and ceilings etc.  I wish the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would not prompt the Taoiseach until he hears the question because I have a question for the Minister as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me have it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I say the Taoiseach is aware because one year ago he visited homes affected by pyrite in County Meath along with the now Minister of State, Deputy McEntee.  In a statement with the big headline, &ldquo;Enda Kenny Visits Pyrite Infected Houses in Meath&rdquo;, the Taoiseach stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am shocked at the level of destruction I have seen. These are people&rsquo;s homes and it is an outrage that the current government is washing their hands of this issue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It was an outrage from the Fianna F&aacute;il dominated Government, whose lax regulation allowed builders to use this material despite its destructive capacity being known.  One survey suggests 50,000 homes in north and west Dublin, east Meath, Offaly and north Kildare are impacted.  The costs for remediation are crushing, between &euro;50,000 and &euro;70,000 in many cases, a crushing burden that people simply cannot afford.</P>
        <P>Cover by HomeBond, which was set up by the builders, is incapable of meeting the costs and lasts only ten years but, of course, this is a progressive problem.  In reply to Deputy Catherine Murphy, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government gave, almost word for word, the same hand-washing response as the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Deputies got last year from the then Government.  The view was that it was a private issue between home owners, home builders, HomeBond and developers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You are over time Deputy.  Could I have the question please?  Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is not a private issue and that home owners are the victims of criminal negligence by State authorities and builders?  The science of <Col N="270"/>this has been known since the 1950s and 1960s.  Standards were introduced in England and Britain in 1975.  Will the Taoiseach take charge and alleviate the suffering and stress by immediately establishing a taskforce on pyrite destruction and a State-sponsored pyrite remediation scheme that will give immediate redress and remediation to the victims?  The builders and insurance companies can be pursued afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited a number of homes where pyrite has had a devastating effect on the structures.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that when people decided to buy their home and apply for a mortgage, they found themselves in a situation where, with interest rate increases, it was difficult enough to meet those demands, particularly when house prices were so inflated.  Situations have arisen where cracks appear in the floor or the gable, running right across ceilings.  Measurements taken over a period of months have shown a deterioration, where doors must be removed and door saddles taken up and where floors have risen by up to six inches.  I have seen these houses and I know the frustration and devastation it causes to people.  It happened through no fault of their own.  In some cases the HomeBond facility was able to come to the rescue where contractors dug out foundations and replaced those that contained pyrite, which expands when mixed with cement and water.</P>
        <P>There was a recent High Court case on this.  I am concerned at the number of people affected.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, along with the Minister of State in the Department with responsibility for housing, Deputy Penrose, will study the impact and conclusions of the High Court case.  I do not want to see a situation where people are in houses that show serious cracks in gables.  The measures show in a number of cases that the houses are deteriorating.  This is a cause of constant angst and pressure for those families who find themselves in a situation like this.  The Minister and Minister of State, along with Deputy McEntee, the Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has been meeting representative groups over the last number of years, will be prepared to meet a representative group from those affected and acquaint them with the Department&rsquo;s analysis of the High Court case.  I would like to see people who bought their houses in good faith being proud to live in those houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach described the problems well but he did not give the assurances we need.  The victims of pyrite are the same home owners who were caught in the vicious circle of rocketing house prices up to 2007 that made mega-profits for developers.  As taxpayers they are now bailing out those same developers since they crashed to the tune of billions or euro.  They are in negative equity and the product for which they have taken out 40 year mortgages is now disintegrating in their hands.  This is a monstrous injustice by any standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s genuine concern but could we have a supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am asking the Taoiseach not just to study a court case, I am asking for the Minister and the Government to establish a task force, with immediate effect, to look into all aspects of this problem.  Yes, the Minister should meet those who have been affected but he must come up with a remediation scheme that will allow these structural defects to be repaired without crushing the victims economically.  They are incapable of doing any more because they do not have the money.  I would like the Taoiseach to be more definitive here.  Will he set up a task force with immediate effect with the Minister and others involved in the situation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="271"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Deputy wants me to be definitive but he would not want me to be foolish about this.  The fact is that I have stood in kitchens where people have cried with frustration because their homes have been destroyed by pyrite.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of these questions were brought to my attention by Deputy Broughan and Deputy Terence Flanagan.  The Deputy wants me to give an answer to all his problems on the floor of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>These are not my problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing are gathering all the information to define the best response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They washed their hands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The contractors in many cases did not deliberately put material containing pyrite into the foundations of these houses.  The insurance claims have mounted dramatically.  The answer to what to do about the structure is known: the foundations are removed and repaired, as are the walls.  The dwellings affected are detached, terraced houses and apartment blocks.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being definitive about the extent of the problem.  I want the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to bring definition to the conclusions of the High Court case to see what is the best thing to do.  My interest is in seeing people have homes they can be proud of and not have to wake up every morning to see gables split by pyrite they were not responsible for and which, in fairness, the builders involved did not know was in the material when they put in the foundations.</P>

	<P>There is significant discussion at international level today about the call by President Sarkozy to increase the role of the State in the regulation of the Internet.  The Taoiseach knows the significant role the digital sector plays in Ireland in job creation and the economy and we both agree it has significant potential to create jobs in the future, so this is a major strategic issue.  Given the commitment in the programme for Government on the technology industry, and President Sarkozy&rsquo;s comments, when will the Government bring forward legislation to protect the independence of the Internet from an Irish perspective or will he follow the line taken by President Sarkozy in this regard?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked that question three times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy asking whether there will be another referendum on the day of the presidential election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  I asked that at the beginning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already given my view that there are two priority areas in this respect.  We consider that referendums on the issues in question &mdash; the Abbeylara judgment and the protection of whistleblowers &mdash; should be held on the day of the presidential election.  In the first instance, we believe Oireachtas committees should be able to compel witnesses to come before them.  The Attorney General is proceeding with the drafting of legislation to that effect.  In the second instance, we believe whistleblowers who bring important information to the notice of people should be fully protected.  We consider that referendums on these two priority areas should be held on the same day as the presidential election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights?</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach is aware that the first sitting of the new Seanad will take place today.  As a former Senator, I wish the Members of the new Seanad well.  The <Col N="278"/>programme for Government contains a commitment to hold a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder if the Taoiseach can tell us how legislation in that respect is progressing.  When does the Government expect to hold a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said it would happen within 12 months of the Government taking office.  We are nearing the conclusion of the process of drawing up proposals for the establishment of a constitutional convention.  The issue raised by Deputy Hannigan will be considered at that forum.  I intend to have a referendum on the matter in 2012.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>When does the Taoiseach envisage that legislation will be published to provide for the abolition of prescription charges?  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has announced on numerous occasions that he intends to abolish prescription charges.  We have now found he has delayed that.  Will it happen in the next 40 days or so?  The Government&rsquo;s first 100 days are almost up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>We will get you an answer in a minute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Health should outline why legislation has not yet been published.  There are just 40 days left in the Government&rsquo;s 100-day window for the abolition of these charges.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason the legislation has not been published is that we are operating within the IMF-EU deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach not know that before 25 February last?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker><Col N="279"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Some serious legislation will have to be drafted and enacted in accordance with a strict timeline and in the context of the IMF-EU deal.  Deputy Kelleher seems to have the impression that we will deal with every legislative matter in our first 100 days in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise two issues.  First, what will happen if the constitutional convention mentioned by the Taoiseach recommends that the Seanad be reformed?  In such circumstances, will legislation be introduced to reform the Seanad?  Second, we have waited a long time for the establishment of the Oireachtas committees.  If we are to exercise our role as Deputies properly, we need the committees to be established and to be meeting.  When will they be established?  When will they start meeting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question is in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect the Oireachtas committees to be in operation by next week.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to play a full part in them.</P>

	<P>During the recent general election campaign, Fine Gael and the Labour Party emphasised their intention to abolish upward-only rent reviews for existing leases.  A commitment to that effect is contained in the programme for Government.  When does the Government propose to bring legislation in this regard to the House?  Many people bought into what Fine Gael and the Labour Party were saying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>When is the legislation due?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be done by means of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which is awaiting Committee Stage at the moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to propose an amendment to the Bill?</P>

	<P>Yes.  The Bill will be amended.</P>

	<P>I would like to refer to an important section of the programme for Government that has received little attention and has not been prioritised.  I was extremely disappointed that social enterprise, which has the potential to deliver thousands of jobs, was not mentioned in the recent jobs initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question about promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What steps does the Government intend to take to roll out the section of the programme for Government dealing with social enterprise and to realise its job creation potential?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation is actively working on this element of the programme for Government.  As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government will be implemented over the lifetime of the Government.  I share the Deputy&rsquo;s views on the potential for job creation in this regard.  The Minister will make his intentions known as quickly as he can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Members that it is in order to raise aspects of the programme for Government only if they have been elevated to the status of promised legislation.</P>

	<P>That is the problem.</P>

	<P>Debates, as the Ceann Comhairle knows, are a matter for the Whips&rsquo; meetings to decide.  Deputy Doherty and his party are perfectly entitled to raise a request for a debate when the information becomes available.  I do not have the figures as of this morning.</P>

	<P>Yes, I have been trying for some time to ask a question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry I did not see the Deputy.  When I asked him earlier he did not indicate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  I do not have a dispute with the Ceann Comhairle today.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach is not up to speed with the legislative programme of his Ministers.  Three weeks ago the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is admittedly the Machiavelli of the Government with whom the Taoiseach will have a job keeping up, stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to get on with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that water charges or a property tax would not be introduced next year. </P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>However, he promised a new household utility charge on a flat rate.  When will the legislation giving effect to this charge be brought before the House?  Is the Labour Party happy with the charge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Taoiseach did not answer my question on the issue, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will allow him to answer Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is pursuing the development of the proposal for water metering and water charges in accordance with the IMF-EU deal.  That work is proceeding and the Minister will keep the Deputy informed as he makes his decisions.</P>

	<P>With respect, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>With the greatest respect, while I understand what the Deputy is trying to get at, the matter is one for a parliamentary question.  Legislation is not promised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to disagree with the Ceann Comhairle.  Three weeks ago, the Minister stood opposite and promised the House that a charge would be introduced.  The Taoiseach must tell us when it will be introduced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach told the Deputy a date has not been set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As usual, he blamed us for it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not even refer to the charge but raised something else that has been set aside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>He told the Deputy about an examination.  I ask the Taoiseach to read out his statement again as Deputies may not have clearly understood it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is developing proposals on a programme of water metering and the introduction of domestic water charges following commitments given in the EU-IMF programme for financial support and the decision taken by the previous Government.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The programme and considerations are being developed by the Minister who will keep Deputy Higgins and every other Deputy informed as he proceeds with that work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Before moving on to questions, I propose to pay a brief tribute to Mr. Victor Loughman, an usher on the Superintendent&rsquo;s staff, who retired yesterday after 22 years&rsquo; service to the House.  For those who have been here over the years, Victor was exemplary in the performance of his duties, courteous in his dealings with Deputies and visitors to the House and a role model for those who enter public service.  I wish him and all the members of his family every continued success and thank him for his years of public service to the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I was in New York from 4 to 6 May last.  During my visit I attended several events and gave a range of media interviews during which I stressed the progress in our economic recovery.  My first engagement was when I paid my respects to those who died on 11 September 2001.  On the evening of my arrival I attended an Irish community reception where I met a broad cross-section of the New York Irish and Irish-American communities.</P>
        <P>The following morning, I  attended a breakfast at the New York Stock Exchange where I met the chief executive.  Also in attendance at the breakfast were top executives of IDA client and target companies and senior figures from the financial houses on Wall Street.</P>
        <P>I participated in a lunch at the Council on Foreign Relations where I had the opportunity to meet the Council&rsquo;s chairman, Mr. Richard Haas, and to address an influential group of opinion formers.  That evening I made the keynote address at the American Ireland Fund Gala at the <Col N="286"/>Lincoln Centre which gathered together more than 1,300 of the most significant players in Irish America.  I had a series of visits with US business leaders about potential investments and global economic prospects and had a meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</P>
        <P>The trip provided a great opportunity for me to continue the work of rebuilding Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad.  I reassured the business community in the United States that our rate of corporation tax would not change and pressed home the message that we are tackling our major economic challenges and are open and ready to do business.</P>
        <P>Since taking office I have had two trips to the United States to restore and develop this crucial relationship.  Monday&rsquo;s momentous visit by the President and First Lady was a tangible expression of the warmth and strength of the relationship between our two countries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit, I welcome the fact that we maintain a strong engagement with our diaspora.  I was particularly active in terms of the global diaspora and the United States.  I learned recently that the Government has decided to have a second Farmleigh summit of the Global Irish Economic Forum.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the concept of the forum was a good one when it was initiated?  Will he indicate if he has had any engagement with the global Irish network which was formed as a result of the get-together in Farmleigh, particularly its American members?</P>
        <P>As the Taoiseach noted, Ireland has always been open for business with the United States.  Can the Taoiseach provide clarification on some of the potential projects that are under way?  Did he have bilateral meetings with companies who are thinking of investing in Ireland with regard to specific projects?  He obviously may not be in a position to name the companies involved, but I would be interested in ascertaining whether he spoke to a number of such companies.  Reports yesterday suggested that 2010 was a particularly effective year for inward investment into Europe.  Ireland is one of the largest recipients of foreign direct investment from the United States, so I would like to have some indication as to the potential for further job creation in that regard.</P>
        <P>I have asked both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste about the number of trade visits that are being planned.  From the replies I received last week, it seems that there is a relatively small agenda for trade missions by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste for the rest of the year.  Has that something to do with the tug-of-war that is currently going on between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Department of Foreign Affairs over who has responsibility for the trade portfolio?  I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to move trade to the Department of Foreign Affairs, but that has not happened yet.  It seems that there will be a division of responsibilities between both Departments, which will be a recipe for confusion, as well as a lack of clarity and focus in formulating, articulating and implementing trade policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I give the Deputy credit for the global economic forum which he held in Farmleigh.  It was innovative and brought together a concentration of important people to examine how Ireland might use its global connections for economic development, including exports and job creation.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, has decided to hold a second forum in October, which will probably involve a larger number of interests from abroad.  It will focus more on the consequences of working through the ideas and proposals that are brought forward.  The forum that Deputy Martin organised was important as it was the first of its kind.  I think he might agree, however, that the conclusions might perhaps have been worked through to a far greater extent.  That is where the focus of the next one will be, although I am not decrying the Deputy&rsquo;s initiative.  Having spoken to those in attendance, I know they would like to see a greater follow through on the <Col N="287"/>ideas that were raised and, therefore, the emphasis will be on how best we can obtain actual results from ideas and proposals.</P>
        <P>I met with quite a number of those people in New York and Washington DC.  One of them made the point to me that they would all like to be ambassadors for this country.  The challenge for Ireland is to be able to use that diaspora resource so that when they are speaking to business people or other worldwide interests, they will be informed about the opportunities that exist here.  I also met with a number of banking and other commercial interests which are in the process of engaging with the Industrial Development Authority concerning decisions to locate in Europe.  A number of these interests are considering Ireland, but the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot give details.  It is not for me to make the final decision on their behalf, but we were strong in putting forward the view that they should invest in Ireland.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that we should discuss how best we can make an impact on trade promotion and the economy generally.  There is no difficulty between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has responsibility for trade promotion, while trade policy remains with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is anxious that every embassy will have senior personnel working with the ambassador in the interests of trade promotion.</P>
        <P>The number of forthcoming trade missions has not yet been finally decided.  I have received a request to go to China and while we have agreed to that in principle, it is a matter for the Chinese authorities as to when they have appropriate dates that are suitable.  I raised this matter with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, when he was here and when I met him in London recently.  Given the resources they have, the British Government has made a conscious decision to expand trade promotion and work actively in that regard.  It is also supportive of the opportunities for Ireland in that respect.  We will focus on this area in so far as our resources facilitate us to do so.  There is no difficulty concerning the division of responsibilities in the Departments.  I will advise the Deputy when the trade promotion delegations are finalised.</P>
        <P>Sometimes people think that if a very large delegation travels abroad it makes a proportionately bigger impact, but from my experience I do not think so.  Depending on how far east one goes, a smaller number of chief executives might command more respect and opportunity than having a large delegation.  In either event, we are interested in opening doors and keeping those opportunities very much alive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In his discussions in the United States, was the Taoiseach able to cast any light on the claim that the US Government&rsquo;s Financial Secretary had vetoed the idea that &euro;30 billion of bondholders&rsquo; bad gambling debts should not become the responsibility of the Irish people?  That was flatly refused by the US Government.  Did the Taoiseach get any insight into that in America or from his recent talks with President Obama here?</P>
        <P>With regard to the global economic forum and multinational corporations, while every job is absolutely vital for each worker concerned and must be protected, does the Taoiseach not recognise that much of this investment is highly capital-intensive?  Even the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative document explains that it does not yield major job creation.  Does the Taoiseach not see a contradiction between crushing the domestic economy with austerity proposals, while on the other hand seeking a second global economic forum?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not see any contradiction there at all.  I am sure the Deputy is as interested as I am in seeing that those who are unemployed in his constituency have an opportunity to get a job and be gainfully employed here.  Whether that is by working for foreign direct investors in our country or because of indigenous investment whereby jobs are created, <Col N="288"/>I am sure the Deputy would be happy either way.  As regards foreign direct investment, we are interested in building on the opportunity that exists here in the hi-tech area, which is changing rapidly.  Ireland has the flexibility to meet the next wave of change that is coming, whether it is in robotics, nano-technology, genetics, biotechnology or the Internet itself.  Over the last dozen years or so, Ireland has measured up by having the world&rsquo;s best located here.  We want to keep it that way.</P>
        <P>I did not raise the US Treasury Secretary&rsquo;s comments because I was not aware of Professor Morgan Kelly&rsquo;s article at the time.  I do not have the minutes of the G8 meeting.  I understand that this matter was not on the agenda, but arose in side comments at that meeting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, the view of the IMF and the ECB in terms of burden sharing and bondholders is clear.  Our engagement with the US Treasury is conducted by officials from the Department of Finance and we are in regular contact with it.  As late as just a couple of weeks ago, one of the senior officials was actually in Washington discussing with the Treasury the connections that continue to exist between here and the United States.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed our connections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>If I understand the Taoiseach correctly, he has told the House that he met Timothy Geithner in March&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>He has not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>He has.  He met Timothy Geithner in March, he visited the United States again to discuss economic matters and he recently met the President of the United States.  He knows, I know and the entire country knows that Ireland is on its knees as a result of the requirement placed on us to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders.  Is the Taoiseach seriously telling the House that he got no inkling from Timothy Geithner or the US business people and politicians he met about the US Government&rsquo;s position of torpedoing a proposal that the bondholders should share some of the pain of the financial crisis they created and that we were being asked to pay for?  That is extraordinary.  I note&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Question Time.  The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach telling the House that, despite the allegation, he gathered no knowledge in all of his meetings that this was the US Government&rsquo;s policy position on Ireland&rsquo;s economic situation?  After the allegation was out in the open, did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about it?  In the newspapers, he described the President as a political super star.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, but I must remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.  Will he ask questions, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Are we to take it that the Taoiseach was so star struck by his meeting with President Obama that he forgot about the most pressing issue facing this country and did not ask whether the US Government torpedoed our plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="289"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These questions relate to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to the United States.  Will the Deputy please ask questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to force bondholders to pay some of the cost of the economic crisis they created?  It is staggering.  Has the Taoiseach any intention of asking the US authorities whether this most serious allegation is true?  It will have a devastating effect on our people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy seems to know a lot about it.  It is a pity he did not remind me of this before I went to America to meet Treasury Secretary Geithner.  Obviously, it was not discussed because the assertion had not been made in an article by the economist Professor Kelly.  I am sure that, if the Deputy had known of it in advance, he would have informed me of it.  In so far as that is concerned, I do not have the minutes of the meeting that took place in Asia.  I understand that it was not on the agenda and I am not privy to the side comments made during any discussion that took place at that meeting.</P>
        <P>In so far as the discussions with the President of the United States are concerned, we discussed immigration, our restructuring of our banks, trade both ways between the two states, foreign direct investment by American investors in Ireland and the fact that 80,000 Americans across 50 states work in Irish-owned companies, many of which have been assisted by Enterprise Ireland.  We discussed the range of issues in so far as Europe was concerned.  We will continue that measure of contact and connection between both Administrations.  The information flow between the Department of Finance on behalf of the Government here is conducted with Treasury officials in Washington.  A senior official was out there just a few weeks ago giving a full briefing in so far as progress about meeting our commitments and developing our economy were concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to New York in early May, he announced a jobs creation scheme, essentially a &euro;3,000 reward for each job someone in the diaspora creates and that is still in existence after two years.  Has anyone taken up this proposition and what job numbers has the Government projected will be created by the initiative?</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the undocumented Irish &mdash; we have both done so a number of times &mdash; directly with President Obama recently?  Will the Taoiseach report on this matter?</P>
        <P>We are all agreed that the diaspora is important and, particularly in the US, influential.  The amount of help it has been to the peace process is a matter of public record.  It has encouraged the British quietly and diplomatically to deal with issues the latter may have been reluctant to address.  Has the Taoiseach considered the question of legacy issues?  In particular, of what assistance will the White House be in respect of the Oireachtas motion on the British Government&rsquo;s refusal to hand over the files on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings?  Will the Taoiseach seek the assistance of those in the White House and the wider diaspora to get the British to do what they should as of right?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I had a good meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR, in New York.  We discussed the implications of the fact that, if legislation was to be drafted through Capitol Hill, it would come through Senator Schumer of New York.  He has close connections with the ILIR and would be the author of any such legislation.  As the Deputy is aware, there is now a difference between the political bases of the Congress and the Senate.  The legislation would require support from both sides to get through.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding what might happen, the situation in so far as homeland security is concerned following the bin Laden incident is that an increased package of security measures may come <Col N="290"/>forward, in which case immigration reform could be an associated measure, but this is a long process, as the Deputy knows.  President Obama, at our meeting in Farmleigh House, indicated following his El Paso speech on immigration that this is a priority for him and that he would regard the matter as not being solely concerned with one element, that is, a number of nationalities are involved.  He is interested in that.  We agreed that, through the Irish ambassador and other agencies, we would continue to work with political representatives from both sides in Congress and the Senate.</P>
        <P>I made reference to the jobs situation in New York.  I did not put any figure on the contribution that the State might make to anyone responsible for bringing about a job here.  This is an opportunity, brought forward by a private company, to say that there is now a facility globally to tie in the entire Irish diaspora through the use of modern methods, such as the Internet.  If a person is in Australia, Alaska, South America or Siberia and has connections with this country in any shape or form, there is an opportunity to involve the entirety of the global diaspora in the potential creation of jobs here.  If someone in Wicklow contacts a relation in Sao Paulo who is working for company X, he or she would ask whether there was an opportunity for some element of what that company manufactures to be manufactured in Ireland.  A foreign national in this country could decide to contact someone in his or her own homeland to say there are better opportunities for sourcing the development of that person&rsquo;s industry in Ireland and ask for it to come here.  If the IDA is not actively following through on this particular proposal and if it comes to fruition and jobs are created, the idea is that the person who initiated it would get a reward, if the House wants to term it in that sense, for bringing about jobs that last for one or two years and beyond.  There is no figure mentioned.  The proposal will be piloted by IDA Ireland which has appointed a person to drive it forward in conjunction with the company.  It is not in operation yet.  It is a brilliant and innovative idea, tying in the Diaspora in one fell swoop in the interests of job creation in Ireland.  A project could be set up in Louth, Cork or anywhere else.  It is an opportunity to tie everything together in the hope extra jobs will be created here by foreign investors who would not normally consider doing so.</P>
        <P>I think the Deputy asked me a third question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about enlisting the support of the Diaspora and particularly the White House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We talked about the Assembly elections in Northern Ireland and the fact that the Government would continue to work with the newly elected Assembly and the British Government in taking advantage of cross-Border opportunities.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to following through on promises made by the previous Government in a number of cross-Border areas.  The first North-South Ministerial Council meeting between the new Executive and the new Government will be held on 10 June when we hope to pursue a number of these issues.</P>
        <P>What I did mention to the President was the requirement for funding under the International Fund for Ireland to continue.  He specifically mentioned that his own Administration had included it in the budget.  Senator Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs, has this in view and I hope it will continue.  I made the point that for vulnerable communities on both sides in Northern Ireland, this kind of investment was important, particularly to prevent young men, as the Deputy is well aware, from regressing towards violence and criminality.  We discussed the matter in general.  The President has been very supportive and says he will continue to be so in this regard.</P><Col N="291"/>
        <P>We did not discuss the question of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s earlier reply on trade and the division of responsibility, I am disappointed with what is happening.  When he announced the new Cabinet, it was clear that responsibility for trade policy was to be in the Department of Foreign Affairs, hence the name Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It seems there has been a resiling from that position and that now responsibility for trade policy will not be in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but will continue to reside in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  Ambassadors in the Department of Foreign Affairs have always promoted trade.  In the past two or three years they have had specific functions in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I put it to the Taoiseach that when I met ambassadors from around the world when they came back to Ireland a year ago, they all clearly articulated the idea that responsibility for trade policy should reside in the Department of Foreign Affairs because it would facilitate greater synergy of approach.  From what the Taoiseach said, it seems that is not now happening.  This is a mistake.  The new title is a misnomer.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with the President the idea of having an E3-type bilateral agreement with Ireland?  I successfully negotiated a working holiday agreement between Ireland and the USA and this was the first country to do so.  The agreement allows a person to work and travel for up to 12 months, similar to other agreements we have in place.  The idea behind bilateral agreements it to try to develop a legal framework for future structured migration in order that we can, at least for the future, avoid creating new generations of undocumented and illegal immigrants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Taoiseach whether he had any discussions on the specific issue of a bilateral agreement on the basis of the E3 visa which is a renewable work permit, a matter about which we have had discussions in the past.  Given the difficulties outlined by the Taoiseach in achieving comprehensive immigration policy reform, have there been any separate discussions on the possibility of entering into such an agreement?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s brilliant innovative idea, we need greater clarity in terms of verification and validation.  My own experience as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment suggests that is not how jobs are created by or sourced from multinational or emerging companies in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.  It takes a far longer, more focused effort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The President has made it clear that it is not his responsibility to decide on bilateral arrangements such as the E3 visa programme.  It is a matter for the Hill, as the Deputy is well aware.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what I am saying.  I am asking about the New York visit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the New York visit I met the ILIR and discussed the possibility of having an E3 visa-type agreement.  In that context, any amendments made would require Republican support because the legislation would have to go through the House in the first instance.  If this were possible, it would be tagged on, as the Deputy is aware, to some other Bill going through.  That is where Senator Schumer and his group have an important role to play.  I was in contact again in the last couple of days with the ILIR which is prepared to work with the Government in whatever way it can to achieve an E3 visa-type bilateral arrangement.  The holiday visa was a concept that did not catch on as much as the Deputy might have thought.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="292"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a good initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The President said during his visit that his priority was overall comprehensive immigration policy reform, but that will be difficult, given the political set-up in the Capitol.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is developing the Ireland House concept that is already applied in many countries in order to drive trade promotion.  This concept has worked successfully and will continue to do so.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I make no case that job creation will result from the initiative using modern communications that may be developed here.  It is one element, part of an additional resource that will be piloted by IDA Ireland.  It may bring about the creation of a substantial number of jobs, but I do not know.  It must be tested.  However, it is new and its value is that it will tie in the Diaspora.  We can target individual areas by sending delegations or office appointment which have a constant impact, but this concept allows for people all over the world to involve themselves simultaneously in placing the focus on Ireland.  This brings me back to the point I made about the last Government&rsquo;s Global Irish Economic Forum.  The members of the Diaspora would all like to be ambassadors and they can now be because they will have an opportunity to make direct contact to feed into the job creation potential.  It is an addition to the formal structures that have been proved to work by IDA Ireland during the years.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has said he discussed the restructuring of banks with President Obama.  I ask him to take us briefly through that conversation.  Did he explain how German, French and other banks had recklessly gambled tens of billions of euro on Irish properties and then lost?  Did he remind the President that his guy, Mr. Geithner, had vetoed the idea that these gambling banks should carry their own losses and generously offered that the Irish people would pay instead?  It beggars belief that the Taoiseach would not raise this issue with the President, following on from his failure to raise the same or a related issue with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  This is the single most crushing burden on the people.  Will the Taoiseach explain to the D&aacute;il why he failed to raise these issues and the possibility of a major reduction in the debt with these two world leaders?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but this is Question Time.  This group of questions relates to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to New York.  Can we stick to that matter, please?  We have spent 32 minutes on this group of questions.</P>
      
        <P>Will the Deputy please co-operate with the Chair and ask a supplementary?  We do not need statements on each occasion he rises to put a supplementary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I might respond to the speech made by Deputy Higgins by stating that it was the unilateral guarantee which was given that was identified as being impossible to resile from.  The discussions in which I engaged in respect of restructuring involved explaining the Government&rsquo;s decision to move away from having six dysfunctional banks in order that we might <Col N="293"/>establish two core pillar banks which would be in a position, through deleveraging, to make credit available to small businesses and to lend money in order that we might engage in job creation and develop our economy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to the German banks and the fact that they lent money to Irish banks which, in turn and in many cases, lent it on recklessly.  The latter added to the confusion that existed and helped create the situation in which we find ourselves.  From that point of view, the discussions in which I was involved centred around the decisions taken by the Government to move towards resolving this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not obtained an answer to the question I posed, which relates to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s recent visit to the United States.  Given that the burden of the banking debt is the key to our economy being crushed and is responsible for the brutal austerity being imposed on all of us, is the Taoiseach stating that he did not obtain an inkling from US Government representatives that their attitude towards this crucial problem is that the Irish people should pay for the gambling debts of French and German bankers?</P>

      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the job creation scheme which the Taoiseach outlined in graphic terms, are there any projections available which indicate the number of jobs that might be created?  When he visited London prior to his visit to the USA the Taoiseach stated that he would be unveiling a range of initiatives &mdash; some of which he indicated would be very exciting &mdash; aimed at encouraging the diaspora to engage with our economy.  In view of the fact that the diaspora is getting bigger with each passing week, will the Taoiseach provide details on some of the exciting initiatives to which he previously referred?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="295"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that what the Deputy has just stated is the case.  That is why we announced, as part of the jobs initiative, moves to deal with VAT and PRSI and it is why we are focusing our efforts on the areas of tourism and trade, particularly between Ireland and Great Britain and the United States.  The programme of investment being followed through on by IDA Ireland is both serious and quite exciting in nature.  I met potential investors in Washington and New York and I am aware that they are very enthusiastic regarding the clarity displayed by the Government in the context of its decisions on the banks and on how it proposes to encourage investment in this country by retaining our existing corporate tax rate.  There will be no equivocation with regard to the latter.  On my visit to the US, I also pointed out the financial advantages and opportunities that exist in Ireland for companies wishing to establish operations here.</P>
        <P>Tying in the diaspora in respect of that new innovation would give a global reach to what we are trying to achieve.  When the second economic forum takes place in Dublin later this year &mdash; the first was organised by Deputy Martin &mdash; I hope we can follow through with a more comprehensive process for dealing with the issues that arise in the context of ideas and proposals or with regard to changes that might be brought about in order to stimulate job creation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, every day that passes is a day which moves us further away from the recession.  In addition, every job created represents a new career for someone and also an opportunity to proceed with the strengthening of our economy.  The latter is critical in the context of ensuring that people will not be obliged to leave.  Many of the companies which have already received assistance from IDA Ireland should be encouraged to employ and train graduates, particularly in view of the fact that the position with regard to our exports is currently so strong.  If these companies did as I suggest, it would give people the opportunity remain here rather than being obliged to move abroad.  I am sure the Deputy would support such a development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GerryAdams"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerry Adams</NameTxt>
	<P>I do support it.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to provide projections with regard to the number of jobs to be created?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible to say.  It will depend on how the scheme is structured and the degree to which it will catch on.  I am sure people from abroad will be interested in the flexibility that exists in this country and in the infrastructure potential it offers.  It may well be that it will prove to be critically important.  However, it is critical that we should launch it as a pilot scheme in order to see how it will work.  In this way we will be able to test it and improve on it.  The important aspect is that it will tie in the entire diaspora, regardless of whether its members are located in Australia, South America or wherever.  It will illustrate that there is a connection which is both alive and waiting in respect of interest in this country.  In light of the changes that will occur in the coming decade, I am of the view that Ireland could score heavily in the newer areas of development.  However, the position must be tested.  We are going to establish the scheme, which is a new innovation.  Let us see how it will work.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P><Col N="296"/>
        <P>The programme for Government commits the Government to establishing a constitutional convention to consider comprehensive constitutional reform and to report within 12 months of its establishment on the following matters: the review of our D&aacute;il electoral system; reducing the term of office of the President from seven to five years; provision for same sex marriage; to broaden the reference in the Constitution to the role of women in the home to one which recognises the role of the parent in the home; removing blasphemy from the Constitution; the possible reduction of the voting age; and other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by the convention.</P>
        <P>Work has commenced on the preparation of detailed proposals for the establishment of the convention and, when ready, these will be considered by Government.  They will address matters such as the structure, composition, terms of reference and basis on which the convention will be established.  This process will include consideration of likely costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recent general election campaign Fine Gael promised to establish a citizens&rsquo; assembly, while the Labour Party promised a constitutional convention.  The programme for Government contains the name put forward by the Labour Party and the substance of the Fine Gael proposal.  I asked the Taoiseach about this matter in March and he assured me that other parties in the House would be consulted well before any proposals were presented.  That has not happened and there has been no consultation in respect of this mater.  The legislation must be introduced in the next few weeks if it is to be passed before mid-July.  Does the Taoiseach agree it would be a very bad start to the work of the convention if the first offer of consultation was reneged upon?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach previously stated the preparatory work relating to this matter is well advanced.  Which Minister will be responsible to the House for the convention?  How will it be funded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is contained in the programme for Government.  There were originally two distinct proposals which have come together pretty well.  There will also be consultation with the leaders of the Opposition and their parties.  It is a matter that will, I hope, result in several changes to the way the country is run and it will be reflected in our Constitution.</P>
        <P>It is not a case of proceeding with legislation without consultation.  This is a convention in which citizens will have the opportunity to participate.  On 13 April the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs had a briefing from We the Citizens.  The results of the convention, when it has concluded, will be considered by the Government as a matter of discussion with other parties.  Deputy Martin will be consulted.  The details are well advanced and I hope to produce them soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>While the details may be well advanced and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has met We the Citizens, no one has met Members of this House who should be fundamental to any reconsideration of our Constitution.  Why are such fundamental issues being discussed without any consultation with Members?  It is unacceptable and wrong.  There should be more proactive engagement with Members.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that he will get the Chief Whip to organise effective consultations with Members on this convention?</P>
        <P>Which Minister will be accountable to the House for the work of the convention?  If it is to be truly democratic, as any reconsideration of the Constitution on such a wide basis should be, those directly elected by the people should be the first to be consulted.</P>

	<P>I agree there has to be meaningful consultation.  I do not see any way to bring about the type of political reform the Taoiseach has talked about unless meaningful consultation is a fundamental basis.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach consider giving the vote in presidential elections for Irish citizens outside of this State?  On a matter which I have raised before with the Taoiseach, and which he has promised to consider, how truly national will this convention be?  Will it include citizens from the Six Counties?  Has any advance work or consultation been held on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The D&aacute;il electoral system will be a matter for the convention which will include the possibility of people outside the jurisdiction being able to vote.  At a meeting in Brussels before the last election, it was pointed out to me that more than 3,000 Irish people work in the European Commission, Parliament and other EU institutions.  A simple amendment to the existing legislation would allow them to vote in the same way as diplomats can.  That is a matter for the convention to consider under its review of the D&aacute;il electoral system.  Consideration will be given to the national reflection on this matter.</P>
        <P>It will not be long before I bring these proposals to the House.  It will be unlike the past when the House was disregarded.  When the proposals are put together I will certainly discuss them with the leaders opposite.  If they have suggestions to improve them, I will be very happy to hear them.</P>

    <Title>Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill is welcome in so far as it is a piece in a jigsaw.  The Minister for Finance outlined how it is set against the country&rsquo;s economic position as defined by predictable measurements and the revisions of gross domestic product and so forth that occurred during the IMF-EU review.  I have suggested that our position is even starker and that it will have a far greater impact that we must not forget.</P>
        <P>Our situation is not properly understood in the EU or the IMF.  Following the credit and subsequent property and asset bubble, losses in our banking system will amount to approximately &euro;100 billion.  This has been a slow-burn story to date.  It was unreliable until the end of last year and during the change of government.  The problem now is this monstrous debt.  While it is awful that 450,000 people are unemployed and 50,000 are emigrating, those emigrating are at least not saddled with debt.  With their qualifications, they have a survival kit, albeit abroad.  The people who are being crushed are those who must stay because they are tied to their debt obligations.  The true story that needs to be brought forward by this House is that the banks&rsquo; historical losses are approximately &euro;100 billion.  The embedded debt in the banking system, with the further debts in the household and business systems, are too large.</P>
        <P>The debt in the banking system has a hardcore of approximately &euro;150 billion, essentially provided by the European Central Bank.  Of that, &euro;70 billion has a provenance in the repayment in full of senior bondholders up to the end of last year.  The banks did not have the money to repay the senior bondholders; accordingly, they got it from the ECB on loan and used it to repay them.  That happened when people did not understand the size of the losses in the system were as large as I have outlined.</P><Col N="298"/>
        <P>What is the solution?  There should be a write-down of the debt owed by our banking sector to its creditors, that is the ECB and the remaining senior bondholders.  It has been suggested the write-down on ECB balances should be &euro;50 billion with &euro;25 billion on those to outstanding senior bondholders, making a total of &euro;75 billion.  If that &euro;75 billion were cascaded through the system by a debt write-down for households and businesses that took on impossible debt between 2003 and 2007, it would lead to a massive and real, not a bogus or ghost, stimulus to the economy.</P>
        <P>Take the example of a person paying back &euro;1,850 a month on debt repayments.  If they in turn were able to get a debt write-down of 25%-30% their monthly repayments and loan amount outstanding would be manageable.  Moral hazard will be put forward as a possibility to prevent such consideration but this can be dealt with through logical and fair argument.</P>
        <P>The contributions I heard yesterday on this Bill were constructive and showed that everyone in this House is genuinely trying to make little adjustments and alterations to what is essentially a good proposal to deal with our housekeeping arrangements.  As stated by Deputy Doherty we have three problems: a debt problem, which I have just mentioned, a fiscal problem, which is housekeeping balances and, a jobs problem, all of which are inter-related.  We must not fall short in setting out the true picture, explanations and suggestions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken on many finance Bills down through the years but this is possibly the shortest, physically, on which I have spoken, which reflects the fact that it is a pretty small initiative.  Nevertheless, I wish it well.</P>
        <P>On the day the jobs initiative was announced I welcomed the move by the Minister for Finance on research and development tax credits, a reform long overdue.  I reiterate that welcome.  There is tremendous tax competition to attract investment in intellectual property, research and development and so on.  By and large, we have done well as a country in attracting that type of investment, as the figures for the past five years will show.  Unless we keep up with our competitors we risk falling behind.  While I welcome what the Minister has done I am bound to mention a number of pressing issues, including that of the base year.  Research and development tax credit is claimed by reference to the increase in expenditure on research and development over the base year 2003.  This has created problems for a number of firms who invested fairly substantially in 2003.  On the outsourcing cap, one is allowed to outsource 5% of one&rsquo;s expenditure on research and development.  That is too small.  I made representations on the matter to Deputy Lenihan when he was Minister for Finance which, I regret to say, were unsuccessful.  However, the case is no less valid now.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The difficulty that arises is not the quality but the amount of research done outside business by research and third level institutes.  The amount in this regard far exceeds what is done in-house, as people in the business will testify.  Also, an increase in the cap from 5% to 25%, as recommended by some experts, would encourage further links between industry and the research and third level institutes.  Many Government policies scattered throughout the programme for Government are designed to encourage such links.  Retaining the cap at 5% flies in <Col N="299"/>the face of what the Government is attempting to do to encourage linkage, with which I agree.  The programme for Government also includes the specific commitment that companies with research and development expenditure of under &euro;100,000 would be allowed tax credits for the entire expenditure rather than tax credits by reference to the base year.  I sincerely hope the Minister for Finance will be able to incorporate these urgently required changes in the next budget.</P>
        <P>On value added tax, on the surface it would appear it is a good idea in principle to target VAT relief at a particular sector.  This is better than the initial approach suggested in the programme for Government, namely, a 1% cut across the board for all activities covered by the 13.5% rate.  Nevertheless, the question that arises is whether the VAT rate reduction will be passed on.  The evidence in this regard is, to say the least, a little sketchy.  I recall the former UK Government, to stimulate the economy and create employment, introduced fairly substantial cuts in value added tax but because the concomitant benefits were not realised the public finances ended up in an even worse mess, resulting in the cuts having to be reversed.  The Government has said in a number of statements that it intends to review the situation at the end of this year to ascertain if the reductions have been passed on.  If not, the relief may be withdrawn.  I regret that I do not find that credible.  If the Government were serious about this it would introduce the reduced rate for the balance of this year and indicate its preparedness to continue it in the next and following budget provided the benefits were being passed on.  If the benefits of this reduction are not passed on, all we will have is a raid-pilfering of private pension funds to enrich restaurateurs, hoteliers, fast food outlets and various others who have benefited from the reduction.</P>
        <P>Despite that many services are covered by the reduction, many others are not, including services directly related to the tourist industry, which I accept is a job rich industry and it is right for us to focus on it.  For example, one of the services covered by the 13.5% rate is &ldquo;short term hiring of cars, caravans, mobile homes, tour guide services&rdquo; which are fairly integral to encouraging tourism.  Perhaps the Minister will when replying clarify if these services are covered by the VAT reduction.  General repair and maintenance services are also subject to VAT at 13.5%.  As such, electricians, mechanics, carpenters and so on remain liable to the 13.5% rate.  I do not know what would be the cost of extending the reduction to cover these services but it could perhaps be balanced by reducing the VAT rate by 3%-3.5% rather 4%, in particular in view of the growth of the black economy.</P>
        <P>Also subject to the 13.5% VAT rate are &ldquo;fuel for power and heating, coal, peat, timber, electricity, gas and heating oil.&rdquo;  There is no relief in this area despite the reality of fuel poverty.  I recently read an article in a newspaper in relation to the reduction in the VAT rate to 9%.  It was estimated that in respect of a meal and two drinks costing &euro;100 one would save &euro;3 as a result of this reduction.  I do not know if that would encourage people to go to restaurants.  The relief would be better concentrated on people who are suffering the effects of fuel poverty and who are struggling to survive week to week.</P>
        <P>I hope these measures will be successful because it is in the interests of the country that they are.  However, I am concerned about the method by which the finance is being raised.  This direct attack on private pension funds is akin to something the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe would try to do, expropriation of private property.  As I said on the last occasion, the number of people aged over 65 years in this country will treble in the next 50 years.  How are we to provide for them?  Traditionally, we have encouraged people to help provide for themselves through the provision of generous tax reliefs.  The cost of annuities has gone through the roof, returns have disimproved and there is a constant threat of withdrawal of tax relief hanging like the Sword of Damocles over people who invest in private pensions, on top of which the Minister has now imposed this levy.  Also, various legislative changes introduced by this and the previous <Col N="300"/>Government restrict the sums one can provide for.  The whole direction of the levy is towards creating a disincentive to people to provide for themselves, when there has never been a greater need for people to provide for themselves.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday, and the Minister for Finance has said on previous occasions, that representatives of the pensions industry made this offer to the Government.  They suggested to the Government that it impose a levy of, I think, 0.5% on the basis that tax relief for pension provision would not be interfered with.  I listened to the Taoiseach and that is clearly what he said.  Do I take it that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention, because it is bringing in this levy, not to interfere with the present tax regime for contributions to private pension schemes? I would like the Minister to address this in his response.  When these people from the pensions industry approached the Government, not only did the Minister take them at their word but he said he would do even better for them.  Instead of a levy of 0.5%, he made it 0.6%. He gave them more than they were looking for.  According to the Taoiseach, there was a clear understanding that this was a <i>quid pro quo </i>for not interfering with the tax relief on pension contributions.  I doubt if that will be the case.  Having read the IMF/EU deal and seen what the Government will have to do on the taxation front and having read the programme for Government which talks about tax shelters and so on I very much doubt if that will be the case.</P>
        <P>I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides.  I am sure he had visits from people in the pensions industry who made the suggestion to him.  If the people from the pensions industry, whoever they were, thought they were doing something for their members by approaching the Government with such a suggestion they are even more foolish than the returns they have managed to get for pensioners in recent years would suggest.  We need an incentive to people to provide for themselves, because the State will not be able to provide for them in future years.  We need an incentive and not another disincentive.</P>
        <P>With regard to defined benefit schemes, people who have retired and for whom an annuity has been purchased out of the pension fund will not be caught by the levy.  It is the people for whom the pension is provided directly from the fund who will be caught.  This is another anomaly.  A person under the age of 60 who can afford to retire early can transfer his or her pension to an approved retirement fund, which will not be caught at all.  That is another potential loophole.</P>
        <P>The Government says it is up to the trustees of defined benefit schemes to decide how to finance the levy and where they will find the money.  However, as much as 80% of defined benefit schemes are already in deficit and are in no position to absorb this charge.  This means either that contributions will increase for the people who are still paying them or employers will pay more.  There is an irony here.  If employers must pay more the cost of employment will increase.  This may lead to job losses, as a result of an initiative that is supposed to create jobs.</P>
        <P>The most likely outcome is that beneficiaries will have to pay directly.  Benefits will be cut.  We are talking about people who, because of the devastation wrought on pension funds by the downturn, in many instances have had indexation taken out their defined benefit pensions.  By agreement, trustees abandoned indexation.  Members of this House are beneficiaries of a defined benefit pension scheme, which is indexed.  I can imagine the reaction of Members if the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach announced the abolition of indexation and left us at the mercy of future inflation.  Many of these people are in precisely that situation.  Many of them are elderly, vulnerable and living on fixed incomes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It has been suggested that funding a pension of &euro;10,000, which is at the upper end of what people might expect, requires capital of &euro;150,000.  A levy of 0.6% of &euro;150,000 would amount to &euro;900, or a 9% reduction of a pension of &euro;10,000.  People in the pensions business tell me <Col N="301"/>that the figure needed to generate a pension of &euro;10,000 is closer to &euro;200,000.  That would put the levy up to a 12% reduction in the pension, every year for the next four years, of elderly people on fixed incomes.  That does not seem to be very fair.</P>
        <P>Most of the discussion of this issue has focused on defined benefit schemes.  The amount of capital accumulated in defined contribution schemes has been devastated by what happened in the markets in recent years.  They will be further devastated by the Government reaching its hand in and taking a portion of the capital retained over the next four years.  Many schemes will have to close down.  It is written into the legislation that if a scheme closes down its trustees will not be caught for the levy at all.</P>
        <P>I do not think the Government envisaged people being advised to shift their pension funds overseas.  Under EU rules they would be immune from the Government levy.  I am told certain gentlemen are in town at present going to different businesses extolling the attractions of Malta as a possible location.  Pension funds can be moved offshore, where they will be out of the ambit of the levy.  We may find that the levy will be applicable to people who cannot afford to move offshore and whose schemes do not provide for early retirement and do not close down.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made by the Minister for Finance and others regarding public sector pensions.  There has been a levy on them.  Public service pensioners have a reasonable expectation that there will be enough tax revenue to pay their pensions.  It is very different for private pension schemes.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s assurance regarding deposits.  Private pensions are another form of saving.  They are exactly equivalent to deposits.  The proposed levy is a retrospective tax on saved income.  There is, therefore, no reason in principle that cannot be extended to deposits.</P>
        <P>Those people from the pensions industry who went to the Government had no right to offer their members&rsquo; capital to the Government.  They merely administer pension schemes.  They do not own the money.  They had no right to offer it to the Government or anybody else.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>They offered it to the previous Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>They had no right to offer it to any Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>That is clearer.  I thank the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said pensions were built up as a result of generous tax relief.  That is true.  The State went to people and told them it needed them to provide for themselves because the State could not afford to do so.  For that reason, the State gave tax relief.  The offer was made and accepted in good faith.  The State cannot say, years later, that it offered too much and wants to take some of it back.  In any event, pension holders will pay tax when their pensions are paid out.</P>
        <P>Another Government argument is that much of the money is invested abroad, as though the investors are unpatriotic people who decided to invest outside Ireland.  The Government is well aware that the rules under which these people operate are set by the Government and can be changed by it.  I do not mind who I offend when I say we are very lucky they invested most of their funds abroad in recent years.  I can just imagine what the situation would be if they had not.</P>
        <P>I trawled the record to find a precedent for this type of imposition in the history of the State.  I found none.  The closest a Government came was the proposal by the minority Fianna F&aacute;il Government in 1988 to impose a levy on the capital gains of pension funds.  The levy was not on the capital but on the capital gains.  In 1988, substantial capital gains had been made by pension funds over the preceding two or three years.  The Opposition finance spokesperson at <Col N="302"/>the time was the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  That levy was designed to raise &pound;15 million in 1988 when times were better.  The current levy is designed to raise &euro;1.9 billion.  In 1988 Deputy Noonan said: &ldquo;I always understood that the rule in regard to the taxation of pension funds was that the funds were taxed on the way in or on the way out but not taxed during the term&rdquo;, which is precisely the point.  Deputy Noonan went on to say in regard to the proposed &pound;15 million imposition, which was intended to and did only last for one year:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am not sure whether all pension funds can bear this imposition ...  we need more information about this ...  it ... will bear very heavily on some pension funds.  I sincerely hope that it does not drive some of them into insolvency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While that is what Deputy Noonan said about a &pound;15 million levy in 1988, he has no concern now about a &euro;1.9 billion if not &euro;2 billion levy, although the &pound;15 million levy was actually on capital gains and not on capital itself.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are many other issues I would address but, unfortunately, time is against me.  In regard to the jobs initiative generally, which this Bill is bringing into law, I wish it well.  I hope it succeeds in its objectives and hope it is the beginning of a process of economic recovery in this country.  However, I could not help noticing as I read Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s speech from 1988 another quote referring to the 1988 budget brought in by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, where Deputy Noonan said: &ldquo;This is a budget of addition and subtraction when the nation is interested in multiplication and growth rates which would lead to jobs.&rdquo;  Scratch around as I might, I cannot think of a better epitaph for this budget, initiative or whatever one might wish to call it.  Nevertheless, I wish it well and I hope the objectives set out by the Government are achieved.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomBarry"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Barry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, which gives effect to the measures in the jobs initiative.  Four main areas are covered, namely, the research and development, or R&amp;D, tax credit, the suspension of the air travel tax, the introduction of the lower VAT rate and the introduction of a pension levy.  Similar to the position with corporation tax, which is very important for attracting foreign direct investment &mdash; we have recently heard all the arguments for retaining it while other countries try to make us increase it &mdash; the R&amp;D tax credit is also a measure of huge importance.  Some 25% of incremental expenditure on qualifying R&amp;D can be set against corporate tax liabilities.  The Bill enhances the flexibility for the accounting of R&amp;D tax credit by giving an &lsquo;&lsquo;above-the-line&rsquo;&rsquo; tax credit.  It makes three amendments to section 766B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which address the payroll liabilities, the relevant payroll period and the payable credits.  Basically, it facilitates a better operational status of this measure.</P>
        <P>The second area is the suspension of the air travel tax.  The Bill amends section 55 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 to reduce the air travel tax to zero and suspend it until the end of 2012, at which stage it will be reviewed.  This puts the onus back on the airlines, which are constantly complaining, to deliver.  This is positive because, as they say they can deliver, let us see whether they act accordingly.  Hopefully, this will help to boost tourism numbers, which have been dropping year on year.  From the implementation date, which is set at 1 July 2011, the measure is set to cost &euro;105 million to December 2012.  It will also hopefully provide a stimulus to revitalise the tourism industry, particularly literary and cultural tourism, where there is huge potential.  Unfortunately, not even this good Government can promise wonderful <Col N="303"/>sunshine or promote the country as a sunshine destination so we will have to look to other areas to encourage visitors to come.</P>
        <P>The third measure amends the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 to provide for a second reduced VAT rate of 9%, which will apply mainly to the tourism trade.  It will last until December 2013 and will cost up to &euro;820 million over the complete period.  This is a bold and decisive move by the Government to aggressively encourage tourists by enhancing our cost competitiveness and giving better value for money to all who come here.  Our nearest neighbour, the UK, will get even greater value given the sterling-euro exchange rate.  This will help to reverse the 32% decrease in tourist numbers from the UK from 2007 to 2010.  The amendment covers a number of areas, including restaurant and catering services, hotels and accommodation, admissions to cinemas, theatres, musical performances, art galleries, fairground amusements and sporting facilities, as well as hairdressing services and printed material.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that the reduction from a 13.5% to a 9% VAT rate will help to encourage and develop the arts by making theatre and musicals more affordable.  It will encourage new talented Irish people and others living here to follow their talents and their dreams because it will create a market and help to provide them with a livelihood, which is a positive spin-off, and it will also make our country more attractive in the process.  It will also help to fill the very high standard of accommodation which we have.  While many think in the main of accommodation in the cities, there is also accommodation in our rural communities, such as in the Blackwater Valley, where I live and where we rely on tourists to come for fishing and the relaxed way of life.  Many farming communities have built fabulous supplementary accommodation to bring tourists to Ireland.  The Bill will help in this area also.  On a lighter note, if all of these tourists cut their hair on their way home because they have had such good value for money, it will bring an added benefit.</P>
        <P>More seriously, I hope the Revenue Commissioners desist from harshly penalising minor infringements in regard to late payments of VAT by reputable companies.  I have had an issue with this practice for some time.  When people are owed VAT rebates by the Revenue Commissioners, they cannot get paid on time.  However, there are those with a good track record whose only fault is that they do not have a proper cash flow because others are strapped for cash also, and who, in the absence of a practical banking system, cannot pay on time, although they may pay within a month.  The Revenue Commissioners could certainly show some lenience in that regard.</P>
        <P>The fourth measure imposes a levy of 0.6% on the capital value of the assets under management in pension schemes.  The levy will last for four years and will hopefully raise &euro;470 million.  Difficult as it is to bear, and many are angry and critical about it, if this succeeds, it will hopefully benefit pension funds in the future.  It is worth recognising that this measure is being taken to tackle the enormous black hole we have inherited from the previous Government.  I cannot but smile wryly when I hear Deputy O&rsquo;Dea speaking of loopholes in the Bill.  He has become terribly clinical.  Where were all the soothsayers and people who could see into the future in the last Government?  The real loophole here is a financial recklessness into which the previous Government entered.  It did not envisage that it would absolutely ruin the country.  When I hear the Deputy using quotes from 1998, I shall quote him back straightaway.  He mentioned people in business to whom he spoke.  I hate that the Deputy has left the Chamber but he can watch the debate on video link.  I run a business and we need to instil confidence back into the country.  We are picking up the pieces from a Government that fell asleep at the wheel.</P>
        <P>I heard a former Minister state it was lucky that pension funds were invested outside this country.  What does that mean?  Does it mean that when the former Government was in power, <Col N="304"/>breaking the country financially, it encouraged people to leave, knowing the place would be a basket case?  I am upset that people can wreck a country, stand up some months later and act as if they were Robin Hood, able to fix everything in a short while.  It is extremely hard to rebuild after the devastation they caused.  At present I am working to try to bring back a sugar industry to the country.  There are talks and troubles and we are attempting to have a feasibility study.  However, the amount of work involved in returning industry to this country after the destruction of our indigenous industries is considerable.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill, therefore, even though parts of it are unpalatable.  We must go through with it and my generation in business will pay for it.  I will not emigrate; we are the people who are stuck.  We are glad to stay here and want to see our country return to a position of solvency.  However, I will not tolerate the people who broke this country criticising the efforts we make to restore it to its former glory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The ultimate job of this Government is to put in place measures that will allow this State to regain its full sovereignty and rebuild its solvency.  Any such measures must be evaluated in light of these two overriding objectives.  Within that framework there are many measures and plans proposed in this Bill which are welcome.  The philosophy underpinning the Bill is that the green economy and the smart economy will form a large part of our future economic renewal, but this Government must also look after the cash economy of today in order to allow us get to that point.  It recognises that the many different sectors of employment and growth which constitute the cash economy will play a significant and valuable role in our future by providing jobs for those who lack them and by preserving the jobs we have.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Within that theme there are five areas I wish to touch upon in my contribution.  They are mentioned in this Bill and the debate surrounding it and I believe it is worthwhile to note them in the House.  First, I refer to the employment survey figures published today by Forf&aacute;s, covering all companies that were provided with State aid or supervision in the past year.  Many of these companies tend to be so successful in providing a balance of payments surplus that an enormous difference shows up between Ireland and other European countries involved in managing a debt crisis.  These figures reveal a point very pertinent to this discussion in the House.  They show that within that sector of our economy, slightly more than 275,000 people are employed.  However, the actual numbers employed in the sector have declined by 6,521 since last year, in spite of its superb economic output in that period.  This points to the real challenge we face in securing the jobs we have.  In those sectors of the economy that are so very successful in producing wealth and driving export performance the numbers of people employed are actually declining because of the sector&rsquo;s productivity and the nature of the industry.  Between one and seven and one in eight jobs within our economy are found in this large sector which is massively important to our economy.  However, in spite of this recent great success the numbers employed in the industry are in decline.</P>
        <P>That points to the strategic necessity of a Bill such as this which looks at other jobs and other sectors that are important to our economy and asks what can we do to give them a prompt and add some confidence.  What this Bill proposes, therefore, is the abolition of one tax, the reduction by half of another and the reduction of a third tax to be funded by measures taken elsewhere.  The measures are all designed to provide support and confidence to other parts of our economy that will be vital in our continued renewal.</P>
        <P>Second, I refer to measures that were announced in the jobs initiative which are not, by their nature, included in the Finance Bill, namely, proposed measures to improve visa access to this country.  This is a most important area for us to focus in coming months.  Last week, I organised a forum in Leinster House that focused on the digital part of economy, in particular companies <Col N="305"/>involved in digital gaming.  Many colleagues were good enough to come along for an hour to hear about the good work in question.  Yesterday, I visited one of the companies concerned, Havok, which was acquired recently by Intel because of its enormous success in designing software that allows three-dimensional graphics to be portrayed on screen.  Company personnel spoke to me about the considerable challenge they face when they identify foreign talent, people who design games, physicists and engineers, the very epitome of the smart economy, and induce them to move to our State.  Getting them into this country and locating them here is proving a real challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The personnel pointed to a scheme which currently operates in Denmark.  Danish candidates who work in the smart economy but who have not worked or paid tax in Denmark in recent years can return to that country and be given a personal tax holiday for five years.  That tax holiday to encourage them to return is tied into the ability of such people to create local jobs.  Why can we not look at a scheme of that kind?  If we can attract people into our State, regardless of nationality, and tie their employment here into indigenous job creation, we should be able to make instant their ability to acquire a visa.  One of the factors that played a significant role in the creation of the Silicon Valley success story, of which we hear so much, is that in the early 1980s nobody cared who was responsible for creating the success.  If a person had a good idea, it did not matter where they came from.  The authorities made it very easy for them to get into the state of California, set up a business and be active.</P>
        <P>I believe that we will move quickly to a situation whereby, notwithstanding our banking difficulties and the pressure created in the supply of credit, there will be people coming into this State who will want to supply capital to people who are successful and have good ideas.  We should encourage people, regardless of their nationality, who want to set up business in Ireland to create jobs here.  I heard at first hand personnel from the company, Havok, talk about the great difficulties they experience in doing just that.  There is a low-cost opportunity here for our State.  Measures could be sorted out quickly in order to make it easy to funnel direct job creation into the smart economy.</P>
        <P>My third point was touched upon by Deputy Stephen Donnelly in his contribution on the jobs initiative a number of weeks ago.  I agree with him on one important point.  We must ensure that whatever measures we put in place to reduce the tax burden on employers will contribute either to an improvement in competitiveness within the sectors concerned or to an improvement in direct job creation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It would be a pity if in 12 months when we sit back to evaluate the success of this initiative &mdash; I will make a point on that &mdash; what we see amounts only to marginal improvements in these sectors but there is no sign that it is yielding direct job improvements or improvements in the competitiveness of those sectors.  Too often in our country we come up with an initiative and put it out but we never take the time to step back 12 or 18 months afterwards to determine how it has actually worked.  We must be brave, stand up and indicate what has and has not worked and what we should do the next time.  The evaluation of initiatives, especially this one, must be carried out a good deal more.  By the time we get to the next budget we should be able to stand up and state what has and has not worked with regard to all the measures proposed in the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  In the case of those elements which have not worked within the scarce resources available, we should acknowledge as much and redeploy them elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I conclude with reference to the European situation on which many colleagues have commented in this debate and earlier today in the House.  It is of inordinate importance that whatever decisions are to be made in the next 12 to 18 months in terms of our engagement with private credit markets and so on, such decisions should not be made at the last moment. <Col N="306"/> We can see a significant element of what is unfolding in Greece.  It has a large amount of debt that must be renewed shortly; I believe it is next month.  Whatever the difficulty facing Greece, which is vast, it is being compounded by the fact that it is running out of time to make any decisions and all the agencies involved are quickly finding themselves in a corner.  Whatever decision we make and whether the scenarios are run out in private or in public, we should be doing the work for it now.</P>

	<P>We should think through the matter now and not wait until 12 months time.  As has been found with Greece, our ability to navigate our way forward is significantly impaired, notwithstanding the banking difficulties, by a significant fiscal deficit that must be serviced now.  Whatever the measures taken by the Government to reduce the scale of the deficit, they must be taken quickly.  Such is magnitude of the deficit.  I read today that the Greek deficit is between 9.7% and 10%.  There is little difference between that deficit and our own at the moment.  All steps that can be taken to reduce it in a sustainable manner would appear to be in the national interest and should be done within this year.</P>

	<P>T&aacute; an Bille seo an-t&aacute;bhachtach ar fad, ach n&iacute; th&eacute;ann s&eacute; r&oacute;-fhada.  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann s&eacute; fada go leor ar chor ar bith.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in m&iacute;sh&aacute;sta leis.  Essentially, we are debating the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party&rsquo;s so-called jobs initiative once again.  It amazes me that there should be any need another debate on what is almost wholly a pointless piece of window dressing, which is more about paying lip service to stimulus than about contributing to any initiative which will bring sustainable long-term growth or even a short-term boost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has called this budget cost neutral.  Unfortunately, once again we in Sinn F&eacute;in are correct when we say it will also be jobs neutral.  Fine Gael has been obsessed with public sector reform for the past four years at least.  The party&rsquo;s language translates into a three pronged approach of slash, burn and privatise.  It has supported the deflationary measures of the previous Government and has built on them since it came into power.  It has missed a golden opportunity to take the initiative, to act in the public interest and to deal with the problems facing ordinary Irish people.  However, what is worse, those in Fine Gael do not know it and their Government partners, who should know better, are going along with it.  Never mind the imperative that it is Gilmore&rsquo;s way or Frankfurt&rsquo;s way, it is now clear that it is Noonan&rsquo;s way or no way.</P>
        <P>This is not surprising from Fine Gael.  However for the vast numbers of people who voted for the party, who worked hard during the past decade and are now struggling or out of work, including young people facing emigration, it will be not only devastating having put their trust in this Government, but it prolongs their struggles and will force more to work in far flung places away from their families and the country in which they wish to make their lives.</P>
        <P>The extent to which this is window dressing is obvious when one considers the numbers.  A capital spend of &euro;135 million is touted but, in reality, this is not new money for extra work; it is simply a reorganisation of spending with an extra &euro;29 million for these projects.  We have spent more than the entire capital expenditure plan on metro north.  Roughly &euro;150 million has been spent already according to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and now there is a danger the Minister will decide not to go ahead with the plans.</P>
        <P>Since this plan is budget neutral, money is being taken from somewhere else and, for the most part, from the pockets of hardworking individuals who have been hit and hit again by this and the previous Government to the clear detriment of the wider economy.  This time it is <Col N="307"/>in the shape of a deeply inequitable pension levy, which, according to Government officials, will see pensions rise in cost by 50% in some cases and, it has been claimed by the private pension sector, which will be a fatal blow to its trade.</P>
        <P>Just as the previous Government distracted people by rearranging deckchairs on our very own <i>Titanic</i>, the Government rearranges the numbers to make it appear that it has the remotest commitment to creating jobs.  Not only were the road works, pedestrian routes and cycle lanes for which money has been earmarked in this initiative essential, but they were already planned.  There is no consideration of a large scale capital project which could create employment in the medium term and have significant return on spend.  We may only hope more courage and initiative is taken by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in future when he finally makes his decision between BXD, metro north and DART underground.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whatever about these projects, we cannot afford to stand by idly while unemployment remains so high.  It would be higher than the current scandalous figure of 450,000 had we not said goodbye to so many brothers, sisters, sons, daughters and friends as once again we are faced with a generation subject to emigration.  This would be bad enough were it not for the fact that all of these measures give the lie to so many of the promises of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the election campaign and before.  In 2009, we heard the disgraceful nonsense cry of &ldquo;jobs, jobs, jobs&rdquo;, a promise for capitulating on the second Lisbon treaty vote.  Then, the cry of &ldquo;jobs&rdquo; was one of Fine Gael&rsquo;s much discussed but much less acted on five point plan.  However, this was not simply vague talk.  Both Government partners laid down clear detailed promises to make a real go of a jobs creation plan.  Deputy Enda Kenny had the neck to state that in a four year period he would spend &euro;7 billion on job creation, creating 100,000 jobs and 45,000 training places.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Eamon Gilmore stated that the Labour Party would spend &euro;500 million on jobs and would set up a strategic investment bank with &euro;3 billion.  This initiative, if one could use the term, does nothing close to that objective.  It is smoke and mirrors and the Minister for Finance Deputy Michael Noonan has proven himself to be more Tommy Cooper than David Copperfield.</P>
        <P>If anything is to be taken from the plan, it is the reduction of the airline tax and the new lower rate of VAT.  The reduction to 9% is positive and, hopefully, will help struggling restaurants and similar businesses which cater to tourists.  However, many more supports could have been given to the hospitality industry but they are lacking.  The tiny impact of a &euro;3 euro reduction in the price of an airline ticket is highly unlikely to inspire many people from around the world who are also being hit by similar poorly thought out measures to wing their way here to spend their hard-earned cash, much less the throngs we require.  Surely if we are to build on our tourism industry we need good transport infrastructure which has been neglected, surely we need to link Dublin Airport to our city centre in the most effective way possible while creating jobs along the way.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in before, during and after the election has put forward real meaningful ideas for job stimulus that can help to get our economy moving again but these have been roundly ignored or derided by the consensus for deflation and cuts represented by the other major parties in this Chamber.  Sinn F&eacute;in would invest &euro;2 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund into creating and holding on to jobs in the next year.  This would see a large specific job creation investment as well as a &euro;1 billion spend on infrastructure on top of existing commitments, ensuring that the essential capital projects are seen through with the best value for money and the best return of jobs.  All this would be done with a focus on the young unemployed to see that our best and brightest are not forced to emigrate.</P>
        <P>We can do this not by cutting the wages of the 20% of people who only have &euro;70 euro left at the end of the month but by targeting the highest earners in the public sector, Deputy and <Col N="308"/>ministerial wages and those with net assets over &euro;1 million excluding farmland.  This is the fairer, more equitable way we can start to get on a road to recovery.  It is the kind of change the Government parties were elected to do and have so far failed in both word and deed.</P>
        <P>This must, however, be done.  We must invest properly in our economy or it will continue to fail, we will say goodbye to many more friends and family and dole queues will swell.  We have a choice and it is time to be brave and do what is required of us.  This Government has given &euro;24 billion to the banks and specifically &euro;3 billion to Anglo Irish Bank, it has continued the path of raiding the National Pensions Reserve Fund to pay for a bailout which is not acceptable and will only saddle us with a debt we cannot pay and yet it has shown so little consideration for the need to get people working again and spending again.  Where are its priorities?</P>
        <P>We said it first and we say it again, jobs are the priority; the people of this country who are struggling and who are languishing in unemployment are the priority, not the bankers, not the IMF and not the ECB.  Until the Government wakes up to that we will continue down this road and we will reap the whirlwind or it shall be inherited by our children.</P>

I compliment the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs on her work representing Ireland abroad in the past few weeks.  It is good to see someone who, along with the Minister for Finance, has the ability to represent our country abroad.</P>
        <P>Listening to Deputy Ellis, I had to ask if I was listening to Paul Daniels or Tommy Cooper because it was like taking something from here and something from there and mixing it up.  In reality, this is a jobs initiative, it is a plan, a vision to get Ireland back to work.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not perfect but the Deputy misses the point completely, a bit like Sinn F&eacute;in during the royal visit last week.  It has missed the mood and is opposing for the sake of it.</P>
        <P>This initiative requires bravery from the Government, something it has displayed.  We have not abandoned the principles of responsibility or the interests of the Irish people.  How can someone criticise a Government that introduces a research and development tax credit, suspends the air travel tax, changes the VAT and employers&rsquo; PRSI rates, restores the minimum wage and introduces a pension levy?</P>
        <P>We must pay to create jobs; there are no easy solutions.  The economists, the experts, the commentators and the Opposition all agree there is no pot of gold, no magic wand to wave or silver bullet.  That is why the duty of Government is to be responsible and to act on behalf of all of our citizens.  In just ten weeks, this Government has been strategic and displayed vision.  It is acting.  We might not agree with everything, we might want to see more money spent but if we compare the first ten weeks of this Government with the last ten years of the previous Administration, there is a stark difference.  That is why it is important to look to the future and to this Bill to offer a new opportunity.</P>
        <P>I tweeted when the Bill was introduced that it was not ideal but that it was a new beginning, a significant step that would instil confidence in employers and give hope to those seeking employment, while providing leadership and showing those in the outside world that we are once again in control of our finances, albeit with the help of the IMF and the EU.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P Just="Left">If Deputy Ellis wants to be critical of the Bill, fair enough, but let us look at what is in it for schools, roads and retrofitting schemes.  Is it wrong to help small and medium-sized enterprises and to offer hope to people?  Is it wrong to tell schools we will expand the building programme and look at new public private partnerships?  All of us have received letters and e-mails from parent associations, boards of management and school principals about conditions in schools.  Measures to address those conditions are contained in this Bill.</P>
        <P>There is an extra &euro;60 million for investment in local roads.  Will those opposite vote against that?  I hope not.  This is about investment in infrastructure, a gateway to creating jobs.  Are we telling people in Cork the N28 cannot be upgraded, or that the main road from here to Wicklow cannot be improved because we do not have the money?  The Government is going to invest an extra &euro;60 million in roads and while that is not ideal, if we take the Bandon Road and Sarsfield Road flyovers in Cork, those are included in this to provide relief and improve a road network that shows a confident, mature nation ready to embrace employers and entrepreneurs and to open our markets.</P>
        <P>That is why it is important to look at this Bill holistically.  The Taoiseach was right this morning that our country needed help.  We did not go voluntarily to the IMF and ECB.  Those in Government 12 months ago were in denial about that but we had to go there, we had no choice, we could not go to the open markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must never forget the narrative of why we are here. It was as a result of poor management by the previous Government, bad economic decisions and a lack of political accountability.  There was a breakdown in regulation and a cosy cartel that ran this country for a decade was allowed to develop.  Those who were in Government lost the run of themselves and their cronies were part of the inner circle, ensuring no one cried &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.  It is important that narrative is never forgotten by anyone.  We have a duty to remind the people and, more importantly, the Fianna F&aacute;il Members of this House, why we are in this situation.  Our people are living in places such as Toronto or Boston or Brisbane and there are those who are still at home seeking work.  As Deputy Mathews said, there are those at home who cannot afford to go away due to their debts or family situation.  The story is that of a people under pressure, of people struggling.  I refer to the euphoria of last Monday and the past week with the visits of President Obama and the Queen.  The visits lifted the Irish people.  I noted as I walked from College Green among hundreds of ordinary citizens the sense of hope and of a new beginning, a sense that together we can get out of this morass.  It will not be easy and the job of government is to lead, to be responsible and to tell the Irish people the truth.  A Government can never be allowed to abandon its people as happened during the past ten years.  The previous Government ignored its responsibility, a responsibility that goes with accepting the seal of office entrusted to it under the Constitution by the President of Ireland.  This is what the previous Government did; it abandoned the people and ignored the sacred trust.  Its members did not live up to their seals of office and the responsibility attached.  Likewise, people in banks and in financial regulation have serious questions to answer.  There must be accountability and this must happen under this Government&rsquo;s watch.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mathews in his contribution spoke about a monstrous debt and he is right.  People have a monstrous debt and our country has a gargantuan debt.  However, the ordinary citizen has to deal with high unemployment, emigration, negative equity and which are the legacies of ten years of boom and bloom.  This Government has presented the Finance (No. 2) Bill which offers solutions and a plan.  This is not a plan for the big shots or for the rich and powerful but for those who are courageous in creating employment and for those on the lower minimum wage.  This Government is saying to them that it understands and is listening.  I become nauseated when I hear people in certain parts of this House say they are concerned about those who are unemployed or in negative equity.  I said it before in this House and I say it again, <Col N="310"/>everyone on the Government side of the House knows of family members, friends and constituents who are in negative equity, who are unemployed and who are under pressure.  They ask us to provide a solution and to give them an opportunity to go back to work.  They want to be able to remain in their family home and they ask for a chance to start a business or to buy their own home.  This is why it is important that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has taken on the banks and has created a new banking force.  Our banks must listen and they must be cognisant of the ordinary person.  Equally, the Revenue Commissioners must stand up and listen and must be aware of the plight of business people and of the ordinary citizen.</P>
        <P>It is unfortunate that a two-tier Ireland seems to be developing, private versus public, with an upper, middle and lower class.  I regret this because the people I choose to represent and the people who put me in here are not the high flyers nor the socialites who were drinking in the Galway tent, who owned three or four houses and two or three big cars.  They were the people who bought property &mdash; one property &mdash; at the height of the boom, who had a job and who were earning &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 a year, whose spouses also had to go out to work.  They were paying for child care.  These are the people who are in negative equity today and who are struggling.  I use &ldquo;struggling&rdquo; deliberately because that is the plight of many citizens today.  The job of government is to create a new State, a new opportunity and a new vision.</P>
        <P>The Government, the IMF, the ECB, the banks and Revenue must listen to the distress of the ordinary person, the man and woman whom we all know.  I do not mean the developers, the people sitting on the boards of banks, the economic commentators who knew everything, nor the political commentators.  They must listen to people.  This Government must create hope.</P>
        <P>I have met many people over the past 12 to 18 months who are distressed.  I met a man two weeks ago when he came to my office.  He was afraid to go home.  He was afraid to tell his partner that he owed money to the banks and to Revenue.  He was employing five or six people and he could not go home and tell all this to his partner.  This is not acceptable and it is not the Ireland I want to live in.</P>
        <P>The Government has an obligation to protect the family home and it must encourage people to enter into a covenant and agreement with the banks or lending institutions.  I agree with Deputy Mathews that the people who lend us money must understand the story of the Irish people.  As the Taoiseach said this morning, we will pay our debt but I contend this cannot be at the expense of our people.  I agree that we live in the European Union which is a community of sovereign nations.  My understanding of being part of the European Union is that we are here to support one another and to live and to work for a common goal.  Those who are assisting us should listen to the cry of the Irish people.  The Taoiseach is correct in that we will honour our debts, we will repay them, but it behoves those in control of the IMF and the European Union to listen, to come out of their ivory towers and to interact with the ordinary citizens of this country to see how they are getting on.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Government have within the first 100 days brought forward a jobs initiative.  Deputy Dessie Ellis is correct that the biggest task facing us is the creation of jobs and the retention of existing jobs.  We must reward entrepreneurs and risk-takers who employ people.  Equally, contained in the jobs initiative is an acceptance that those who want to work should be allowed to work.  It is much better to have people working than on welfare.  Is it right to keep the minimum wage at the level introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il?  Should we allow people to go on welfare?  It is much better to have people in work and to place a value on work so they can make a contribution to society and can be proud, active citizens.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest>      if he will allow rough grazing to be taken into account when estimating the single farm payment and discontinue the policy that only allows arable land to be included.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[12962/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can confirm that rough grazing is eligible for the single farm payment scheme and other area-based schemes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme and the grassland sheep scheme.  The terms and conditions of the single payment scheme advise applicants, <i>inter alia</i>, that if they are to draw down full payments in respect of their single payment scheme entitlements, an eligible hectare must be declared in respect of each entitlement.  In this context, an eligible area is land that is used for an agricultural activity and includes land used to grow cereals, oilseeds, short rotation coppice, miscanthus, protein crops, sugar beet, maize, fodder beet, turnips, kale and grass for silage, hay or grazing.  Eligible land is all land that is subject to agricultural activity by an applicant.  It may be used for arable crops, hay, silage or grazing by farm animals, for example, or the applicant may choose to top it on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>Land that was declared on a 2008 single payment scheme application, gave rise to a payment and was subsequently afforested can be eligible in certain circumstances.  If an applicant is not producing crops or animals from the land, he or she can choose to top it in order to maintain it in good agricultural and environmental condition, as required under the scheme.  In the case of hill or mountain land or marginal land, or other rough grazing which cannot be mechanically topped, if the applicant wishes to claim the land under the area-based schemes, the only way to maintain it in good agricultural and environmental condition is to graze it with sufficient cattle or sheep.  If scattered scrub is present in a land parcel, farmers are required to make a percentage reduction in the claimed area to allow for the ineligible area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Last year and again this year, farmers have been making amendments to their area-based applications.  The Department seems to be instructing them to remove areas of scrub or rough grazing from their applications.  As a result, people are losing their eligibility to entitlements in respect of lands on hills and in glens that are subject to normal farm practices.  On the other hand, some land owners are burning scrub or gorse from their lands to ensure they are eligible.  Such practices cannot be condoned in any way.  The Department and the Government have to make sure such practices are not encouraged in any way.  The Department&rsquo;s interpretation of rough grazing refers to land that can be accessed by cattle other than during a short period of the summer months.  The Minister spoke about land that cannot be mechanically topped.  Such lands should be taken into account.  I ask the Minister to get his officials to re-examine the Department&rsquo;s interpretation, which is too strict, and to consider relaxing the regulations that apply to rough grazing land that can be accessed by stock in certain circumstances.  The Minister should ensure the burning of such lands is not encouraged in any way by the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will look into the issue.  I am quite familiar with the single farm payment scheme because we make an application in respect of our farm every year.  I am also familiar with the types of land that are and are not eligible under the scheme.  We have a great deal of clifftop land that is not eligible, for obvious reasons.  If land is to be eligible, it has to be farmable land.  It has to have the capacity to carry stock for grazing or rough grazing purposes, or to carry crops.  If agricultural activity like grazing is not taking place on the land, the farmer is required to maintain the land in a reasonable condition.  Topping may be required in such circumstances.  If unwelcome growth is compromising the agricultural potential of the land, the farmer is required to deal with it.  I will raise the issue with my officials.  I was a little unsure about the point of the Deputy&rsquo;s original question.  That is why my response was quite technical.  If Deputy Moynihan wants to talk to me about the matter, I am available for such a discussion.  If he thinks specific cases are being treated unfairly, we will examine them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest>      the arrangements put in place for students to complete a full skippers ticket in his Department&rsquo;s training school following the retirement and non replacement of the second teacher in Castletownbere, County Cork.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[13032/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara is the leading provider of vocational training to the seafood industry.  By providing accredited training services to fishing, aquaculture and processing personnel, it underpins this indigenous industry and adds to its skill set.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara&rsquo;s seafood industry training programmes are delivered through its training centres at the National Fisheries College in Greencastle, the regional fisheries centre in Castletownbere, its three mobile coastal training units and its seafood development centre in Clonakilty.  The National Fisheries College and the regional fisheries centre are equipped to deliver a broad range of courses that are accredited by the Department of Transport and the Further Education and Training Awards Council.</P>
        <P>Deputy Colreavy probably knows all of that, so I will answer his question.  I do not want to talk my way out of answering it, which is something may previous Ministers were perceived to do.  The employment contract of a master mariner instructor in the regional fisheries centre in Castletownbere concluded in August 2008.  As a result, the skipper full certificate of competency course could not be offered in Castletownbere and aspiring candidates were redirected to Bord Iascaigh Mhara&rsquo;s National Fisheries College in Greencastle, County Donegal.  Following the retirement of a master mariner in Greencastle last December, Bord Iascaigh Mhara had to cancel the skipper full certificate course there.  That was alluded to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  My Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara have commenced discussions on addressing the personnel needs of the delivery of the skipper full certificate course, in the context of the board&rsquo;s employment control framework targets.</P>
        <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara has not been able to fill positions that became vacant when people retired, essentially, as a result of the recruitment ban.  It is crazy that the board does not have the skill set to provide the full skipper course about which Deputy Colreavy asked.  Over the past 18 months or so, there has been a significant increase in interest in the fisheries sector.  For the first time in many years, young people want to enter the fishing industry, for example, by becoming skippers and deck hands.  Many courses are still on offer and are being availed of.  The training course that leads to the highest qualification for the skippers of fishing vessels in Ireland is not being provided at the moment.  We need to resolve that issue with Bord <Col N="313"/>Iascaigh Mhara.  I am trying to do that at the moment.  It will require sanction from the Department of Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night, the Minister indicated the fisheries and fish processing business has a potential value of &euro;1 billion.  While I agreed wholeheartedly with the vision for agri-food and fisheries he set out, I cautioned that the policies, practices and choices that are made are often contrary to his vision and do not bring us closer to achieving its objectives.  What we have here is an example of that phenomenon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy ask a question please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>What plans are in place to implement the report that was done regarding business plans for the development of fishery harbours centres nationally?  Have any students been unable to finish their full skippers ticket by virtue of the resignation of the teacher in question?  Do the Departments not engage in forward planning?  Surely someone knew that this essential cog in the wheel was about to retire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify the issue, two individuals retired rather than resigned.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara has advised that in the interim and as a matter of urgency it is seeking instructors on a service supply basis through the Government&rsquo;s e-tender website.  The short-term solution it seeks is to bring in someone from the private sector to provide the services required to train skippers for the fishing industry.  It is unlikely, however, that this will provide a long-term solution for people in Castletownbere, Killybegs, Greencastle, Dingle or on the east coast.  The reason this case arose and other, similar cases are arising in many other Departments is that the recruitment ban prevents departmental staff from being replaced on retirement.  A problem often arises when someone with a specific skill set who can normally be replaced by someone else in the Department retires from a Department.  In this case, however, the skill set required of a master mariner to teach the course in question meant that no one within Bord Iascaigh Mhara was available to replace the individual in question.  As a result, we must resort to the use of e-tenders to have the persons in question replaced in the short-term.  I accept, however, that a long-term solution is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask a brief supplementary question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Speakers should keep questions and replies short.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelColreavy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Colreavy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does this case not beg the question as to why provision is not made to allow persons with an essential qualification be replaced, especially if failure to replace the person will damage the vision the Minister outlined so well last night?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the Deputy.  However, such provision is being made in some cases.  For example, the Department recently secured sanction to increase the number of teachers in agricultural colleges to respond to the problem arising from increased student numbers.  While the case before us should not have arisen, Ireland does not have many master mariners, specifically those who could fill the post in question or would like to join the public sector.  The position requires a specific skill set and only a relatively small number of people want to do the skippers course.  While we are resolving the problem in the short term, I accept the need for a longer term solution.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest>      when 2010 agri environment options scheme payments will be made; and when will he get agreement on <Col N="314"/>the proposal made to EU Commission last year to increase the natura agri environment options scheme payment from &euro;75 per hectare to &euro;150 per hectare.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[12826/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a long reply.  I will read out the final paragraphs as it will be of interest to Deputy Fleming. </P>
        <P>When the agri-environment options scheme was launched last year the intention was to increase the rate for designated land from &euro;75 per hectare, as originally announced, to &euro;150 per hectare.  My Department has been in discussion with the Commission with a view to obtaining approval for this proposal.  However, given the current financial constraints and the overall funding limits which have been introduced in the national recovery plan and to ensure that as many applicants as possible can be accepted into the scheme, I have decided that the rate for designated land will be &euro;75 per hectare.</P>
        <P>At that time, a second request was made to allow farmers in agri-environment options schemes to increase the amount of nitrogen they may put on meadow grass.  This request was put to me again at a meeting with representatives of the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association this morning.  We will examine the issue and I hope to be able to give a more welcome and satisfactory answer on the issue of nitrogen and meadow grass.  We will not be in a position to accommodate concerns on increasing the payment under the agri-environment options scheme from &euro;75 to &euro;150 per hectare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>While I understand the Minister is constrained by the national finances and, in particular, the terms of the IMF-EU agreement, his response is most disappointing in light of the widespread optimism that payments under the agri-environment options scheme would increase from &euro;75 to &euro;150 per hectare.  Participants in the scheme are the custodians of the land.  Their family farms are, by and large, located in disadvantaged areas.  It is great that such farms are still viable and making a contribution to society and rural communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision given that participation in the scheme will cost money for farmers in special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  His decision will act as a major disincentive to participation in future schemes.  If we are to incentivise young people in rural areas to remain on the land to make their living, it must be reconsidered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>While I concur that the decision is disappointing, I had to make choices on the agri-environment options scheme because it was launched without financial provision being made for it in the budget.  We had to create a budget for the scheme and faced a choice in this regard.  We could increase the payment for the designated areas from &euro;75 to &euro;100 per hectare which would have cost approximately &euro;4 million per annum and required us to reduce the number of successful applicants for the agri-environment options scheme.  However, only so much money is available.  This year, &euro;25 million has been made available in each of the next five years to fund 2011 applications to join the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is correct that it is difficult to incentivise farmers to continue to keep sheep and cattle on marginal land and they must be supported.  For this reason, such farmers are first in line to join the agri-environment options scheme this time around.</P>
        <P>Many people have suggested that the number of applications for the agri-environment options scheme is low.  To clarify the matter, approximately 7,000 applications have been made under the scheme.  At least 6,000 applications have been received to date and it is estimated <Col N="315"/>that once applications are received from various offices, the total number of applications for the new scheme will be approximately 7,000.  I want to ensure all applications are accepted.  If I were to increase the payment for the relevant designated area from &euro;75 to &euro;150 per hectare, the decision would have implications for other small farmers in need of support who cannot join the scheme despite being located in Natura areas and special areas of conservation.  The problem I have is that I must make choices in the context of an expenditure ceiling in my Department.  That is the reason for my decision.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest>      the steps he has taken, in conjunction with his European colleagues, to activate an EU wide milk quota system instead of a national quota.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[12963/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This issue was debated in some detail last night and is one on which I agree with the Deputy.  We need to find a way to allow the dairy industry to expand before 2015 when the European Union wide quota system ends.  We have many young and not so young farmers in many counties who have the capacity to significantly increase milk output.  They are doing so already at levels dangerously above their quota allocations in the expectation that they will get away with it this year because they got away with it last year.  While we need to encourage expansion and growth, unfortunately under the rules of the milk check agreement, Ireland is only being given an additional 1% milk quota each year until 2015.  That is nowhere near being sufficient to allow us to expand in the way we would like to over the next five years.  So the Food Harvest 2020 target of a 50% increase in milk production by 2020 will, at the moment, require a massive expansion in the five years from 2015 to 2020 due to the restrictions before 2015.  We are trying to find a political solution to that problem because many EU countries are under quota.  We would like to see what the Deputy has called for, which is an EU-wide quota, so that when some countries are under quota others that wish to be over quota would be given the flexibility.  That is not a runner politically at the moment, however, in the European Commission or in Germany and France.  I am in the process of trying to put together a coalition of countries in order to find some kind of political resolution to this matter.</P>
        <P>In the past year, both Denmark and the Netherlands have had significant super-levy fines applied to them for being over quota.  We were less than 1% under quota and only just made it.  There are four or five EU countries that want to expand their dairy industries and which need the flexibility to do so, but it will be a significant political challenge in order to be successful.  All farmers that are planning milk production above the quota allocated to them should be careful before choosing to do so because we are in danger of being over quota this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response.  Excess figures provided by various milk processors range from a low of 17% to a high of 25% year-on-year from April 2010 to April 2011.  There is a major effort at every level cautioning people to avoid going over the quota.  On 31 March this year, we were a little bit under quota because milk supplies were held back and managed at farm-gate level.  The Minister referred to other EU countries that have had super-levy fines, and said he is building a coalition of other member states.  Where is the pressure coming from within the EU and what countries, if any, are holding out against an agreement such as this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a good question.  I understand that France and Germany do not even want to entertain a discussion on this issue because the milk health check was agreed after a lot of difficult debate, particularly with France and Germany.  Many people in both those countries would rather not see an end to the milk quota system.  They see restricting milk <Col N="316"/>output as a way of securing price consistency in future.  Therefore the very idea that we would allow countries like Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands to expand milk production dramatically in the short term is perceived as a risk to milk price stability between now and 2015.  Whereas they have conceded that after 2015, when there is a long lead-in time to prepare for that, milk quotas will end, they are certainly in no mood to concede that there should be significant increases in milk production between now and then.</P>
        <P>The counter argument is that milk production is falling in certain countries.  In my view, overall milk production across the EU would not increase if Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands were to increase production dramatically.  That is because countries like Slovenia are 17% below quota.  Our closest neighbour, Britain, is well below quota and it is not an issue there because production is nowhere near the quota.  European thinking is needed here.</P>
        <P>Many of the new markets for Irish dairy products are actually outside the EU.  One of the reasons I will have to leave the Chamber early this evening is that I am meeting the Chinese Minister for agriculture.  He is visiting Ireland this week to look at our production and traceability systems, as well as our quality food production.  There are also exciting markets for infant formula, for example.  Ireland sells 16% of the world&rsquo;s total infant formula exports and we want to fill the enormous and expanding market in China.  The irony is that the expansion of the Irish dairy industry may not affect European markets at all.  It is up to me to make persuasive arguments to open up a reasonable discussion on this issue.  I am trying to do so and, to that end, there is an informal Council meeting in Hungary next week where we will start the process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If, as the Minister said, France and Germany are opposing quota increases and trying to maintain farm-gate prices, is it not better to have an orderly expansion of the European-wide dairy industry, rather than when the quotas go post-2015?  Is there a political point to be made that it is bowing to the inevitable at European level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>That point needs to be made and I will do so.  We need to make, and are making, reasonable arguments on interest rates relating to stability funds but unfortunately these things take time.  Sometimes we are dealing with stubborn viewpoints in other European countries.</P>

        <Quest>   the measures he will introduce to protect farmers from the destructive effect on Irish agriculture of the major supermarket multiples and the low prices they are paying to farmers in view of the fact that in 1996 producers were receiving 37% of the retail price and this has reduced to 19% in 2011.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad of the opportunity to answer this question because farmers are outside Leinster House today protesting on this issue.  Many farmers believe they are not getting a fair percentage of the margins made on food sales by retail outlets and big supermarket chains in particular.  It is important to note, however, that my powers and influence in this area are limited.  Prices in big outlets such as Tesco, Dunnes Stores, Musgraves and SuperValu are, by and large, determined by competitive realities.  We are working to resolve this matter at European level.  The European Commission is examining this issue to encourage more collective bargaining power for primary producers, that is, the farmers.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce a fair trade Bill, which would even the scales in negotiations between primary producers and retailers.  I intend to ensure that that legislation <Col N="317"/>is brought forward.  It is not being drafted by me but by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
        <P>This morning, I spent some time speaking about this issue with IFA representatives.  The response of the Competition Authority to a complaint made against the IFA was, in my view, excessive and I am uncomfortable with what happened.  A body such as the IFA, which represents so many people, should be treated with more respect than it received from the Competition Authority.  There is an ongoing investigation, however, and we must await the results.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that the majority of food produced in Ireland is not sold through multiples or other retailers here, but is exported.  While we obviously want to secure a fair price for farmers&rsquo; produce, we must also ensure that food production is price-competitive, because the majority of food produced in Ireland is exported and sold in foreign markets.  It is about getting the balance right between those two issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Like most Deputies, I am concerned by the outrageous act of the Competition Authority last week when it did a dawn raid on the Irish Farm Centre with 15 officers and a search warrant, just because of one person&rsquo;s complaint.  It was totally high-handed and that is the problem.</P>
      
        <P>There is too much regulation and I am glad the Minister will meet his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  In 1996, producers were receiving 37% of the retail price, but this level reduced to 19% by 2011.  I wish the Minister well in his portfolio and I hope he will tackle this issue.</P>
        <P>Farmers are busy people and do not want to be out on the streets of Dublin, but that is where they are today in their many thousands.  I met them earlier.  They are disciplined, always well behaved and have served this country well.  They do not need this kind of unfair treatment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>

	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot fix margins either.  We can examine ways for primary producers to negotiate collectively to get better prices for their products.  We must balance the need for primary producers to get a fair price for their products that reflects the cost of production &mdash; the poultry and pig sectors are under particular pressure because of the price of grain and feed &mdash; with the need for Irish food to be produced in a way that is competitive with anywhere else in Europe.  We are uniquely exposed to export markets and must sell the majority of our produce outside Ireland.  The issue of margins relates to negotiating power.  This is one matter that will be considered by the draft fair trade Bill.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</askee>
        <Quest>      the reason Ireland continues to support several Irish fishing vessels that are currently operating in the over-exploited and disputed waters off the coast of Western Sahara; and if he will make a statement on the matter.      </Quest>
        <QRef>[8776/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In many ways this is a human rights issue rather than a fishing issue but there is a crossover.  I debated this matter as a Member of the European Parliament&rsquo;s <Col N="318"/>fisheries committee when the EU-Moroccan fisheries agreement was being considered.  The current fisheries partnership agreement, FPA between the European Community and Morocco came into force in February 2007.  A fisheries protocol setting out the detailed operating rules for the FPA was also established at the time.  The FPA, which includes the waters off Western Sahara, renews automatically every four years.  However, the protocol expired on 27 February 2011.</P>
        <P>The FPA with Morocco is considered one of the EU&rsquo;s most important bilateral fisheries agreements.  Under the protocol, the EU provides a financial contribution to the Moroccan authorities each year in exchange for fishing opportunities for EU fishermen in Moroccan waters.  As with all FPAs, this contribution is intended as payment for the fishing opportunities and as assistance for the development of the capacity of the local fisheries sector to exploit its resources sustainably.  Eleven member states, including Ireland, are allocated fishing opportunities under the agreement.  Ireland receives a quota of 2,500 tonnes each year in the FPA&rsquo;s industrial pelagic category but no Irish fishing vessels have operated in Morocco under this FPA since 2007.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Negotiations on the renewal of the protocol, which were due to commence late in 2010, were delayed because Morocco was considered not to have provided sufficient data regarding the regional socioeconomic impacts of the EU&rsquo;s annual financial contribution.  Given the EU&rsquo;s important fishing interests in Morocco and because Morocco belatedly provided some information, the European Commission asked the Council to be provided with a mandate to negotiate a one-year protocol on similar lines to the expiring one.  The Commission&rsquo;s goal was to allow EU fishing operations in Moroccan waters to continue uninterrupted while detailed consideration was given to the merits of negotiating a new longer and potentially different protocol.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="10"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P el="0">Given the urgency of the situation and the importance of this agreement for European fishermen, Ireland supported the Commission&rsquo;s request to the Council to be provided with a mandate to negotiate a one-year protocol.  Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Commission&rsquo;s mandate was given on the proviso that, before the Council would ratify the new short-term protocol, the Commission would share with member states the information provided by the Moroccan authorities concerning the implementation of the current protocol and its regional impact.  This would allow member states to make a full assessment of whether the current agreement was providing a benefit to the Saharawi people.</P>
        <P>In late February, the EU Commission and Morocco initialled an agreement for a one-year fisheries protocol.  As part of this negotiation, transitional arrangements have been put in place for up to six months, allowing EU fishing operations in Morocco to continue uninterrupted pending completion of the ratification procedures.  The initialled protocol must still be ratified by the EU and this only takes place when agreed by Council and consented to by the European Parliament.  The Commission has not yet made a proposal for ratification, but this is expected shortly.  The new protocol has additional requirements for the provision by Morocco of details of the geographic distribution of benefits.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been clear that our final decision would be influenced by whether it can be persuasively shown that there is appropriate benefit deriving to the Saharawi people through implementation of the FPA.  Therefore, our position on the ratification of the one-year protocol remains reserved, as the Commission&rsquo;s analysis of the information provided by the Moroccan side on the regional benefits has not been unequivocal.  While citing that positive benefits were in evidence in the regional distribution of funds including to the Western Sahara, the level of <Col N="319"/>those benefits remains uncertain.  Ireland has always been a firm supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara and the Government remains firmly committed to this principle.</P>
        <P>Ireland is also of the view that the FPA with Morocco should be implemented if it can be shown to be to the benefit of all the people concerned, including the Saharawi in terms of the waters off Western Sahara, and in full accordance with the principles of international law.  I am not convinced that this is the case at present and will consider carefully Ireland&rsquo;s final position on ratification of the one-year protocol when a formal proposal comes from the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Minister, the protocol regarding the fisheries off the Moroccan coast was due to cease in February 2011.  Is there any evidence that any part of our fishing fleet or, more importantly, any part of an Irish-registered fishing fleet as distinct from Irish vessels is exploiting those waters without operating within the protocol?</P>
        <P>I accept fully that it is a human rights issue.  It has been brought to our attention for some time that waters off west Africa, in particular Morocco, have been exploited to the detriment of those countries&rsquo; peoples.  In many of the countries in question, questionable leaders are prepared to sell national resources for their own benefit as distinct from the benefit of the people they are supposed to represent.</P>
        <P>Is there evidence of Irish vessels with Irish workers and skippers fishing there or are the boats referred to in the information that has come to us just registered in the Republic of Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of our approach towards the Western Sahara issue, I will reread two paragraphs into the record, as it is an important matter.  They read:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland has been clear that our final decision would be influenced by whether it can be persuasively shown that there is appropriate benefit deriving to the Saharawi people through implementation of the FPA.  Therefore, our position on the ratification of the one-year protocol remains reserved, as the Commission&rsquo;s analysis of the information provided by the Moroccan side on the regional benefits has not been unequivocal.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">While citing that positive benefits were in evidence in the regional distribution of funds including to the Western Sahara, the level of those benefits remains uncertain.  Ireland has always been a firm supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara and the Government remains firmly committed to this principle.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am quite familiar with the Western Sahara issue.  I am unaware of any evidence of Irish boats or Irish interests operating under a flag of convenience fishing there, but I may be wrong.  If the Deputy has individual cases he wants to explore with me, I would happily discuss them with him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is a general question, I might use it as an opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s position to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that there are two questions on this matter, this question and Question No. 37.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="320"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  This question is on the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  As people will know, along with the Common Agricultural Policy review, there is also a CFP review.  It is important that both get the priority they require.  Those negotiations are occurring in parallel with the overall EU budget negotiations.  Next month, the Commission will publish the first draft proposals on the so-called EU budgetary framework.  We will then have an idea as to the proposed allocation of funds for agriculture and the CFP.  I suspect it will not be good news.  As such, there will need to be a great deal of subsequent political lobbying to try to change the figures.</P>
        <P>Ireland is likely to hold the Presidency of the EU when the CFP and CAP reviews are to conclude and an acceptable compromise across the EU is to be delivered in the first half of 2013.  I have made it my business to try to get to know some of the key personalities with whom Ireland needs to build understanding and alliances, for example, my counterparts in France and Spain.  I have met both Ministers as well as Maria Damanaki, the Commissioner with responsibility for this area.</P>
        <P>Ireland has specific concerns about how the Commission looks like it will approach the CFP.  The most dangerous change in policy for Ireland is the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of a single transferable quota.  Under this, instead of giving a country a quota and allowing the relevant Department to allocate it responsibly with the industry to keep everyone in business, boats would be able to transfer quota between them.  My fear is that the buying power of big Spanish, French and possibly British and Dutch fishing companies would allow them to buy out Irish quota through companies they would set up in Ireland, as quota transferability will be restricted to domestic transfers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry to interrupt the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering two questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for saying that we were dealing with two questions; I read an incorrect note.  We are dealing with one question only.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me conclude.  The single transferable quota is a potentially lethal policy for Ireland which we need to resist, because we do not want to see quota seeping out of Ireland through loopholes in the law.  This has already happened in the UK, by the way, as quota was taken by Spanish companies under British flags, and those fish never see the British coast.  We do not want to see the same happen in Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other issue is that of discards.  Fisheries did not do well, particularly in Ireland, from the financial package that went with the current Common Fisheries Policy, and we must aspire to improve on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and welcome his comments on the question.  The first thing to acknowledge is that the CFP, while minor in an overall EU context, is a major issue for coastal communities in this country and throughout the EU.  We will not go through the entire CFP today, but there are some specific questions the Minister might address.  The first issue is the perception that the current CFP has largely been detrimental to the conservation of fisheries throughout the EU, which will affect fisheries on our coast.  I hope the new review will address this.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment on single transferable quotas.  I agree completely that this would be detrimental to Irish fisheries and I hope we will get support across the House for his efforts to resist it.</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>I propose that the Minister support the idea of subsidiarity or a ground-up approach towards the management of sea fisheries.  We have had significant success in the Irish sea fisheries industry with the Celtic Sea fishery, in which there was an industry-led initiative to conserve stocks.  We have seen major improvements in stocks based entirely on an initiative that was instigated by the industry, supported by the Marine Institute and the Department, to solve a problem.  Much more work on and support for ground-up, industry-led initiatives such as this would be useful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I must bring in the Minister now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about one more specific issue, with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rsquo;s indulgence, which is that of discards.  This is a major problem and has been identified by the Commissioner as a particular issue she wants to address.  I urge the Minister to have close consultation with the industry in this regard.  It is a crime against conservation and the industry when good fish is thrown out dead, for many reasons.  One aspect of this is economic discards from factory ships.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Commissioner&rsquo;s concern about discards but I do not agree with her solution to that problem.  It is simply a moral issue, but, in addition, the killing of juvenile fish in order to catch marketable fish is detrimental to future fish stocks.  Literally hundreds of thousands of tonnes of juvenile fish are dumped over the side, dead, because they cannot be brought ashore by a boat that is over quota.  This is something that simply must be tackled, but in a way that is workable and that will not put people out of business.  I have had preliminary discussions with industry representatives on this issue.  We are considering, for example, the introduction of a pilot project in what is called the biologically sensitive area or the Irish conservation box, which would help the Commission understand the practicalities of what it is proposing.  This would also be a way of reinforcing in people&rsquo;s minds the fact that the Irish box is a vulnerable area that needs to be maintained.  If we were to lose that area, the impact on Irish fish stocks would be devastating.  I am cautious about the discards issue, but I am also realistic in admitting that something must happen.  I encourage the industry to work with me on this.</P>
        <P>The principle of subsidiarity is one that should apply to the CFP.  We have good examples of stocks, including Celtic Sea herring, that are actually growing at the moment.  We have put measures in place on a voluntary basis, including set-aside at sea, under which the industry has agreed not to fish in certain areas to allow stocks to breed and grow.  That type of approach should be factored into the CFP.</P>
        <P>I have invited the Commissioner to come to Ireland to see for herself how the industry works here, because the industry in Ireland is structured in a different way from that of France or Spain.  In France, the fleet is predominantly owned by big multinationals, while in Ireland trawlers are owned by families.  It is a different financial structure, and the Commissioner needs to understand that in the context of the CFP.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support the Minister in his endeavours to ensure the quota system is preserved as it is.  If there is a major deficiency in the Irish fleet, it is a lack of quota.  In the negotiations on the CFP, I hope the Minister will do everything in his power to gain extra quota for Irish fisherman so they can have a sustainable income and a viable business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s comments on earlier questions.  However, I ask him to consider in particular those who are fishing with smaller boats.  I tried to raise on the Adjournment the issue of last Monday&rsquo;s storm, in which fishermen in Arranmore Island lost &euro;150,000 worth of lobster pots.  As a result of conservation elements and because of EU <Col N="322"/>and State law, those fishermen cannot fish for salmon and cannot fish in area 6A, and now their livelihoods in lobster fishing have been taken away.  There are issues in the CFP, particularly to do with area 6A and boats under 15 m, that must be addressed.  I ask the Minister to consider the effects of the natural disaster that occurred on Monday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McGinley raised that issue with me this morning.  I am going to Killybegs and Greencastle next weekend and I hope I will have an opportunity to meet some of those fishermen and hear what they have to say.  It is not as easy as the Deputy might think to simply transfer quota to them to make up for losses they have experienced, because this would mean taking quota from somebody else.  There are some contentious issues to resolve this summer, including mackerel quota, Celtic Sea herring, new fish stocks that are in their first year under the quota system, and the allocation of quotas.  I accept that we need to try to keep the small guys in business.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 40 together. </P>
        <P>I had thought we would take Nos. 35 and 36 together.  Maybe this is an opportunity for people to come back and ask for more detailed answers if they want.  These questions are about the discussions I had with Commissioner Damanaki.  To say that I made a clear case in terms of my reservations about single transferable quota would be an understatement.  We met for about an hour and a half, and for an hour of that we were discussing the issue of single transferable quotas &mdash; why it makes sense for France and Spain and perhaps Britain to have a system under which quota can be traded, as milk quota was in the past, but it makes no sense for Ireland.  This is because of the way our industry is structured, primarily along family lines.  In some cases, particularly the big 23 in the pelagic fleet, it is different, but the whitefish fleet consists of relatively small trawlers.  Under our system, the national quota is allocated with the aim of keeping intact as many fishing families as possible in coastal communities by giving them a viable quota.  The quota is shared out in a way that will give maximum benefit to coastal rural communities, and this has worked.  Although I accept that we do not have enough quota, the allocation of resources, in terms of the quota we do have, has worked quite successfully.  The industry works with my Department.  I accept that differences of opinion sometimes occur but by and large the industry works well with my Department.</P>
        <P>The idea that we would allow people to sell or lease their quotas to anyone they like with a view to exiting the industry or making money is extremely dangerous.  If we were to allow this to happen it would enable fishing companies which have significant resources and which are linked with multiples to expand their activities.  The latter is particularly true in the French case.  For example, one of the largest retail multiples in France &mdash; it is a really good company &mdash; owns 15 trawlers, eight of which operate, perfectly legally, in Irish waters much of the time.  We are meeting representatives of the company in a few weeks to try to encourage it to land its catch in Ireland in order that it might be processed here.</P>
        <P>We could not allow the Spanish fleet in particular to buy up additional quotas in Ireland in order to feed what is, as everyone is aware, a fleet which does not have sufficient quotas to <Col N="323"/>allow it to remain viable.  We cannot permit this to reduce the level of quotas available to Irish boats.  We have made this absolutely clear.  My expectation is that when we see the first draft of the proposals relating to the Common Fisheries Policy these will contain a recommendation regarding single transferable quotas.  I am sure the EU will try to accommodate our concerns by putting in place restrictions relating to the need to retain quotas within individuals countries.  However, I am not convinced this will protect quotas to the extent we would like.</P>
        <P>The second issue about which I had quite a long conversation with the Commissioner was that relating to discards and the importance of the Irish Box, or the biologically sensitive area.  I have already made my position clear in respect of that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate the Minister on getting out of the traps extremely quickly in respect of this sector.  His experience and his passion for this subject will be of assistance to the industry.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two points.  The first relates to the fact the Minister has inherited a Department which is paralysed by fear.  This is the case as a result of the European Court of Justice&rsquo;s 2007 decision to penalise Ireland for being in breach of the birds and habitats directive in the context of the aquaculture industry.  There are possibly upwards of 700 licences which must be expedited.  I have spoken about this matter to the Minister on a private basis and I am of the view that some form of public timetable is required.  There must be a meeting of minds between him and the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Deenihan, who has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, in respect of this matter.  A timetable must be placed in the public domain in order to instil confidence among those in the industry to the effect that a roadmap exists and that there are potential investment opportunities in this area for entrepreneurs.  Such a timetable must be drawn up by the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Tourism, Culture and Sport.</P>
        <P>My second point relates to the disaster involving Arranmore Island, which has placed the entire debate on area 6A in context.  I had an in-depth discussion about this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McGinley, this morning.  The fishermen on the island were completely dedicated to the lobster and crab industry, which has now been totally wiped out.  Their hands are tied because they cannot, for example, sail out to catch bait.  Neither can they catch the lesser spotted dogfish, pollock or other whitefish.  The reality is that area 6A is an example of how the system is not working.  Donegal, most particularly its coastal communities, voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to both referenda on the Lisbon treaty.  This is a significant matter which must be examined.</P>
        <P>I request that the Minister examine the research currently being carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in respect of the possibility of catching the lesser spotted dogfish within the mixed fishery of area 6A.  The cod recovery plan is in place but everything else is being penalised as a result of this plan.  Fishermen who want to catch lesser spotted dogfish are not catching cod and neither are those who want to catch pollock.  As already stated, therefore, we must examine the research being carried out by BIM.  A good and in-depth analysis has been carried out locally as well as nationally.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the research to which I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a detailed discussion to be had with regard to the consequences of what happened off Arranmore Island where a localised fishing industry that was entirely reliant on crab and lobster was wiped out when the fishermen lost all their gear in a storm.  That is a matter to which I will give consideration when I visit Donegal.  I do not want to raise expectations without first having examined what occurred.  To date, I have literally engaged in a five-minute conversation in respect of this issue.</P><Col N="324"/>
        <P>In respect of aquaculture, I have seen the expected timetable for assessing all of the harbours located in Natura 2000 areas or SACs before licences can be applied for, considered and granted.  If I recall correctly, Glengarriff will not be dealt with until 2017.  The system is not working nor will it work into the future.  If we were to apply the timetable that is currently proposed, we would miss an extraordinary opportunity to develop an aquaculture industry in Ireland which could fill markets across Europe and further afield.</P>
        <P>I recently visited the largest fishing expo in the world, which is held each year in Brussels.  Some 19 Irish companies were represented there and the biggest difficulty for them was the fact that buyers did not know why they were present if they could not sell them the volumes they required.  Last year, 12,000 tonnes of farmed salmon were produced in this country.  Scotland produced 150,000 tonnes and Norway produced over 1 million tonnes.  I understand that production in the latter is now heading towards 2 million tonnes.  We have a fantastic natural resource and we must manage it in a proper and sustainable way in order that it will not impact on other fisheries.  I accept there are concerns in respect of aquaculture but I am of the view that we can deal with these.  We cannot allow this huge opportunity to pass.</P>
        <P>Some 70% of the fish consumed within the European Union is imported from outside of it.  There is a huge market for our aquaculture products on our doorstep.  The way to expand the fishing industry in this country is to expand aquaculture and the processing element of the fishing industry.  In the interim, we must examine the position with regard to quotas and try to improve our deal in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy etc.  The window of opportunity that exists is, for political reasons, limited.  However, there are major opportunities in the other two areas to which I refer.  My officials and I met the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Deenihan, and his officials and we are trying to find a way to progress the position with regard to the granting of aquaculture licences in Natura 2000 areas in a much more speedy fashion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister discuss with the Commissioner the issue of electronic log books, particularly in the context of their introduction not just in Ireland but rather, as the industry desires, across the entire EU on a simultaneous basis?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we did discuss that matter and the Commissioner was quite taken aback when I stated that Ireland is ready to proceed with the introduction of electronic log books.  I also informed her that we are hugely frustrated that she is not taking a stronger position in respect of this matter, particularly in the case of Spain.  The Commission has set a date &mdash; I believe it is September &mdash; after which it expects electronic log books to be introduced on trawlers.  This will give Irish authorities a much more accurate picture with regard to who is fishing, where they are fishing and what they are catching.  Even though we are doing a reasonable job in terms of policing the European waters for which Ireland has responsibility, I suspect there is a great deal of fishing occurring in those waters which should not be taking place.  Electronic log books will assist us in our efforts to counteract that activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister well in his further talks with the Commissioner and with the relevant EU officials.  I support what he had to say and was impressed by it.  I was taken by how strongly the Minister put his points across in respect of this matter.  I am glad he will be meeting the Arranmore fishermen on Friday.  He stated he does not wish to raise expectations.  However, approximately &euro;150,000 worth of fishing gear was destroyed.  Some 15 fishermen &mdash; they represent the entire fishing fleet of the island &mdash; were affected.  All of those 15 fishermen did not participate in the voluntary buy-out when the issue of salmon drift-netting was settled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It involves only a small amount of funding.  Will the Department be flexible to ensure this traditional fishery can survive?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree with islanders and many others who argue there needs to be a unique set of policies across the European Union for island communities when it comes to fisheries policy?  It is argued policy should be adapted for those in the island community given that in many cases it is their only industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the single transferable quota is introduced, what options do we have?  Are we looking at allowances being made for Ireland?  Can we opt out of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP?  Could an exemption of the six-mile limit be considered under the CFP for island communities in west Donegal and the VIa area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to make commitments in the Chamber when I may not be able to deliver on them later.  However, I would be more than happy if the Deputy wished to talk to me in person about the case he raised of the 15 fishermen.  Deputy Pearse Doherty does not need me to remind him that we do not have much money to spend.  My Department must make significant savings next year which will stress many people.  I will examine the case he raised if he gives me the full details and see what is possible for the Department to do.</P>
        <P>I do not think a separate islands policy in the CFP is a runner.  For example, could Britain be considered an island?  How does one classify rural coastal communities in Spain and Portugal which are not on islands?  The new CFP will examine sea areas rather than land masses.  That is why we want to get preference for Ireland in several areas.  For example, we want to retain Ireland&rsquo;s special treatment for a white fish quota through the Hague preferences.  The reason behind this is to keep economies of scale in Ireland&rsquo;s fishing industry.  If the amount of quota allocated for a particular catch falls below a certain tonnage, it may not be viable to fish it any longer.  I hope this reasonably good deal will be protected under the new CFP.  I have made this point to the Commissioner.  It is not a done deal but I am working on it.</P>
        <P>The second special treatment I will be getting for Ireland will deal with the biologically sensitive area around the Irish Box which comprises the south-west and south coasts.  It is probably the most fertile spawning ground in the EU seas.  Spanish, Dutch, French and British trawlers concentrate most of their fishing efforts around this biologically sensitive area and are desperate to enter it.  We need to keep the existing protections in place.</P>
        <P>Regarding the single transferable quota system, we cannot simply opt out of the CFP just like we cannot opt out of the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, we can make it clear at an early stage what we consider acceptable and not.  The single transferable quota will be the most contentious issue for Ireland and one on which we must make a real stand.  Spain, the most politically powerful of the fishing nations, sees the single transferable quota system as a solution to the quota problems its current fleet is experiencing.  The Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Maria Damanaki, however, now understands our concerns in this regard.  It is up to her to put a solution together that can accommodate Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>What can be done to increase Ireland&rsquo;s farmed salmon production from the current level of 12,000 tonnes per annum to the realistic potential of 1 million tonnes per annum?

	<P>A very technical question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="326"/>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can always rely on Deputy Peter Mathews for figures.  He is correct about the number of jobs that could be created.  It is my ambition to dramatically expand the aquaculture industry in Ireland in a way that is consistent with protecting special areas of conservation, SAC, and Natura areas.  As well as putting fish farms in harbours and bays, we must examine the potential for offshore fish farming.  The technology and engineering capacity is available to put larger cages further offshore that can have higher density of stocks.  Some private companies are already examining the potential in this area.  We could expand the industry quicker if we did not have to base it in Natura areas.  My twin-track approach is to assess the SAC bays and harbours for fish farms while examining the potential of development in offshore areas.</P>
        <P>Having been to the recent seafood exposition in Brussels, I know of the enormous demand for Irish fish products.  We have much capacity to expand processing and add value to our fish products.  The industry could employ thousands and I intend to make it a big good news story over the next five years.  However, I will need help with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 65 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food supports the planting of miscanthus and willow crops by giving farmers grant aid under the bioenergy scheme.  Farmers are paid a grant of up to a maximum of &euro;1,300 per hectare to cover 50% of the cost of establishing the crop.  This scheme is co-funded by the EU under the rural development programme.</P>
        <P>In 2010 the area planted under the scheme was 353 hectares.  For 2011, 89 applications were received and approvals to plant 480 hectares have issued to date.  There are 14 further applications, with a total of 260 hectares, with outstanding issues.  The Department is pursuing these with the applicants.  It continues to work closely with other Departments and agencies, particularly Teagasc and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, with a view to maximising the development of the bioenergy sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  Is the target of 70,000 hectares by 2015, set by Teagasc in 2008, achievable and what policies are being followed by the Department in this regard?  Will the changes to the Sustainable Energy Ireland schemes and greener home scheme, which abolished the grants for wood chip burners, have an impact on the uptake of miscanthus and willow growing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I have attended a number of conferences during the six weeks I have been in office, at which serious interest was expressed in regard to the growing of miscanthus and willow crops.  Many local authorities, in particular in County Clare, have taken it upon themselves to provide their own heat, through the use of wood pellets and chips.  We have an obligation to do this.</P>
        <P>There is much frustration within the energy industry.  With the support of the Government and Department, many people got involved in the growing of willow and miscanthus but the <Col N="327"/>refit tariff has not yet come through despite our having applied for it almost 12 months ago.  This is a major factor in terms of people opting to grow willow, which is a long term plantation, or miscanthus.  With greater demand for arable ground and farming going well, this will become more competitive.  I am happy that the refit tariff problem will be sorted out shortly.  One must apply to the EU for status and accommodation of the tariff and we have replied to all of the questions put to us in this regard.</P>
        <P>I am happy this matter will be sorted our fairly soon.  This will encourage people, in particular in the energy, sector, to get involved as they will have a fixed income.  One cannot get involved in something on a wing and a prayer basis.  Willow cannot be grown on any type of ground and one must grow a certain tonnage in order for it to be viable.  Also, one must have an outlet for it.   I recently attended the Birr show and other shows.  People are confident that we can provide our own energy.  Energy prices are resulting in higher costs in the farming and pig industry and as such the more energy we can provide the more viable these industries will be.</P>
        <P>I am unable to provide the Deputy with a response in regard to his question about whether the 70,000 acres is achievable.  However, given the year that is in it we must steady ourselves.  We have set targets which I believe we can reach.  We must steady the situation in terms of funding.  As Minister of State, I am responsible for horticulture and forestry.  We must steady the flow of money to support these sectors.  Farmers and other people cannot be encouraged to get involved in a business unless it provides a steady income.  It is great that marginal land is coming back into grazing.  This land is also good for willow and miscanthus planting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>It was announced today at a conference that peak oil occurred in 2006.  Does the Minister of State believe we should be putting a stronger case to Europe for improved grants for miscanthus and willow growing?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Two other important energy crops are sugar beet and rapeseed oil.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline any developments in policy in regard to these crops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>A study on sugar beet is currently underway and I would be foolish to comment on that.  As regards rapeseed oil, I recently visited a plant in Carlow where I saw it being processed on an experimental basis.  Every area is being looked at.  Willow and miscanthus grass growing is the way forward.  I do not believe there will be any increase in funding in this regard.  The Minister has a job to do in terms of the manner in which the Department is run.  We must ensure that every sector of agriculture is growing and that we fund to the best of our ability the people at the coalface who are being asked to get involved in willow and miscanthus growing.  This is a crucial year.  We must seek to stabilise the acres we are growing, get the refit tariff in place and convince local authorities, hospitals and other institutions that use a great deal of heat to consider moving away from oil.  I referred earlier to local authorities using local fuels, namely pellets or timber, to produce their own heat.  This is the way forward.  The more energy we can provide within our own system the better for everybody.  Also, thousands of jobs can be generated in this sector.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am acutely aware of the concerns expressed by many people in regard to the affects of the pension levy.  The people we represent believe those who landed our country in this economic position have walked scot free from their well paid jobs with lump sums and pension pots which are grossly excessive without being held to account for their actions.  We need to restore fairness and justice to society.  We must ensure that revenue raising measures go hand in hand with policies that will facilitate job creation and will hold rogue bankers to account.</P>
        <P>The proposed pension levy is a temporary measure which will assist in the rebuilding of our economy.  It is about our country and our people.  The growth of our economy and the rebuilding of Ireland will help to restore the value and importance of being Irish and will help us as a nation.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement yesterday that the Government will not raid investment funds or deposit accounts.  I welcome his assurance to the House yesterday that the Government has no plans in this regard.  It is important that the Government allays people&rsquo;s fears, driven in part by idle commentary and pure political gamesmanship by Fianna F&aacute;il in particular.</P><Col N="329"/>
        <P>The ideological pursuit of a low tax based economy to the exclusion of all other considerations is but one of the policy decisions that has forced the hand of this Government to implement difficult proposals.  As part of the drive to push down the tax base, many reliefs and shelters were created.  Unfortunately, these were designed to benefit those on excessive incomes and to allow those with more than ample personal wealth to further increase their net worth without paying a fair level of tax.</P>
        <P>Much has been said and written during the past number of years in regard to property tax reliefs, which amount in value to &euro;460 million.  Yet, much less has been said about tax reliefs applicable to pensions, which amount to &euro;3 billion.  The tax treatment of pensions permitted high earners to syphon-off large parts of their income, thereby paying little tax while many, in particular on PAYE, could not benefit to the same extent.  The pensions industry grew and developed on the back of these large tax reliefs.  This lobby group has encouraged everyone to invest in their products, many of which are now not worth a fraction of their previous values.  In the last two years, some of the tax reliefs have been clawed back but, given the economic morass in which we now find ourselves, there is little option but to continue to row back on some of the existing reliefs.  It is important to recognise that a 0.6% levy is a temporary step.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to suspend the air travel tax.  Airlines must now respond to the Government proposal.  Rhetoric must be matched by action.  The Government has honoured its commitment.  The airlines must reciprocate.  I call on Ryanair, Aer Lingus and other carriers to act in the national interest, enter into an agreement with the Government and not confine themselves to empty words and big advertisements.  The time for talk is over.  They must now act.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, a number of people in the pensions industry have raised legitimate concerns with me.  Time has not allowed me to e-mail them to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, or to the Minister.  I hope they can be considered before Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>This is a good beginning.  It is not ideal, but the Government has shown it has a plan and a vision.  At the core of that plan and vision is job creation and the protection of the Irish people.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House I will share time with Deputies Tom Fleming, Stephen Donnelly and Clare Daly.</P>
        <P>The performance of our colleague, Deputy Buttimer, is more reminiscent of the stage of the Abbey Theatre than of this House.  He told us this was a brave and courageous initiative.  I am sure he knows, because his Minister has already said it, that this is a very modest proposal.  In fact, it is a minor proposal and totally inadequate to deal with the current unemployment crisis and recession.  It does not bear any resemblance to the promises made by Fine Gael or the Labour Party during the recent general election campaign, when we were promised 100,000 jobs and 50,000 training places.  While the Bill contains welcome elements, the Minister is right in saying it is a very modest and inadequate proposal.</P>
        <P>Deputy Buttimer said there is no pot of gold and nothing in the Bill for the rich and powerful.  He is wrong on both counts.  I remember the 1980s when we went on PAYE marches and when hospitals and hospital wards were closing.  At that time we were told there was no pot of gold.  Some people were foolish enough to believe that.  Very shortly afterwards we discovered that the rich and powerful had salted their wealth away in every nook and cranny they could find and sent most of it out of the country to offshore bank accounts.</P>
        <P>Similarly today, there is a pot of gold.  It contains the personal assets of the 6% of the Irish people who are super-rich, who have &euro;250 billion in assets and who do not pay one ha&rsquo;penny <Col N="330"/>in assets tax.  Deputy Buttimer is right about one thing.  There is nothing in the Bill for the rich and powerful.  There is no assets tax and no attempt to make the rich and powerful pay any of the costs of the recession.  Not only does the Bill not contain an assets tax but the rich are exempt from the pensions levy.  Very wealthy people can put huge sums of money into pension accounts that are exempt from the levy.  There is a pot of gold, but have we the political will to go after it?  The Bill contains no provision for the taxation of very wealthy people and they are exempt from the pension levy.</P>
        <P>Deputy Buttimer also told us the Government would pay its debts.  He suggested we should be proud of that.  The EU and the IMF are not good Samaritans taking a neighbour out of trouble.  European bankers who gambled recklessly and lost are now demanding that Irish taxpayers pay for their losses.  They want an each-way bet on their reckless gambling.  They want the Irish taxpayer, low and middle income families and the poor to pay.</P>
        <P>There is no debt.  This is a rip-off.  The so-called payment of our debt means an unprecedented assault on living standards, mass unemployment, 100,000 emigrants per year, cuts in social welfare, tax increases and the continuation of the universal social charge which, during the general election campaign, the Government parties promised to review and scrap.  The Government had an opportunity to review the charge in the Bill but it has not done so.  We have long waiting lists in hospitals, patients on trolleys in hospital wards and special needs assistants and resource teachers sacked in our schools.  In the last few days it was announced that 150 resource teachers have been withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Rather than something to be proud of, the payment of this so-called debt &mdash; or rip-off &mdash; is something to be ashamed of.  We must ensure that very wealthy people pay their fair share.  They are paying nothing at present and they need to pay a once-off significant levy and a 5% assets tax for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the main thrust of the jobs initiative.  I hope it will create an environment that will invigorate and give positivity to all the areas of job creation targeted by the Government.</P>
        <P>I have reservations and concerns about some aspects of the Bill.  The Finance Act that followed the last budget contained a measure to oblige an employer to pay the 10.75% employer&rsquo;s PRSI on shares issued to an employee as part of remuneration.  This made perfect sense as the shares were income, like all forms of remuneration.  In this Bill, it is proposed that in the small number of companies that are in a position to give share options to employees as remuneration, the shares should be exempt from PRSI.  This measure is geared towards taking care of the elite, who constitute about 3% of employers and employees in the country.  This is inequitable and unethical.  It is a devious measure that has been slipped through under the impression that it could be beneficial to employment as a whole.  It is geared towards the very small minority of companies that are in a position to grant share options in remuneration packages to their employees.  This would have to be paid for by the others who pay tax, directly or indirectly.  It is appalling that it is being slipped through as a concession to the fat cats, who I estimate make up approximately 3% of the population.  This elite group will gain from this measure while the huge majority of the citizens will pay for it.  Money spent on this aspect of the scheme would be better spent on restoring cuts to the incomes of the blind, the disabled, carers and widows, who were affected in the last budget.</P>
        <P>With regard to the 0.6% pension levy, many ordinary people, whether workers or small business people, have put aside a small nest-egg in an annuity that will return approximately &euro;16,000, prior to tax, in 12 months.</P><Col N="331"/>
      
        <P>It is shameful that these people are being hit indirectly as a result of the proposals before us.  In many cases we should have a tiered system.  Sums up to &euro;500,000 should be exempt from the pension pot because it can take many years to accumulate such a sum.  Beyond that amount, we could introduce the 0.6% rate up to &euro;1 million, 1% from &euro;1 million upwards and, on a progressive basis, 1.5% for &euro;1.5 million and 2% for &euro;2 million.  There is a lot of money which could be targeted by amending this scheme, which would be fairer and more equitable as it would be a progressive tax and would not penalise the poor pensioner to compensate the fat cats.</P>
        <P>I welcome the interim scheme, although the figure of 5,000 could be more ambitious and up to 30,000 workers could eventually be included in the scheme.  As an incentive, there should be retention of medical cards and perhaps some of the rent allowance for up to three years from the time people participate in the interim scheme.  This was previously done in 1994-95 by Deputy Joan Burton, who was Minister of State at the time.  We should consider giving such an incentive to encourage participation in that scheme.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I strongly welcome the measures on tourism and the airline tax.  If anything, we should give more in order to get as many people as possible into the country.  We should do a special deal with the airlines to encourage low-cost fares and maximise the opportunity to bring people into the country to spend their money.  There is good value at present in hotels, bed and breakfasts and other accommodation and in the general tourism industry.  The only issue to which I take exception is the hiking of prices recently for the visits of the Queen and the US President as well as the European championship match.  There were exorbitant and shameful prices here in the capital city, taking advantage of those visiting the country for a week, which created a bad perception on the international stage.  This should not be tolerated and controls should be introduced.  I ask that these matters be addressed in the context of the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="StephenDonnelly"><NameTxt>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Peter Mathews on his stand in the House today.  As Deputy Mathews pointed out, the total cost of the banking losses which the Irish people are being forced to pay is &euro;100 billion.  That is &euro;72,000 of other people&rsquo;s debt for every single household in Ireland.  The reward for bailing out European financial institutions is cuts, taxes and, most importantly, the real loss of our independence as a sovereign nation.  Deputy Mathews&rsquo; call to share the costs of bailing out the European financial institutions with Europe is morally, politically and economically correct.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said emphatically in the House today that Ireland would pay its debts.  Here is the point &mdash; they are not our debts.  Half of the debt is ours, and we should pay that.   Half of the debt belongs to the private sector.  There is absolutely no moral reason for us to pay this.  If a man and a woman drove themselves and their family into bankruptcy not just by paying their own mortgage but by paying the mortgage of their neighbours, they would be considered fools at best and insane at worst.  Yet, that is exactly what we are doing.  Paying of this debt will drive us into a national insolvency that the Government claims it is trying to avoid.  Earlier this week, President Obama spoke of the spirit of the Irish.  He spoke of our history of fighting for what is right and of fighting foreign powers.  I implore the Government to remember this and take that fighting spirit back to Europe.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains many good ideas and I hope it will protect existing jobs and help to stimulate new jobs, yet I cannot support it.  Why?  It is because we have no idea what the benefits and costs of the proposed Bill are likely to be.  We know that the Bill will take nearly &euro;2 billion out of the pensions of private sector workers.  How many people will stop investing in their pensions?  We do not know.  How many people will move their deposits out of Irish banks?  We do not know.  We know that the Bill will protect Irish jobs and stimulate new jobs but how <Col N="332"/>many jobs will it protect?  We do not know.  How many jobs will it help to create?  We do not know.  How much of people&rsquo;s private pensions will be required to pay for each new job?  We do not know.  How many tourists will it bring to our shores?  We do not know.  If the management team of a company made investment decisions like this, that company would be bankrupt very quickly.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet of the previous Government acted in this way.  It made critical decisions without bringing the assessments of those decisions to this House for review.  As a result, we are bankrupt and we have lost our independence as a sovereign nation.  Is it the intention of the Cabinet of the new Government to continue acting in this way?  I sincerely hope not.  This House is constitutionally bound to hold the Cabinet to account &mdash; that is our role.  However, we can only perform this role if we know the projected costs and benefits of the legislation which the Cabinet is asking us to support.  Without this information, the Members of the House should reject the Bill, not because there are bad ideas in it but because we simply do not have the information required to evaluate whether the Bill represents value for money for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>Of course, it is likely that the Bill will be passed.  It is assumed that every Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputy will vote for it, even though they have not been given the information required to make that decision.  The implications of the Bill are wide.  Taking &euro;2 billion out of private sector pensions could have profoundly negative implications for our society for years to come.  In this context, I oppose the Bill and ask my fellow Deputies in the Labour Party and Fine Gael to oppose it also, not because they are bad ideas but because we do not yet have enough information to know if those ideas are good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>When we strip the jobs initiative of the padding, waffle and unquantified and lofty aspirations, this is what it finally boils down to &mdash; a Finance Bill putting forward four measures which will not deliver a single job and which in fact will continue the policies of Robin Hood in reverse which have been a hallmark of this Government and its predecessor, namely, taking money out of the pockets of ordinary workers in order to pay for a crisis that was not of our creation.  There has justifiably been much focus on the pension levy aspect of the Bill.  Of course, as other Deputies have said, it would be an outrage to pass on this levy to pension holders who are already reeling from pay cuts, tax hikes, mortgage interest rate increases and so on.  It is particularly scandalous that this would be envisaged in the context of the lack of choices considered by the Government in terms of other moneys it could have gone after to fund realistic jobs proposals or measures, such as those highlighted by Deputy Healy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to deal with two of the other measures in the Bill which really expose the con it is, namely, the airport tax and the research and development, or R&amp;D, tax credit.  Let us be perfectly honest about this situation.  The R&amp;D tax credit is nothing more than the legalising of tax evasion.  In reality, it would be better characterised as a form of economic prostitution.  It will not create any wealth or create a single indigenous job, and it will not provide any useful service whatsoever.  It is blatantly clear that this is simply about allowing Irish subsidiaries of foreign multinationals to &ldquo;enhance&rdquo;, as it is termed,  their accounting flexibility.  In other words, they can write off this credit against their operating costs in Ireland and in that way give us an edge over neighbouring economies.  It is a tax write-off scam that will allow the likes of Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and so on, to continue an attempt to persuade them to stay by enabling them to pay virtually zero tax on their worldwide profits.  It is pushing it to say this will keep jobs in the country and it takes the biscuit to claim it will create any new ones.  The only benefit will be the further enhancement of the profits of the multinational corporations.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>It was laughable to hear one of the Fine Gael Deputies lauding the example of California, citing it as a model for the type of economics being pursued in this measure as if it was a good thing.  He is, of course, correct in that California is a very good example of where this model leads.  Let us look at where that state has arrived.  The unemployment rate in California is 11.9%, almost 3% higher than the US average.  More than 2 million people are unemployed in the wealthy state of California.  They are unemployed precisely because of policies similar to those being advocated by the Government in proposals such as this, which basically puts our economy and ourselves up for sale in order to entice companies to come to this country and allegedly provide employment.  It has not worked anywhere else and will not work here either.</P>
        <P>The other measure I consider to be a farce is the reduction of the airport tax.  This is bandied around as if it were some sort of reality, the notion being that if one says something often enough it will not be a mirage.  We are being asked to buy into the axing of a tax in return for an unspecified number of extra passengers, with no idea of how they will be delivered or how we may prove they have been delivered as a result of this cut rather than because of any other measures airlines adopt.  Is it proposed that Ryanair may get the cut while Aer Lingus may not?  It is a joke.  No details are provided.</P>
        <P>The key point is that the airport tax has already been reduced while passenger numbers have fallen.  The idea that a further cut of 3%, even if it is passed on to the tourist, would be sufficient to cut across the international economic backdrop and entice people to come to this country is ridiculous.  It is another vain hope that tourism will be a way out of our economic woes but against the backdrop of an international recession and other difficulties this will not be the case.</P>
        <P>On their own, those measures highlight the fact this Bill will in no way scratch the surface of a problem that has left almost 500,000 people unemployed.  Instead of implementing real measures and a key infrastructural programme that would put people back to work it is simply a giveaway to those who have the wealth in the first place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony who is sharing time with Deputies Gerald Nash and Kevin Humphreys.  I understand Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony has ten minutes and the other two Deputies have five minutes each.  Is that correct?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance (No. 2) Bill which, in effect, is legislation to implement the jobs initiative announced some weeks ago.  We consider these as an early attempt to tackle the biggest fallout from the mismanagement of this country and its finances during the past ten years.  I refer to the unemployment crisis of the past two years and the growth in the number unemployed to some 450,000.  Although everybody, including the Minister and the Government, acknowledges this is only a beginning, just a small part of an overall answer, at least it is a signal of hope that, compared to the last Government, this Government is not merely trying to fix the banking crisis but is trying to stimulate employment.</P>
        <P>This jobs initiative will create an environment where businesses should find it cheaper to employ people and where apprentices can find a way of finishing their training.  Tourists will find it cheaper to travel to the country and when they arrive they will find it cheaper to stay in excellent accommodation and eat in our excellent restaurants.  They will find it cheaper to access and enjoy the wonderful entertainment, music and art we saw so successfully paraded in the past week.</P>
        <P>We had the most successful ten days of marketing Ireland to the outside world that ever took place.  I compliment our President, our Taoiseach, members of our Defence Forces and the Garda as well as many community groups.  I especially include the GAA for the part it played.  This country played to its strengths in the past week.  Although the visits of the Queen <Col N="334"/>of England and President Obama came at some cost to the State, that cost is minuscule compared to the free advertising we received during that period.  Today I heard an expert analyst suggest it was worth &euro;23 million of free tourism marketing.</P>
        <P>It is very appropriate, therefore, that the jobs initiative and the Finance (No. 2) Bill appear at this time because they will help to maximise the impact and effect of those State visits and go some way to reverse the downturn in the numbers of tourists in recent years.  There was a 13% decline in 2009 and a cumulative decline overall of 25% between 2007 and 2010.  During those three years there was a 32% decrease of visitors from Britain.</P>
        <P>Some of the above measures have been criticised because they were not introduced on a permanent footing.  I note the contribution of Deputy Daly who stated that the travel tax measure does not quantify the numbers of extra tourists it will deliver.  However, I believe it does because my reading of the jobs initiative is that if the measure is not successful by the end of 2012 the tax will be reintroduced.  It is important to look to the future, to see if the measures deliver the result they are supposed to.  It will be a strength of these measures that they do so.  If they do not deliver other measures can be considered.</P>
        <P>It is important not only to set targets but to see that the results measure up.  I refer again to the jobs initiative and the free marketing for our country in the past ten days. It was disappointing to read in today&rsquo;s newspapers that Diageo is to reduce its workforce, especially within the marketing area, after the quantity of free advertising it received in Dublin, Moneygall and throughout the country during recent days.  There is never a good time to announce job losses but this announcement was particularly ill advised and inappropriate at this time.  Perhaps President Obama and the Queen should be offered a pint of Beamish or Murphy&rsquo;s when they come again, as we hope they do.  On a more positive note I welcome the announcement last week of 200 new jobs at construction stage and 100 permanent jobs in Killala, County Mayo, with the granting of planning permission to Mayo Renewable Power for a biomass-fired power station.  I hope this will be the first of many announcements in the energy sector in County Mayo in the coming months and years.</P>
        <P>I refer to the section of the Bill that relates to the research and development tax credit and I welcome the changes proposed.  I encourage the Minister to do even more in the end-of-year budget.  Increased budgets for research and development will produce more jobs, so it makes sense to make it easier and cheaper to carry out research and development.  I understand that Dr. Dick Kavanagh of the Industry, Research and Development Group has made a number of proposals in this area.  These include increasing the tax credit rate from 25% to 35%, encouraging greater company-third level interaction and better utilisation of college resources by increasing to 25% the spend allowed, and encouraging company to company interaction by increasing the amount allowed to be subcontracted to 66%.</P>
        <P>In this area, I ask the Minister to ouitline his intentions with regard to the provision in the last Finance Bill, which abolished income tax exemption on royalties payable on patented inventions for which substantial research and development was carried out in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This was one provision which encouraged research and development in Ireland more than any other initiative during the past 38 years since it was introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan.  It was amended over the years to remove abuses that had been highlighted but it was tax legislation that encouraged genuine investors to take risks and to try to come up with inventions which had commercial potential.  It is my contention that we should not have thrown out the baby with the bath water.  We should get rid of any abuses by all means but we should not withdraw the support and incentive when it is most needed.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>The proposal of the industry group in this case is to encourage patents.  Individuals named on a full patent should be entitled to an annual tax free royalty payment up to a maximum of the previous year&rsquo;s gross salary and subject to a 12.5% income tax charge.  I am aware of a couple of companies in my constituency that are severely affected by the changes in last budget.  I encourage the Minister to make some movement on this issue.  In addition to welcoming the plan to review the affects of the abolition of the travel tax, it is vital to examine and check if the reduction of the VAT rate to 9% is being passed on to the consumer by the various sectors and services involved.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interest that this takes place because the more people and tourists who walk through the doors of restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues, the more money will be spent and the more profit made by those providing the services.  If the lower rates are not passed on it will have the opposite affect.</P>
        <P>I make a final appeal regarding the jobs initiative, which, despite the best efforts of some Members of the Opposition, has been welcomed.  Many Deputies will have received many inquiries in their clinics and offices on how to apply for this or that.  I appeal for an easy-to-follow, simple guide that uses understandable language and which is produced such that members of the public and businesses are aware exactly of what they must do to apply for specific training courses, skills training, internship schemes, the retrofit scheme or whatever.</P>
        <P>I call for this is because of the following communication which I received some days ago from a constituent.  I will read it out but I will leave out the names.  It is from a heating and plumbing contractor:</P>
        <P LI="1">I wish to outline our recent experience in trying to give a redundant apprentice employment and the problems we have encountered.  An apprentice contacted this office seeking employment and spoke to me explaining his plight in being a phase five apprentice and redundant, unable to finish his training.  We offered him work on a three-day week trial basis and we were in touch with the F&Aacute;S office No. 1.  The forms were duly filled up and all of that went on but the forms had to be passed on from one F&Aacute;S office to another to another; there were three F&Aacute;S offices involved.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Eventually, he was informed that it was not accepted because he started work before the forms were completed even though the apprentice and the company followed the guidelines to the letter.  The company was given the wrong forms but acted in good faith.  From an employer&rsquo;s perspective there have been three F&Aacute;S offices involved and this delayed the matter.  The letter continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The apprentice was informed prior to contacting us of the need to ring around for work and get the employer to complete the change of employer form.  This is what he did.  Should F&Aacute;S not be advising their apprentices not to accept the work until they are accepted on the scheme?  We are willing to employ this apprentice but are receiving no help and support to do so.  How does this fit into the Government programme?  As a small business employing staff we are fully tax compliant.  Is there any incentive or simple assistance to grow my business and employ staff within this sector?</P>
        <P FLI="0">I point this out as part of the frustrations.  All the people in the F&Aacute;S offices were very helpful; I am criticising the system.  My appeal is that this would be helped a good deal if there were simple rules and language to follow.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldNash"><NameTxt>Deputy Gerald Nash</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle for a moment.  Since this is the first time I have spoken in the Chamber for several days I wish to acknowledge the passing of the former Labour Party Deputy for Louth, Michael Bell, who died last Friday.  As Deputies will be aware, the late Michael Bell represented the constituency of Louth for 20 <Col N="336"/>years from 1982 to 2002.  I express my deepest sympathies to his family, supporters and to my constituents in Louth.  I understand that arrangements will be made on a more formal basis to pay tribute to the late former Deputy Bell and I look forward to that opportunity.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  This is the most significant single step taken to date to deal with the unemployment catastrophe, one of a series of rotten legacies bequeathed to us by the last Administration.  The provisions outlined in the Bill are not the panacea for all our ills but they represent a strong start for an Administration which, by any objective measure, has done more for jobs and economic confidence in two months than the worst Government in our short history managed to achieve in the previous two years.</P>
        <P>We can look towards the future with a more positive attitude now.  Such were the words of the Drogheda based hotelier Martin McGowan in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> this week.  He welcomed the slashing of VAT rates for hotels and other sectors of the economy, an element of the package announced this month which will have a significant positive impact on job creation and retention in an industry that has borne the brunt of the economic collapse.</P>
        <P>The package of investment in jobs must be paid for and there are no easy options in this regard.  The decision by the Government to propose to introduce a small, temporary levy on funded pension schemes has had its critics and I acknowledge some of the concerns expressed on this issue.  However, I take issue fundamentally with the Eddie Hobbs of this world, who go relatively unchallenged on the airwaves of the nation when telling us how the sky will fall in as a result of this temporary and necessary measure.  We are in a warlike situation.  In periods of war or national emergency we are often required to do extraordinary things which may otherwise never have been countenanced.  I prefer to view this small levy as an expression of social solidarity.  Those out of work require the help of those working.  An analogy could be drawn in the way the community rating system for private health insurance operates.  That is a system to support or subsidise those who are ill and old or who require more serious and frequent health care interventions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the capital element of the Bill.  The Government will invest considerable sums in additional school works and in additional roads and transportation projects.</P>
        <P>I have stated previously in the House and through the media and I will say it again, the State must ensure as a matter of urgency that the contractors who benefit from an injection of taxpayers&rsquo; money remain, in so far as possible, within the State.  There is an urgency to review the way in which public authorities in the State award public contracts.  In my constituency and throughout the Border region, it is an all too common occurrence to witness substantial contracts from public authorities awarded to contractors from outside the jurisdiction.  As a matter of urgency we must review this situation.  We must be smarter, cannier and more intelligent in the way in which these situations are handled in the context of procurement requirements.  I urge, understand and accept that it is outside the framework of this Bill, but the House and the State must address this fundamental matter in the coming months as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KevinHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the remarks on the former Deputy Bell from Deputy Nash.  He is a great loss to the Labour Party.  I realise statements will be taken on the matter later.</P>
        <P>It is important to listen to each other when we hold these debates.  I refer to the earlier remarks by Deputy Donnelly and the contribution of Deputy Mathews.  We did not get into the situation we are in all by ourselves.  We did not get into the situation as a result of Fianna F&aacute;il alone.  There was a contribution from the rest of Europe as well and the cost of getting Ireland back on its feet must be shared throughout the EU.  At this stage we are being treated despicably by our partners, who must take partial responsibility.  It is has been constantly stated <Col N="337"/>in the international media that Ireland is taking the measures to get the country back on its feet but it needs the assistance and help of our EU partners.</P>
        <P>Over the last decade, we have invested significantly in research and development.  I heard Deputy Clare Daly speak earlier about research and development tax credits.  I come from the private sector, the pharmaceutical and technical industry, and in my experience, if we can anchor research and development in the country, we will anchor good jobs throughout the economy.  If we can hold on to the research and development element and attract it into the State, it will grow further good quality, well-paid jobs.  I welcome the increase in flexibility for research and development.  It will encourage Irish companies to innovate and create the products and technology of the future.</P>
        <P>Reductions in VAT on sales related to tourism, along with the removal of the airline travel tax, are excellent proposals and will increase the numbers of visitors.  This morning my colleagues in the Labour Party told me that bookings are up and that there is a new increase in awareness as a result of the visits of Queen Elizabeth II and President Obama.  It is also a result of the attractiveness and competitiveness coming into the economy.  That attractiveness will grow and these measures will increase our competitiveness.  There have been studies that show general VAT rate cuts do not have a high impact on consumer spending but the way the Government introduced those cuts will attract more tourists to Ireland and if the removal of the air travel tax is not successful, we will go back to it.  The challenge has been offered to Ryanair and Aer Lingus that if they increase routes and tourist numbers, the cut in tax will stay but if the numbers are not delivered, the tax will be reimposed.</P>
        <P>The PRSI reductions for low-paid staff are a significant concession to the hospitality and catering industries.  Their calls for changes to the working conditions of their staff through the restructuring of the JLCs should not be followed; we are already showing flexibility and working together.  Research has shown wage rates in the hospitality sector were 11% below the EU 15 average in 2008.  We have made major concessions to that industry to make it more competitive.  Any further increases in competitiveness cannot come through reducing pay for those on low wages.  I also ask the Minister to keep tax expenditures under review because it is important these are passed on.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the amount of money being spent on tax cuts.  I would prefer to see more of the money invested in infrastructure projects that would have the effect of addressing major structural issues in the labour market with the collapse of the construction industry.  Many unemployed workers have no chance of being re-employed in the construction sector so we must establish a sustainable construction industry.</P>
        <P>This is a small levy in comparison to the charges for managing pension funds; it is only0.6%.  At the moment, members of pension funds are being charged 1.5% for the management of funds that have lost money because of bad management over the years.  This is a four year temporary measure when we badly need investment in jobs.</P>
        <P>This jobs initiative is the first step.  I look forward to seeing increased employment and confidence in the economy and this is the first step in that direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the chance to speak on the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  First, however, I wish to express my sympathies to the family of the late Deputy Michael Bell, to Deputy Nash and his Labour Party colleagues.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin will take part in the tributes at a later stage.  On a happier note, I extend good wishes to my fellow county man, Senator Paddy Burke, on his election as Cathaoirleach of the Upper House and wish him well.</P>
        <P>I welcome the context surrounding the introduction of this Bill.  Despite the pleasant distractions of the Government over the past week, we are now back to reality.  Unemployment is <Col N="338"/>one of the major issues facing us.  It directly affects people on a day to day basis in a manner that micro-economic issues do not.  This Bill should be the start of a debate in these Houses on a focus on unemployment and how we tackle it.  The committees will be established next week and each committee will have a role to play in doing this, regardless of whether it has a direct input into an economic brief.  Each committee should be tasked upon establishment to identify areas within its brief that could create employment.  By doing so, the Oireachtas will show to those 440,000 people who are unemployed that we understand their situation and that we are taking it seriously.  The situation is dealt with on a daily basis in our clinics and we must, while dealing with each personal situation, deal with it at a macro level as well.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the jobs initiative and the accompanying Bill we are discussing today send a positive signal that we are taking these issues seriously and I welcome them.  I acknowledge Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s remarks on the practical difficulties on the implementation of the placements and related issues.  The Government, while in Opposition, spoke of the need to create a one-stop shop for benefits and everyone in the House would support such a measure.  There is equally a need for a one-stop shop for employers who are seeking to access some of the places announced in the jobs initiative or over the course of the last few years.  It is ridiculous but common that three different employment agencies must be consulted.  When we include the local employment service and various other wings of Government that must be involved in the creation of a place, it would put many employers off engaging.  I ask the Minister to look at the creation of a simple system to access these places.  Otherwise, we will be here again this time next year to discuss places that were not taken up or where funding was allocated for them but because of red tape they are still lying empty.</P>
        <P>While welcoming some aspects, I cannot ignore the difficulties we have with the Bill.  For me personally, many of those relate to the expectations that were created in advance of the launch of the employment initiative.  Before the election there were claims about the NewERA document and all that went with it by both parties.  The programme for Government contained more claims and promises about this issue.  The pension levy, however, has become the main focus of debate around the jobs initiative and that is unfortunate.</P>
        <P>The common response from the chorus-line opposite is that Fianna F&aacute;il is responsible for this, that Fianna F&aacute;il got us here and the Government&rsquo;s hands are tied.  That will get the Government through the next few months, undoubtedly, because that is the political climate, but it will run out of road with it because it was elected on the basis of promises made on employment creation, expenditure and taxation that it will have to deliver upon.  While it can throw that comment back at us, it cannot use it with the expert bodies.</P>
        <P>Deputy Nash criticised Eddie Hobbs and I agree; there are many in the commentariat who have made stars of themselves in recent years.  I see Deputy Mathews in the House and I give him credit for at least having the guts to put his name on a ballot paper and to come into this House to take responsibility for what he said before the election, unlike so many of those who appeared on panels with him, who did not have time to get ready for the election, but continue to lecture those of us who had the balls to put ourselves in front of the people and stand by the decisions we are taking.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>There are, however, people with greater inside knowledge than some of the commentariat and they are concerned about the pension levy.  Over many years, the political and financial systems have tried to encourage people to make provision for their pensions.  It was a shared, all-party decision to allow substantial and generous tax incentives in <Col N="339"/>this regard.  However, this decision was taken in the knowledge that the country is facing a pensions time bomb.  It was taken as an acknowledgement by the Oireachtas and Government that we had a responsibility to encourage people to provide for their pensions.</P>
        <P>However, the Government&rsquo;s proposal has undermined much of that work, whether intentionally or unintentionally.  Security and guarantees were offered with regard to pension provision.  Management fees and pension provisions were high and the performance of pensions has been disastrous for many people in the past number of years.  However, this was outside the Government remit as these were commercial issues and decisions in which neither the Government nor the political system had any input.</P>
        <P>This levy is a Government raid, an attack on what has been a suggested and agreed policy on the security of pension provision.  I do not doubt the Government&rsquo;s and in particular, the Minister&rsquo;s personal intentions that it is only a four-year, temporary levy.  I say that in the knowledge there are few more honourable people in this House than Deputy Noonan.  The Department of Finance has a different interpretation of the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; than the dictionary definition.  Over decades, many levies were introduced as temporary measures but which are still being levied on all our pay cheques to this day.  If we could align the definition of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> with the Department of Finance definition, I would be more reassured.  I acknowledge that the Minister has done that.</P>
        <P>The pensions time bomb is still in existence.  Those who work in the private sector today have had to make provision in order to be able to maintain their lifestyles in retirement.  This has been done in the face of losses which are beyond their control.  I fear that this levy will add to the sense of mistrust about pensions and to the attitude that somebody else will look after it, that we can live for the moment.  Unfortunately, circumstances for many people mean they cannot afford to make that provision.  We have undermined it with the introduction of this levy.</P>
        <P>The Society of Actuaries in Ireland could not be said to be a part of the celebrity commentariat.  The society has noted that these changes will have the cumulative effect that people will lose faith in the stability of the system and will lose the confidence to commit to future pensions savings.  I acknowledge the society has a vested interest because it represents actuaries and this is their day job but it will be the challenge for this and future Governments to restore confidence in our pension provisions.  This is a significant challenge but some smaller challenges may perhaps be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the initiatives for the tourism sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Deputy moves to speak on tourism, I wish to make a statement for the record of the House.  The Deputy made a comment in the spirit of the debate regarding the taking away of levies.  I know he did not personally mean anything by it but it is important to correct it by saying that Governments impose levies and take them away; the Civil Service do not do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the comment was made in the spirit of the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is the meaning and definition of the word, &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiatives for the tourism sector.  I have listened to some Deputies on the other side who were predicting that hundreds of thousands of tourists would come here on the back of the &euro;3 reduction in the air travel tax.  I more particularly welcome the initiative announced this morning by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar and the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, about what is termed &ldquo;staycations&rdquo;, the stay at home <Col N="340"/>vacations, a &euro;1 million initiative to encourage Irish people to holiday here.  However, when some airlines charge passengers &euro;40 to print an A4 sheet of paper or &euro;15 if one wishes to throw a plastic bag in the hold, I am a little sceptical about their ability to deliver extra passengers on the basis of a &euro;3 reduction in the air travel tax.</P>
        <P>I would be more confident about the ability of airlines to deliver extra passengers if the agreement to which the Government has referred had been done before the introduction of this Bill to the House.  The Government is committing to reach agreement with the airlines about a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  It has decided to reduce the air travel tax on a date to be agreed if the airlines promise to bring in more people into the country.  However, the legislation does not specify a date.  We are all familiar with regional airports and we all know that airlines make commitments and promises to bring in hundreds of thousands of passengers if they are given extra supports but they rarely live up to the expectation.  Fianna F&aacute;il will take the Government on trust.  I would ask the airlines flying into Ireland, in particular, Ryanair and Aer Lingus, as a gesture of faith in their ability to deliver on bringing in more tourists, to implement the &euro;3 reduction on airfares now, as a gesture of their faith in their ability to deliver on the fares.</P>
        <P>However, the airlines have moved on the debate to the subject of Dublin Airport Authority airport charges at Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.  We are well used to Michael O&rsquo;Leary rattling cages and cheerleading but when the chief executive officer of Aer Lingus becomes involved, it is time we all took notice.  Aer Lingus is the anchor tenant in Terminal 2.  It seems to me that the biggest challenge facing us in an attempt to persuade the airlines to engage with tourism promotion projects and to reduce the cost of bringing people into Ireland is the question of airport charges.  If a substantial reduction were to be offered this would raise issues about the viability of the DAA and the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</P>
        <P>We are tinkering at the edges with a &euro;3 reduction which I am not convinced will make any significant difference when the big elephant in the room is the need for us to completely reform the way we run our State airports.  Colm McCarthy in his report has highlighted some of these issues.  I do not have to tell Deputy Breen about them.  We should not be overly optimistic.</P>
        <P>I welcome the reduction of VAT in respect of certain goods and services.  I do not believe it will save money for consumers but it will give the message that we are cutting costs.  I am at a loss and it has not been explained to me how as an island nation we introduce a tourism initiative, reduce the rate of VAT on many tourism-based services but the cost of car hire has been deliberately excluded from the VAT reduction.  I ask the Minister if he could find a way of considering its inclusion in the initiative.  The United States and the United Kingdom are our key markets and tourists arriving by aeroplane need a car in order to get to the key tourist areas which we want to promote.  They will need a car to get out of the capital city &mdash; I mean no offence in saying that.  Our rates for car hire are already higher than our competitor markets by virtue of our general high cost base and because of the small size of our market.</P>
        <P>This initiative was an opportunity to make a direct attack on car hire which is one of the bigger costs of a holiday in Ireland but I am afraid that chance has been missed.  I suggest that on Committee Stage the Minister could explain the costing for including car hire in the initiative because I suspect it would be very small.  If the reduction were to be applied between now and the end of December it could be reviewed subsequently.</P>
        <P>I suggest that timing is important because this is when people are deciding on summer holidays.  The country has had a fantastic week with images of the visits of the Queen and President Obama broadcast around the world.  However, the imagery from Iceland in the past few days is not helpful because it may reinforce a decision to stay at home.  Now is the time to <Col N="341"/>reduce these costs so that when people are making travel and accommodation arrangements they will know that bookings after 1 July will benefit from all the reductions.  If we are to do something about the rates for car hire, it would be preferable for tourists to know that if bookings are made after 1 July they will benefit from the reduction.  This is why I ask the airlines to bring in the reductions now for those planning to travel to Ireland.</P>
        <P>This is an initiative aimed at tackling unemployment and as such is welcome.  One of the issues facing unemployed people is the difficulty in making their social welfare payments match the cost of living.  One of the biggest problems they face is the cost of fuel, which is going through the roof on a daily basis.  The Government continues to have an opportunity to reduce the 13% VAT rate that applies to fuel.  A decrease in fuel costs would make a difference to people&rsquo;s daily lives.  I ask the Government to show us how much it would cost the Exchequer if it were to reduce fuel costs by decreasing the rate of VAT on fuel.  How much would that cost in the context of the resources that are available?  The documentation that was provided on the day of the jobs initiative included target figures for the amount of money to be raised through the pension levy.  Although a great deal of money will be allocated to capital expenditure and various initiatives, not all of the money that will be collected under the levy will be spent.  I think there will be an underspend of approximately &euro;180 million.  If the money accrued from the pension levy is to be spent directly on the jobs initiative, as the Government has said it wants to do, that underspend will have to be addressed.  A number of areas could be suggested to that end.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative announcement did not refer to the work that is under way to transfer the trade functions of the Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The transfer has not happened because there has been a delay in bringing the delegation of powers measures before the House.  It suggests there is a problem.  Two and a half months have passed since the composition of the Government was announced, but the arrangements for transferring powers and functions have not yet come before the House.  I do not want to be the second Deputy in a day to be thrown out for complaining about the delegation of functions.  It is an issue.  I congratulate the Government on its decision to give trade functions to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Such cohesion is long overdue.  It will focus the trade section and the foreign affairs section.  If we do not do it quickly and ensure that our message is properly joined-up, it will lose its effectiveness.  Although our export sector is powering ahead and our international markets are doing very well, there is a danger we will get complacent and take it for granted that those markets will continue to do well and to demand our goods.  It is proper and right that we should focus on domestic issues, but we should not lose our focus on the export market.  We need to move ahead quickly.  I would like the Government to come before the House next week to introduce legislation providing for the proper reorganisation of Departments.  Two and a half months into the lifetime of the Government, it is only fair for us to expect such action to be taken.  It is necessary to allow everyone to focus on ensuring our export markets continue to perform strongly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the initiative and the spirit in which it was introduced.  The many omissions from the initiative are particularly disappointing for the public, however.  The expectations of the people were not created by Members on this side of the House nor by what happened before the election, but by Members on the other side of the House when they were in election mode and when they prepared the programme for Government.  However, I welcome the various additional capital initiatives that are to be pursued throughout the country.  Deputy Nash spoke about contracts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is directly responsible for this matter.  I reiterate my request for the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 to be advanced as a matter of urgency.  We need to give subcontractors some security when it comes to Government contracts.  The biggest jobs initiative we could adopt would involve guaranteeing Irish jobs to <Col N="342"/>Irish suppliers.  At this stage in our economic development, we should challenge things like EU procurement rules and ensure the money the Government has found and put aside for capital investment stays in this country.</P>

	<P>They are unhappy because of what has happened to our economy over the last couple of years.  They have given us a huge mandate to sort out the unholy mess that was made by the previous Government.  Some serious decisions will have to be taken on this side of the House.  We are ready for that challenge.  When Opposition Deputies speak, it is important for them to try to tell the truth.  They should understand they were also elected to try to help the people to get out of the mess this country is in.  Some ridiculous statements that were made in this House are quietly being put to rest as solid arguments against them are made by Ministers on this side of the House.  We will constantly face tough challenges over the next couple of years.  We will have to deal with them.</P>
        <P>It is important to continue to look for solutions to the problems we face.  A few weeks ago, the Master of the High Court said that if a Government Minister would meet him, he could draw up a solution to the problem of mortgage arrears on the back of an envelope.  I would be interested to know whether the Judiciary is prepared to use the Civil Liability Act 1961 to help people with mortgage arrears.  This legislation, which has been around since the early 1960s, allows the question of whether the banks were reckless in offering loans to be taken into account.  It has the potential to help people with mortgage arrears, but it has not been tested in the courts because nobody has taken a case to the point at which a member of the Judiciary could make a decision on it.  I would be interested to hear members of the Judiciary comment on that.  If this legislation can be used to show the banks were reckless to a certain degree, it might ensure that a degree of responsibility is placed on them.  The banks gave loans to people who are now being pursued through the courts to continue to make repayments.  We should seek answers from the Judiciary with regard to this legislation and ascertain whether they have any concerns about it.</P>
        <P>Members of the Irish Farmers Association are protesting in Dublin today about the margins being taken by multinational companies on farm produce.  I will not get into that debate now because I am sure it will arise during the Private Members&rsquo; debate later this evening.  It is interesting that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement raided the offices of the IFA to confiscate computers as part of its investigation into insider trading.  It astounds me that the same office is unable to get the passwords of some computers in Anglo Irish Bank.  That situation has been going on for a couple of years.  We need to try to get answers to questions of this nature on the floor of the House.  Why has the investigation into Anglo Irish Bank been dragging on for so long?  Why was the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, accompanied by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, able to threaten IFA staff who refused to hand over their computers with arrest and prosecution on suspicion of breaking competition law when, at the same time, that office has been unable to compel Anglo Irish Bank staff to provide the pass<Col N="343"/>words of laptops as part of its investigation into the greatest corporate scandal in the history of this State?  I would like answers to these questions.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I spoke in the House two weeks ago about the issue of burning bondholders.  Many Opposition Deputies have had a great deal to say on the matter.  The Government&rsquo;s position is that it is not really the way forward.  Two days after I spoke about the matter in the House, Professor Morgan Kelly argued in a newspaper article that we should default, basically, on over &euro;100 billion of State loans.  He made the consequences of such an approach quite clear.  He said that if we default, we will have to adjust next year&rsquo;s budget by &euro;20 billion because we will no longer be in a position to get any loans from anybody.  He said that in such circumstances, we will have to cut social welfare payments and public sector pay by a third, we will probably have to increase taxes and we will add such unpredictability to our economy that nobody will be sure where we are going.  I am surprised that Opposition Deputies have not commented on what Professor Kelly had to say.  Have they realised the idea of burning bondholders is a flawed policy that would land everyone in this country who is in trouble in a serious crisis?  When questions of this nature are thrown across the floor, it is sometimes useful to throw them back.  When Opposition Deputies are commenting on the Professor Kelly doctrine, which has been espoused by some of them since the day this Government was elected, perhaps they will explain its consequences for the people.</P>
        <P>This House needs to have a serious debate on the Croke Park agreement.  Significant portions of the agreement are expected to have been implemented by the beginning of September, which is 12 weeks away.</P>
      
        <P>If the political establishment, public servants and everyone else involved in providing services fail to co-operate on the implementation of the Croke Park agreement, it will result in a serious crisis.  As the International Monetary Fund has pointed out, if we do not make substantial progress in addressing our problems, it may unilaterally take difficult decisions on our behalf.  This should be the focus of our debates in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>This is straightforward legislation which includes a levy on pension funds.  It will be necessary to continue the debate on providing pensions for the vast majority of employees who do not have an occupational pension.  The value of my small, private pension has been decimated, not because a levy of 0.6% is to be imposed on it but because the fund managers made poor investment decisions.  Despite the value of many pension funds declining by between 20% and 50% in recent years, pension management companies continued to charge significant management fees.  These fees are not applied to the profits they make but to the total value of the fund and are far in excess of 0.6%, the level at which the Government levy has been set.</P>
        <P>Opposition spokespersons and pension fund managers argue that the proposed Government measures will create a crisis in pension funds.  It is the mismanagement of pension funds that will create the crisis.  The previous Government failed to address the excessive management fees charged by pension funds.  In its 14 years in power, it did not conclusively address the issue of providing pensions for citizens who do not have access to occupational pension funds, notwithstanding the many discussions in the House on White Papers and Green Papers on pension reform.  The House must continue to debate pensions and produce innovative solutions to ensure those who are fortunate enough to have a job can pay into a pension fund with confidence that it will be available to them when they retire.  Many of those who retire in the next five to ten years will not receive the level of pension they expected.  This has nothing to do with the 0.6% levy which is being introduced to try to rejuvenate the economy but the result of pension fund management.  This issue must be given serious consideration.  The Government will take on board any constructive proposals made by the Opposition.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>Only a few, short years ago, the annual interest repayments on the national debt amounted to less than &euro;1 billion.  Next November, the Vote in the budget for interest repayments on the national debt will be in excess of &euro;4 billion.  The difference between these figures would pay for many school places and hospital beds.  While many more difficult decisions will need to be made in future, the Government is prepared to make them while minimising the hurt and pain they cause to citizens.  That is what being a responsible Government is about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011.</P>
        <P>I grew in confidence with every word the Minister for Finance spoke yesterday evening.  He stated the economy is expected to return to growth this year following three years of recession.  This is partly due to our strong export performance.  Gross domestic product is forecast to grow by 0.75% in 2011 and 2.5% in 2012.  I welcome the increase in exports and it is significant that many multinational companies are performing well.  They must be nurtured and minded because they provide solid, stable employment.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative programme was designed to be cost neutral.  Over the period from 2011 to 2014, the total cost of the package of measures in terms of revenue foregone and expenditure amounts to &euro;1.8 billion.  The programme will be funded on a cost neutral basis to fulfil the commitments of the joint EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Funding will be generated from the application of a temporary levy on funded pension schemes, an issue on which many speakers have contributed.</P>
        <P>I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s statement last night that we are moving in the right direction.  The jobs initiative will add to public confidence.  It received a broad welcome from many interest groups when it was announced some weeks ago.  The programme for Government promised a jobs initiative programme in the first 100 days of government and we have lived up to that commitment.</P>
        <P>The visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama in the past week have created a feel-good factor and, above all, placed Ireland at the centre of the global stage following several years in which our international reputation has been tarnished.  The feel-good factor evident in Dublin and elsewhere, including Ennis and other parts of my constituency, will prove to be a major boost.  Tourist numbers will increase, especially the number of tourists from the United States, which it seems will be relatively good for July and August, and Britain.  Some of the measures included in the jobs programme will further boost tourism and jobs.  I commend the Minister on introducing these measures because tourism will play an important role in creating the environment in which economic recovery takes place.</P>
        <P>Unlike some of the finance Bills that are produced following budgets, this is a short Bill of only six sections.  It contains four key measures, namely, the research and development tax credit, suspension of the air travel tax, introduction of a second lower rate of VAT and imposition of a temporary pension levy.</P>
        <P>The Government has affirmed its commitment to maintain the 12.5% rate of corporation tax.  As the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Finance have stated, the corporation tax rate is not up for negotiation.  The Minister for Finance will meet the French Minister for Finance, Ms Christine Lagarde, today to discuss a number of issues, specifically a reduction in the interest rate for the EU-IMF bailout.  However, we will seek much more than a cut in the interest rate and I am sure the corporation tax rate will also be at the forefront of his mind.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement today that the Government is not seeking further time to repay its debts is a sign of confidence.</P><Col N="345"/>
        <P>I propose to discuss the details of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with the research and development tax credit.  This credit is important for industry and complements the corporation tax rate.  It has influenced the decisions of many international companies to locate in Ireland.  As I noted, multinational companies are making major strides in increasing exports and profits.  Many of them have been established in my own region of the mid-west, including Intel which has an outstanding research and development facility at its Shannon plant.  Intel will be developing products there for the next ten years.  It is a specific area but a very important R&amp;D plant nonetheless.</P>
        <P>Section 2 deals with the travel tax, which has been a contentious issue for the travelling public as well as the airlines since its introduction in 2009.  While airlines have more important issues on their mind at the moment with the ash cloud moving towards mainland Europe, they should take this matter seriously because they have been campaigning for its abolition for over two years.  They should work with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to create a plan to boost passenger numbers coming here, thus stimulating the tourism industry and creating jobs.</P>
        <P>Tourism has been hit badly in recent years but Ryanair, in particular, is well based to boost those figures.  The company&rsquo;s end-of-year accounts were published last week, showing that the airline carried 72 million passengers in Europe and made a massive profit of &euro;401 million last year.  As a successful Irish businessman, Michael O&rsquo;Leary should take the national interest on board and play his part in our economic recovery as he did during the Lisbon treaty campaign.  We all remember that famous debate he had with Declan Ganley on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; programme when he was campaigning for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary said then that Ireland&rsquo;s future success depended on being at the heart of Europe as a member of the EU.  It is important for him to think of Ireland&rsquo;s future now also.  Ireland is his base and Ryanair is an Irish airline, so there is an onus on him to boost tourism figures here.  Aer Lingus has a commitment in this respect as well.</P>
        <P>Section 3 is an important part of the Bill which amends the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 to reduce VAT from 13.5% to 9% in respect of certain goods and services mainly associated with the tourism industry to stimulate employment.  I hope that hotels, restaurants and other providers will take this great initiative on board and reduce costs accordingly.  Unfortunately, Ireland had a reputation of being an expensive holiday destination, but this is a golden opportunity for us to sell the country as a destination of better value.</P>
        <P>This week  in Dublin over 3,000 delegates are attending a world telecoms conference at the National Convention Centre, which will generate huge revenues for the capital city.  All hotels in the capital are booked out and this is happening straight after two State visits.  I am worried, however, that our rip-off culture still exists in hotels.  This week and last, hotels doubled their room prices due to the special events taking place.  That matter must be worked on.</P>
        <P>Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s genealogical programme and marketing campaign in the United States is important.  Deputy Calleary referred to car hire and asked why that was not included in the VAT decrease.  The bigger problem with car hire, however, is a shortage of vehicles rather than the VAT rate on such vehicles.  Many car hire operators went out of business during the period of office of Deputy Calleary&rsquo;s Government.</P>
        <P>All the measures in this Bill are welcome and will boost tourism.  We must also plan for 2012, which is important.  I had other things to say but I have run out of time.  However,  I know the Minister will consider constructive suggestions on Committee Stage.  I hope the Opposition will do so, too, so that the Bill will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="346"/>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>A previous speaker referred to the article by Professor Morgan Kelly and, in that respect, it is possible to agree with an individual&rsquo;s analysis without agreeing to whatever solution they may wish to provide.  There is often more than one way to provide a solution.</P>
        <P>With regard to the debate on the jobs initiative and the Finance Bill, some 30 minutes were used to ask questions at the end but only ten minutes were available for replies.  Unfortunately, however, we did not get answers to some of the questions posed.  It would be great if the Minister of State could provide such answers.</P>
        <P>One of the questions I wanted an answer to concerned whether or not the money being provided to finance the project is equitable.  I pointed to the fact that the pension levy is a flat tax and income blind.  The same rate will be applied to a person on &euro;40,000 as to someone earning &euro;500,000 and paying into the pension fund.  A person who is struggling financially will have the same rate applied to them as a rich and powerful figure.  Under the Government&rsquo;s system, many people at the top of the pensions pyramid may get away scot-free.  Those on the bottom, however, will incur a higher imposition of this levy.  It mirrors the impact of the universal social charge or USC, whereby those earning over &euro;75,000 had the incidence of taxation reduced, while those below that figure had it increased.</P>
        <P>I also asked about defined contributions and benefits.  Will there be a difference in the incidence of this taxation between those two groups?  Some people may pay as much as &euro;2,000 over the period of the new tax, while others will pay nothing.  Most families are trying to get by from day to day, as well as forecasting the money they will be surviving on in future.  It is important that they should have some idea of how much it will cost them.  We asked the Minister how much will be charged to each of those sectors.  The Minister did not answer those questions but perhaps he did not have the information on the day.  It would be interesting, however, if those questions could be answered in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>Excellent.  In that way, people will be in the know.  At that time, the Minister responded with another question which I will paraphrase.  He asked whether there was any type of tax that people actually liked.  I suggested there are taxes that people are willing to pay, such as a progressive tax.  With the latter system, the rate of tax increases on the amount that is taxable.  Thus, the incidence of taxation is lower on those with low incomes, but is much higher for those with a greater ability to pay.  It is not a new idea and has been around since the 18th century.  It is a tax that is universally recognised as the best way of imposing taxation on people but, unfortunately, it is not the ideology that is currently being used by Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  The continuation of the USC is an example of a regressive taxation system, as is the pension levy.  In addition, the Government&rsquo;s proposed property tax and water tax are all flat taxes which have a regressive impact on those paying them.  Why is it so difficult to convince the Government of the importance of having progressive taxation, when it is such a universally understood and accepted tenet of tax?</P>
        <P>We also have difficulties with the meagreness of proposals concerning the jobs initiative and the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  Some 440,000 people are unemployed while 50,000 are emigrating annually.  The latter figure is akin to the number of students sitting the leaving certificate examination each year.  It is shocking that so many individuals are forced to leave the country.  Emigration has been a gaping sore in Irish society since the Famine.  In many ways it could be said that emigration is the curse of the Irish.  Thanks to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s gross economic mismanagement and the continuation of a policy of retrenchment by Fine Gael and Labour, more than 500,000 people have been made unemployed or forced to emigrate.</P><Col N="347"/>
        <P>This issue is of such magnitude that it demands a significant response.  It demands a Keynesian-type stimulus, something similar to what was on the lips of Fine Gael and Labour Deputies during the election campaign, yet we have been given a shockingly damp squib.  It is sad that, despite the number of possibilities presented to the Government to improve the situation, it has said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Many sectors of society feel let down that they were ignored in the jobs initiative.  I have spoken with farmers and those involved in the agrifood sector who are disappointed that their sector was ignored.  Let us walk through the different sectors that have been ignored &mdash; ICT, health and life sciences, financial services, creative industries, marine, medical services, education, transport, logistics and distribution.  They have all been left out of the jobs initiative.  One would imagine that two parties that have been in opposition for 14 years would have had time to develop comprehensive plans for these areas so that they could hit the ground running in terms of implementation.  Unfortunately, this has not been the case.</P>
        <P>I have been raising the issue of reform of the enterprise sector since being elected.  It should have been a pillar of the jobs initiative.  Last week, I was telephoned by a woman from the west who was interested in setting up a food company.  She has knowledge, experience and drive.  She needs a small helping hand from the State to carry out a feasibility study.  She applied to her county enterprise board for a small grant of approximately &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000, which would allow her to conduct studies of the product, whether it would last on shelves, whether it passed certain sales regulations, etc.  She was denied the money because the board told her it had none left for the year.  Bear in mind that we are in May.  An individual who wanted to set up an indigenous business to create indigenous jobs was told &ldquo;No&rdquo; by the Government.</P>
        <P>This is not the only type of grant that has been exhausted by many county enterprise boards.  For example, an employment grant normally amounts to &euro;10,000 and is applied for twice per year, that is, &euro;5,000 after the first application and &euro;5,000 six months later.  Its purpose is to allow the applicant to employ someone new or take himself or herself off social welfare and to develop a new business.  Consider the economics behind this grant.  After eight months or so of social welfare savings and PRSI and tax contributions, the grant pays for itself.  However, individuals looking for it from some county enterprise boards are being told no money is available.  This is a shocking indictment of the enterprise development sector.</P>
        <P>Many of the Members opposite will have spoken to the hundreds and thousands of small businesses throughout the State that are in dire need of micro finance.  In many cases, credit unions have deposits that could be reasonably, well and safely transferred into micro credit for business.  Some of the county enterprise boards launched similar campaigns a number of months ago whereby they would work hand in hand with the credit unions to develop the micro credit sector.  However, they are no longer being allowed to do so.  Again, the State has said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Opportunities for indigenous jobs arise every day, but they are being ignored by the State.</P>
        <P>When I asked the Minister how many jobs the initiative would create, he might have been wise when he refused to give the number.  Neither he nor the Deputies os mo chomhair were shy before the election when they stated they would create 100,000 jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  &ldquo;Could&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting that the mitigating word &ldquo;Could&rdquo; is being underlined.  Unfortunately, it was not underlined enough prior to the election.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It was.  I wrote it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeadarToibin"><NameTxt>Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</NameTxt>
	<P>It also stands in stark contrast to some of the communications being sent by a number of Deputies.  Straight after the announcement of the jobs initiative, Fine Gael <Col N="348"/>and Labour Deputies ran back to their constituents.  Some local newspapers are festooned with headlines about the thousands of jobs coming to Meath, Offaly and Mayo.  Somewhere along the line, the truth is either not being told by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, or by the Deputies speaking with their constituents.  There is a blatant disparity between the facts provided in the Chamber.</P>
        <P>What the Deputies did not say was that many of the new jobs and funds will come from existing schemes.  Many of the jobs will only be created for a period of two or three months.  In many cases, Peter&rsquo;s job is being robbed to employ Paul.  The Deputies did not mention in their press statements that the actual number of additional jobs contained in the document is approximately 400.  They did not mention that, in the jaws of the most devastating recession ever faced by the State, the initiative will only add 15 jobs in a county like Meath, for example.  The comparison between need and provision is shocking.</P>
        <P>According to the ESRI&rsquo;s figures, 500 young people emigrate every four days.  The jobs initiative will stop four days of emigration.  For the rest of the year, it will be business as usual.  The jobs initiative is a PR initiative virtually free of substance.  It momentarily raised the hopes of hundreds of thousands of people and quickly dashed them.  For this reason, the jobs initiative is contemptible.  In recent weeks, I have spoken to a large number of enterprise organisations and community groups.  Their muted welcome to the document was in desperate hope rather than in confidence.  Enterprise organisations are putting on a brave face in an effort to buoy expectations in the market.</P>
        <P>The Minister has told us there is no other option and that the straitjacket of austerity bequeathed to the Government by the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government stops any movement.  I would suggest that the strictures are self-imposed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has identified &euro;2 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, that could be used as a kick start to the economy.  The Government has told us it has no room to manoeuvre and that Europe will prevent anything else, but there is a compulsive desire on the Fine Gael and Labour benches to prove themselves to be the best Europeans in the class.  Sometimes, it is difficult to know whether the parties opposite are working in Ireland&rsquo;s interests or in the interests of Europe.  Are they on the side of the core European countries?  I will provide a number of examples to prove this point.  Fine Gael and Labour forget that being pro-European does not mean slavishly following the core European states.  Rather, it means creating a sustainable Europe that promotes the interests of the core and periphery and does not pit them against each other.</P>
        <P>Today is a case in point.  Deputy Breen informed the House that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, will meet the French Minister, Ms Christine Lagarde, who has just announced that she is seeking the position of the managing director of the IMF.  She vigorously opposed a reduction in the exorbitant interest rate being forced on Ireland.  This interest rate is pushing Ireland off the default cliff.  Ms Lagarde has also said Ireland should increase its corporation tax rate.  Many within the foreign direct investment sector have said that this corporation tax rate is a key competitive advantage for the State, and any change in it will cause major unemployment.  It is mind-boggling that the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has said, despite this, that she believes Ms Lagarde would be an &ldquo;excellent candidate&rdquo;.  She stated: &ldquo;[S]he&rsquo;s eminently qualified, and if she&rsquo;s nominated, we&rsquo;re likely to support her&rdquo;.  She is suggesting that we support a candidate who is working contrary to Ireland&rsquo;s interests and whose interests are incongruent with ours.  If Fine Gael and the Labour Party support this individual in seeking that position, they are themselves working contrary to Irish interests.</P>
        <P>It is time the Government woke up to the harsh reality that the interests of the core European states are not necessarily ours.  If there is a gap between the interests of Ireland and those of the core European states, the Government is mandated to support our interests in Ireland. <Col N="349"/> Over the last three years, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have implemented unprecedented austerity measures at the behest of the core European nations and the ECB.  This has caused massive pain to the weakest in society.  It has reduced the effectiveness of our health service and education system and pushed more than half a million people into unemployment and emigration.  The austerity measures have caused our economy to flatline.  The supposed goal of bringing down our bond interest rates has not actually happened.  Returning to the bond markets before 2012 under the current policies would be very difficult.</P>
        <P>This jobs initiative, and the accompanying Finance Bill, is a child of these failed policies.  As a result, they will effect little if any long-term mitigation of the core problems in Irish society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Despite the financial straitjacket that has been placed on us by the IMF, the Government has set out a targeted support scheme for the lower paid, the unemployed and the tourism sector.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n was critical of the lukewarm responses of some organisations outside the House to the jobs initiative.  I remind him that the Irish Hotels Federation hailed the announcement as one of the most comprehensive policy initiatives supporting the tourism industry in the past decade.  It is clear that the measures taken under this initiative &mdash; including a reduction in VAT on a variety of accommodation, catering and entertainment services, the abolition of the airport tax, the reform of visa requirements, and the halving of PRSI, along with the joint marketing initiative between Tourism Ireland, the Dublin Airport Authority and the airlines &mdash; will have a significant positive impact on inward tourism.</P>
        <P>Anyone from any part of the world or from this country could not but agree that the Government was correct in its decision to focus resources on the tourism sector based on the high profile visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama, which will have a significant positive impact, in both the short and medium term, on people&rsquo;s perceptions of the attractiveness of Ireland and on the inward movement of people to this country.  The Government&rsquo;s support of visitor businesses and tourism will increase job opportunities, not only on a seasonal basis but all year round.  Some people are criticising the fact that jobs will be created on a seasonal basis, but it is important to recognise that there are many thousands of people, especially young people, who need work during the summer months to pay for their third level education.  Many of them have not had the opportunity to do that, and seasonal work is very important to them.  It is also important for those who are unemployed.  Many people I know would be delighted to have an opportunity of two or three weeks&rsquo; work, never mind three or four months.  Any seasonal opportunity or full-time labour is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
        <P>The economic regeneration of this country must start with tourism, and I believe it will.  The major visits that have happened over the past ten days are the first step towards enhancing our tourism package.  The groundwork has been done.  However, it is just the beginning.  Much more work needs to be done, especially in the counties I represent, Leitrim and Roscommon.  There is major untapped tourism potential in both counties, which needs to be developed.  We should not consider tourism purely from a west coast point of view; we should not just accept that once one leaves Dublin, the scenery on the west coast is the tourism package.  There is a lot of potential in the midland and peripheral counties, and it is important they are not ignored.  One significant step that could be taken is the use of the River Shannon as an asset.  It is potentially a major asset for tourism in this country, but at the moment it is the dividing line between all the tourism regions, so that instead of focusing our resources on the river, we are focusing them away from it.  It is about time Tourism Ireland and the development agencies woke up to this fact and used the River Shannon as an asset.   We must develop the tourism potential of counties such as Leitrim and Roscommon, which have unspoilt beauty.</P><Col N="350"/>
        <P>We should maximise the use of Ireland West Airport in Knock, which can bring tourists directly into the region, as well as developing the cross-Border aspect of tourism.  We must facilitate tourists who visit Northern Ireland in coming south of the Border and those who visit Ireland in going north of the Border.  The announcement made by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about the tourism initiative has been underestimated.  The single decision to introduce short-term visas allowing people to travel across the Border &mdash; something I raised in this House on numerous occasions with the previous Government &mdash; will have a significant impact in terms of bringing tourists into this jurisdiction and developing cross-Border tourism.  For that reason, if for no other, Members on the opposite side should welcome the initiative.  Much more needs to be done about visa issues.</P>
        <P>We also need to address the clustering of attractions in counties and regions.  The less developed counties include Leitrim, which I believe should be developed as a county of culture.  It has many assets, including people that are known both nationally and internationally.  There is major potential to develop heritage tourism in Roscommon, which has been overlooked by the tourist industry.  My county was formerly the capital of Connacht, having been home to the kings of Connacht and the High Kings of Ireland.  Among its attractions are the Napoleonic fortifications, King House and the Cistercian Abbey in Boyle and Strokestown Park House, where the Famine Museum is located.  I could provide a list of many more places of interest.  However, the point I wish to make is that the counties which have been less developed up to now or which have been ignored by the tourism industry have some major assets.  We must assess these assets in order that we might market them.  I have already outlined the position with regard to heritage tourism in County Roscommon.  I am of the opinion that Roscommon should be marketed as a heritage county because doing so could make it distinctive from other parts of the country.  The position is similar with regard to County Leitrim, particularly in the context of arts and culture.  The latter has a significant reputation, both nationally and internationally, in this regard.  County Leitrim and its attractions should be developed, enhanced and marketed properly.</P>
        <P>Instead of ignoring counties in the midlands and those which are less well developed we should seek to use them.  If we could encourage tourists who arrive in Dublin Airport and then travel on to the west to stop off on their journey and spend one night in one of these counties, it would have a dramatic impact in the context of bed nights and bed numbers and also the overall spin-off for local economies.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the issue of the holiday visa waiver scheme.  This is an extremely positive mechanism which has been introduced by the Government.  I hope the latter will also consider the position with regard to student visas.  Again, there is major potential in the context of developing that sector which could possibly bring an extra &euro;1 billion into the economy if dealt with in the proper way.  It is important that the requisite checks and balances be put in place.  If there is proper co-ordination between Tourism Ireland and the Departments of Justice and Equality and Education and Skills we can ensure that there will be an extremely effective and secure regime in place which will make Ireland attractive to the sector in question.</P>
        <P>We have built up a major reputation in respect of education over a long period.  We should now be in a position to pass on what we have learned.  Students who want to come here to learn English or to appropriate the technological skills their counterparts in this country already possess should be able to do so.  The route we must take should involve building on our assets and on what we do best.  We can then, based on this, concentrate on developing our economy.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have a particular message to deliver to the Deputy at that point.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011.  I will deal first with the measures it contains.  The jobs initiative announced by the Government does not contain a promise to deliver a large-scale plan.  We are restricted in that regard by the terms of the deal with the EU and the IMF.  As with the Bible story of the loaves and the fishes, the Bill brings forward measures which are very practical in nature and which will, in my view, an exponential impact on business in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Contained in section 1 is a change in the research and development tax credit which will place it on an above-the-line basis.  This will have a major impact on multinational companies coming to Ireland.  It is a simple measure but it will have an enormous effect.</P>
        <P>The air travel tax acted as an impediment in the context of flights coming into this country.  For the mid-west and for Limerick in particular, Shannon Airport is a vital part of local and regional infrastructure.  To ordinary people it may appear that the air travel tax brought in a great deal of money, namely, &euro;100 million.  However, there is no doubt that it had a massively negative impact.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will now have at his disposal the tools to allow him to abolish this tax.  He is proceeding in that regard by obliging the airlines to bring in additional flights in return for its abolition.  That is the type of governance which appeals to me because it seeks to obtain value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>I accept that in the context of the VAT rate which applies to the tourism industry, there might have been an argument to also reduce the 13.5% rate in the areas where it applies.  However, the reduction is targeted at the tourism sector, which is underperforming.  The number of tourists visiting the country has fallen by 25% since 2007.  For the mid-west and Limerick, tourism is vital.  It is responsible for bringing visitors to the region and for filling beds in hotels, guesthouses, etc.  Coupled with the abolition of the air travel tax, the reduction in the rate of VAT that applies to tourism will have a massive effect.</P>
        <P>Deputy Naughten referred to short-term visas.  Again, what is proposed is integrated into the area of tourism.  This will have a huge impact in terms of confidence etc.  Ireland is now a country where people believe things can happen.  That is certainly true but practical measures must be put in place.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not deal directly with it but I am of the view that the loan guarantee scheme will have an enormous bearing on people&rsquo;s confidence.  Small business is the lifeblood of this country in the context of the contribution it makes to the Exchequer and with regard to the employment it creates.  If a person in business requires an extra overdraft facility of &euro;10,000, the banks being unwilling to take a risk on him or her may determine whether jobs are retained.  It is in cases such as this that the loan guarantee will come into play.</P>
        <P>In summary, the mid-west region is heavily dependent on tourism and the multinational sector.  The change to the research and development tax credit, which will make it possible to <Col N="352"/>reflect it above the line, will be crucial to the latter and the abolition of the air travel tax and the reduction in the rate of VAT which applies to the tourism sector will bring people to the region.</P>
        <P>In the context of the EU-IMF deal, there have been discussion regarding the 1% reduction we are seeking in respect of the rate of interest we are being charged.  Such a reduction would have given the Government an additional &euro;400 million to spend on the creation of extra jobs.  A number of measures are required so that we might move forward.  The first of these is a reduction in the interest rate.  The second is the need to obtain funding from the European Central Bank in the medium term.  The latter is vital.</P>
        <P>There are two major aspects to the Stability and Growth Pact, which was put in place before the introduction of the euro.  The first of these is the fact that a country&rsquo;s annual budget deficit can be no more than 3% of GDP and that its total national debt can be no more than 60% of GDP.  These parameters were drawn up against the backdrop of the introduction of the euro, when it was obvious that there would be a significant reduction in the interest rates paid by countries such as Ireland.  A measure designed to deal with the growth in credit that was about to occur should have been build into the Stability and Growth Pact.  It was clear that there would be an increase in the level of credit available to countries such as Ireland on foot of the significant drop in the rates of interest they would be obliged to pay.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that Germany and France breached the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact in the early 2000s.  At that time, Germany and France were restructuring their deficits.  Both countries should be aware of the mammoth task that Ireland now faces in restructuring its deficit.  Responsibility on a European-wide basis must be shared for the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact did not cater for the growth in credit.  In hindsight, measures should have been put in place to deal with it.  In the past, Ireland did not breach deficit rules such as the ratio of the annual government deficit to gross domestic product not to exceed 3% or the ratio of gross government debt to gross domestic product not to exceed 60%.  However, a massive growth in credit, particularly in the property sector, was going in under the radar and which was clearly a recipe for disaster.  It is critical that other EU member states are aware there must be a European-wide solution to this problem.  As the IMF stated, they must realise that to enable Ireland to deal with its difficulties, it must be given an interest rate reduction and guaranteed medium-term funding from the European Central Bank.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative in the Finance (No. 2) Bill is a start in the process of Ireland tackling its economic difficulties.  An entrepreneurial culture must be fostered in this country.  Having been self-employed for 12 years, I know it is the key ingredient to economic recovery.  The jobs initiative is enterprise orientated with the reduction in the VAT rate and the provision of a microfund and a loan guarantee scheme.  We must encourage more people to set up self-employed businesses.  In other countries, even those that fail are admired.  Many multinational companies like to take on individuals from such a background.</P>
        <P>Measures in the Finance (No. 2) Bill will foster an enterprise culture and begin to grow confidence again in the economy.  They will ensure the reward of the country coming out of recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill is very much in line with expectations based on the jobs initiative announced in the House recently.  The Bill effectively gives the technical details required to give effect to the jobs initiative.  It has been debated as to whether the jobs initiative can be considered an attack on private pension funds.  There will be an opportunity to debate it in more detail on Committee Stage.</P><Col N="353"/>
        <P>I hope, however, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance will accede to Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s request to publish the advices they received relating to overall pensions policy.  We are all concerned about the long-term viability of and the deficits in many of these funds.  It would seem bizarre the Government would seek to undermine the financial stability of these funds.  Accordingly, it is important the advice the Government received is published, perhaps on Committee Stage.  It would give all Members an opportunity to decide whether the pension levy is the most appropriate way to raise the jobs initiative funding, which in the end is a rather modest stimulus to the economy.</P>
        <P>I welcome this stimulus and any measures that might ultimately re-ignite a level of activity in the economy.  However, the initiative falls far short of what was promised prior and during the general election campaign.  Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell stated the Bill was relatively modest and did not seek targets for job creation.  On February 23, Fine Gael, however, promised to publish a jobs budget within 100 days of going into government which would result in the creation of 100,000 jobs by 2015.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs told the House on 6 April:</P>
        <P LI="1">The totality of the Government&rsquo;s economic programme is aimed at the creation of jobs.  The jobs budget will be introduced in the month of May.  The detail of how many jobs it is intended to support and the precise measures to provide and support the provision of jobs will be contained in that Budget Statement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are some of the expectations that have been created.  I do not want to refight the general election on the floor of the House.  I accept we lost the election and the Government has the support of the people in its difficult endeavour.  However, it would be nice if it recognised it has changed its stance and, maybe, leaped ahead too liberally in the election campaign.  It should set targets that are more realisable.  After the election, there is an expectation among the public that the Government has a magic wand to resolve this economic morass.  It would be a good start if it were more honest and upfront about the speed by which recovery can be achieved.</P>
        <P>While there is some potential with the measures contained in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, it is also a gamble.  The potential impact the levy on private pension funds will have on their viability might outweigh the amount it will raise which may well be only a thin spread of funding across certain sectors, particularly tourism.</P>
        <P>As tourism spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, I know how much the sector has the potential to get the economy back on track.  Our loss of competitiveness, however, has impacted on our capacity to compete internationally for tourists.  Notwithstanding that, I cannot see how the reduction of the VAT rate for the sector is enough to have a meaningful impact on Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness to tourists.  The Government has proposed the 9% rate will apply mainly to restaurant and catering services and areas such as museums and art gallery exhibitions, fairgrounds or amusement park services, hairdressing services, printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues, magazines and newspapers.  I am not sure how a VAT reduction in newspapers and magazines will resolve our economic problems.  Another example is in eating out where this reduction will result in a reduction of &euro;2 for an early bird meal for two that comes to &euro;50.  That would not buy one cup of tea, let alone two.  How many times would a visiting couple have to eat out to save the price of a full meal?  That is how people view these types of measures and I am not sure if it will re-ignite activity in this sector.  I hope, however, it will have some impact.  The abolition of the travel tax has potential.  The introduction of the travel tax became something which was being positioned against us by the airlines.  Often, perception becomes the reality.  One particular airline has a tendency to utilise the media in an effective manner, often engaging in a greying of the facts in an effort to spin the message <Col N="354"/>that the travel tax was somehow the cause of the drop in passenger numbers.  The drop in passenger numbers out of and into Ireland during the past two years has been largely as a result of the downturn in the economy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>During the boom years from 2005 to 2007, activity at our airports was very strong.  However, when one analyses more closely the figures in this regard one finds that much of that traffic was Irish people travelling abroad on short breaks and so on, which was a change in pattern of vacation.  When one analyses the figures to an even greater extent one finds that approximately 80% were Irish originating passengers and 20% were inbound.  I accept that when flights are no longer operational because that 80% of passengers, or a percentage of them, are not travelling there is a corresponding reduction in inbound travel.  It has been suggested that the abolition of the travel tax will recreate activity.  I am not sure it will.  I do not believe Irish people are ready or have the wherewithal to recommence travelling, which is, perhaps, not bad a thing.  Perhaps we need to be promoting the notionof staycations which would encourage people to remain at home and spend whatever limited money they have here.</P>
     <P>As regards Shannon &mdash; Deputies O&rsquo;Sullivan and O&rsquo;Donnell will be familiar with what happens in the Shannon region &mdash; I have always believed that any truthful and detailed economic analysis of the region would have found that the activity of a particular airline had not benefited the region during the boom years as much as some people thought.  I believe it was a drain on the resources of the region at a time when people travelled more freely, had more money and ready access out of the country to sunnier locations.  It is often stated that access to sunny destinations is of benefit to the region.  However, all it does is take Irish money out of the country.  Ryanair has been particularly good at promoting this.  I ask the Minister for Finance and, in particular, the Minister for Transport, to be mindful of this in entering into discussions about the reduction of charges at airports, which I accept are important and need to be balanced.</P>
        <P>Airlines must come to the table with a better presentation in terms of how they manage their charges.  There exists a smokescreen to present all the charges as somehow being those levied either by way of tax or landing or other general charges, which ultimately is money needed to pay for the management of the infrastructure, to ensure the airports are kept up to standard and to pay staff working there.  There is a considerable amount of work to be done in this area to assist the tourism sector.  However, it would be wide of the mark to believe the tourism issue would be resolved by a reduction in the VAT rate and the abolition of the travel tax.  That will not happen because the bulk of activity at our airports was outbound.</P>
        <P>From a tourism perspective, we must be far more imaginative and must look to the attractions we have.  Competitiveness is essential but at the end of the day people come to Ireland for a particular purpose.  That purpose has changed.  I listened with interest to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s contribution.  I acknowledge that some people come here for heritage and genealogical reasons and I have no doubt more will do so as a result of the visit of President Obama and his wife in the past couple of days.  There was a similar surge in this regard when former Presidents Regan, Kennedy and Clinton &mdash; President Nixon to a lesser degree &mdash; visited Ireland.  Notwithstanding this, there are peaks and troughs in activity.  We must concentrate on our nearest neighbour &mdash; the recent visit of Queen Elizabeth II will be helpful in this regard &mdash; and on the European market.  We must tailor our product.  No longer will people come here because we have lakes, green hills and other folksy types of things.  They were an offering for a different time.  We must be much more imaginative in terms of developing a product.  While Irish music is an important product we must ensure we do not fall behind because we are not providing for families in particular, in respect of whom we have given up the market.  We have ceded this <Col N="355"/>sector to the sun destinations.  Not every family wants to go to a sun destination but they do want facilities appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>There is a role for Government in terms of bringing innovation to our tourism product.  Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell will be familiar with the late Mr. Brendan O&rsquo;Regan who was the brainchild behind the mid-western Shannon region.  Often, too much emphasis is placed on the airport because it is the access point.  People came through the airport for a reason.  The folk park developed through Mr. O&rsquo;Regan&rsquo;s ingenuity, the Cliffs of Moher, Adare and so on were products of their time and were very successful.  However, it is time we came up with something to operate in parallel with them.  We need to find the new Brendan O&rsquo;Regan and to bring a level of competition to tourism on a regional basis.  We must encourage regions to compete for funding for iconic projects.  The Cliffs of Moher in County Clare is one such project into which we all put a great deal of effort in terms of ensuring it received appropriate funding to upgrade its facilities.  The State and European Union invested some &euro;30 million in that project.  While it has been of much benefit to those who visited it, it has not resulted in an increase in numbers.</P>
    
     
        <P Just="Left">We need to look to new ideas and to invest money in the creation of the next wave of products and attractions, which will be a hard task.  Often governments &mdash; this is true also of my party when in government &mdash; believe such tasks are for the industry, that it need only create the environment for job creation and others should come up with the ideas.  However, we must provide a stimulus to encourage people to come up with ideas and must ensure such ideas are supported.  We have seen the benefit and potential of the convention centre.  It is an iconic project which is heavily funded by the State and will have true potential in time.  We need to come up with similar projects outside the Dublin region.  The mid-west, because it has the infrastructure, is well positioned in this regard.  However, I do not wish to be parochial when speaking about such an important matter.  I am concerned that money is being spread too thinly and I am not sure it will have the impact suggested.  I hope there will be some benefit.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum refers to the 9% VAT rate applying to sporting facilities, in respect of which there is an anomaly.  A European Court of Justice judgment found against Ireland in regard to the manner in which VAT is collected from public versus private bodies, including in respect of parking, leisure facilities and so on.  There has been much toing and froing on this issue, including when Deputy Brian Lenihan was Minister for Finance.  This relates to section 117(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Finance Act 2010 which was not commenced because the then Minister ordered a review of the legislation which was enacted to satisfy the ECJ judgment.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce has made a submission to the Minister for Finance on the jobs initiative in which it requests that consideration be given to the unfair competition by VAT exempt bodies to deal with the outcome of the European Court of Justice judgment which was taken against Ireland by the Commission.  It further states that this matter needs to be considered in the context of the unfair competition &ldquo;by local authorities and other VAT exempt public bodies&rdquo;.  It is an issue which is particularly acute in the leisure industry, where the failure to charge VAT on non-core activities resulted in predatory pricing by VAT exempt bodies.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce believes urgent attention should be given to the creation of a level playing field for public and private sector bodies competing for the same market, not only in order to engender fair competition but also to ensure Ireland is fully compliant with its obligations under EU law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That has an impact on private operators providing services in the leisure sector where they compete with publicly funded bodies.  For example, there are a number of privately operated five-a-side soccer pitches.  Private operators have funded their own operations but are competing with universities and local GAA and soccer clubs which have been funded through capital investment under the sports capital programme.  A private operator, who has funded his operation, must pay VAT while our friends in the clubs and societies, the bulk of whose capital <Col N="356"/>funding is provided by the State, do not return VAT.  This is creating a disparity, and the European Court of Justice found it to be unfair.  The unfairness also applies to parking and other services.  An element of this judgment awaits commencement.  It is in the Finance Act 2010 but has not been commenced.  I ask the Minister for Finance to give consideration to the commencement of that section as part of the jobs initiative.  He was quite vocal on this issue himself when, in a parliamentary question on 19 October 2010, he asked the then Minister if he would commence that section.  I may be overstating Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s position.  He asked when the ministerial order regarding the leisure sector, arising from section 117 of the Finance Act, would be commenced.  I ask the Minister to deal with this issue in his later remarks.</P>
        <P>Prior to the general election, the parties now in government made much of the necessity to deal with upward-only rent reviews for existing leases.  I am anxious that this be dealt with.  I was concerned about this issue myself at the time.  The advice from the Attorney General was that the issue moved into the area of property rights and involved constitutional matters.  At least one of the parties in opposition at that time had received a legal opinion that would give support to its case that the matter could be revisited.  It would be nice to see that legal advice brought into effect, if it is still available, as early as possible.  Could it be presented by way of legislation, either as an amendment to this Bill or in some other Bill?</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that appropriate funding is put in place to deal with our regional airports.  There are concerns about the operation and capital expenditure of our regional airports, which are important from a tourism and business perspective.  Much of this initiative is about keeping business in place and assisting tourism.  Regional airports are not always widely used for tourism but they are an important feature in support of business.  In places like Galway, Kerry and Donegal there is an effort to generate some level of economic activity.  The links between Dublin Airport and those regions are vital.  We need to ensure they have the appropriate funding to be able to operate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill for a number of reasons.  It is the first step taken by the Government, as promised during the course of the general election and in the programme for Government, to introduce a jobs initiative.  There have been many inquiries about what the jobs initiative would entail.  I was adamant that it should be positive.  I am sure everyone in this House felt similarly.</P>
        <P>The Bill is positive.  It touches the most important aspects of our society, with particular reference to our economic society.  If we do not regenerate growth in our economy and encourage employment creation we will not go anywhere.  We are in a deep recession and a difficult position.  We cannot wish it away.  It will not go away.  We must work our way out of it.  We must work harder for longer and for less, as you and I know, a Chathaoirligh.  This is difficult but that is how it is.</P>
        <P>Sacrifices must be made.  The Bill imposes sacrifices on people.  Of course people do not welcome that.  They could not do so.  The situation we are in is not one we would wish upon ourselves.  It has come upon us.  I am not about to blame the Opposition for the situation.  I simply say it is there now and we must deal with it.  The Government must deal with it in the only way it can.  That is by introducing measures that are calculated, strategic and will impact positively on our domestic economy and in the wider economy throughout Europe.</P>
        <P>I have listened to many speakers over the past few days asking why the Government did not do X, Y or Z or why it did not spend more money.  Do people not understand that there is no money available?  The country is borrowed up to the hilt.  It is all gone.  It is spent.  What happens when you bet on a racehorse?  As you and I well know, a Chathaoirligh, if the horse wins you have money in your pocket but if the horse loses you have an empty pocket or a hole <Col N="357"/>in your pocket.  Unfortunately, we now have a massive hole in our pockets.  All the people of the country must put their shoulders to the wheel and do the things that must be done to bring about a change.</P>
        <P>We must also restore confidence in our position internationally.  There is no good saying we are great guys.  We all said that during the boom times of the Celtic tiger.  We were great guys.  We were the richest country in the world.  Do Members remember when we were the second or third richest country in the world?  Where were we going?  What were we thinking about?  We were not the richest country in the world.  However, we are good, and if we do the things we know well and do them better, we will be good again.  We will not be lectured to by anyone or subordinated to anyone.  We know our obligations.  They are before us and graphically presented to us.  If we do not stand up to them our credibility is at stake.</P>
        <P>Our credibility may be questioned in the way the Celtic tiger was allowed to boom on.  We all know that after every boom there is a bust.  The famous roaring twenties were followed by the hungry thirties.  After the boom came bust.  It has always been the same.  Ask any householder.  If you spend your money unwisely you will pay the price.  Do we have the grit to pay the price?  I believe we have.  I believe the Government is doing the right thing.</P>
        <P>The Minister set out the sections of the Bill.  Research and development are hugely important at this time.  We must use innovation and technology to advance in the areas we are good at.  This can and will be done.  We must create a situation where economic growth can take place.  We must give those who are interested in promoting that concept some leeway and latitude.  Every single Government Department has within its ambit the capacity and responsibility to look at itself and find out how best to contribute to this concept.  Over the past ten years, in every Department we have seen the growth of bureaucracy, red tape, obstacles and recirculating correspondence in such a way as to give employment but no growth to the economy.  That may give temporary employment to somebody but it is of no benefit to the economy whatsoever.  As you and I know, a Chathaoirligh, because we have spent time in the health institutions and local authorities, this goes right down to every Department.  Every Government Department is being examined to see how it can contribute positively to the situation in which we find ourselves and towards the goal of achieving the targets that have been set.</P>
        <P>On another issue, I am amazed that some Members of the Opposition refer to what was promised before the election.  The current Government promised nothing.  The Government parties said we are in a difficult situation, we will do our best to work out of it and we will do everything possible to ensure we alleviate in so far as we can the impact on the people of this country.  That is what the Government is doing and where its responsibility lies.  Nobody said it was going to be easy or that it would be achieved overnight.  It is not much more than 50 days since the formation of the Government.  I would be amazed if the country had been turned around and we were back in boom times again.  It will not happen that way, it was never thought of as happening that way and nobody ever promised it would happen that way.</P>
        <P>It may be that some of those who now find themselves on the Opposition side of the House, although they are absent from the Chamber at present, had the notion that were they on this side of the House now, they would recover the economy overnight.  It took them 15 years to sink it to its current depths, and they did it magnificently and to such an extent as to leave a huge burden of responsibility not only on the Government but on the people.  They did it without permission.  They never asked the permission of the people or whether it would be all right to do what they did.  They just did it &mdash; that is the way it is.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Government and the two Government parties for their willingness to tackle this task in the way they are doing.  I am sure we have not done everything right and that improvements can be made.  One of the points identified by some in recent years <Col N="358"/>was the difficulty of achieving economic growth.  We knew this two or three years ago.  On 29 September 2008, we who were then on the other side of the House identified these issues and the difficulties faced by the economy and the people at that time.  We knew it would not be an overnight success no matter who got into power.  Those who suggest there was a promise of overnight success or a promise that everything in the garden would be rosy are wrong.</P>
        <P>The provisions in regard to the research and development tax credit are positive and will help to achieve economic growth.  Incidentally, I note the Minister has identified a positive element in the sense that there will be economic growth.  Some of us thought two, three or four years ago that there would not be any economic growth and that we would now have negative growth.  It is hugely important that we have achieved what we have.  It is a huge success, even in a very short space of time.  It is true to say that the outgoing Government was forced to make those provisions and do what it did, although it did not like to do it.  The fact is that this must be carried on.  We must continue to improve our economic position because the difficulties have not gone away.</P>
        <P>With regard to the markets and economic activity, the Minister in his speech stated that with the contraction in the economy from 2007 to 2010 tourism between this country and the UK fell by 32%, or almost one third, which is a huge issue.  We hope, as I am sure everyone in the country does, that the promotion this country has received in the past couple of weeks will be of benefit to that sector, which is very labour intensive and a sector where jobs can be created quickly.  Tourism is totally governed by demand, however, and we must create that demand.  Hopefully, we are doing that.</P>
        <P>The issue that has received the most attention is the pension levy.  No levy will be welcomed.  If the Government had any other options, there would not be a pension levy and there would be a much easier regime generally in regard to the current economic performance.  There are no other options, however.  When I hear it suggested that we will not pay the European banks and we will default, I find it extraordinary.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch, has advised constituents over a long period.  One of the things I am sure he never advised them to do is to go into a bank or financial institution and tell the person behind the counter &ldquo;I will want money for the next four or five years on an ongoing basis to run my house or business but I will not pay you back the money I owe you&rdquo;.  That would be a strange situation and would create in the mind of the person on the other side of the counter the possibility that he or she would be taken for a run.  Unfortunately, we cannot take people for a run any more.  We cannot take them around the course for a gallop.</P>
        <P>We must be up-front and honest, and tell our European bankers that we intend to deliver.  We might not like the terms and conditions they have set down, and we will negotiate better terms when we get to the higher ground, but we must get to the higher ground first.  This means we must be able to tell the bank manager or person on the other side of the counter that this is how we propose to run the budget for the next two or three years, that it will achieve results and that, when it does, we will seek a review of the situation.  This is what is done ordinarily in banking practice.  When one gets to a particular situation, one can negotiate.  One can do many things when in a bargaining position but, if one is not in a bargaining position and is waiting for a cheque to come from some institution to pay the wages for the coming years, it changes the situation dramatically.</P>
        <P>The Bill does something along those lines.  It reassures the international institutions that we are not just a bunch of chancers, that we take matters seriously, that we intend to stand up and be counted and to run our economy in the way it should have been run in recent years.  If anyone doubts that, we need to go back 14 years to find a situation where the Minister for Finance left Government with the books balanced, everything in order, the engine running <Col N="359"/>perfectly and job creation running at 1,000 jobs a week.  People have forgotten how it was in 1997.  A strange situation developed in the meantime where everybody said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P>I withdraw that, Acting Chairman.  Everybody did not say it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The point is withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody did not say it.  Some people said it, but they said it unwisely.  What they were saying was that a crowd of fools had left the budget of the country and the finances in good order, had job creation going well and had our international reputation at the highest known level, but they would change all that.  They said they would improve on that, recalibrate and do it better, then put themselves on the international stage in a way that was never known before.  They forgot one thing, namely, that we can never live above our means and we can never pretend.  When one is dealing with international financiers, pretence is a dangerous game.  Unfortunately, they were wrong but they did not have to pay; the country and its people have to pay and the Government has to pay on behalf of the people.  This is why we are where we are at present.</P>
        <P>In a situation like this, what we need to do is to pick out the small areas, the little tweaks, that can be positive.  We must try to leave the negativity behind us.  Let us remember that the people who are now most negative are those who were the most positive during the boom times.  After all, it was never going to end.  However, the realistic growth in the economy that was in place in the mid-1990s was not good enough for those experts who sought to do better.  They were wrong, and they failed.</P>
        <P>The measures being taken by the Government are positive.  We do not live in a society which is carefree any longer.  We must pick up the tab, work harder and make sure we restore confidence in our country.  Every measure taken by Government must be along those lines.  Every Minister must look at the functions and services under the remit of his or her Department with a view to identifying how best each Department can adjust to take advantage of the situation.  If that is done we will find a positive outcome in sight but if it is not we will have failed.  I would be the first to admit this.</P>
        <P>In the past I have often been a critic, on all sides of the House.  That is a healthy sign, a good thing.  However, it is extremely important that all of us recognise one point, namely, we cannot wish away our present situation but must work at it.  When we work at it we will succeed.  Some time ago I was at a meeting where the Commissioner, M. Michel Barnier, was present.  He commented on this country and was positive in what he said.  He stated he had every confidence in Ireland, that we had the ability to do well in the areas we knew well and that this would be the salvation of our economy.  I believe he is right.  There have been many other commentators, both from Europe and within this country, who are less positive but we should recognise those who are positive and those who at least give us encouragement.  We should steer away from those who proclaim on a regular basis that all is lost and we are going nowhere, that we do not count and should get out of the eurozone, out of Europe and fend for ourselves.  We should say to people who think along those lines that this is not an option.  We are not in the business of trying out experiments.  We do not have that latitude.  We have a simple problem ahead of us, namely, to get the economy going again, get our people back to work and ensure we show to everyone around us that we are capable of doing whatever job needs to be done and whatever task is handed to us, and that this will remain the case.</P>
        <P>The Minister also stated there had been some speculation that the Government would proceed to raid investment funds or deposit accounts.  He wished to assure the House the Government has no plans in this regard and stated, &ldquo;The Government regards as a top priority the safeguard and security of savings and would not wish to consider any step that would impact <Col N="360"/>negatively on this confidence&rdquo;.  He is absolutely right.  What we need is for people to put their savings into this country and this economy.  Ultimately, that will benefit the economy magnificently.</P>
        <P>The Minister had to try to steer a course around the obstacles and present a situation that would be beneficial from the point of view of generating confidence in our economy on the one hand, and international confidence on the other hand, while impacting as lightly as possible on those who are negatively affected by this Bill.  Had there been other options, the Minister clearly indicated they would have been taken.  He also stated, on page 7 of his document that: &ldquo;My officials are consulting the pensions industry and other interested stakeholders on the legislative provision in this section with a view to minimising where possible any unnecessary difficulties which this measure may give rise to&rdquo;.  That is a very important statement.</P>

	<P>I reassure Deputy Durkan that I too am very keen to stay in Europe.  I am also an optimist at heart and believe everything is possible but I also believe we should get a fair deal from Europe which is not the case at present.  I say to the Deputy that when a person goes into a bookie&rsquo;s office and backs a horse, if the horse does not win, the person loses.  I agree with him on that point.  However, if a person bought bonds in a bank and lost on them, that person would still get the money back under the present arrangement.  That is a bit different.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many elements I like in the Finance (No. 2) Bill, especially the VAT proposal which will be an enormous boost to the hotel and restaurant industry.  I believe in the principle of investment.  Investment stimulates an economy whereas austerity drains it.  Unfortunately, we are probably not getting as much investment as we would like and are getting much more austerity than we would like.  Unfortunately, too, austerity probably hits the less well off in our society more than anybody else.</P>
        <P>There is a big problem in regard to getting things moving in this country, namely, the lack of a banking system that functions.  We were told about a strategic investment bank.  Perhaps it is still on its way but it is really needed.  Bank lending is a problem &mdash; banks are not lending.  They do not see our businesses as safe to lend to and do not believe in them.  I read an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> today about the HSBC in Britain which stated that in the first quarter of the year HSBC&rsquo;s lending volumes rose by &euro;28 billion.  The writer asked where most of that money had gone.  It went to the fast-growing markets in Asia: &ldquo;in stark contrast to western markets like Britain and Ireland, where, more than two years after the peak of the financial crisis and despite repeated agreements with governments to boost the availability of finance banks are still reluctant to lend to businesses&rdquo;.</P><Col N="361"/>
        <P>Believe it or not, the Irish Government is in a privileged position in that it owns a couple of banks.  I might prefer if it did not but it does.  We must stop asking the banks to lend money to us and must tell them to do so, given that the State owns them.  It would be a great boost to our economy to have again a banking system that functions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The biggest problem with the Finance (No. 2) Bill is the pensions element.  A great number of people have telephoned me to express serious disillusionment with what has happened.  One might claim that 0.6% does not seem to be very much but that amount is calculated on the full value of a pension each year.  What really worries people is that may only be the beginning; it may not be the end.  It will be perceived as the thin end of the wedge.  For the past number of years we have talked a great deal about the need to encourage people to begin a pension.  It is difficult enough to do that because one is asking people to store away money for 30 or 40 years in the hope it will be there ultimately when it is really needed.  When something like this happens it dents people&rsquo;s confidence and there is no doubt that confidence has left many people.  It was bad enough that many pensions suffered badly because of the recession but it was a new phenomenon to find that the Government would raid them.  This will have a really negative impact on trying to persuade people to invest.  We have an ageing population and we need to work at persuading people to have pensions.  Robbing them is not a good idea.</P>
        <P>If we are not going to rob the pensions where will we get this &euro;1.9 billion?  Deputy Peter Mathews spoke very well today.  He suggested there must be a negotiated restructuring of &euro;75 billion; &euro;50 billion with the ECB and &euro;25 billion with the bondholders.  He suggested the money should be cascaded down and invested in the economy to deal with household debt.  For this to happen, if there is to be a negotiated restructuring, Europe has to see sense.  In my view, Europe does not believe how bad things are in this country.  Unfortunately, because of our export figures a false picture is created.  Things are not as good as people abroad seem to think.  We must reinforce to Europeans that the figures do not add up and we will not be able to meet all the repayments.  Therefore they must treat us more fairly.</P>
        <P>In the short term, while we wait for the Europeans to see some sense, salaries over &euro;100,000 must be dealt with.  A wealth tax of 1% would bring in &euro;1.2 billion in this country.  There is a wealth tax in countries such as France, Switzerland and Norway which seems to work well enough.  Surely the wages that Deputies and Ministers get and the pensions and lump sums they get when they leave here amount to outrageous money.  People cannot believe that we can still get this money in the present climate.  There are people with State jobs getting more than &euro;500,000 per year but we are cutting resource teachers for Travellers in schools.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>When approaching any legislation basic questions should be asked with regard to whether it will make a difference, what sort of a difference and whose lives will be affected.  When I consider the Finance Bill I question whether it will make a difference and for whom.  I admit to approaching anything in the financial line with a degree of scepticism.  No matter who it sets out to benefit appearances can be deceptive.  There are too many examples of creative accounting, tax loopholes, tax evasion and false information.  No matter what tax measure is introduced it immediately becomes a challenge for someone to get around, under or over to avoid paying his or her just taxes.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to corporate tax as being the heart of the matter.  I reiterate some points I have made already.  We cannot be a tax haven for companies which use us to avoid <Col N="362"/>paying their lawful taxes in their own countries.  I am struck by the irony of the suggestion to ask President Obama to help us to protect our 12.5% rate when he condemned it during his first presidential election campaign.  European countries need not take the high moral ground on their stated higher rates when, in fact, they have tax concessions and loopholes for companies.  A small increase in corporate tax would make a significant difference to what we need at the moment.  However, at the least we should ensure that 12.5% is collected from everyone and not an effective rate of tax in single figures as we are led to believe.</P>
        <P>Let us consider particular aspects of the legislation.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, well in reaching agreement with the airlines regarding the suspension of the air travel tax and I hope it will bring in additional passenger numbers.  The review should come sooner than the end of 2012 so it can be reversed if it does not bring in the additional numbers envisaged.  I do not believe the air travel tax was the reason we saw a reduction in the numbers travelling to Ireland.  The astronomical pricing here to stay and eat contributed to the fall in tourist numbers.  It was disquieting, to say the least, to learn of the significant hike in accommodation prices during the past week because of the various sporting events and visits.  It is too long to wait until the end of 2012 to examine the effects of the change.  There should be consistent and regular mini-reviews and instant action should be taken if it is deemed not to have positive effects.</P>
        <P>It has been established that most of the visitors we have are associated with the cultural area.  I have been appealing for some time for resources to preserve suitably the historic area from the General Post Office, GPO, to Moore Street, Moore Lane and O&rsquo;Rahilly Parade.  Let us consider the number of visitors to the National Museum in Kilmainham.  With the centenary of the 1916 Rising approaching the economic potential is vast.  If funding were allocated for preservation there would be jobs and, afterwards, retail opportunities for business, jobs as guides etc.  We have speculated a good deal on the royal and presidential visits.  I hope we accumulate significantly from them.</P>
        <P>We know more than 300,000 jobs have been lost, there has been a doubling of the numbers unemployed and that the projected level of increase in employment is not expected to be enough to reduce unemployment.  We badly need measures to make a difference.  Are these measures for the benefit of society or the marketplace?</P>
        <P>The Government was elected on a platform of being honest, having greater accountability, bringing political reform, stopping the bonus culture, adhering to principles of fair share, ensuring bondholders will pay and that tax shelters would be closed.  The Government has correctly blamed the previous Government for the disastrous situation we are in.  However, it is time to move on from the blame game.  The Government must take responsibility and address the matters on that platform and where we stand on them.  The bonus culture and excessive salaries are still alive and well.  There have been no reversals and no payback from the Mr. Fingletons and Mr. Drumms and political appointments continue.  As a PAYE worker and a former teacher, if I underpaid my tax, Revenue would come after me and rightly so.  However, one can defraud the country, continue to play golf, go on holidays and live the high life.  The payback from those people could have been used for this jobs initiative.  Is it not possible to require bondholders who foolishly lent funds without sufficient assets secured to pay back something?  Instead, there is a levy on funded pensions schemes and personal pension plans.  I realise it is temporary but I am unsure whether we are good when it comes to &ldquo;temporary&rdquo;.  Those who were sensible and prudent enough to save for their retirement now must fund this initiative.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the jobs in the retail sector.  Some 20,000 businesses employ tens of thousands but sales are in decline.  I trust the intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to establish <Col N="363"/>a national retail forum will grasp the issue.  The way forward should focus on small and medium sized enterprises as the key to employment growth in retail, the green economy, social networking, agribusiness and food.  The talent and ideas are in place.  One need only consider the young entrepreneurs in our schools and the Young Scientist &amp; Technology Exhibition.  The song holds that when the going gets tough, the tough get going.  Leinster showed this last Saturday and I believe Ireland can do so as well but I have my doubts about whether we are making the right decisions in this Finance (No. 2) Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill gives effect to the taxation elements of the Government&rsquo;s modest jobs initiative.  The Government is pinning all its hopes on an export-led growth strategy to get us out of this recession.  The Minister pointed out that exports increased by 9.5% last year and it appears this level of growth will continue this year as well.  However, depending on whose figures one believes, we face economic growth of 0.5% or 0.8% for 2011.  The effect of this is effectively no real growth this years with, at best, unemployment not increasing.  This is hardly a success.</P>
        <P>The financial services, pharmaceutical, software and food sectors have all seen growth in exports.  Exports to Brazil, Russia, India and China, the BRIC countries, increased to more than 12% last year.  However, gross domestic product has declined by 15% during the past three years.  The problems we have are in the domestic economy, not the export sector but the Government is placing all its eggs in the basket of export-led growth.  We need to stimulate the domestic economy by supporting small and medium sized enterprises and encouraging these firms to get into the export market.  This would provide real jobs growth and would put much needed money into circulation through the wages paid to new workers.</P>
        <P>The foreign direct investment sector accounts for more than 90% of exports and employment in these firms has probably peaked.  The potential for jobs growth in these sectors is limited.  However, the potential for growth in the SME sector is vast.  Focusing support and the jobs initiative on the firms with the potential to grow would make a good deal more sense.  As I mentioned in the House when discussing the jobs announcement earlier, countries such and Estonia and Slovenia have a greater focus on exports from SMEs than we do, with figures of 23% and 21% respectively.  In Ireland only 11% of SMEs export with only 2.4% of revenue coming from the export of goods and services.  Clearly, this is where the potential for growth lies.  Encouraging the research capabilities of universities to focus on SMEs could lead to export growth that would help to increase the number of jobs.</P>
        <P>Measures included in the Bill legislate for a stimulus or boost for tourism, including the abolition of the travel tax and the reduction in the VAT rate to 9% for tourism and catering related activities.  The abolition of the travel tax is dependent on the agreement of the airlines to boost visitor numbers in the country.  Already, airlines such as Ryanair have stated they do not have agreements on visitor numbers and the abolition of the tax will probably be built into an increase in prices that will boost their profits and will not result in the hoped for benefits.  Their campaign has moved on to the cost of using airports in the country and they seek to have control of these handed over.  The sections in the Bill which allow the tax to be restored if the increased numbers are not achieved are vital.  The use of the carrot and stick is the only way to ensure a proper response.  Equally, the change in the VAT rate must be monitored closely.  While the reduction in the rate will not make a great impact on prices, it should help to increase employment and boost confidence.  The impact should result in a boost in confidence in the sector and encourage the industry to grow and create jobs.  It will be important to monitor the success or otherwise of the reduction and we must be prepared to make the required changes if the necessary level of job creation does not materialise.  The Government has <Col N="364"/>avoided committing to any jobs numbers expected from the initiative but we must wait and see what the impact will be in our areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>Like many others, I have spoken on the jobs budget, stimulus and initiative previously.  As other Deputies have stated, the Government put forward a modest jobs initiative only two weeks ago.  Although there are no figures put on jobs, the idea that this jobs initiative could potentially create 250,000 jobs is immediately counteracted by the 220,000 jobs being lost in the public sector.  This does not make sense when it comes to creating jobs.  A national job strategy is needed, with investment from the Government.  I outlined in the last debate how the money can be raised and it is a choice the Government will have to make again and again, whether to go after those with no money or those with money.  There is plenty of wealth in this country; the rich have got richer and there are ways to take that money from them and for them to contribute to us getting out of the recession, even under the market system.</P>
        <P>The briefing paper from the Chief Whip&rsquo;s office states that legislation is being prepared to allow pension scheme trustees or administrators the option to adjust benefits payable under the pension schemes or plans.  I have no doubt this option will be used by the pensions industry.  I bring to the attention of the Minister the position of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, which demands the levy should be taken from the profits of the industry, particularly their marketing and hospitality funds.  The pensions administration companies have made massive profits for many years, despite huge mistakes when playing the market, which then required huge additional injections of capital to meet pension requirements.  There is no necessity to pass on this tax to people who have already suffered pension levies, wage cuts and increased taxes.</P>
        <P>Provision for the option to pass on the levy should be removed from this Bill.  In fact there should be no levy.  The amount the levy will raise could be easily raised by other measures.  A substantial amount of income is exempt from PRSI and income levies.  We are continuously asked time and again for alternatives so here they are: exemption of capital gains and inheritance and gift tax would raise &euro;290 million per year; exemptions on rental and dividend income would raise &euro;89 million per year; the ceiling on PRSI contributions would raise &euro;120 million a year; and PRSI exemptions on share options would raise &euro;29 million a year.  The abolition of those exemptions would provide &euro;500 million without touching anyone&rsquo;s pension.</P>
        <P>The amount this levy will raise could be raised by treating income from capital investments and rents in the same way as PAYE income.  Having made such a start towards a fairer and more equitable way of dealing with the crisis, the Government might move on to the wealth tax and close off tax breaks that go overwhelmingly to the wealthy and use that money to create a real jobs stimulus package that will put billions of euro into creating jobs.  That is the choice this Government has.</P>

	<P>I was glad to hear Deputy Joan Collins&rsquo;s speech, where she said there should be no levy, and then argued in favour of a wealth tax.  I am amazed at Deputies from the United Left Alliance opposing this levy.  They are taking the same side as the right wing commentators, the managers and trustees of pension funds and Mr. Eddie Hobbs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I recommend Deputy Collins listens to an interview on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; with the economist Colm Rapple.  Some of the points he made would make me believe that Deputy Collins should rethink her position on this particular wealth tax.  He made the point that opposition to the levy is being stirred up because in principle it is a wealth tax.  It is being opposed because it is a wealth tax, and the pensions industry is doing the stirring, <Col N="365"/>even if it had a different position before, although I have spoken to people who work in the industry who tell me this is a fair tax.</P>
        <P>It is 60 cent on &euro;100, as pointed out by Colm Rapple.  In April, the average managed fund went up by 7%.  He said it was a tax on wealth and is relatively fair.  He pointed out that 50% of workers are not in pension schemes &mdash; the low paid &mdash; and these are the very people who have been paying tax to fund the tax reliefs that have allowed some people to put these funds into pension funds.  I asked a parliamentary question last week to find out how much tax was foregone for tax relief on these pension funds.  In 2006-7, the figure was &euro;3 billion.  The 0.6%, the &euro;470 million over four years, is a minuscule amount in comparison to the wealth that was put into these pension funds over the years.</P>
        <P>With this levy, the more a person has, the more he will pay.  Colm Rapple pointed out that 80% of the funds put into pension funds come from the wealthiest 20% in the country.  There are those on middle incomes who have put money into these funds but these do not make up the bulk of those who pay into these funds and the tax foregone.  All of us as taxpayers funded the tax breaks that allowed this wealth to be put into these pension funds.</P>
        <P>Pat Kenny asked during the programme if people would not be taxed when they take the money from the pension fund when they retire and it was pointed out that is not generally the case and that average earners would not have paid tax on these pensions.  A married couple with an income from a pension of &euro;36,000 between them would not have paid any tax on the pension when they retired.  This idea that it will hit people on low incomes is absolute rubbish.  It is a disgrace the way Deputy Joan Collins and Deputy Joe Higgins have talked about raids on pension funds while, in the same breath, talking about the need for a wealth tax.  Which tax on wealth will the Deputies favour?  They will probably oppose a property tax.  This is wealth &mdash; savings is wealth &mdash; that has been put away.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan said this is a tax on prudence but this is a tax on wealth that was put away at the expense of the taxpayer, the 50% of people who do not have a pension scheme, who are mainly low paid workers and whom Deputy Collins should support.  Many unemployed people who paid taxes over the years to help the State pay for the tax foregone will hopefully benefit from the jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>Whatever criticism the Deputy has of the jobs initiative, that is fine but to argue against the pension levy leaves her with no credibility at all if she calls herself a socialist.  One of the people who texted the radio programme claimed Colm Rapple was an old fashioned, unreconstructed socialist.  That is what people used to say about Deputy Joe Higgins but now he is suddenly defending the pension funds industry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pension funds industry is not representative.  Those who are stirring this up are not speaking for everyone who manages pension funds.  I got a letter before Christmas from Owen Dwyer, a senior partner in Irish Pensions and Finance, who wrote to Deputies in November 2010 arguing against reducing tax relief on pensions while suggesting a levy on pension funds.  I spoke to him today and he said in his opinion the levy was not a bad thing for people with personal, company or AVC pensions.  He said it would have a greater impact on those with defined benefit pension schemes.</P>

	<P>No one can argue with the content of the motion.  There is no doubt that Food Harvest 2020 provides huge opportunities for growth in employment in the food and export sectors.  With more than 139,000 people employed in the production of agrifood and fisheries products, the sector represents 7.5% of national employment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wish to concentrate on the fisheries and fisheries products sector where this growth can be realised very quickly.  One of the great tragedies of our fishing industry and its development, apart from the Common Fisheries Policy which has been the greatest crime inflicted on the Irish people by the European Union, perhaps matched only by the bailout terms agreed last November, is that the fishing industry has never stepped up to the mark nor delivered on value-added product.  This has significant potential for communities along the west coast.  One must wonder what the western seaboard of Ireland would look like if we landed the fish that is taken out of our waters and brought to other EU ports and if that fish was processed into a value-added product.  We would not then have the unbalanced regional development which currently exists and we would have a vibrant western seaboard with vibrant employment and growth.  Adding value to fish is the only way to go, particularly as the impact of the EU quotas is experienced and with the reductions in the amount of fish which the Irish fleet is entitled to land.  In most countries, every fisherman at sea creates ten jobs on shore whereas in Ireland it is two jobs for every fisherman at sea.  There is a potential to grow the numbers employed in shore-based industries by five times and by adding value and exporting those products.  There is no reason in the world why we should export frozen fillets and whole fish to Germany so they can be processed in German factories and sold to the German people.  We should be processing the fish here in places such as Killybegs, Castletownbere, Rossaveal, Greencastle and Burtonport and exporting the finished <Col N="369"/>product which would result in an economic and jobs boost.  Food Harvest 2020 shows how we could make significant gains.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Others have spoken about the important issue of how we can increase our exports in order to bring more money into the country but there is also an area of agriculture that needs to be developed in places such as where I come from, where last year, according to figures I have, we used in the region of &euro;9 million worth of fruit and vegetables.  Myself and a few other people tried to establish how much of this produce was produced in the area and we could only conclude it was in the region of 5%.  I know we will never be able to produce all our fruit and vegetables nor will we be growing grapefruit or oranges in County Roscommon but I do not think it is too ambitious to set a target of 50% of that &euro;9 million to be produced locally.  Some people like Pat Kenny on &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; would lead one to believe that it cannot be done but I am not a spokesman for Tesco like he is so I will say it can be done.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I know a man in Strokestown who, with one acre of land, is making a living for himself by growing fruit and vegetables and selling bags of potatoes and various different products in Strokestown on Fridays.  I know another group of people called Tulsk Fruit and Veg who, on 17 acres of land, cater for two adults and two grown children, four employees.  A 19-acre farm in Williamstown successfully makes a living out of growing fruit and vegetables.  It can be done; one can make a living on a small farm.</P>
        <P>The multiplier effect comes into play.  Johnny the farmer produces cabbages and sells them.  He will then have more money to get his house painted.  He will employ a painter and that painter needs to eat and he buys some of his produce and the money goes around in the local economy, unlike now where it leaves after one whirl on the money roundabout.</P>
        <P>For this to happen, we need actual, physical markets at which farmers can sell their produce.  We do not have such a market in Roscommon nor in many areas around the country.  County councils should be encouraged to develop such markets so people can sell their produce directly to consumers and cut out the middle man.</P>
        <P>We need to change from the current system whereby the more land and animals a person has, the more money Europe will give him or her.  That money should be used to help develop small family farms where more people can be employed and which produces a better product with higher standards.  It will not solve all our problems but it would go a small way towards solving local problems.  Exports are very important but the local economy must be developed because it has been forgotten.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all fairly well aware that we are short on indigenous industry and very dependent on multinationals to provide employment and to drive the export market.  Of the indigenous industry, farming accounts for approximately 60% of exports and it plays a significant role in the domestic economy.  There is little doubt that the deal the farmer gets from supermarkets leaves much to be desired.  I note the farmer&rsquo;s share has changed in a number of years.  The report, Equity for Farmers in the Food Supply Chain, states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The farmer&rsquo;s share of the retail price has declined significantly in the major commodities over the last 15 years.  For example, since 1995 the farmer&rsquo;s share of the retail price for liquid milk has declined from 42% to 33%.  For cheese, the farmer&rsquo;s share has fallen from 34% to 20%, for pigmeat from 51% to 27%, and for beef from 60% to 50%.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The multiple chains have grown stronger in this country.  Successive Governments have allowed the small shopkeeper and small farmers to be pushed out.  We are familiar with the practice of hello money which enabled farmers and producers to put their products on supermarket shelves but this practice has been banned.  However, it is alive and well today under a different name. <Col N="370"/> They call it advertising marketing contribution.  This allows the multiple to dictate who will survive and who will not, with the result that many small farmers have been driven out of business.  They are unable to compete.  The person who grows 10,000 tonnes of tomatoes has a significant advantage over the person who grows one or two tonnes.  There is no fairness in the system.  This country has an obligation to protect agriculture which is the only decent indigenous industry we have.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanSherlock"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take five minutes.</P>
        <P>I refer to a point made by Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan about maximising a potential within communities to grow that sector and to develop local markets.  I completely agree with the Deputy on that score.  I looked at models in upstate New York of community-supported agriculture.  I am very much on the same page as the Deputy on that issue.  A consolidation of the dairy sector and the meat sector would mean a smaller number of larger farms feeding into a co-operative structure which will probably be restructured.  One must then have due regard for the smaller community-based agriculture and the smaller farm and their place in a community and social structure.  Because they are so vital we need to ensure they are not left behind.  I hope that once the new Oireachtas committee structures are up and running we will be able to discuss those kind of issues.  Local authorities should be encouraged to maximise a new space and look at models being rolled out in places such as Tralee and other towns.  The use of land could be maximised especially around urban areas.  We need to ensure we do not lose the family farm structure.  The family farm should not be left behind.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the consolidation of the dairy sector.  Milk quotas will be abolished in 2015.  We all buy into the Food Harvest 2020 proposals.  However, we are not blind to the fact that it may present some constraints.  Will greater consolidation of the dairy sector result in jobless growth?  Will it result in the existence of just one or two milk dryers in this country?  What would be its permutations be for regional growth in this country?  There are challenges in this regard.  If there is a 50% increase in milk production, it must be accompanied by job creation.  We cannot have jobless growth.</P>
        <P>We must ensure we continue to add value to milk as a commodity.  That is where my research and innovation brief comes into play.  Teagasc is doing a great deal of work on infant formula at its Moorepark facility in Fermoy.  It wants to ensure the commodity has a research component and to add value in order to create jobs.  There is an engagement in that space.  If we do not engage politically, however, there is a danger that we could get left behind.  My role is to prioritise research so that we can mine as much potential as possible from the food industry while feeding into policy at the same time.</P>
        <P>I hope we can realise the potential of research in assisting the added value process.  If that does not happen, there is a danger that we will go down the commodity line and, as a result, fail to create the type of jobs we need to create in this sector.  I am very conscious of that.  It is all very well to talk about the expansion of the dairy and meat sectors, but there is a danger that growth will not be accompanied by job creation.  We all favour expansion.  We do not know what the post-2015 scenario will be.  Many younger farmers are scaling up at the moment because they can see the potential that offers.  We need to have due regard for those smaller <Col N="371"/>farmers who do not have the required economies of scale to act in a similar manner.  We are conscious of the needs of that sector of the agricultural community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ReginaDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Regina Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The agriculture and agrifood industry is undoubtedly among Ireland&rsquo;s most important indigenous industries.  According to the Irish Farmers Association, 38% of all households are located in rural Ireland.  One in four of those households is an agricultural household.  This industry is vital and must be supported.  Despite the growth in exports in 2009, the number of people engaged in agriculture fell by 40% by comparison with the 2007 number.  Employment in the food and drink processing industry fell by 10,000.  The challenge faced by policy makers is to develop a sustainable strategy that enables the agriculture and agrifood industry to grow over the next decade.  The Food Harvest 2020 programme reflects this aim.  The comprehensive nature of the programme reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving exports in all sectors of the industry.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, aims to increase the value of agrifood and drink exports by 3% this year.  The aims of the Food Harvest 2020 programme are welcome.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to address the development of labelling and the traceability of food.  According to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which monitors this country&rsquo;s food traceability and labelling regulations, in general terms food labels are not supposed to mislead the consumer.  A general requirement of the regulations on the labelling on products is that the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs must be clear and unambiguous and must not mislead the consumer to a material degree.  The term &ldquo;labelling&rdquo; refers to any word, particulars, trade mark, brand name, pictorial matter or symbol relating to a foodstuff that is placed on any packaging, documentation or label accompanying the foodstuff.  Labels must be easy to understand and clearly legible.  If a product is being sold in Ireland, the label must be in English with the option of Irish.  While this is all well and good, as a consumer I continue to be confused by labelling at times.  If I see that a product has a label that says &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo;, I may decide to buy it.  If I turn the product around and read the detail on the reverse, however, in many instances I will learn that the product is not made in Ireland.  It might be just 50% Irish.  Where do consumers stand on such issues?</P>
        <P>The rules of the Guaranteed Irish organisation provide that any product or service in respect of which at least 50% of the adding of value took place in Ireland can qualify to be deemed as &ldquo;guaranteed Irish&rdquo;.  In the case of services, the award criterion is that the company must have majority Irish ownership and must be creating employment in Ireland.  The only terms or phrases that seem to mean what they say on the tin are &ldquo;free range&rdquo;, &ldquo;traditional free range&rdquo;, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; and, in some instances, &ldquo;fresh&rdquo;.  These terms are protected by legislation and inspectors are employed by the State to inspect possible cases of fraud.  Why is the same thing not done to protect the origin of foodstuffs?  As the regulations state, we should have clear and unambiguous labelling that does not mislead me and other consumers.  Why should a person who runs into a supermarket to get something for his or her dinner have to read the equivalent of an essay on the reverse of the package to make sure what they are buying is Irish?</P>
        <P>We need to work with the Minister for Health, who has overall responsibility for general food labelling, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to ensure customers know where their food is coming from.  If a chicken kiev originated in the UK but was processed in Ireland, that should be made fully clear on its packaging.  Under the EU general labelling directive, the place of origin of a foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.  Under EU legislation, specific country of origin labelling is only required in the case of beef, unprocessed poultry and fruit and vegetables.  This is all well and good, but it needs to be much clearer.  We need to make it so clear and unambiguous that there can be no doubt in my mind as a consumer where each product comes from.  We need to make Irish <Col N="372"/>labels stick in consumers&rsquo; heads and make shopping for Irish goods as easy as possible.  That is essential for the continued success of the Irish goods market.</P>

	<P>As a representative of my constituency I am happy to arrive in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at a time when it is recognised on all sides of the House that the agrifood sector will be in the vanguard of our economic recovery.  I am happy that a recognition of its crucial role in our recovery forms the background to this debate.  The Irish food sector employs 150,000 people and has an annual output of &euro;24 billion.  The target of the 2020 project is to increase primary production output by &euro;1.5 billion, value-added output by &euro;3 billion and general exports by &euro;12 billion.  We need to work towards meeting those wonderful and ambitious targets.</P>
        <P>The dairy sector has survived the bad times of 2009.  The EU and world markets are performing strongly.  I am happy that the grants for modernising milking parlours, collecting rain water and developing better infrastructure are on stream.  I am pleased because such schemes have great potential  There is a need for better banking facilities in the dairy sector.  That needs to be addressed in the general context of the need to solve our banking problems.  There will have to be lending.  It is our duty to enter into dialogue with banks.  We should make it a condition of any investment in the banks that they facilitate investment in our dairy sector, which has the potential to create jobs and lead economic revival.  Dairy farmers need banking facilities if they are to expand.  They may also need favourable tax recognition to that end.  That needs to be examined by the Department of Finance.  The Minister of State made the valid point that we do not want dairy expansion or consolidation if it happens to the detriment of employment.  I am proud to say that the cream used in Emmets Irish Cream and Baileys Irish Cream comes from my county.  I believe there is great potential to develop value-added products like liqueurs.  That can be done in each sector.</P>
        <P>I conclude by drawing attention to the difficulties being experienced in the pig sector, which is a crucial one if we are to meet our ambition to achieve the 2020 target.  An average of &euro;12 per pig is being lost in the pig sector at the moment.  That needs to be addressed, for example, by means of better banking facilities.  The cartels and monopolies of the retail outlets, some of which are using pork products for below-cost selling, need to be tackled.  They are damaging the pork, bacon and chicken industry.  I ask the Minister to examine the position of conglomerates in the retail sector.  I was alarmed to learn anecdotally recently that these companies were in the process of buying up food processing outlets in an effort to take complete control of the market.  This is a serious matter.</P>
        <P>The agriculture sector has significant potential and requires support.  It will be important in the renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy to maintain the single farm payment and investment in agriculture.  I have no doubt that the Government will actively engage in that process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelHarrington"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Harrington</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.  This debate presents an opportunity to highlight the good news story of increasing exports in the agri-food sector.  The Food Harvest 2020 strategy offers major opportunities to the dairy sector to significantly expand and will substantially increase agrifood exports.  While this is welcome, I sound a cautionary note because the strategy could cause problems.  We are hearing mixed messages about providing on-farm jobs.  It will be pointless to pursue the strategy if it does not deliver additional employment.  I am concerned that as farmers and landowners take the opportunity to pursue the strategy, smaller, less viable land holdings will find it increasingly difficult to compete.  While I am reluctant to sound a sour note, it would be regrettable if the strategy resulted in a net loss of jobs in the dairy sector.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>I strongly encourage stakeholders in the dairy industry.  On-farm entrepreneurs are being encouraged to ratchet up production via acquisitions and other means.  However, if processing and supporting infrastructure are not similarly ratcheted up, increased production will be pointless and we will not achieve our targets in terms of increases in exports and values.  We may even experience a net loss in the number of farm jobs.  We must be careful, therefore, to encourage off-farm businesses to ratchet up their capacity.  In many cases, increasing capacity on farms requires increased or changed breeding programmes which will require an effort over three years.  We are trying to encourage farmers to change their breeding programmes and increase capacity and production, while skirting around the super-levy issue.  In this respect, we must be careful to send the correct messages.</P>
        <P>The motion and the amendment refer only briefly to aquaculture, one of the key growth areas of the economy.  In the past ten years Ireland has lagged far behind other countries in promoting our aquaculture industry.  Norway which has a similar coastline and enjoys similar advantages to Ireland produces 100 times more in aquaculture than we do.  Scotland has made considerable progress in aquacultural production in recent years and currently produces ten times more in this area than Ireland.  Global demand for aquacultural products is significant.  For every 1,000 tonnes of aquacultural products produced, seven jobs can be created in coastal and peripheral areas.  If we could increase production to Norwegian levels, we would create 7,000 jobs.  This figure cannot be ignored and I hope the Minister will take it on board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion.</P>
        <P>The state of the economy means we are constantly focusing on sectors, including agriculture, which are performing well.  While one hears that sheep and cattle are fetching excellent prices, it is important to note that the price of inputs such as fertiliser and concentrates has also increased.  The sector is doing well and will, I hope, continue to do so, but we must address the concerns of many farmers.</P>
        <P>The position of the Common Agricultural Policy after 2013 will be of fundamental importance.  The various sectors of production tend to be focused in different regions.  I represent the west which has a large number of small farmers.  The discussion on boosting milk production reflects a focus on one sector.  We must protect small farm families in the west, not only on the basis of their contribution to agriculture but also because of their role in local communities and economies.</P>
        <P>We have heard forecasts about the role agriculture will play in the economy and all the agricultural sectors have been discussed in this debate.  If we are to encourage off-farm businesses and assist farmers to become involved in other key aspects of their business, including marketing, accountancy and so forth, we must concentrate on education.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, the only remaining agricultural college along the western seaboard is under threat.  It is located in Mountbellew in our constituency.  Like many young farmers from County Donegal down to County Cork, I studied at the college.  Many former students have been successful in the agriculture sector.  Two of my former classmates, for instance, were the first people to secure an investment on the &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Den&rdquo; programme, as a result of which they have started to create jobs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Achieving the goal of increasing production in the various agricultural sectors means ensuring a supply of people with an appropriate education, ability and background.  If we want to maximise our potential, centres such as Mountbellew Agricultural College must be protected.  This year the college was forced to refuse applications from students who were seeking to become involved in farming and agribusiness.  Realising the potential on the western seaboard will depend on educating young farmers.  If we are to bring agriculture to where it should be in the next ten, 15 or 20 years, we must protect educational opportunities for young farmers.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to speak to the motion.  It is essential that we afford the appropriate amount of time and priority to this issue.  We have argued consistently that the rural and social economies will be rebooted, in no small part, by a vibrant agrifood sector.  It is important, therefore, that the House give prominence to this issue in its weekly work.</P>
        <P>Agriculture was once the cornerstone of the economy and Ireland in general.  Following the emergence of greater diversity in the economy, its importance declined somewhat during the years.  I do not say this in a pejorative sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Harrington spoke eloquently about the marine aspects of the agricultural economy.  The presence of items from family run food companies in west Cork such as Glenilen cream and Gubbeen cheese is a testament to the entrepreneurial skill and potential of vibrant rural economies.  We can tackle unemployment while showcasing excellent products on the international stage.  The agrifood sector offers a way forward for rural economies because it can create and sustain jobs and reboot rural and social economies.</P>

	<P>It is a good day when the non-government or Opposition benches produce a motion with which we can all agree.  It is living proof that the cowboy and farmer can be friends.  It is vital to remain focused on what we can do, namely, our core competencies of tourism, energy, agri-business and micro-enterprise.  We must also ensure we focus both on the economy and society.  We have an opportunity to examine how people living along the western seaboard can enjoy sustainable livelihoods.  There are enormous opportunities and our agencies need to focus on them.  We also need to look at branding and delivering for small producers in a sustainable manner, not only through the normal forms of agriculture but also through opportunities that arise from organic growth. </P>
        <P>It is a good day when we can look with 20-20 vision and say we have something to be proud of and that jobs will be created as a result.  We must put all our ideas and enthusiasm towards that.  It is something I am happy about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion.  We must be doing something right.  Recently, in a Sunday newspaper, a celebrity economist identified the agrifood business as a key driver of the economy.  The same person understood that, as we used to say in Wicklow: &ldquo;When they&rsquo;re boiled, eat them up to that.&rdquo;  I wish to make a few key points.  Departments will have to adopt a flexible mentality.  At present, the key to driving this is to look on matters differently now than in the past.  We must train young people to become involved in farming, making it a career and a life rather than a struggle which it was in the past.  At times, it was financially rewarding but it involved high demands.  The younger generation of farming families are not prepared to accept what their fathers might have accepted.</P>
        <P>We must adopt a system that allows land to get into the hands of young, trained and educated entrepreneurs &mdash; young men and women in the farming business.  That may require alterations to the tax code.  It cannot be the case that a person must own land because it is too expensive, even with reduced prices.  When I was a young man, I had the good fortune to spend a year working in New Zealand where land ownership was not seen as a barrier to land operation and management.  The Revenue Commissioners and officials in the Department of Finance will have to get their heads around this matter by being flexible.</P>
        <P>The motion recognises that both regional and national food labelling needs to be improved.  It must be accurate and honest in dealing with issues such as health, country of origin, rearing and slaughter.  In that way, people can make an informed choice.  We are committed to introducing fair trade legislation.  It is acceptable and cool to buy coffee with a fair trade logo from somewhere in the world, but we seem to have a slight difficulty in adopting the same principle <Col N="375"/>here.  There are a few who are controlling what is an &euro;11 billion or &euro;12 billion retail industry in this country, depending on what one brings into the equation.  That must be tackled.</P>
        <P>According to research carried out at University College Cork, this country is made up of 54 local economies.  Most of those are centred on provincial towns with a big rural hinterland.  It is a known fact that when agriculture is doing well in such areas, so do the economies of such towns and communities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>In the short time available I will focus on aspects of fishery, which is point four on the motion.  Statistics indicate that the world&rsquo;s population will increase to 9 billion by 2050.  There will be a consequent increase in demand for agriculture products and we must place ourselves in a strong position by setting out our stall to promote and sell our brands.  We must ensure the quality that has been inspired by many in the agriculture and fisheries sectors will continue to grow positively.</P>
        <P>Many farmers have bought into the cross-compliance and traceability agenda.  While prices are coming back a little, we should ensure their commitment is a two-way street.  We can reciprocate that by ensuring quality is rewarded by pricing.</P>
        <P>The old Chinese proverb has it that without fish, there is no dinner.  I am glad we are joined in the Chamber by the former Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy John Browne.  In his time in the Department, he would have known that there are many historical challenges in the agriculture sector.  There is also a mindset of possible paralysis within the Department as a result of the 2007 European Court of Justice ruling which found that this country was in breach of the birds and habitats directive.  Since then, there has been a lack of confidence in trying to drive the marine agenda forward.</P>
        <P>We must examine the added value potential by advancing our domestic processing capacity.  We should look at examples such as Spain where in Zaragoza alone there is a 76,000 sq. m factory dedicated to fish processing.  We must also address anomalies that exist in the licensing of processing, especially within the aquaculture sector.  We have tremendous potential advantages for shellfish, including mussels, oysters and scallops.  In addition, we are exporting in excess of 12,000 tonnes of salmon per annum, but Scotland exports more than 100,000 tonnes annually.  That is an example of how we are not realising our potential by using our comparative advantage to drive the agenda.</P>
        <P>In Donegal, we have people working at the raw material end with good processing units.  However, we cannot realise the full potential owing to Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regulations.  There are good people working in that Department but there is also a mindset that needs to be challenged.  The Department should take risks in the interests of sustainability and conservation.  Without stepping over the obvious parameters, we must still take risks because we can fish our way out of the recession.  It is not all about big boats and deep water fishing.  It is also about realising the potential of inshore fisheries.  Scallops, mussels and oysters are being exported raw to France and elsewhere.  We must examine the processing capabilities and potential in order that shellfish can be exported to India and China.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the country&rsquo;s busiest fishing port at the moment is Cork Airport in Deputy Noel Harrington&rsquo;s county.  It is a sad indictment of our fishing industry when we are importing packaged fish products from as far away as Vietnam.  That is the challenge we are facing and it is why we should not lose our focus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the most relevant and important motions to come before the House since the new D&aacute;il was convened.  The agriculture industry will play a major economic role in helping to drive us out of recession.  The motion highlights key statistics and indicators which are relevant to the weight of this sector which is our most important indigenous <Col N="376"/>industry.  Its annual output is worth &euro;22 billion while agricultural exports to 160 countries amount to &euro;8 billion.  Some 140,000 people are employed in the provision of agrifood and fisheries products and services.  The sector supports 128,000 farm families as well as 600 food and drink companies.  When one considers that we narrowly missed exceeding our quota while others underscored by 30%, one begins to realise that a political solution must be found to allow the expansion of the dairy industry before 2015.</P>
        <P>The Government must adopt a strong and unequivocal stance at the Mercosur talks to ensure the protection, viability and future of the beef industry.  The Government has stated it will deliver on the Food Harvest 2020 programme and has indicated it agrees with its vision and targets for the continuing growth, improvement and prosperity of the agricultural sector.</P>
        <P>I will address the issues of the milk quota and the beef sector.  We cannot allow a situation to arise whereby Europe as a whole is under quota while some countries can face super levies for being over quota.  To say that this can facilitate a soft landing of the industry before its opening up in 2015 does not hold water.  Before the figures crystallised some time ago, the Minister believed we would come in over quota and face the super levy fine.  He has also stated there will be no political solution to this issue before 2015.  If the Government parties are to support this motion, they are committing to finding a political solution.</P>
        <P>The Irish dairy industry has 35,000 employees.  We export 80% of our dairy products.  We encouraged dairy farmers to invest in stock, machinery and parlours.  We facilitated improved farm buildings by means of grants because we recognised the indigenous value of the sector.  The number of dairy stock entering the system will increase significantly.  We must support the sector.  The Government must insist on a European quota that will not only ensure a soft landing but will also leave the Irish sector so well placed as to meet the objectives set out in the Food Harvest 2020 document up to and beyond 2015.</P>
        <P>When the former Minister introduced this document, he introduced a roadmap for the industry.  We appreciate the current Minister&rsquo;s commitment to it but we call on him to stand by and use it.  With farming bodies, we must enforce the will of the country in realising European-wide milk quotas.</P>
        <P>The Government must outline our stance in respect of beef, namely, that it makes no environmental sense whatsoever for the EU to allow its production to be displaced by less sustainable systems such as those operating in South America.  The quota sought by the Mercosur countries seriously undermines Ireland&rsquo;s beef industry and cannot be allowed.  For the sake of the beef sector, Ireland must be prepared to use its veto in the industry&rsquo;s defence.  Our beef exports are worth &euro;1.5 billion and 90% of our output is exported.  We are the largest exporter of beef in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 aims to create 3,500 to 4,000 jobs and provides for an increase of 50% and 20% in milk production and beef output, respectively.  We appreciate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this document but taking it in charge means the Government is responsible for its implementation and for ensuring the parameters, atmosphere, criteria and will that will allow for its success.</P>
        <P>The past week was a fine one for the country, given the way in which it welcomed its esteemed visitors, the way in which it was portrayed in a positive light and the way in which the hopes and aspirations of those who saw it were lifted.  We heard about &ldquo;Yes we can&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is f&eacute;idir linn&rdquo;, living the dream and spring being around the corner after a hard winter.  Our beef sector is in good shape, has good potential and possesses marvellous economic and social values dear to the hearts of those who own, manage and produce from our lands.  To the Government I say, do not blow it, stick to its guns and insist on a European milk quota and on the protection <Col N="377"/>of the beef industry from those who aspire to tear it asunder.  We do not want any sad stories.  One man has been synonymous with &ldquo;Yes we can&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is f&eacute;idir linn&rdquo;.  Do not allow anyone from this Chamber to tell us &ldquo;No we cannot&rdquo;.  It is not something with which we could live.  The Government will not do that but I must emphasise the significance of this motion.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the commitment by the coalition parties in Government in this regard.  The Government must show us its mettle and prove that in accepting the Food Harvest 2020 document, it can meet its demands and aspirations.  The first step is to protect the milk and beef sectors, as this will ensure a 50% gain in milk production and a 20% gain in beef output, which would be of great service to the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and compliment the Government and Deputy Moynihan on reaching an agreement on its unanimous acceptance.  It recognises the value of agriculture and the food industry to Ireland and shows that they remain at the heart of our economy.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, every success in the Department.  I spent some time there.  It is an important Department and he will do a good job.  He was in my county for a recent strawberry function, although he did not invite me to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Deputy John Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended another strawberry function a couple of days later where the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, and I launched the new Sunny Wexford Strawberries.  It is a marketing concept whereby County Wexford&rsquo;s strawberry growers have joined together to sell their strawberries nationally under that brand.  It has already proven to be a successful campaign among supermarkets and retailers up and down the country.  We all know that Wexford strawberries are the strawberries in this country.</P>
        <P>It is important that agriculture be addressed in the same way, that is, a single brand or logo under which to market products.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s election manifesto called for a single brand under which to market Ireland as a green food island.  This would be important, as all of the agricultural products produced in this country are practically organic, given how they are grass-based and of high quality.  It is important that we continue down that road and use these virtues as a selling point into Europe and elsewhere, as proposed by Deputy Cowen and others.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the agricultural industry has invested a great deal of money in farm waste management and environmental matters in particular.  They brought it up to a high standard, at enormous cost to farmers, but they were also given substantial grants by the outgoing Government.  I hope that will continue.</P>
        <P>I hear all the talk about the milk industry, which is important to this country.  We were able to deal with the possibility of going over quota this year, but we should consider a Europe-wide quota system.  We need to be careful, however, because we do not want to saturate the market.  I hear that the milk market will be opened up and we will do away with quotas in 2015, but we have not yet had an analysis of the effect of this on prices.  In addition, I am led to believe that co-ops are currently at peak capacity, and there will need to be major investment in milk co-operatives up and down the country before they can deal with increased milk quotas in the future.  Young farmers are saying to me they want to avail of milk quota and get into the milk industry, but again, there is a major cost factor, including the upgrading of milking parlours and the development of new milking parlours to cater for increased milk quotas.  I wonder what plans the Minister has for grant aid in this area, because it will not happen otherwise.  Farmers will not have the financial wherewithal to invest in this area unless they get substantial grant aid from the Government and from Europe.  We need to tread carefully in the future.</P><Col N="378"/>
        <P>I understand there was a vote in the European Parliament today on a report on the CAP by Albert Dess, a German MEP.  After 2015 we will have CAP reform, and I understand the report suggested that payments under pillar 1, single farm payments, and pillar 2, rural development, should be protected, that the term &ldquo;active farmer&rdquo; should be defined once and for all and that grant aid should be paid towards this area.  A debate on payment modules also took place.</P>
        <P>It is important to recognise that only 7% of farmers in the EU are under 35, and we have the same problem in Ireland.  Young farmers also need to be targeted under CAP reform.  We must consider the education of young farmers, as mentioned by Deputy Andrew Doyle earlier.  In the days of the Celtic tiger, as Deputy McEntee knows, many young farmers left the farm and went into the construction industry and related areas.  Thankfully, however, many of them are now returning to farming, including in my county of Wexford.</P>
        <P>During the years of the Celtic tiger, farming colleges were practically closed and there was not a great demand for places, but now things have gone in the other direction, and we have a major demand for extra farming places in agricultural colleges.  Last year, many young farmers in Wexford or their parents were ringing me to say they could not get into Kildalton or other agricultural colleges because there were no places.  This is an area close to the heart of the Minister of State.  We should consider seriously how we can increase the number of places in agricultural colleges.  We should also consider allowing such courses to be run in VEC colleges.  I understand that from 2012 there will be some changes under which that may be allowed to happen.  Young farmers from Wexford should not have to go to Cork or Meath or other faraway places.  These courses could be put on by vocational colleges and outreach centres such as the one run by Carlow IT in St. Peter&rsquo;s College.  This would be an ideal place to set up such a course for young farmers from Wexford and Carlow.  This is something the Minister should consider for the future.</P>
        <P>We had a large number of farmers outside the gates of Leinster House today.  It was like the old days, when the farmers used to come in busloads.  Something like five busloads came from Wexford and I am sure there were similar numbers from every other county.  I thought farmers only protested when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, but it was good to see them there today as the Labour Party and Fine Gael are in government.</P>

	<P Just="Left">They promised that they would be back on a regular basis.  It is important that the Government takes note of that.</P>
        <P>I want to mention the food supply chain.  Farmers are concerned that supermarkets, particularly the multinational supermarkets, are ripping off farmers.  I read in the last few days a report carried out by a European economic body, the European agri- and economics institute, entitled profit on invested capital in the agrifood sector, which pointed out a number of problems within the industry.  It stated that feed producers get 15% of the profit margins, co-ops or dairy producers get 18%, retail bodies get around 25% and the farmer, or the cowman, as one person wrote in the paper, gets 0.3%.  It can be seen that the farmer is the poor relation in this regard.  This is a matter of grave concern to farmers up and down the country.  We will see more protests about this.</P><Col N="379"/>
        <P>Strawberry producers tell me that when they are supplying strawberries to supermarkets, the supermarkets set up promotions under which customers can buy one pack and get one free, or get two packs for &euro;4, but it is the producer who must supply the strawberries at the reduced price so the supermarket can maintain its profits.  It is important this is tackled.  It will not be easy.  I was in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the then Minister, former Deputy Mary Coughlan, met the multinationals to discuss this issue, and they did not listen to her.  I am sure it will be the same with the present Minister.  However, it is in the interests of farmers and with the aim of creating and maintaining jobs that we must deal effectively with the multinationals and make sure the producer is getting a fair price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  While I accept there is an agreed motion before the House, there is a considerable difference between the Government and those of us on this side of the House on a number of important issues.  While we broadly agree on the policy framework that is now underpinning the agricultural industry, Food Harvest 2020, there are important factors that must be taken into consideration.  There is broad agreement on many of the points made in this document, but there are issues that need to be addressed.  It is important that new systems, new ways of doing business and new ways of improving the sector are developed.  If we are to see the kind of innovation that is necessary to reach the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, we will need ongoing input from this Government.  It will not be enough for the Government to say this is the legacy it was left by the previous Government.  It will need to develop its own set of initiatives to ensure there is support for the framework that is now in existence.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To that end, the Government will need to take a fresh look at the area of innovation, and as part of that, it will have to consider Teagasc and the service it provides.  It will need to consider the level of innovation it is delivering within its corporate structure, but also its level of involvement with farmers on the ground.  Sadly, a decision was taken by the board of Teagasc, as a result of budgetary measures, to close offices around the country and reduce the level of interaction between farmers and advisers, suggesting the private sector would somehow have the capacity to do much of the form-filling that was involved.  I have no problem with that in principle, but the agricultural advisers provided a much greater level of input into the capacity of farmers to re-engineer their ways of doing business, develop new streams of income and develop their farms to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      
        <P>I grew up on a small farm in the west.  As a result, I am aware of the importance of the work done by agricultural advisers over many years in assisting people who farmed on marginal lands in exploiting, to the greatest extent possible, the outputs from those lands.  There is a need for a complete review of the policy of Teagasc.  I request that the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, engage with the board of Teagasc and as its members to review, in their entirety, the proposals relating to the closure of some of the organisation&rsquo;s offices.</P>
        <P>I have no wish to be parochial but a number of offices in Clare are earmarked for closure.  The office in Ennistymon has already been closed and the one in Scariff is destined to follow suit.  I have examined, from an economic point of view, the logic behind the closure of the Scariff office and I can state that it makes absolutely no sense to me.  It is going to cost more to transfer the service from Scariff to Ennis.  We are discussing an agricultural service and it seems ludicrous to suggest that the entire delivery of advice to farmers would be centralised into an urban area.  That just does not make sense.  I ask the Minister of State to review what is proposed.  Perhaps we might have an opportunity to discuss the matter at some future date.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The previous speaker referred at length to the fair trade issue.  When it was in government, Fianna F&aacute;il promised action on this issue and significant moves had been made before the <Col N="380"/>party left office.  I hope the current Administration will take up the reins and move matters forward.  It was outrageous that farmers were obliged to take to the streets earlier today.  The number of farmers who took part in the protest outside the gates of Leinster House during what is their most productive and busiest period and especially when farming is going well should speak volumes to the Government and to those in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in particular with regard to the concerns that arise in the context of the issue of fair trade.</P>
        <P>It was scandalous that officers of the Competition Authority were allowed to raid the headquarters of the IFA.  If the main farming organisation is not in a position to speak on behalf of its members, it undermines the entire principle of representation.  What occurred would not have happened if a trade union were involved.  I do not understand why it was allowed to happen in this instance.  We all know that farmers are price takers and that it is the multiples which dictate the price.  If there is collusion, then I suggest that the Competition Authority should look towards the people who are setting the price.  Farmers certainly have no responsibility in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Government will be making a major and fundamental mistake if it does not take immediate action on this matter.  No one should be allowed to suggest that the organisation which represents farmers should not be in a position to seek to ensure a viable living for its members.  I do not know what the courts will ultimately decide in respect of this matter.  However, what happened in recent days does not get us to the nub of the matter, namely, where the price is set.  If a change in legislation is required in order that this might be achieved, then the Government should introduce the relevant measure quite quickly.  This matter, which arose on foot of the actions of the Competition Authority, must be dealt with without delay.  I hope the Government will bring forward proposals on it in the near future.</P>
        <P>I was disappointed by the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, during his first few days in office about the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the considerable curtailment, from &euro;5,000 to &euro;4,000, in the amount payable to farmers under the scheme.  Some of us on this side of the House fought hard when our party was in government to try to ensure that the scheme was put in place.  I am not trying to be exclusive with regard to this matter but Members from the west know the importance of the payments associated with the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the AEOS.  We are also aware of the effect such payments have in the context of the livelihoods of small operators.  Some of the latter are not commercially viable in their own right but they provide a good service and supply an appropriate level of commodity to the market.  Such schemes help to keep people on the land.</P>
        <P>As a result of the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, farmers availing of the AEOS will each be worse off to the tune of &euro;1,000.  There is some dispute about this matter but the money for the scheme was set aside in the Estimates and it is clear that a payment plan &mdash; with which the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials will be extremely familiar &mdash; which would have delivered up to &euro;5,000 to each farmer was envisaged.  I hope Minister, Deputy Coveney, will be in a position to reconsider this matter.  I contributed to the earlier debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill and if the Minister is concerned that there is a funding shortfall, I can inform him that the Government will be raising an additional &euro;110 million this year as a result of the introduction of the pension levy.  I suggest that he seek some of this money because, ultimately, it comes down to priorities.  I accept that money is scarce.  However, the Government is still generating money, particularly, as already stated, through the imposition of a pension levy.  So funding is available.</P>
        <P>It comes down to priorities.  If the Government is serious about supporting the vision set out in Food Harvest 2020 and if it is prepared to recognise the fundamental benefits this will deliver to the State through the creation and retention of employment and the protection of the rural <Col N="381"/>environment, it must then be prepared to make the necessary choices to support this policy.  In my opinion, such support must focus on encouraging research and development, ensuring that we obtain the maximum benefit from the land currently being farmed, particularly for those who have returned to farming, and backing those whose enterprises are not commercially viable in the current environment through the restoration of the &euro;5,000 upper limit relating to the AEOS.</P>
        <P>I request that a debate take place when the new joint committee on agriculture is established.  I expect that the latter will be set up in the near future, particularly as the Seanad is now sitting.  I ask that a consultative process be put in place within the Houses.  Due to the fact that there is general agreement on the importance of the industry, which is evidenced by the way in which this motion is being dealt with, I am of the view that there should be a more informal approach to the entire agriculture sector in the context of developing the policies relating to the vision I referred to at the outset.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to begin working with the new joint committee at the earliest opportunity so that the broad spectrum of views which exist might be presented to them through the committee by the various stakeholders in the sector.  Given that I come from the west, the aspects of agriculture with which I am most familiar relate to the beef and milk sectors.  I would be less familiar with milk and more conversant with the suckler cow and beef sector.  There are people with different interests, including, for example, those who operate in the horticulture sector &mdash; particularly in north County Dublin, on the border with the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency &mdash; who must also be heard.  There must be a significant level of input from all the stakeholders rather than Ministers outlining what they believe to be the best approach and then proceeding to adopt it without engaging in consultation.</P>

	<P>Food Harvest 2020 outlines the potential future for Irish agriculture.  It contains ambitious targets in relation to the dairy, beef, pig and sheep sectors.  I have some reservations about what is happening and on how Irish farmers are to be facilitated to meet the targets to which I refer.  A 50% increase in milk production and a 20% increase in beef production by 2020 will stretch the sector at a time when we have stated our intention to keep the fundamental principle of the family farm in place.</P>
        <P>As Food Harvest 2020 gears up, we are witnessing the retrenchment of the Teagasc advisory service countrywide.  The Teagasc office in Ennistymon in north County Clare has already been shut down and there is a proposal to close the office at Scariff in the east of the county.  In addition, there is the embargo on the recruitment of agricultural advisers.  The preferred option of Teagasc seems to be that of research and academic publication.  It is difficult to see how the organisation can leave aside its research on behalf of farmers in order to facilitate the goals of Food Harvest 2020, particularly if it is intent on closing or running down its advisory network.</P>
        <P>The Minister must carefully consider how we are to achieve the targets set down in Food Harvest 2020.  I am strongly of the view that the role of Teagasc in respect of this process must be redefined from two perspectives.  The first of these perspectives relates to the key role of the advisory service and office network, which are both allied to the continued education of Irish farmers.  The second perspective relates to the future of research facilities relating to the dairy, beef, sheep and pig sectors.  This model should not be the responsibility of Teagasc on its own, rather there should be a strategic partnership between it and farmers involved in the sectors.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that there is huge potential in Irish agriculture and that this potential will benefit the entire economy.  It is vital, therefore, that we should ensure that none of this potential is lost through bad judgment or inactivity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate has not alone been very welcome but also very encouraging, demonstrating a unity of purpose on all sides of the House to ensure agriculture and the agrifood sector will be at the centre of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</P>
        <P>It is now accepted Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery will be export-led.  Bord Bia estimates 11% of all exports last year came from the agrifood sector, an increase of almost 8% over the 2000-2009 average.  The agency also estimates that food and beverage exports may increase by 3.3% this year.</P>
        <P>The impact on the domestic economy is also particularly important, as illustrated by the fact that economic expenditure on raw materials and services accounts for 72% of total expenditure in the food and beverage sector.  Several speakers pointed to the agrifood sector&rsquo;s social as well as economic importance.  The Government recognises the value of agriculture and the agrifood sector, including the fishing, forestry and drinks industries and fully appreciates the contribution they make to the national economy, as well as to many local rural and coastal communities.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 charts the way forward for the next decade for this industry.  The Government is determined to ensure its ambitious targets are met.  As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, said last night, our job is to progress the implementation of the strategy and to build capacity so that we can build production.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies identified the dairy sector as one which has enormous potential for growth with calls to change the quota system.  This motion calls for an &ldquo;orderly expansion of the dairy industry in Ireland between now and the ending of milk quotas in 2015.&rdquo;  While the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, said he is trying to establish a coalition of countries that wishes to see dairy production expansion, the fact is that, as recently as last December, the European Commission came to the conclusion there was no need to revisit the quota elements of the 2008 Common Agricultural Policy health check agreement.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, we would like to see a soft landing for farmers in Ireland and other EU member states.  Ongoing challenges experienced by some member states, including Ireland, in trying to achieve a soft landing, should be acknowledged by the Commission.  Efforts should be made to help ensure a smooth transition from the milk quota regime in the period prior to 2015.</P>
        <P>The dairy sector is of critical importance for this country.  Several Members referred to the regulatory burden on the sector.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has no desire to impose any unnecessary administrative burden on farmers or the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P>Neither does it unnecessarily delay the processing of farm payments, as was suggested last night.  For the processing of payments, it is necessary to have regard to the various EU requirements.  For example, it is essential the Department&rsquo;s land parcel identification system is accurate.  Any failings or shortcomings in the system would leave the Department open to a very real risk of significant fines.  We cannot afford to take such a risk and we will not compromise the value of direct payments to farmers.  The criticism of the Department for delays in processing applications is misplaced.  Last year, Ireland was, once again, one of the first member states to release single payment funding.</P>
        <P>Several speakers referred to the possibility of a trade agreement with the Mercosur group of countries.  I share the deep concern of Members on all sides and agree that Ireland&rsquo;s interests must be protected.  The preliminary results of the EU impact analysis bear out our concerns, which are primarily though not exclusively, about beef.  All Members agree the displacement of Irish beef in the EU market by imported products would have significant economic and social consequences for rural Ireland.</P><Col N="383"/>
        <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I have been both impressed and encouraged by the optimism around agriculture and the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sectors.  This debate has been constructive and positive and demonstrates a shared vision for the future of the industry.  The past week has been a showcase for this country with the pictures from the State visits beamed around the world set to yield enormous benefits.  The image of Ireland as a green country is one on which we must capitalise, creating that strong link for consumers between Irish food, high environmental standards and sustainable production.</P>
        <P>Consumers must be at the heart of this sector and its development.  In that regard, the Brand Ireland concept, with which Bord Bia is progressing, will be a crucial marketing tool in the years ahead.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment is to work with all those in the industry to ensure it is greater than the sum of its current parts.  My determination and commitment, and that of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, is to ensure agriculture, the agrifood and marine sectors play a central role as part of the Government&rsquo;s plans for economic recovery and that the targets of Food Harvest 2020 are not only met, but where possible, surpassed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Michael Moynihan on bringing forward this motion and I thank the Minister for accepting it.  I was impressed the motion recognised the importance of the western counties to farming and to provide greater support to small and medium-sized farms.</P>
        <P>Last night I was heartened when the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney, pointed out there was an increase in the number of students attending agricultural colleges in recent years.  I know applicants have been turned away from Mountbellew Agricultural College recently.  Last year I and some Members from the 30th D&aacute;il had to meet with Teagasc authorities to ensure a reprieve against the closure of the college.  I must record my thanks to the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for their help in this regard.  I must also thank the Franciscan Order for providing the opportunity for many young people in the area to receive an education in agricultural science.  We must build on this and I believe Teagasc has a role in the future development of the agrifood sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Problems with red tape are being raised by many farmers.  Some in the west have informed me about the new sheep dispatch sheet for the sale of sheep which is a very complicated document.  The new agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, describes a specific type of fencing required by farmers.  This is not the way to go.  Many farmers have pointed out the problems with this over-bureaucratic approach.</P>
        <P>Today, farmers marched in Dublin to highlight the gap between the price they receive for milk and the price in the supermarkets.  This is another area that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>There has been disappointment with the delays in the 2010 AEOS payments and the maximum payment of &euro;4,000 in the new scheme.  This should be rectified, particularly when one considers how the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, improved farming over the past several years with up to 60,000 farmers participating in it.  It is frustrating that many of these environmental measures and schemes get much support in Europe yet Ireland cuts back on them.</P>
        <P>The Food Harvest 2020 programme has an ambitious target to increase the value of agrifood exports from &euro;8 billion to &euro;12 billion by 2020.  The green image of Irish agrifood must also be promoted in conjunction with tourism agencies.  I hope the Minister of State will ensure this progress is made.  I thank the Minister for taking on board this motion.  Deputy Michael <Col N="384"/>Moynihan&rsquo;s motion has allowed us to develop points on improvements in the agricultural sector, of which the farming community is deserving.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the first time I have had the opportunity to congratulate my colleague from the north east, Deputy Shane McEntee, on his ministerial appointment.  He represents the Meath East constituency while I represent Louth.  There is a code of good neighbourly behaviour in the north east for most of the year, except for a few months in the summer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>Due to the significant increase in the volume production of milk, there is a prospect of a severe super levy payment due from the State and individual farmers on 31 March 2012.  While production is buoyant in Ireland, it is not the case in other EU member states.  Based on the statistics for recent years, it is clear other member states are not even filling their milk production quotas.  It is unrealistic that Irish farmers will be penalised because of a marginal over-production when other farmers in the economic community area are not fulfilling their individual or State quotas.  There is a strong argument for the calculation of the super levy milk quota system on an EU community rather than national basis.  </P>
        <P>The Minister and his senior officials would be doing an excellent job of work for the dairy industry if they could succeed in getting a significant block of the unused quota of other States made available to Irish farmers.  This is an issue of urgent importance to the industry.  At a time when our economy could do with a leg-up from the EU decision-makers this is an obvious way to help, one which will not result in a cost in so far as the EU exchequer is concerned.</P>
        <P>On agricultural education, some 7% of farmers EU-wide involved in the primary end of agricultural product are under 35 years of age, which has clear implications for the industry going forward not alone in Ireland but right across the Union.  There is a need for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Teagasc to look at the educational programmes which they are currently organising.  I had occasion recently to make inquiries on behalf of a constituent wishing to take part in a green certificate course.  Owing to a reduction in the number of personnel operating in the educational end for Teagasc there appears to be no prospect of the green certificate course being delivered over the three year period.  It must be a full time course, which has its own implications for young people working on farms.  This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government promises that we will have a fair trade Bill, in respect of which there is an urgent need.  There is also an urgent need to get right the negotiating equilibrium between the primary end of the agricultural industry and the supermarket or retail outlet.  A weighting arrangement needs to be put in place that will tilt the balance between the farming community and the multiples to a point of fair play.  The multiples exercise a control that is way out of proportion to their position in the food chain supply industry in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority raided the offices of the Irish Farming Association in recent days.  It is hard to understand the reason it found it necessary to do so.  The agricultural industry is at this time facing much greater problems with the multiples, who might warrant such a visit at this point.  I am conscious that my colleague, Deputy Calleary, wishes to contribute.  I hope we will have an opportunity to revisit many of these points at a time when there is real prospect of the agriculture industry recovering and making a significant contribution to the economic recovery of this country.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P>If one wants to designate areas that are truly national wealth creating areas then the dairy and beef sectors clearly fill that bill.  They are way ahead of many other areas of economic activity, hence the importance of having policies tailored to ensure we are getting optimum benefit from their development and expansion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on Deputy Moynihan&rsquo;s motion and commend the Government for agreeing to it.  Like many Deputies, I share the sense of irony that we are debating a motion on the development of Irish agriculture and the promotion of jobs through the Irish agricultural industry on a day when thousands of Irish farmers, through the IFA, have gathered to protest at the action and inaction of another State agency.  I am sure many Members of the Fine Gael Party were nervous about members of their sister organisation being on the streets.</P>

	<P>I would not bet on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>As has been said by many Deputies on all sides, it is difficult to understand the actions of the Competition Authority last week in the context of the ongoing difficulties faced not alone by farmers but by many small producers in their dealings with large multiples.  It is difficult to understand why organisations such as the IFA, who are doing their utmost to keep the dangers of this issue in the public eye, are the ones being targeted.  Given the inaction of regulators during the past number of years, leading us to where we are in so many other sectors, one would have hoped that those regulators still in business would have learned how to do their job that bit better.  I know that the Minister, and I am sure the Minister of State, shares Members&rsquo; concerns.  However, I hope that concern is shared at the Cabinet table and that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will express his concern about this matter.  Otherwise this will continue.</P>
        <P>For those of us who deal on a daily basis with agricultural issues it is no surprise that an arm of State, through red tape, tried to block the progress of Irish farming.  Deputy Kitt has already referred to the difficulties in the new sheep scheme and we are all aware of the difficulties with the AEOS.  If we are to collectively maximise the potential of all sectors of Irish agriculture, to reach the ambitious targets laid down in Harvest 2020 and to secure the future not just of rural Ireland but Ireland as a whole, then we must as a House declare war on needless red tape and ridiculous over-inspection.  Surely, it is within the capacity of this House to devise a set of regulations and inspections that do the job that needs to be done in terms of compliance and keeping Europe happy but do not, as is currently the case, choke the opportunity to maximise the potential of Irish agriculture or frustrate many farmers to the extent that they would rather leave the industry than put up with it on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Surely, it is also within the capacity of this State to come up with a proper payment schedule and to give farmers information in regard to when they will be paid.  I do not share the enthusiasm or hope of which the Minister of State spoke in regard to payments being made on time.  Considerable difficulties and challenges have arisen in regard to mapping, issues that could be resolved if we had in place a more focused system that would allow people to get their money on time, again encouraging investment in the industry.</P>
        <P>The agreement we have in this House will form the backdrop of what the Minister and Minister of State will have to deal with in the coming years, namely, the renegotiation and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is one of the biggest economic issues facing this State.  It is on a scale of importance with the renegotiation promised by Government of the IMF-EU deal, such is the impact it will have on this country.  There is a willingness in the House to have a cross-party approach to agriculture.  The Minister and Minister of State should try to build on this as we move into the talks for 2013.  We all agree that failure to get the right <Col N="386"/>result from the review in 2013 will fatally undermine the potential for a home-grown economic recovery, a recovery based on our meats, dairy, grain and, most of all, vibrant rural economy.</P>
        <P>I did a great deal of work on farm safety during my time in the previous D&aacute;il, in respect of which the figures continue to rise.  None of us want to see needless injuries or deaths on farms across the country.  I again ask the Government, including the Minister of State as a practising farmer, to pay particular attention to this issue and to guide the Health and Safety Authority in its approach to this issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy Moynihan&rsquo;s motion has given us a roadmap in terms of planning agriculture and placing it at the heart of an economic recovery.  The work done by former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, on Harvest 2020 provides much direction in that regard.  The agreement we have in this House this evening around this motion and around the aims and ambitions for Irish agriculture should be maintained through the agricultural committee as face towards 2013 and the challenges this will place on communities across the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House, I am sharing time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.</P>
        <P>The group we met from SR Technics became unemployed through no fault of their own.  They received the statutory redundancy payment, not massive payments.  They were encouraged to avail of further education courses and a seminar was organised in the ALSAA fitness club at Dublin Airport with the various colleges to look at available options.  Some provision was made for the workers by F&Aacute;S, the city and county enterprise boards, the VEC and third level colleges and institutions in support of the more than 1,000 workers made redundant in 2009.</P>
        <P>A group of 55 workers opted for a tailor-made course in All Hallows College, 30 of whom are finishing year 2 of the course, while the remainder are in year 1.  The funding, provided through the European Globalisation Fund, EGF, runs out shortly.  Why were they allowed by the Government to commence a degree course if it knew funding would not be available for the full duration of the course?  The course is of four years duration, approved by the Department of Education and Skills and accredited by Dublin City University.  It is not practical to ask the men finishing year 2 to transfer to another course and begin again.  The men concerned could have applied to other colleges by the CAO mature student route, but they opted for this course which was tailor-made for their needs.</P>
        <P>There must be a way around this problem.  Could it be done through the Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn negotiating with All Hallows College or through the Springboard initiative, as announced by the Minister, or could the remainder of the course be covered under the free fees scheme?  Allowing this would hardly set a precedent as the fund will no longer be available to other workers made redundant.  All Hallows College is on the CAO list and part of the free fees system.  I do not see, therefore, why it is being considered a private college.  As a former guidance councillor, I never considered it as a private college.  The private colleges included the likes of Portobello College and Griffith College.</P><Col N="387"/>
        <P>I ask that a way be found for those currently on the course to be allowed to finish it.  As the State was prepared to fund other full-time courses at third level for the former SR Technics workers, why cannot the same be done for these men who had a legitimate expectation that funding would be available to allow them to complete the course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The workers received statutory redundance payments; there was no big pay-out.  As such, they are not in a position to pay college fees at this stage.  The investment they have made in time and energy was matched by funding from the EGF.  That financial investment should have seen accreditation at the end of the course, to which they are entitled.  I spoke to one of the workers yesterday and he told me the education element of his CV consisted of a group certificate awarded in the 1970s.  A BA degree would have given him the hope he would not end up long-term unemployed but skilled and able to commence his own business or build a new career. </P>
        <P>The workers were of the opinion that EGF funding would commence from the date it was approved by the European Union and run for two years from that date, September 2010.  They were not aware that the commencement date was the date of the initial application in October 2009, which was rejected.  An administrative process was also to have been initiated.  This has not occurred to date and it seems pointless to initiate such a process at this stage.  I wonder if the scheme is entirely in compliance with EGF programme requirements, given that the administrative process was not initiated and the fund is nearly exhausted.</P>
        <P>The students are too far into the degree course to change, as suggested in the letter from the Department of Education and Skills.  Changing at this stage would mean beginning year 1 elsewhere.  If the students did what was suggested, they might well be supported under the CAO system for four years, which would be much more expensive.  Many of the workers are in their 40s and early 50s.  They make the point that this was a really good course that they embraced with enthusiasm.  The fact that they are a group of mature students from the same background has been a positive for them.  Many have been doing the course for a full 12 months in order to complete it as soon as possible.  They are keen to get back to making a contribution and take advantage of their new skills, but it is now doubtful if they will be able to complete the course.  They are asking to be allowed to do this.  There are many half-baked schemes and courses with no result at the end of them, but there is massive potential for these 55 workers.  All that they ask is that they be allowed to complete the course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Deputies for raising this matter.</P>
        <P>The requirements in applying for and implementing approved applications for EGF co-financed programmes are prescribed by EU law.  EGF supported programmes are of finite duration.  Currently, they are required to be completed no later than 24 months from the date of submission of the relevant EGF application.  The binding timeframes are specified in the relevant European Commission decision addressed to the member state in approving its application.  Under the terms of the European Commission decision relating to the EGF application in support of redundant SR Technics workers, EGF co-funding can be used for measures delivered from the commencement of service provision on 25 March 2009 until 9 October 2011 at the latest.  When the Irish authorities raised the issue of the extension of the current EGF implementation period, this position was reconfirmed by the Commission.</P>
        <P>It was always made clear to the redundant SR Technics workers, including at a number of EGF specific public meetings to showcase the funded supports, and the various service providers that only supports provided within that timeframe would be funded.  That the Department made the expiry date of 9 October 2011 clearly known in advance was acknowledged by a delegation of the former SR Technics workers attending the course at All Hallows College when they met departmental officials last month on this matter.  Moreover, All Hallows College <Col N="388"/>was informed in writing by the Higher Education Authority of the expiry date for EGF funding of their course of 9 October 2011 at the latest.  In turn, the college has submitted a number of claim forms to the authority for funding under the EGF, clearly indicating that the completion date of the course in question is 30 September 2011.  It is, therefore, not clear how students could have begun this course at the college earlier this year in the expectation that the EGF would co-finance study beyond 9 October 2011.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that All Hallows College has been extremely helpful in running what was originally a part-time course on a full-time basis under the EGF programme.  This was done in order to accelerate students&rsquo; progress on a modular basis and maximise the scope for them to benefit from the EU funding available.</P>
        <P>In addition to a number of past meetings, briefings and communications with members of the delegation of former workers studying at All Hallows College over the course of EGF programme, officials from my Department met the delegation last month.  They discussed in detail both the position on EGF funding and the full range of options and supports available to students generally who wish to pursue education programmes in the publicly funded higher education system.  I have also recently written to an individual member of the delegationre-emphasising the position as outlined.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection has confirmed that if the students remain on the programme on a full-time basis beyond the EGF cut-off date, they will be entitled to retain their back to education allowance.  This would be a considerable advantage to the students providing income support while progressing their education.</P>
        <P>An option open to the students would be to engage with All Hallows College to seek a reduced course fee for continuation of the course full-time but at their own expense.  Alternatively, the relevant students could apply to participate in other full-time courses in the public system that are part of the free fees scheme without losing their back to education allowance.  These are matters of individual choice for the relevant students, not for the Department.</P>
        <P>In terms of supports being offered outside the EGF programme, the particular education course in question is not part of the Department&rsquo;s free fees scheme which funds full-time higher education course fees for first-time students progressing on the National Framework of Qualifications.  All Hallows College, a privately funded institution, had applied to the Department for access to the free fees scheme for this programme in 2010.  However, the application was turned down having regard to the fact that the programme was not generally available through the CAO and because of the overall constraints on funding.  Further, in line with the recommendations of the new strategy for higher education, the policy of the Department is to provide for no further extension of free fees funding to specific courses in private institutions such as All Hallows College.  Additional funding is not available elsewhere in the Department&rsquo;s Vote to fund this course for this cohort of students.  To do so outside normal requirements and rules would set an unsustainable precedent in terms of other EGF programmes and in terms of access to education programmes generally.  I again thank the Deputies for raising this matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Deputy Seamus Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  As we know, apprenticeship is vital as part of skills development for the building and construction sector.  F&Aacute;S, despite considerable criticism in some other areas, has delivered on the programme of training in this area for a considerable period and has provided a steady stream of trained and suitable personnel for this sector.  While we all know of the decline of the sector and the impact it has had on the economy, we must keep the focus on the longer-term position, namely, that the skills involved will be required, albeit with a much greater focus, in years to come.</P><Col N="389"/>
        <P>There is some degree of uncertainty as to how these courses will be delivered in the immediate and the medium term.  F&Aacute;S is delivering the courses at present but there is some suggestion that the institutes of technology might take over responsibility for them.  It goes without saying that students, tutors and lecturers would like clarification on this as quickly as possible.  I will not labour the point.  I am sure the Minister of State understands the need for information.  My case rests and perhaps he will advise us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the current position of the Department of Education and Skills.  The standard-based apprenticeship programme is an alternance training and education programme for employed apprentices for which F&Aacute;S has statutory responsibility.  The training and education programme generally comprises three off-the-job phases and four on-the-job phases.  The off-the-job training and education is generally provided by F&Aacute;S at phase 2, and phase 4 and phase 6 are provided by the institutes of technology and colleges of further education.</P>
        <P>The registration of apprentices, including in the carpentry and joinery trade, by employers has reduced considerably since 2005 due to the reduction in the level of activity in the construction sector.  In 2010 an interdepartmental working group and F&Aacute;S undertook a detailed forecast of the number of apprentices that would be expected to be recruited by employers in the period up to 2014.  This forecast is currently being updated to provide a forecast to 2015, taking account of the changes in the level of economic activity that have taken place since the report was commissioned and the lower level of registrations experienced to date.  It is expected that a draft forecast report of apprentice intake for the period up to 2015 will be available in September 2011.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, the trade of carpenter and joiner provided the highest employment among all of the designated trades.  Employment reached its peak in 2007 at 43,400, which is almost double the level recorded in 1998.  The apprentice recruitment levels in the construction and joinery trade began to contract two years earlier than the employment stock.  The apprentice intake level, unlike the trend in employment, reached its peak level of 2,127 in 2005 and declined thereafter to 138 in 2009.  Based on forecasts of apprentice registrations, the training capacity provided for the off-the-job training is agreed with the training providers based on the current population of apprentices progressing through their apprenticeship as well as the current and future forecast registrations expected from employers.</P>
        <P>The capacity for phase 2 training in carpentry and joinery for 2011 is eight courses, comprising 112 places.  The capacity for phase 2 in carpentry and joinery for 2012 will depend on the level of registrations by employers.  The capacity for phase 4 and phase 6 for the academic year 2010-11 is 102 blocks, comprising 1,632 places, to provide for the progression of the current apprentice population.  The capacity planned for phase 4 and phase 6 for the academic year 2011-12 is 30 blocks, or 480 places, and this lower level is based on the apprentice population now expected to progress and accounts for the lower level of registrations in the previous two years.</P>
        <P>The Department, in conjunction with F&Aacute;S and other relevant stakeholders, continues to monitor and assess the apprenticeship capacity requirements for all trades, including carpentry and joinery.  I again thank the Deputy for allowing me the opportunity to outline the Department&rsquo;s position relating to this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnthonyLawlor"><NameTxt>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue regarding the necessary infrastructure for the continued expansion of Intel in Leixlip.  Intel is one of Ireland&rsquo;s biggest employers, with more than 4,000 people working in either chip <Col N="390"/>manufacturing or research and development.  Indirectly, Intel supports up to eight times this number in the business and service sector in the Kildare, Meath and Dublin areas.</P>
        <P>One of the main reasons the company located at this site more than two decades ago was that necessary infrastructure was available along with a qualified labour market.  Currently, Intel is retrofitting an existing building as this would be cheaper than starting from scratch.  This $500 million investment will create 850 construction jobs in the two year fit-out of this building and the move will create more than 1,000 new jobs in this facility.  Key to all this investment, however, is the continued attractiveness of Ireland as a place to invest, particularly with our 12.5% corporation tax.  I was delighted to tour the facility recently with the managing director, Eamonn Sinnott, and the Taoiseach, who stressed that the existing rate of corporation tax would be maintained.  Consequently, I was delighted to hear the Minister, Deputy Noonan, reiterate this in Paris today.</P>
        <P>There is also a well-qualified labour market and Intel has developed links with local schools and NUI Maynooth.  In addition, there is the issue of the necessary infrastructure to support this expansion, which includes the huge water requirements of this plant.  For the previous two winters, during extreme weather conditions many homes in the area of Celbridge, Leixlip and Maynooth suffered severe water shortages while the council was able to maintain supplies to keep the Intel plant at Leixlip operating.  With this new expansion, there needs to be an increase in the water quantities made available to this area of north Kildare.</P>
        <P>We all know that in the eastern region, water supply is on a knife edge.  It would be a shame if employment suffered as a result of water shortage.  There was previous experience of this when lack of a sufficient water supply in the county resulted in a potential major employer locating elsewhere.  I urge the Minister to allow the funding to be made available as soon as possible to improve water supply, not alone for the potential for jobs to be generated but also for the householders and small businesses in the area.  It is of no use to sanction funds for upgrading the water supply after the factory has been retrofitted, resulting in Intel being unable to commence operations in this facility.  This water upgrade must occur in tandem with the retrofit expansion.  Consequently, will the Minister of State assure the House that the necessary funds will be made available immediately and that Kildare County Council will speedily upgrade the water supply to this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Lawlor, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, for the opportunity to set out the current position on the provision of water infrastructure in north Kildare, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure which supports and encourages economic development in the area.  Significant water services infrastructural development is taking place countrywide at present and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2010-12 is providing the funding to support this development.  In addition to its public health, environmental compliance and water conservation focus, this programme has among its stated objectives the need to support economic and employment growth throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Exchequer funding of &euro;435 million has been provided for the water services capital programme in 2011, with &euro;350 million of this provision dedicated to the water services investment programme and the balance of &euro;85 million allocated to the rural water programme.  The water services investment programme comprises 130 contracts and water conservation projects which were in progress at the end of 2009, to the value of &euro;1 billion; 340 new contracts with an estimated value of &euro;1.8 billion, including around 80 water conservation contracts, with an estimated value of &euro;321 million, that have been prioritised to start construction over the period 2010-2012; and 190 schemes and water conservation projects to be progressed through their earlier planning stages during 2010-2012.</P><Col N="391"/>
        <P>In County Kildare alone, there are three contracts listed as at construction, and a further 14 are listed to start during the lifetime of the programme.  The estimated cost of these contracts is just over &euro;172 million.  As part of the programme, the Barrow abstraction water supply scheme is one of the most significant projects being undertaken in the county.  Although the contract for this scheme was signed only recently, when completed it will provide County Kildare with a new water treatment plant at Srowland, thereby reducing Kildare&rsquo;s future demand on the Liffey system that serves the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>As part of the overall Kildare county water strategy, the Srowland water supply will enable Kildare County Council to become more self-reliant in respect of the supply of water in the county.  A further element of that strategy, the Castlewarden-Ballygoran water pipeline and reservoir contract, recently approved to go to tender by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will utilise water from Srowland and deliver it to Ballygoran in north Kildare.  This contract, consisting of a new 20,000 cu m service reservoir at Ballygoran and over 17.5 km of water main, will bring water to Barberstown Cross and the western area of Celbridge.  The new reservoir will also supply water to the Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip and Straffan areas.  Any requirements to meet the upgrading of facilities at Intel can be accommodated through a pipeline link from this supply to Intel and this can be completed within a very short time.</P>
        <P>The Minister is keenly aware of the existing economic and employment benefits of an enterprise such as Intel.  The Deputy can be assured that his Department continues to work closely with Kildare County Council to advance the water supply, and other water services infrastructure requirements of the area.</P>

	<P>Almost 38 years ago the then President, Erskine Childers, laid the foundation stone for the Kilbarrack-Foxfield community centre on Greendale Road, Kilbarrack, Dublin 5, following years of fund-raising by local residents.  With the help of the HSE, F&Aacute;S, local representatives including myself and the then Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, a Kilbarrack aftercare community programme was developed from May 1996 and finally established in 1998.  In January 2001, this project became the Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, KCCP.  Based in the Kilbarrack Foxfield community centre, KCCP has developed a wide range of impressive programmes to combat drug use and provide information and recreation for the young people of the parish.  Under the outstanding leadership of the retired Garda superintendent and chairperson, Mr. Michael Finn, Ms Marian Clarke and Mr. Declan Byrne, KCCP carries out this core work through a community employment programme which caters for more than 15 clients recovering from addiction problems.  A wide range of activities including IT training, cooking skills, arts and crafts, yoga, drama, gym and fitness classes and relaxation techniques are provided for clients and many of these services are available to the wider community in Kilbarrack-Foxfield.  In addition, KCCP provides a regular attractive local newsletter, The Snapper, aimed especially at young people and has carried out a range of important and informative reports including Young People &amp; Drugs, in 2004; A Prevalence Study of Drug Use, also in 2004; and Transforming Kilbarrack &mdash; A Proposal For A New Youth And Community Resource Centre, in 2009.  The work of KCCP is strongly supported by the north-east drugs taskforce, the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, SIPTU, local youth and sporting bodies and the three Dublin North East Deputies who met KCCP a few weeks through a meeting I organised in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Given the tremendous track record of KCCP, I was astonished to learn during the general election that the leaseholders of Kilbarrack-Foxfield community centre, Kilbarrack and District Community Association, KADCA, had served KCCP with papers concerning a court action to evict KCCP from the centre.  A large public meeting of more than 200 people was facilitated on 21 February by our famous Kilbarrack community leader, Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Neill, at St. Benedict&rsquo;s resource centre.  I attended the meeting for a time.  It voted overwhelmingly in favour of rejecting the eviction and for the retention <Col N="392"/>of KCCP&rsquo;s services at the community centre.  A further large public meeting of more than 300 people on 2 March, called by the leaseholders, KADCA, passed, with an overwhelming majority, a vote of no confidence in the KADCA committee and a similar vote in favour of KCCP staying in the hall was again supported by a massive majority.  On 23 March a third large public meeting elected a new local residents association, the Kilbarrack-Foxfield Community Residents Association, KFRCA, led by Ms Madeline McNally-Murray.  The members are pledged to operate the community centre fully for community use and have it upgraded to a high standard.  However, in spite of this positive development the legal eviction action is reportedly being continued by individuals connected to KADCA.</P>
        <P>I call tonight for this action to be withdrawn immediately and for former members of KADCA to support the new Kilbarrack-Foxfield Community Residents Association to begin operating the community centre and all its important facilities, including the key services of the Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, KCCP.  Dublin City Council has a key role in the resolution of this distressing and time-consuming matter.  The council granted KADCA a 99-year lease in November 1978 for the community centre but public meetings have heard that this lease may now be legally infirm because it is claimed that the leaseholding body did not have a continuous legal existence from 1975 onwards, and especially during the 20-year period, 1987 to 2007.  Whether that is the case, Dublin City Council has a clear duty to review the 1974 lease and ensure the retention of the KCCP project and its 41 jobs at the community centre.  I have called on local area and city management to urgently investigate and report on this key issue.  I was informed that there have been three substantial efforts at mediation on this matter in the past ten years which have failed in spite of KCCP&rsquo;s full engagement and efforts to be co-operative.  It is now time for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Reilly, and the Dublin city manager to step in and insist on an immediate resolution.  This should recognise the clear wishes of the people of the two Kilbarrack parishes to retain in their community centre, supported by a sublease if necessary, the critically important and hard won services and facilities of Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy James Reilly.  The Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, KCCP, is located at Thornville Road in Kilbarrack, at a premises leased by Dublin City Council to Kilbarrack and District Community Association, KADCA.  KCCP is funded by the HSE to provide rehabilitative, prevention and education services and a parental support service to the Kilbarrack community.  The Department of Health and Children has also allocated funding for 2011 in respect of KCCP, as a drug-related project in the Dublin north-east local drugs taskforce area.  The funding and accounting for this project is channelled through the HSE.  It is the responsibility of the directors of KCCP to acquire suitable alternative premises from which to operate, if required, in order to receive ongoing funding towards the valuable local services it provides.   I understand that both the HSE and the local drugs taskforce have engaged with representatives of KCCP and KADCA on several occasions over a number of years in an effort to mediate the various issues that have arisen.  Unfortunately, the matter is now the subject of legal proceedings and as such, it would be inappropriate for me to make any comment.</P>

	<P>There was no delay in submitting my Department&rsquo;s progress report under the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement. It was forwarded to the Department of Finance on the 4th of May. The report outlines the significant progress made by my Department, which has been engaged in a fundamental process of re-organisation, major reductions in staffing levels and improvement of its business processes, including major changes to the local office network. </P>
        <P>Of the 24 specific actions outlined in the plan, we have reported real progress in 20, including a reduction of 173 staff and administrative savings of nearly &euro;14million since the end of March 2010. This brings to 1,200 the number of staff reductions achieved by my Department since 2005. These reductions have been driven by a process of re-organisation, changes in the way schemes and programmes are managed, reductions in disease levels, and advanced use of information technology. The Action Plan set out under the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement will further deepen the change management process that is now well underway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am of course concerned that Ireland could be over quota in the 2011/2012 milk quota year. Favourable market and weather conditions during the 2010/2011 milk quota year contributed to a dramatic increase in milk production, which resulted in a remarkable turnaround from a position where the country was 10 per cent under quota at the end of the 2009/2010 milk quota year. Increased heifer retention is also a significant factor in what is expected to be a further increase in milk production in 2011/2012, and in subsequent years. Indeed, estimated delivery figures for April 2011 point to an 18 per cent increase over April 2010, and a projected national position of 8.67% over quota. </P>
        <P>In such circumstances, it is appropriate to again remind all dairy farmers of the need to carefully plan their production activities and to pay close attention to the limitations imposed by the quota regime if they are to avoid potentially very damaging super levy fines. Even allowing for a further increase of one per cent in the national quota since 1 April 2011, recent delivery trends, if repeated, will put the country in serious danger of going over quota. It is therefore incumbent upon every milk producer to exercise the necessary caution and to seek advice from, for example, Teagasc on the most sensible approach to be taken in managing their enterprises as they enter a crucial phase of the preparations for quota abolition in 2015.</P>
        <P>For my part, I intend to continue my efforts to raise the issue of the soft landing at every opportunity with Member State colleagues and with the Commission. The latter has resisted attempts to revisit this matter, and there is, in any event, no guarantee that a majority of Member States will support calls for a more flexible milk quota regime. Therefore Irish dairy farmers must continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 54 together. </P>
        <P>To coincide with the next EU multiannual financial framework, discussions are underway on the policy direction for the CAP after 2013. Ireland has taken an active part in the discussions to date in the Council and in bilateral meetings with the Commission, European Parliament, other Member States and groups of Member States.  The size of the CAP budget is likely to be determined by Finance Ministers and EU Heads of State and Government in the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework.</P>
        <P>Aside from seeking a well-resourced CAP, my main priorities in the upcoming negotiations on the CAP are:</P>
        <P LI="1">To retain Ireland&rsquo;s current funding both for direct payments and for rural development in any redistribution of CAP funds between Member States;</P><Col N="395"/>
        <P LI="1">To obtain flexibility in the payment model or method for distribution of single payment funds to farmers within Member States; and</P>
        <P LI="1">To retain investment and afforestation measures in the list of options for Member States in the Rural Development regulation.</P>
        <P FLI="0">A Commission communication setting out broad policy options for the future CAP &ldquo;The CAP towards 2020&rdquo; was presented on 18 November 2010.  Following discussion on this communication at the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers, a majority of Member States lent their support at the March Council to a series of conclusions drafted by the Hungarian Presidency.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication was the first formal step in the negotiating process for the CAP after 2013.  The formal legislative proposals are due to be tabled by the Commission later this year.  In that respect, the Presidency conclusions provide a strong signal to the Commission of the views of Member States in this process.  I believe the Presidency&rsquo;s text was an inclusive presentation of Member States&rsquo; positions and provides good guidance for the legislative work of the Commission.</P>
        <P>My view is that we need a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013 to ensure security of food supply, to maintain family farming in Europe and, to promote competitiveness and innovation.  The continuation of direct payments to farmers is fundamental to achieving these goals.  Decoupled income supports, together with the judicious use of market management measures, serve to support and stabilise farm incomes and provide the platform for the production of food and sustainable management of our natural resources and balanced rural development.</P>
        <P>We also need to provide a series of targeted measures in the second pillar so that Member States can focus on the particular needs of their own regions and sectors.  I am particularly focused on the need for investment measures to restructure and modernise family farms in the context of our Food Harvest 2020 ambitions.  We must also of course provide appropriate scope to assist farmers with measures to underpin and improve the sustainability of their production systems and to encourage afforestation.</P>
        <P>It is very early days in these negotiations.  We still have to see the detailed legislative proposals and there will be difficult negotiations ahead, firstly to secure adequate funding from the overall multiannual financial framework and then to secure the CAP policies that are best suited to Irish needs. In addition to representing the Irish view at Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings I have recently met with my French, Spanish and Danish counterparts.  I also plan to meet with my UK counterpart, Secretary of State Spellman over the coming weeks.  I will also have the opportunity to engage with my EU counterparts at the Informal Council of Ministers meeting in Hungary next week.  At official level also we have engaged actively with our colleagues in other Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament.

	<P>Agriculture and the agri-food processing sector is Ireland&rsquo;s most important indigenous industry.  It has a key role <Col N="396"/>to play in terms of direct economic activity and is one of the growth sectors designated to advance our national export led economic recovery. </P>
        <P>In my view, this sector provides a strong base for national economic development.  Currently, the overall industry has an annual output of around &euro;24 billion and most importantly is strongly embedded in the Irish economy. It remains Ireland&rsquo;s most important manufacturing sector, accounting for over 6% of GDP.  A total of over 135,000 are currently employed in the production of agri-food and fisheries products, which is approximately 7.4% of national employment. This sector is the primary outlet for the produce and output of the country&rsquo;s 128,000 family farms and includes approximately 600 food and drinks firms.  Its wide geographic spread throughout the country plays a major part in sustaining rural and coastal communities.</P>
        <P>A further important facet of the sector is the extent to which it is embedded in the economy and contributes to national prosperity.  Due to its  low import content and low profit repatriation levels, the net foreign earnings of this sector amount to 32% of the total net foreign earnings from primary and manufacturing industries.  According to Forfas, the food industry spends over &euro;9.5 billion on Irish goods and services, representing 71% of total expenditure in 2009, far higher than the 44% for all manufacturing industry.</P>
        <P>This industry has a huge export orientation with exports currently over  &euro;7.8 billion. Over the past decade, the Irish agri-food, forestry and fisheries sector has competed successfully on the world stage and has demonstrated its capacity to perform as a major player in the global food and drink market. Currently, Irish food and drink produce is exported to more than 160 countries. This multi-million export industry has also undergone continuous development as well as demonstrating considerable flexibility in responding to emerging market opportunities. Over the period it has moved from a largely commodity based sector, underpinned by market support mechanisms, to a far greater reliance on consumer-focused, value-added product.</P>
        <P>In summary, in my view the three key attributes of the sector are</P>
        <P LI="1">It&rsquo;s embedded contribution to employment and exports,</P>
        <P LI="1">It&rsquo;s ability to garner foreign export earnings; and</P>
        <P LI="1">The potential of the sector to generate export led growth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Together these provide the solid foundation for positioning this progressive indigenous industry as one of the central components of the country&rsquo;s export driven recovery.</P>
        <P>In the light of this potential, the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 is a key commitment of the Programme for Government.  I am personally focused on progressing the wide range of state actions needed to drive implementation of this strategic document, which was drawn up by key figures in the sector.  It includes ambitious targets to be achieved by 2020 including:</P>
        <P LI="1">Increase milk production by 50%.</P>
        <P LI="1">Improve the value-added in the sector by &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P LI="1">Achieve an exports target of &euro;12 billion, a 42% increase.</P>
        <P LI="1">Increase the value of primary output of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by &euro;1.5 billion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Actions have already been taken to progress implementation.  A High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC), involving the CEOs of the relevant state agencies, has been established specifically to</P><Col N="397"/>
        <P LI="1">ensure a fully joined up effort on the part of State bodies in the implementation of FH2020;</P>
        <P LI="1">to encourage proactive engagement by the agri-food industry and private sector with the implementation process;</P>
        <P LI="1">and to act as a &ldquo;clearing house&rdquo; for issues relating to the development of the sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I chair this Committee and I look forward to chairing its next meeting which is scheduled for 22 June next.</P>
        <P>I will continue to work to make substantial progress towards the achievement of the agri-food industry targets, and, this summer, I will produce a progress report which will outline the actions taken on each of the 215 recommendations in Food Harvest 2020 and identify key features of the road ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The total level of current investment in agri-food research is significant and comprises a number of sources. </P>
        <P>My Department operates 2 competitive funding programmes for agri-food research, namely the Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM) and the Stimulus Research Programme under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Awards under the 2 Programmes since 2005 amount to &euro;131m while expenditure in 2011 will amount to about &euro;19.1 m.  The FIRM and Stimulus Programmes are open to the public research organisations and higher education institutions via Research Calls announced periodically. The Programmes are directed at building capability, expertise and critical mass through inter-institutional, multi-disciplinary collaboration. They fund research along the continuum from basic through fundamental/applied to the pre-commercial stage.  I would hope to be in a position to announce some new awards under FIRM and Stimulus in the near future arising from a Call my Department issued in the Autumn of 2010, which was closely linked to achieving the targets set out in <i>Food Harvest 2020.</i></P>
        <P>A portion of the annual grant-in-aid to Teagasc is allocated to research. In 2010 this amounted to approximately &euro;49 million (including pay). This goes towards supporting research at its various Research Centres and is directed at its 4 programme areas, namely: Animal &amp; Grassland Programme; Food Programme; Crops, Environment &amp; Land use Programme; and Rural Economics &amp; Development Programme.</P>
        <P>Investment committed to seafood-related research by the Marine Institute, under the Marine Research Sub-Programme of the NDP, for projects that range in duration from one to seven years, amounts to &euro;12.9m since 2007.  Expenditure on these projects in 2011 is estimated at &euro;1.9m.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland (EI) administers awards to companies for food related research under the &ldquo;Fund to Improve Food Industry Competitiveness&rdquo; on behalf of my Department.  The development of R&amp;D initiatives is one of the key aims of this Fund. In 2010, as part of the Fund, EI launched a dedicated food Call under its Innovation Voucher Scheme. The Scheme provides funding worth &euro;5,000 for small Irish food companies where companies can obtain an innovative solution to a technical or business challenge from a Higher Education Institute in Ireland or Northern Ireland.  The Innovation Voucher Scheme saw 145 vouchers being approved in 2010 and 3 more Calls are taking place in 2011.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>Non-exchequer funding arises mainly under the <i>EU&rsquo;s 7th Framework Programme (FP7)</i> which is the largest public good research programme in the world.  FP7 provides an opportunity for Irish research institutions and companies, including SME&rsquo;s, to attract external funding for agri-food research in these challenging budgetary times. It also provides them with an opportunity to benefit from collaborating with other high ranking scientists from across Europe and beyond.</P>
        <P>The main element of FP7 of relevance to agri-food research is Theme 2 &ldquo;Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, and Biotechnology (FAFB)&rdquo; which has a budget of &euro;1.9b over the 7 year period 2007-2013. Ireland had secured &euro;8.5m under this Thematic area up to 2010. Both Teagasc and the Marine Institute have been very successful in attracting funding from the Programme.</P>
        <P>Investment in research by the private sector arises mainly in the food area. Most of the investment in food research is carried out by the larger dairy oriented companies, both indigenous and foreign owned multinationals based here such as those involved in the manufacture of infant formula.</P>
        <P>Research and development priorities, including those related to agri-food, are set out in the Programme for Government which, in particular, endorses the recommendations in the <i>Food Harvest 2020</i> Report.  In this regard, it is generally acknowledged that research has a major role to play in achieving the planned further expansion and innovation in the dairy and meat sectors and in helping to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the sector.</P>
        <P>Research is also seen as critically important to helping the sector face the challenges that lie ahead such as achieving the emissions targets in the context of climate change and ensuring the general environmental sustainability of the sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated previously, I am very concerned about the EU/MERCOSUR negotiations.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue at both the March and April meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers and expressed my reservations about these negotiations, particularly regarding the impact a deal with MERCOSUR might have on the Irish and EU beef sector.  I also conveyed my concerns directly to Commissioner Ciolos in a private meeting in advance of the March Agriculture Council.  At the Council meeting in April, I highlighted the importance of the beef sector in Ireland where 80% of our production is exported, almost all of it to other EU countries.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in raising this issue at European level. I have repeatedly requested that impact assessments on the EU/ Mercosur negotiations should be carried out and the results shared with member states before any offers are made in the negotiations.  We expect to see the full results from the Commission impact analysis within the next few weeks.  Initial results suggest that this will confirm our view of the very negative effects it could have on the beef sector and also on the EU agriculture sector generally.  Once the full results are available I believe it is vital that they are fully and carefully examined in the Agriculture and Trade Councils.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>At the Agriculture Council in April, France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Slovenia and Portugalall intervened to support the call for transparency and discussion of impact assessments. I have specifically urged the Commission to exercise extreme caution in the negotiations and to take on board Irish proposals on sustainability and on measures to mitigate the effect of tariff quotas in the beef sector. My officials have had a series of meetings with senior Commission officials and have made several presentations and submitted a number of papers to the Commission explaining the implications of such an agreement for Irish agriculture, and the beef sector in particular.</P>
        <P>At a bilateral meeting with the French Minister for Agriculture in Paris on 18 March, I raised my concerns about these negotiations and the effect on the beef sector. My concerns were shared by the French Minister and we agreed to a joint initiative to highlight the positive contribution of EU extensive beef production to the global fight against climate change. I also met separately with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn on 3 May to express my deep concerns about the negotiations and the possible implications arising from the impact assessments.</P>
        <P>It is obviously desirable that any FTA negotiations should deliver an increase in trade opportunities and a new trading environment that is equitable and fair to all of the key sectors, economic operators and individual Member States.  I was therefore particularly concerned at the preliminary findings of the impact assessments of the EU/Mercosur negotiations, which were presented to Member States at a Technical Group meeting in May.  While this analysis  shows an overall net gain to the EU, it also shows that substantial losses could arise in a number of key agriculture sectors and that these would seriously impact on many Member States. The impact assessments suggest that an equitable balance of advantage will be very difficult to achieve.</P>
        <P>When my colleague, Minister of State for European Affairs, Lucinda Creighton TD met with her French counterpart in Paris on 11 May, they discussed the current negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mercosur. In the joint communiqu&eacute; that issued from that meeting it stated that France <i>and Ireland believe it is vital to avoid concluding an agreement that will damage European agricultural interests, particularly for the beef and poultry sectors. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the priority of concluding the Doha Round.</i></P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Mr. Richard Bruton TD is as concerned as I, about the potential negative impact a Mercosur Free Trade Agreement might have on our economy, based on the draft impact assessments undertaken by the Commission.  He requested that the EU/Mercosur negotiations be put on the agenda of that Council meeting, which took place on 13 May, 2011.  At that meeting, he emphasised the Government&rsquo;s view that any final agreement with Mercosur needs not only to provide extensive new market access to exporters but also that it cannot undermine the viability of any particular sector, especially our agriculture sector.  Furthermore he said that the impact assessments now being evaluated by the Commission must be subjected to scrutiny and review by both the Trade and Agriculture Councils and that these reviews should take place in advance of any exchange of offers taking place. France, Luxembourg, Poland, Belgium, Finland, Romania, Lithuania, Greece supported the concerns and expectations of Ireland on substance and procedure in relation to the Impact Assessments. Minister Bruton also emphasised these issues in a separate meeting he had with Commissioner DeGucht following the Council.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that any agreement must not undermine the continued viability of a particular sector in individual member states. Because of the important  potential long-term implications for the future of the EU agriculture and food sector, the EU has to take special account of its critical interests in this area and in particular the economic importance to the EU of the <Col N="400"/> sector as well as its contribution to food security, sustainability and the delivery of the EU 2020 strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 55 together.</P>
        <P>I am very concerned about the unacceptable practice of discarding fish at sea and I am fully committed to working both nationally and internationally to bring about an end to this practice.</P>
        <P>Commissioner Damanaki has placed discarding of fish high on her agenda for the Common Fisheries Policy reform and at my meeting with her on the 14th  of April made clear that I  was committed to giving Ireland&rsquo;s support to assisting the Commissioner in identifying and implementing the appropriate measures to effectively address discards.</P>
        <P>At home I have taken a number of opportunities to discuss this complex subject with the Irish fishing industry. I am happy to say that they are also grappling with ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate discards and are currently engaging in trials on selective gears in the Celtic Sea haddock and whiting fisheries, with a view to bringing proposals to me in the next few weeks.  I intend to bring these proposals to my French counterpart as a possible joint approach to the EU Commission as France and Ireland are the main players in these fisheries. If we are successful in agreeing new measures with France and secure EU Commission support, I would be prepared to promote their introduction at national level in both jurisdictions pending their adoption at EU level.</P>
        <P>Discarding has been receiving huge exposure across various international media, setting a negative picture of the global fishing industry. Decisive action is required in the short term, however, the problem is complex with many and at times disconnected factors impacting on it.  This level of complexity requires an approach, which recognises the multi-faceted issues, the different dynamics of individual fisheries and areas and delivers real policies and change on a number of fronts.</P>
        <P>Any resolution will require the buy in of our fishers and a significant behavioural shift will be required from them to successfully eliminate discards.  Without this change in operational patterns there will be a real danger that whatever new legislation is introduced it will only succeed in pushing discarding further &ldquo;underground&rdquo; and this would worsen the current data situation and not deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>Discards was a high priority in Ireland&rsquo;s formal submission on the CFP Review forwarded last year, which argued for a fishery specific approach involving remedial actions to reduce or eliminate discards involving changes to fishing gear and fishing practices.  It focused on the development of a strong industry, science, gear technology partnership to best equip our fleets for their specific needs. It also promoted the development of a Code of Practice to incentivise best practice.</P><Col N="401"/>
        <P>My preference is for a clear policy to eliminate discards, backed up by unambiguous and appropriate technical measures and supports which can demonstrably achieve the stated policy goal. To my mind, there has been little elaboration on the suite of measures and supports that will be necessary.  This  is undermining the discussion to date.</P>
        <P>One of the possible measures being looked at is the concept of catch quota management which involves landing all catches of targeted stocks and recording the landings against quota. There are pilot schemes up and running in some Member States and I await the outcome of those, though it is already clear to me that any move in this direction would have to be over a reasonable timeframe, provide some adjustment in quota to take account of the increased landings and be on a voluntary basis in the first instance.  This approach is technical and requires a significant capital investment in equipment and human resources which will have to be facilitated by financial support from the EU if it is to become a reality.</P>
        <P>From an national perspective in addition to the industry led trials in the Celtic Sea already mentioned, Ireland is preparing a project proposal for the Biologically Sensitive Area (BSA) of the South and West coasts of Ireland, with a view to developing clear management objectives for the area, with a strong focus on the elimination of discards, in the key Hake, Monk and Megrim fisheries. I hope to submit this project proposals to Commissioner Damanaki before the summer.  The objective is develop a regionalised plan agreed by ourselves France the UK and Spain setting out appropriate measures to meet stringent conservation objectives for the area. It could be a roadmap for other programmes to deal with the discard issue across Europe.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will vote against the protocol related to the controversial EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement that will be tabled for the considerations of the Council on 27 April 2011 in Brussels.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The current Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the European Community and Morocco came into force in February 2007.  A Fisheries Protocol, setting out the detailed operating rules for the FPA, was also established at that time.  The FPA, which includes the waters off Western Sahara, renews automatically every four years.  The Protocol, however, expired on 27 February 2011.  </P>
        <P>The FPA with Morocco is considered one of the EU&rsquo;s most important bilateral fisheries agreements.  Under the protocol, the EU provides a financial contribution to the Moroccan authorities each year in exchange for fishing opportunities for EU fishermen in Moroccan waters. As with all FPAs this contribution is intended both as payment for the fishing opportunities and to assist in the development of the capacity of local fisheries sector to exploit its own resources sustainably.</P>
        <P>Eleven Member States, including Ireland, are allocated fishing opportunities under the agreement.  Ireland receives a quota of 2,500 tonnes each year in the FPA&rsquo;s industrial pelagic category; however no Irish fishing vessels have operated in Morocco under this FPA since 2007.</P>
        <P>Negotiations on the renewal of the Protocol, which were due to commence late in 2010 were delayed as Morocco was considered not to have provided sufficient data regarding the regional socio-economic impacts of the EU&rsquo;s annual financial contribution.  Given the important fishing interests that the EU has in Morocco, and because Morocco belatedly provided some information, the European Commission asked the Council to be provided with a mandate to negotiate a one-year Protocol on very similar lines to the expiring one.  The Commission&rsquo;s goal was to allow EU fishing operations in Moroccan waters to continue uninterrupted while detailed <Col N="402"/>consideration was given to the merits of negotiating a new longer and potentially different Protocol.</P>
        <P>Given the urgency of the situation and the importance of this agreement for European fishermen, Ireland supported the Commission&rsquo;s request to the Council to be provided with a mandate to negotiate a one-year Protocol.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Commission&rsquo;s mandate was given on the proviso that before the Council would ratify the new short term protocol, the Commission would share with Member States the information provided by the Moroccan authorities concerning the implementation of the current Protocol and its regional impact.  This would allow Member States to make a full assessment of whether the current agreement was providing a benefit to the Saharawi people.</P>
        <P>In late February, the EU Commission and Morocco initialled an agreement for a one year Fisheries Protocol. As part of this negotiation, transitional arrangements have been put in place for up to six months, which will allow EU fishing operations in Morocco to continue uninterrupted pending completion of the ratification procedures.  The initialled Protocol must still be ratified by the EU and this only takes place when agreed by Council and consented to by the European Parliament.  To date the Commission has not yet made a proposal for ratification but it is expected shortly. The new protocol has additional requirements for the provision by Morocco of details of the geographic distribution of benefits.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been clear that our final decision would be influenced by whether it can be persuasively shown that there is appropriate benefit deriving to the Saharawi people through implementation of the FPA.  Therefore, our position on the ratification of the one year protocol remains reserved, as the Commission&rsquo;s analysis of the information provided by the Moroccan side on the regional benefits has not been unequivocal. While citing that positive benefits were in evidence in the regional distribution of funds including to the Western Sahara, the level of those benefits remain uncertain.</P>
        <P>Ireland has always been a firm supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara, and the Government remains firmly committed to this principle.</P>
        <P>Ireland is also of the view that the FPA with Morocco should be implemented if it can be shown to be to the benefit of all the people concerned (including the Saharawi, in relation to the waters off Western Sahara) and in full accordance with the principles of international law.</P>
        <P>I am not convinced that this is the case at present and will consider very carefully Ireland&rsquo;s final position on ratification of the one year protocol when a formal proposal comes from the Commission.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 71 together.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware the pigmeat sector has been experiencing a severe reduction in its margins brought about by the large increase in feed prices since the middle of 2010.  Feed makes up some 70% of the cost of rearing a pig.</P>
        <P>Since the middle of 2010 my Department has been urging the European Commission to take action in order to ensure that producers are assisted in obtaining a margin which would allow them to stay in business.  At present producers are losing on average &euro;15 on each pig they produce and this is not sustainable.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year (February) the Commission introduced an &ldquo;Aid to Private Storage&rdquo; scheme which took 145,000 tonnes off the market.  However this product is due to some back into the market over the next three months.  We have also asked the Commission to consider the introduction of export refunds to assist with the export to third countries but world market conditions do not appear to allow these refunds to be put in place at present.</P>
        <P>In addition, at the request of Belgium supported by Ireland, the Commission organised over the past months four meetings of an Enlarged Advisory Group on Pigmeat which included representatives of all the various sectors in the industry and environmentalists as well as all Member States.</P>
        <P>The meetings of the Enlarged Advisory Group reviewed all aspects of the industry from the cost and availability of animal feed, the impact of GMOs, and the level and type of assistance that should be made available to the industry.  In addition, issues such as competitiveness, marketing initiatives, environmental concerns, the structure and organisation of the pig sector, risk management, income stabilisation tools pressure from third countries, opportunities in developing Asian markets etc. were also considered.</P>
        <P>The group agreed that there was no &ldquo;magic solution&rdquo; to competitiveness issues but it did identify areas to be addressed including innovation, structural adjustment and the operation of the supply chain.  The pigmeat sector should be considered when drawing up new rural development programmes and risk management instruments should also be used.  The green paper on promotion policy to be published in July should be of value to the pig sector.  In this context the Commission said that the role of producer and inter-professional organisations will be considered.  The Commission concluded by saying it was no longer sufficient to monitor prices in the sector and it will be considering how best to also monitor input costs and margins.</P>
        <P>At the Council of Ministers meeting I said that the Commission&rsquo;s report and its recommendations are a useful basis for discussion.  However, the pigmeat industry was under severe stress and prices are not sufficient to provide producers with an acceptable margin.  I pointed out that we need to retain market management instruments such as aid to private storage and export refunds.</P>
        <P>In response the Commission indicated that they will be coming up with a number of proposals within the process of CAP reform.  The Commission added that the promotion of exports would be more valuable than export refunds in the future and it will come forward with a variety of proposals in due course.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I have no function with regard to the National Assets Management Agency (NAMA) or the usage of its assets.  These come under the remit of my colleague the Minister for Finance. </P>
        <P>The Acquisition of Land(Allotments) Act 1926, which is under the remit of the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, enables local authorities to let allotments in urban areas to an individual for the specific purpose of cultivating vegetables mainly for consumption by that individual &ldquo;or his family&rdquo;, if the authority is satisfied that a demand exists.</P>
        <P>A number of projects to promote and encourage the consumption of local produce have been promoted by my Department.  In 2009 my Department and Bord Bia launched a Good Practice Standard Award for Farmers&rsquo; Markets and 39 markets have been awarded the Standard to date.  A call for further applications issued in April.  The Good Practice Standard is voluntary with all farmers&rsquo; markets operating in the State eligible to apply.  Farmers&rsquo; Markets displaying this award undertake to stock at least 50% of local produce from the county or neighbouring counties, to accommodate seasonal and local garden/allotment produce as well as compliance with food safety/labelling rules and criteria on good governance.  Farmers&rsquo; Markets provide producers with a cost effective direct route to customers.  They play an ever more important role in delivering income to producer, good value to the public and create employment.</P>
        <P>My Department has also been instrumental in bringing together the Irish fruit and vegetable industry to facilitate and fund the Incredible Edibles Growing Challenge in primary schools.  By the year end, 200,000 children will have participated in the project and this will have given them an appreciation of growing skills and an opportunity to focus on the need to increase the production of fresh fruit and vegetables.</P>
        <P>Local food systems support the local and regional economy and can bring environmental benefits where sustainable production systems are followed.  Local food is now seen as food that is not mass-produced, it is about small-scale production and hand-made produce.  There is a growing consumer demand for healthy foods that are locally produced with research commissioned by Bord Bia in 2010 indicating that 79% of consumers buy local food to support the local economy. The Government, and I as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are committed to the development of the food sector and to working with industry to deliver on the ambitious growth targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report.</P>

	<P>I met Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn on 3 May and discussed a number of current issues including research and development in the food area.</P>
        <P>During the meeting I emphasised the importance of the agri-food sector for the economic well being of the country.  Research and development will be critical in driving the industry.  Food is and will always remain the single most important output from land use in Ireland.  However, there is a realisation and acceptance throughout the industry, encapsulated in our own 2020 strategy document &ldquo;Food Harvest 2020&rdquo; that in order to achieve sustainable growth we must &ldquo;think green and act smart&rdquo;.  We currently have a number of groups working on the implementation of the recommendations contained in &ldquo;Food Harvest 2020&rdquo; including an Agri Research Expert Advisory (AREA) Group which is developing a Strategic Research Agenda <Col N="405"/>to guide future national investment in agricultural production research for food production and wider bio-economy activities.</P>
        <P>The EU 7th Framework Programme (FP7) is the largest public good research programme in the world.  It is playing a very significant role in strengthening the scientific and technological base of European industry and in encouraging international competitiveness whilst also promoting research that supports EU policies.  Irish agri-food researchers in Teagasc, the Higher Education establishments and indeed food companies, especially SME&rsquo;s, are well placed to pursue opportunities for FP7 funding owing to the capacity, capability and critical mass that has been built up over the years.  This is as a result of significant national investment, via grant-in-aid, funding of Teagasc and competitive funding programmes operated by my Department such as FIRM (Food Institutional Research Measure) and Stimulus and similar programmes operated by the Marine Institute.  Areas of major focus where Irish researchers have particular strengths include nutrition, functional foods and food for health.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s success rate in winning FP7 funding is steadily improving thanks partly to the encouragement, guidance and assistance provided to Irish researchers by the National Delegates and Contact Points that form part of the Irish FP Network co-ordinated by Enterprise Ireland.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider forming a delegation to travel to Europe to discuss the possibility of acquiring additional milk quota for Ireland to lessen the potential imposition and impact of a super-levy situation for 2011; if he will further consider this in view of Europe-wide under-production in the dairy industry and the potential for Ireland to increase its exports, which could only improve our hopes of honouring our debt commitments to Europe, thereby contributing to the ongoing stability of the Euro; and his plans for assisting or financing the provision of additional processing facilities in advance of the removal of milk quotas in 2015. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I mentioned earlier in my response to a similar question, my officials and I have raised the quota issue with the Commission on a number of occasions in recent months.  Indeed, I used the opportunity provided by my attendance at the Council of Agriculture Ministers in March to ask the Commission to consider whether a more flexible approach might be adopted for the limited number of Member States, including Ireland, likely to have a super levy problem in the run up to 2015.  I also raised the matter in a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Ciolos prior to the Council meeting.  I intend to continue to raise the issue with Member State colleagues and with the Commission.  However, the Commission has resisted attempts to revisit this issue, and there is, in any event, no guarantee that a majority of Member States will support calls for a more flexible milk quota regime. </P>
        <P>Against this background, I should emphasise that the primary responsibility for producing within quota, and for ensuring the avoidance of super levy, rests with individual milk producers.  It is up to dairy farmers, who are familiar with the rules of the quota regime, to make the right decisions and to protect themselves from exposure to potentially very damaging fines.  The rules are very clear, and were confirmed as recently as last December by the European Commission when it came to the conclusion that the soft landing was on track and that there was no need to revisit the quota elements of the 2008 Health Check agreement.  The remaining annual quota increases are therefore the only available mechanism for increasing quota in the period leading up to quota abolition in 2015, and all dairy farmers must take this on board as they plan the development of their enterprises.</P><Col N="406"/>
        <P>Irish dairy farmers must continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.</P>
        <P>Finally, the provision of additional processing facilities is a matter for the industry itself.  My Department has in the past supported investment in this area through the Dairy Investment Fund.  However, I do not envisage the establishment of any similar funding arrangement in the foreseeable future, having regard to the exigencies of the public finances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 85 together. </P>
        <P>As mentioned in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 42 today [12599/11], I would regard the key contribution which the agri-food sector will make to Ireland&rsquo;s economic revival relates to its potential to generate export led growth, its embedded contribution to the economy and employment and its ability to garner foreign export earnings.</P>
        <P>Together these provide the solid foundation for positioning this progressive indigenous industry as one of the central components of the country&rsquo;s export driven recovery.</P>
        <P>In the light of this potential, the implementation of Food Harvest 2020 is a key commitment of the Programme for Government.  I am personally focused on progressing the wide range of state actions needed to drive implementation of this strategic document, which was drawn up by key figures in the sector.  It includes ambitious targets to be achieved by 2020 including:</P>
        <P LI="1">Increase milk production by 50%.</P>
        <P LI="1">Improve the value-added in the sector by &euro;3 billion.</P>
        <P LI="1">Achieve an exports target of &euro;12 billion, a 42% increase</P>
        <P LI="1">Increase the value of primary output of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector by &euro;1.5 billion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>The pig industry is a valuable component of the overall agri-food sector, and has a farm gate value in excess of &euro;300 million.  The sector supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services and these are dispersed around the country.  Production, prices and exports grew significantly during 2010 and the impact of this growth was felt at all levels of the production cycle.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I am aware of the difficulties currently being experienced by the sector.  While returns have improved in recent months and are forecast to improve in the medium term, the biggest issue for producers at the moment remains feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed.  Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 70% of feed.  This is reducing margins to below the long-term average, a situation which may have an impact on production decisions in both the short and medium term.  Difficulties in maintaining credit facilities with suppliers and banks are exacerbating this situation.</P>
        <P>The Teagasc Pig Advisory Service estimates that the cost of production averages some &euro;1.47 per kg, with feed accounting for &euro;1.16 of this.  Non-feed costs account for, on average an additional &euro;0.50 per kg.  These non-feed costs are often herd specific and vary between producers.  Larger scale producers are better positioned to avail of economies of scale.  Pigmeat prices currently stand at &euro;142.70 per 100 kg, an increase of over 10% year-on-year and are expected to continue to improve as 2011 progresses, while cereal output is expected to increase by mid-year.</P>
        <P>Both of these developments should improve the position for pig producers.  Teagasc Advisory Services are working with producers, feed suppliers and banks to advance a number of initiatives to help pig farmers through this difficult period.  As you are aware pig prices are a function of the supply and demand dynamics in the market place and my Department has no role in how they are arrived at.</P>
        <P>The &lsquo;<i>Food Harvest 2020 Report</i>&rsquo;, which was published in July 2010, sets out the vision for the future of the food industry including the pig sector.  Ambitious targets have been set in relation to sow productivity, the size of the national herd, together with a 50% growth in the value of output by 2020.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P>I recently met with many of the stakeholders including producer representatives, some processors and Tesco Ireland and discussed many of the issues currently affecting the sector.  I invited stakeholders to consider any suggestions or proposals they may wish to make and to advance them through the Food Harvest 2020 Implementation Process.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 56, 64 and 77 together.</P>
        <P>As I have stated previously, I am very concerned about the EU-Mercosur negotiations.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue at both the March and April meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers and expressed my reservations about these negotiations, particularly regarding the impact a deal with Mercosur might have on the Irish and EU beef sector.  I also conveyed my concerns directly to Commissioner Ciolos  in a private meeting in advance of the March Agriculture Council.  At the Council meeting in April, I highlighted the importance of the beef sector in Ireland where 80% of our production is exported, almost all of it to other EU countries.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been to the forefront in raising this issue at European level.  I have repeatedly requested that impact assessments on the EU-Mercosur negotiations should be carried out and the results shared with member states before any offers are made in the negotiations.  We expect to see the full results from the Commission impact analysis within the next few weeks.  Initial results suggest that this will confirm our view of the very negative effects it could have on the beef sector and also on the EU agriculture sector generally.  Once the full results are available I believe it is vital that they are fully and carefully examined in the Agriculture and Trade Councils.</P>
        <P>At the Agriculture Council in April, France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Romania, Poland, Belgium, Slovenia and Portugal all intervened to support the call for transparency and discussion of impact assessments.  I have specifically urged the Commission to exercise extreme caution in the negotiations and to take on board Irish proposals on sustainability and on measures to mitigate the effect of tariff quotas in the beef sector.  My officials have had a <Col N="409"/>series of meetings with senior Commission officials and have made several presentations and submitted a number of papers to the Commission explaining the implications of such an agreement for Irish agriculture, and the beef sector in particular.</P>
        <P>At a bilateral meeting with the French Minister for Agriculture in Paris on 18 March, I raised my concerns about these negotiations and the effect on the beef sector.  My concerns were shared by the French Minister and we agreed to a joint initiative to highlight the positive contribution of EU extensive beef production to the global fight against climate change.  I also met separately with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn on 3 May to express my deep concerns about the negotiations and the possible implications arising from the impact assessments.</P>
        <P>It is obviously desirable that any FTA negotiations should deliver an increase in trade opportunities and a new trading environment that is equitable and fair to all of the key sectors, economic operators and individual Member States.  I was therefore particularly concerned at the preliminary findings of the impact assessments of the EU-Mercosur negotiations, which were presented to Member States at a Technical Group meeting in May.  While this analysis shows an overall net gain to the EU, it also shows that substantial losses could arise in a number of key agriculture sectors and that these would seriously impact on many Member States.  The impact assessments suggest that an equitable balance of advantage will be very difficult to achieve.</P>
        <P>When my colleague, Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton met her French counterpart in Paris on 11 May, they<b> </b>discussed the current negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Mercosur.  In the joint communiqu&eacute; that issued from that meeting it stated that France<i> and Ireland believe it is vital to avoid concluding an agreement that will damage European agricultural interests, particularly for the beef and poultry sectors.  The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the priority of concluding the Doha Round.</i></P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation,Deputy. Richard Bruton is as concerned as I, about the potential negative impact a Mercosur Free Trade Agreement might have on our economy, based on the draft impact assessments undertaken by the Commission.  He requested that the EU-Mercosur negotiations be put on the agenda of that Council meeting, which took place on 13 May, 2011.  At that meeting, he emphasised the Government&rsquo;s view that any final agreement with Mercosur needs not only to provide extensive new market access to exporters but also that it cannot undermine the viability of any particular sector, especially our agriculture sector.  Furthermore he said that the impact assessments now being evaluated by the Commission must be subjected to scrutiny and review by both the Trade and Agriculture Councils and that these reviews should take place in advance of any exchange of offers taking place.  France, Luxembourg, Poland, Belgium, Finland, Romania, Lithuania, Greece supported the concerns and expectations of Ireland on substance and procedure in relation to the Impact Assessments.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton also emphasised these issues in a separate meeting he had with Commissioner De Gucht following the Council.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that any agreement must not undermine the continued viability of a particular sector in individual member states.  Because of the important potential long-term implications for the future of the EU agriculture and food sector, the EU has to take special account of its critical interests in this area and in particular the economic importance to the EU of the  sector as well as its contribution to food security, sustainability and the delivery of the EU 2020 strategy.</P>

        <P LI="1">Create additional income and employment in peripheral coastal regions by promoting the production of those species with the potential for added value;</P>
        <P LI="1">Support innovation and other structural initiatives to improve the efficiency-competitiveness, safety, product quality-fish health and welfare and environmental impact of aquaculture;</P>
        <P LI="1">Promote the diversification of the aquaculture industry by encouraging the commercial development of new species, and</P>
        <P LI="1">Promote the introduction of new technology to open up offshore locations for aquaculture and to improve infrastructural support for the sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme is the largest element of the Aquaculture Industry Development Measure of the Irish Seafood National Programme.  That scheme has a budget of &euro;5 million in 2011.  The scheme is designed to promote the commercial development of aquaculture on a basis which is financially, technically and environmentally sustainable.  Its main focus is on the construction, extension, equipping, modernisation and expansion of aquaculture enterprises, development of handling facilities for quality improvement and efficiency and investment in measures of a collective nature designed to improve sustainability, in particular quality assurance and environmental impact, efficiency, safety and competitiveness in the aquaculture industry.  Under the Programme grant aid will not be made available to marine salmon aquaculture sites until the sea-lice issue has been satisfactorily resolved.</P>
        <P>One call for proposals under this scheme was conducted in 2010 and already another has been conducted in 2011.  Investment proposals that have been successful in the 2011 call will be announced shortly.</P>
        <P>In relation to the current backlog in the processing of aquaculture licences, the majority of areas for which the licences are sought are designated as Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and/or Special Protection Areas under the EU Birds Directive (so-called Natura 2000 sites).  In accordance with these EU Directives, as clarified by a judgment against Ireland of the European Court of Justice in 2007, my Department is constrained by law from issuing or renewing aquaculture licences for sites located within Natura 2000 areas, until such time as an &lsquo;appropriate assessment&rsquo; has been conducted in accordance with those <Col N="411"/>Directives of the potential of the proposed aquaculture and fishery activities within that area to impact negatively on the conservation objectives for that Natura site.  The licensing process must take full account of the outcome of that assessment in reaching a determination on any particular licence application.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, BIM and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport is engaged in a comprehensive programme to conduct appropriate assessments for the approximately 90 bays affected.  This is a complex and resource intensive work programme involving the surveying of benthic habitats and bird populations in each of the 90 sites concerned, preparation of conservation objectives by the NPWS for each site, development of fishery plans for each site by fishermen, assisted by BIM, and ultimately conduct of the appropriate assessment by the Marine Institute on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  This comprehensive work programme will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The appropriate assessment of aquaculture applications will be dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to make every effort to expedite the determination of all outstanding licence cases, having regard to the complexities of each case and the need to comply fully with all national and EU legislation.</P>
        <P>The concentration of aquaculture sites in environmentally sensitive Natura 2000 areas is also proving a significant obstacle in terms of supporting the development of the industry through the Aquaculture Industry Development Measure of the Irish Seafood National Programme.  In light of the ECJ judgment and in order to avoid the significant risk of fines being imposed on Ireland in connection with un-assessed aquaculture activity in Natura 2000 areas, it was necessary to include a restriction in the Programme excluding aquaculture sites in Natura 2000 areas from support under the Programme until the site concerned has been the subject of an appropriate assessment.  As the programme of appropriate assessments is rolled out bay by bay over the course of this year, I expect that many more aquaculture sites will become eligible for support.</P>

	<P>Since I was appointed Minister on 9 March last, I have had bilateral meetings with my French, Spanish and Danish Ministerial colleagues.  I have also had the opportunity to interact with my Ministerial colleagues from the 26 other Member States and the EU Commission at the three EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meetings held in Brussels and Luxemburg since I assumed office.</P>
        <P>The meeting with my French counterpart, Bruno Le Maire, was devoted primarily to the reform of the CAP.  We shared common ground on the strategic importance of agriculture both in Ireland and France.  We agreed to work together to ensure that the reform of the CAP delivers an ambitious policy, adequately funded to reinforce and develop agriculture in the EU.  We also agreed on a number of important markers in the CAP negotiations, namely</P><Col N="412"/>
        <P LI="1">That the distribution of future direct income support within Member States should allow for the necessary flexibility of member states to take account of the agriculture and regional conditions which apply to that country and</P>
        <P LI="1">That any future &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of the direct income support schemes should be simple to apply both for farmers and Member State administrations and should not entail additional costs for either.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The meeting with my French counterpart also dealt with the Mercosur negotiations and with the potential difficulties they could pose for the EU beef sector.  The contribution which extensive EU beef production can make to the global fight against climate change was discussed and it was agreed that both countries would work together to highlight this.</P>
        <P>While my meeting with my Spanish counterpart was devoted largely to fisheries matters, we did have the opportunity to exchange views on the broad parameters of the upcoming CAP negotiations.</P>
        <P>Last week I met with the Danish Minister Henrik H&oslash;egh in Brussels and we discussed CAP and our forthcoming presidencies of the EU.  Minister H&oslash;egh intends to make good progress with the CAP reform negotiations during the Danish presidency but it may be that negotiations will continue into Ireland&rsquo;s presidency in the first half of 2013.</P>
        <P>I will have further opportunities to engage with my EU counterparts particularly at the forthcoming informal EU Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting to be held in Hungary next week, where the theme of the meeting is &ldquo;How should the CAP contribute to a sustainable animal husbandry sector in Europe&rdquo;.  It is also my intention to travel to the UK over the coming weeks and to meet  my UK counterpart, Secretary of State Caroline Spellman and her team during that visit.</P>

        <P>In 2010, a Consultative Committee on the CAP after 2013 was set up by my Department comprising all the major farming and agriculture related representative organisations involved in Social Partnership as well as a number of academics.  The Committee met in May and November 2010 and also participated in the Stakeholder event organised by my Department during the visit of Commissioner Ciolos last autumn.</P>
        <P>Commissioner Ciolos also launched a public consultation process during 2010 providing an opportunity for all stakeholders and interested parties to give their views on the future of the CAP.  In parallel with this process, the Commission requested specific submissions on Rural Development in the context of CAP post 2013.  My Department wrote to interested stakeholders in this regard advising them how to participate in both of these consultation processes and encouraging them to do so to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s voice is heard at every opportunity.</P><Col N="413"/>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The increase of 11% in agri-food exports in 2010 evidenced the central role the sector can play in this country&rsquo;s economic regeneration and it is our aim that this growth be continued in the coming years.  Indeed, the Food Harvest 2020 report sets an export target of &euro;12 billion for the sector by 2020, a 42% increase on the average export figures in the years 2007-2009.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia, in its Performance and Prospects 2010-2011, indicates that in 2011 &ldquo;the prospects for Irish food and drink exports remain positive, helped by strong global demand for commodity products and a relatively tight supply situation in a number of key categories&rdquo;, adding, crucially, that &ldquo;growth in global demand is set to underpin food markets well into the future&rdquo;. It is to be hoped that exchange rate movements remain favourable throughout the year, especially with regard to Sterling and the US Dollar, thereby allowing Ireland to reap the maximum return from strong global demand in 2011.</P>
        <P>The data already available for 2011, though limited, provides welcome evidence that export growth in the sector will indeed continue this year.  In fact, CSO figures for January 2011 show exports of Food, Beverages and Live Animals increasing 18% on the same month last year.</P>

	<P>The burning of vegetation, including gorse and scrub, growing on land not then cultivated is prohibited between 1 March and 31 August each year under the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.  Arising from the large increase in the number of wildfires which occurred during 2010, the Land and Forest Fires Working Group was established last year.  The Group highlighted, <i>inter alia</i>, the need to change the mindset regarding the use of fire in traditional agricultural practices.</P>
        <P>Following on from that recommendation, my Department has embarked on an extensive publicity campaign since early 2011 to warn farmers and landowners of the dangers and the consequences of the uncontrolled and illegal burning of gorse and scrub.  A particular focus of the campaign has been to highlight the penalties which apply under the Single Payment Scheme, as well as the legal consequences of illegal land burning through fines and imprisonment.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to prioritise publicising the dangers of this destructive illegal activity, in order to deter persons from risking both loss of life and property, through irresponsible land management practices.  It is vitally important for rural dwellers to remain vigilant and be prepared to take responsibility by reporting any suspicious activities to the Garda.</P>

	<P>The fact that Queen Elizabeth chose to include the Irish National Stud in her very busy itinerary on this her first visit to this country brought the focus of the international media to the Irish  horse breeding industry, an indigenous industry and one in which we excel on the world stage. I was delighted to be present myself to welcome Her Majesty to the Stud. Her Majesty&rsquo;s visit was an acknowledgement of the excellent standing of the Irish thoroughbred sector internationally and will further enhance the international reputation of this industry into the future. </P>
        <P>I was also very pleased to welcome Queen Elizabeth to the English Market in Cork. Whilst this was important for the market itself on the day the broader media impact of the visit was a huge opportunity for the English Market, for Cork City, for our national pride in our food and for our international reputation as a source of high quality agri food produce. I cannot emphasise enough the impact that such a visit can have on our international reputation as a source of good food and the elevation of awareness for influencing consumers and customers around the world.</P>
        <P>I envisage the market having a continued role as an ambassador for our food. The English Market traders, Cork City Council and Bord Bia will meet in early June to discuss continued collaborative effort to build the potential marketing legacy from the visit for the English Market, for Cork City and for our food.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government committed to replacing  the criminal sanctions system for minor fisheries offences with administrative sanction system to bring Ireland into line with other European jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I sought the advice of the Attorney General on the matter. The Attorney General has responded with a detailed advice on the issue which I am currently examining.  The advice highlights the difficulties in relation to the Constitution and in relation to the laws of the European Community relevant to the question of implementing a system of administrative sanctions for fisheries.</P>
        <P>There are many significant differences between the legal systems in Ireland and that of other EU Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s constitutional and legal position provides certain basic rights which must be respected within our system of justice.  Furthermore, European Union legislation requires that penalties for fisheries offences must be &ldquo;<i>effective, proportionate and dissuasive</i>&rdquo;. That is, they must act as a deterrent and they must also ensure that there is no benefit gained by infringing the rules.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of the penalties involved, there is a general requirement under the Constitution that alleged breaches of fisheries control regulations must be tried in a court of law.  I am continuing to actively examine the issue in the context of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in relation to the Programme for Government commitment.</P>

	<P>The issue of food security and supply in the EU is at the forefront of the current EU agriculture policy.  A Commission communication setting out broad policy options for the future CAP &ldquo;The CAP towards 2020&rdquo; was presented on 18 November 2010.  Following discussion on this communication at the Council of EU Agriculture Ministers, a majority of Member States lent their support at the March Council to a series of conclusions drafted by the Hungarian Presidency.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication was the first formal step in the negotiating process for the CAP after 2013.  The formal legislative proposals are due to be tabled by the Commission later this year.  In that respect, the Presidency conclusions provide a strong signal to the Commission of the views of Member States in this process.  I believe the Presidency&rsquo;s text was an inclusive presentation of Member States&rsquo; positions and provides good guidance for the legislative work of the Commission.</P>
        <P>The Commission communication advocates a strong future CAP based on two complementary pillars with three strategic aims of preserving food production potential in the EU, sustainable management of natural resources and maintaining viable rural areas.  The Presidency held three policy debates on the Communication and the issue of viable food production, the first main objective for the future CAP, was discussed at the December Council.</P>
        <P>The international community is committed to reducing by half the number of malnourished people in the world by 2015, but the latest estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations show that the number of hungry people currently stands at 925 million.  United Nations projections suggest that the world population will rise from the current 6.8 billion to 9.2 billion by 2050, with an associated 70% increase in demand for food.  At the same time, more than ever, food production is facing competition for land and water resources from a variety of sources including the impacts of climate change, which pose further risks to <Col N="417"/>food output.  Increasing global demand for food and the level of food insecurity in parts of the world mean that Ireland as a leading world food producer has a responsibility to ensure that it contributes to meeting this demand and affords our agri-food sector new opportunities for growth. But these opportunities will only be fully realised if our farms become as competitive as possible and this will require considerable adaptation and structural change.  It is important that we should actively support our farmers throughout this process. This should take practical expression in pillar 2 measures to support on-farm investment and to improve and adapt farm structures.</P>

	<P>Food Harvest 2020 identifies the many challenges and opportunities facing the seafood sector in Ireland if it is to achieve its enormous potential.  I intend to focus very much on those issues that will assist the seafood sector in contributing to national economic recovery and boosting employment.  </P>
        <P>My main priorities include attracting more landings by foreign vessels to Irish fishing ports to enhance raw material supply to Irish seafood processors, adding value to seafood production through innovation, new product development and new lean and green processing technologies and thirdly fostering the expansion of the aquaculture sector.</P>
        <P>The North East Atlantic zone adjacent to Ireland is one of the richest fishing grounds in the EU.  The potential exists for Ireland to attract landings by non-Irish vessels and to process and add value to these additional fish catches. This would net significant additional seafood output and jobs in the processing sector.  Initial discussions have taken place with representatives of the French industry and they have expressed strong interest. In July this year, BIM will co-ordinate a bilateral meeting between Irish seafood processors and large French fishing organisations, with the objective of encouraging the French to land their catches into Irish ports and enable more processing of fish to take place here. This initiative will provide a pilot project template to attract other foreign landings to Irish ports.</P>
        <P>BIM&rsquo;s new Seafood Development Centre (SDC) has made considerable progress in driving seafood value-added activity since opening at the end of 2009.  As some 85% of Irish seafood is sold in commodity form, the SDC seeks to maximise the potential of indigenous Irish seafood businesses by increasing development of innovative, consumer orientated seafood products through a market-led approach. The SDC adds value through the application of innovation in the processing and marketing of seafood, by improving the capabilities of seafood companies in areas such as new product development, new packaging and leading edge processing technologies. Where necessary, the SDC provides supported incubation spaces.</P>
        <P>During 2010, over 180 seafood companies worked with the SDC. Some of these enterprises have developed a range of successful new seafood products.  BIM has set a target of achieving an additional &euro;100 million worth of new seafood products over the next five years. Through this growth, the SDC will enable the creation of higher quality, better paid and robust employment in the sector.</P>
        <P>I recently launched a new BIM Seafood Value-adding Scheme, designed to motivate seafood companies to explore and develop new opportunities in seafood by fostering innovative product developments that match current and future market opportunities.  It will provide grant aid of <Col N="418"/>up to 40% for eligible companies, subject to a maximum payment per company, supporting an overall investment of &euro;1 million by the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>I have made available &euro;1.5 million in 2011 to foster the expansion and modernisation of the seafood processing sector through BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme.  A call for proposals has just been completed and despite the present economic climate, the call was fully subscribed by ambitious and enterprising Irish companies.  I take great encouragement from that.</P>
        <P>The expansion of aquaculture activity in Ireland has faced significant obstacles in recent years because of the concentration of aquaculture sites and new applications in environmentally sensitive Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas.  Some 90 such marine sites have been designated for protection under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives and this protected status carries with it quite onerous obligations to carry out very in-depth environmental assessment of aquaculture and fishing activities before they can be licensed.  It also places restrictions on my ability to make available financial supports for the expansion of output at these sites.</P>
        <P>I have adopted a twofold strategy to addressing this obstacle.  First and foremost, we must ensure that the protected sites where aquaculture is concentrated are assessed as necessary, as a matter of urgency, so that the present uncertainty is removed for ambitious aquaculture enterprises seeking to grow and modernise.  A multi-agency work programme has been ongoing for two years now and I expect that we will see tangible progress in 2011.  I will endeavour to ensure that this work is given top priority.</P>
        <P>The second element of my aquaculture strategy is longer term and that is to look beyond the often environmentally sensitive inshore locations favoured to date by aquaculture enterprises.  I have asked BIM and the Marine Institute to examine the potential for aquaculture activity in off short sites and I hope that this work  will inform the feasibility of offshore aquaculture activity in Ireland</P>

	<P>Estimated butterfat-adjusted deliveries for the 2010/2011 milk quota year, as published by my Department in mid-April, were 0.43% under quota. These are estimated figures, and a definitive outcome will not be available until August. However, it is hoped that this will confirm that the country has, fortunately, avoided a super levy. </P>
        <P>All milk producers should consider this a timely reminder that quotas remain in place and that decisions on the day-to-day management of their dairy enterprises should be informed by a constant realisation of the need to avoid a potentially very damaging super levy. I intend to continue my efforts to raise the issue of the soft landing with Member State colleagues and with the Commission. The latter has resisted attempts to revisit this matter, and there is, in any event, no guarantee that a majority of Member States will support calls for a more flexible milk quota regime. Therefore Irish dairy farmers must continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check.</P>

	<P>Promoting the marketing of Irish food, seafood, drink and horticulture is the responsibility of Bord Bia.  In its market research, development and promotion activities Bord Bia works closely with producers, industry and existing and potential customers throughout the world to communicate the quality, sustainable production systems operating in Ireland and to identify and promote market opportunities.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020, which sets out a vision and plan for the agri-food and fisheries sector for the next ten years recommends the establishment of a &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo;.  That recommendation reflected the advice in <i>Pathways for Growth</i>, a high level assessment by Harvard Business School, who were engaged by Bord Bia in 2010 to assess export opportunities for the Irish food and drink industry and to provide a new perspective on pathways for growth.  The concept is to develop an umbrella brand or enhanced reputation for the Irish food industry which is credible and distinctive and which embraces all aspects of Irish food and drink.</P>
        <P>Food Harvest 2020 details the key steps necessary to progress the development of this approach. These include detailed scientific and market research into consumer trends, a strategy to emphasise the green and natural reputation of Irish food and drink, a credible <Col N="420"/>scientific basis for product claims and the creation of the highest standards of food safety and traceability implemented in all participating products.  As complexity in delivering on such an umbrella concept is high, a timeframe of at least three-to-five years will be required.</P>
        <P>In all of this, it must be remembered that EU Treaty and Single Market rules prohibit the use of public funds to promote food purely on the basis of origin.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia has taken a lead role in the development of the <i>Brand Ireland</i> concept and have conducted research on a number of successful brand models.  One example of this is the PAS2050 standard (Publicly Assured Systems) for the sustainability credentials of its Beef and Lamb Quality Assurance Schemes which was achieved by working closely with Carbon Trust and Teagasc. This is a very positive step towards realising the <i>Brand Ireland</i>  concept.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is assumed that the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the numerical strength of the suckler cow herd and this information is presented in tabular format below. It will be observed that the number of suckler cows has remained relatively stable over the last decade albeit with a gradual decline in overall herd size. </P>
        <P>The Suckler Cow Welfare Scheme has undoubtedly helped to improve animal husbandry and management practices as well as stabilise beef cow numbers in the aftermath of decoupling. These supports contribute in no small way to underpinning the output quality and overall viability of the sector at farm level.</P>
        <P>With regard to economic benefit, the Food Harvest 2020 report states that a viable suckler cow beef herd is fundamental for the development of the beef industry and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF) has indicated that the profitability of the existing suckler cow herd could be increased by &euro;200 million by 2020. This would be achieved through a combination of better quality cows and breeding, achieving slaughter carcass weights at a younger age and better carcass quality. In addition, genetic advances offer the potential to deliver greater profitability at farm level through enhanced productivity and disease resistance.</P>
        <P>It must be acknowledged that the Government has already committed significant funding to the sector. Direct payments to producers provided by my Department amounted to &euro;110m since the introduction of the Suckler Cow Scheme. Already in 2011, approximately &euro;17m has been paid through the scheme in respect of animals born in 2010, and depending on the number of successful applicants, this figure has the potential to reach &euro;30m by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there are a number of other policy initiatives that serve to provide a sound framework for the future development of the sector. These include the advisory and research output of Teagasc, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Quality Assurance Scheme and its promotional work in expending beef sales at home and abroad together with Beef Improvement Programmes and the Beef and Sheepmeat Capital Investment Fund for the processing industry. All these investments underscore the critical importance of the sector to sustainable economic recovery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I recently visited Brussels to attend the European Seafood Expo and while there took the opportunity to meet with the European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  I regard the Commissioner as an important ally for Ireland in both the Commission and in Europe and would like to develop a strong working relationship with her into the future.</P>
        <P>Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn&rsquo;s directorate is responsible for the &euro;142 billion budget of the new Common Strategic Framework 2014-2020 (CSF) Programme, which will combine the funding of a number of current competitive research programmes into a single strategic research vehicle. The CSF is of great importance to Ireland, particularly were it to support competitive research and innovation.</P>
        <P>From an Irish perspective I consider it vital that the expertise, previous championing and contribution to the development of research based policy formulation in Europe materialises itself into being successful in the tendering processes in new research programmes. I outlined some of the work of the Marine Institute on the EU front in recent times and the opportunities that it and other Irish research bodies can realise using the expertise and experience built up. It is vitally important in the current difficult economic climate that innovative ideas can be turned into products and services that create growth and jobs.</P>
        <P>I also used the occasion to brief Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn on the major policy challenges we are facing in agriculture and fisheries, particularly the reform of both the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commissioner has taken a keen interest in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and was already aware of the difficult negotiations that lie ahead for Ireland.  I consider the Reform of the CFP to be absolutely crucial to the future of the Irish fishing industry and I am committed to delivering a reform package that works for Irish Fishermen while ensuring that fish stocks are rebuilt and managed in a sustainable manner. The very survival of coastal communities is directly dependent on a healthy fishing industry and the new CFP must deliver long term economic activity and employment for these communities.</P>
        <P>We discussed at length the key areas of concern to Ireland in this reform and I asked the Commissioner to use her influence where possible to assist me in defending Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I raised my deep concerns and serious reservations with the Commissioner about the implications of an EU-Mercosur agreement on Irish agriculture and in particular the Irish beef sector. I have already provided detailed information to the House today regarding my concerns relative to these negotiations.  In brief, my meeting with Commissioner Geoghegan Quinn is one in a series of meetings, which I, and my officials have had to highlight Ireland&rsquo;s concerns in about these negotiations. I have already raised this matter at both the March and April meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers.  I have also raised this issue in private meetings with both Commissioner Ciolos and the French Minister for Agriculture Bruno Le Maire.</P>
        <P>In my discussions with Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, in addition to emphasising the very significant economic impact which such an agreement would have on employment within the agri food sector and on Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery, I also highlighted the implications for sustainable production of beef within the EU. In particular, I stated that it makes no sense at <Col N="423"/>all for Ireland to have to reduce its cattle herd to make way for imports from regions with a less efficient carbon foot print.</P>
        <P>At the meeting with the Commissioner, we also discussed research and development in the food area. I emphasised the importance of the agri-food sector for the economic well being of the country and the fact that research and development will be critical in driving the industry.  Food is and will always remain the single most important output from land use in Ireland.  However, there is a realisation and acceptance throughout the industry, encapsulated in our own 2020 strategy document &ldquo;Food Harvest 2020&rdquo; that in order to achieve sustainable growth we must &ldquo;think green and act smart&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>In relation to the development of local fisheries, the Irish seafood sector employs approximately 11,000 people, mostly in peripheral coastal communities.  Irish seafood enterprises are indigenous businesses with significant scope for expansion and have an important role to play on the road to national economic recovery.  Food harvest 2020 estimates employment in the industry has the potential to expand to 14,000 by 2020, mostly through increases in employment in the seafood processing and aquaculture sectors.  </P>
        <P>For 2011, I have made &euro;1.5 million available to foster the expansion and modernisation of the seafood processing sector through BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme.  A call for proposals has just been completed and despite the present economic climate, the call was fully subscribed by ambitious and enterprising Irish companies.  I take great encouragement from that.</P>
        <P>BIM is working with fishermen and processors around the coast to promote product innovation, differentiation of product, competitiveness, business acumen and management, environmental awareness and compliance.  I recently launched a new BIM support scheme to encourage the Irish seafood sector away from low value commodity exports to value added high quality food products that provide much more employment and greater economic return on investment.  The Seafood Value Adding Scheme will support Irish seafood companies in the area of new product development.</P>
        <P>My Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, has to date assisted in the formation of 18 farm forest producer groups.  These Groups enable farm forest owners to co-operate collectively in the management of their forests and the marketing of the timber produced in order to achieve economies of scale and thereby improve the viability of small forest holdings by contributing to the development of wood energy supply chains to local wood energy facilities at various locations around the country.</P>
        <P>Issues surrounding community gardens and allotments are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which makes arrangements for the local authorities to run allotments etc.  My Department is responsible for commercial horticulture and commercial farming activities not for hobby or gardening pastimes.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement that animal products for human consumption imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States. The FVO carries out assessment of third countries wishing to export animal products to EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules. Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website <i>http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/ir_search_en.cfm</i>.</P>
        <P>Consignments of products of animal origin for human consumption are required to come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved and listed for export to the EU <i>http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biosafety/establishments/third_country/index_en.htm</i>.  Following pre-notification of import by the importer, they are required to undergo animal and public health controls at an EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP). Import control involves documentary, identity and physical checks and includes checks on origin and labeling in accordance with EU requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Consignments failing to comply with veterinary control checks may be detained at Border Inspection Post for further examination and where non compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed at the importers cost. Controls on products of animal origin imported directly into the EU through Ireland are carried out at approved BIPs at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport.

        <P Just="Left">New EU harmonised controls on the importation of certain foods of plant origin came into effect on 25 January, 2010.  They provide a list of certain food commodities from specified countries outside the EU that must be subject to increased levels of control at designated points of entry (DPE) into the EU. From that date, importers of certain commodities from specified third countries are required to pre-notify import and submit relevant consignments for checks and possible sampling. Consignments sampled are held and not released unless a satisfactory result has been obtained. Samples analysed in 2010, as a consequence of these increased levels of control, were found to meet legal standards for pesticide residues.</P>
        <P>The list of produce and countries is based on risk assessments by the Commission using information gathered from the EU pesticide residue monitoring control programme, from national monitoring programmes, consumption data and notifications under the EU&rsquo;s rapid alert system, as well as from audits of controls carried out in exporting countries by the FVO. Decisions to add or remove countries of origin or products or modulate the frequency of sampling applied to imported consignments are undertaken by SCFCAH on a proposal from the Commission.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Chinese Vice-Minister for Agriculture, Mr Niu Dun, and a delegation from the Ministry of Agriculture will visit Ireland this week.  The visit is viewed as an important opportunity to facilitate greater understanding and confidence between our two countries in the integrity of our food safety and veterinary control systems, and so facilitate trade.  The fact that the Vice-Minister has taken time from his busy schedule to visit Ireland is a significant statement in itself of the interest which China has in the advancements Ireland has made in agriculture and the expertise which we possess in the agri-food and seafood sectors.</P><Col N="426"/>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland already exports significant volumes of dairy products to China, in particular infant formula, and is also exporting pigmeat and seafood product to China. We have a clear trade objective of obtaining market access for beef into the Chinese market. The focus of the visit is therefore concentrated on our food safety, traceability systems and veterinary controls.  It will include a visit to the Seafood Development facility in Clonakilty, a Beef plant, a Dairy plant and the Backweston laboratory facilities. I would hope that the visit will result in a deepening of our relationships with officials within the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture which I feel can only lead to an enhancement of our trading relationships.  I would hope at some stage in the future to visit China.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest> his priorities in relation to the reform of the common fisheries policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[12588/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent of which was in 2002 and the next is formally scheduled for 2012. </P>
        <P>The European Commission published a Green Paper on the latest reform of the CFP in April 2009 in order to launch a consultation with Member States and stakeholders and to initiate a broad public debate on the future CFP reform. An extensive nationwide public consultation process was conducted under the Chairmanship of Dr Noel Cawley.  These consultations with all stakeholders contributed to <i>Ireland&rsquo;s Response to the Commissions Green Paper</i>, which was submitted to the Commission early in 2010.</P>
        <P>I have examined this submission and have met and discussed the priorities for the Reform with fishing industry representatives. It is my intention to continue the consultation process with industry representatives and other stakeholders over the coming months with a view to maintaining a strong, coherent and unified Irish position.  The reforms I am seeking reflect a pragmatic approach involving changes that collectively take account of economic, social, environmental and sustainability factors.</P>
        <P>The new CFP will be the overarching framework for fisheries in Europe with many key features of interest to Ireland, key among them are:-</P>
        <P LI="1">Retention of the Hague Preferences;</P>
        <P LI="1">New focus on addressing discarding of fish at sea with a complete ban being introduced for stocks in a depleted state;</P>
        <P LI="1">The retention of a management system based on national quotas supported by increased flexibility and a rejection of the mandatory privatisation of fish quotas or the introduction of international trading of fish quotas;</P>
        <P FLI="0">In particular, I will be pursuing initiatives that will deliver and sustain jobs in coastal communities rather than those that promote the concentration of wealth and delivery of excessive profits for a few big international businesses. I support a system which maintains strong economic links between national quotas and the traditional fishing communities which these quotas were allocated to assist.</P><Col N="427"/>
        <P>I have no doubt that if mandatory ITQs are put in place, our quotas for both whitefish and pelagic will be purchased by large European fishing conglomerates, with no socio or economic links to our ports, and landed elsewhere, with the resultant loss of jobs and economic activity around our coast.  This will be a key area for Ireland in the ongoing discussions on the CFP.</P>
        <P>A major priority for Ireland in the Reform is the retention of the Hague Preferences, agreed by Heads of State in 1976 by way of the Hague Resolution, under which Ireland receives additional shares of quotas for the whitefish stocks around our coast.  There was been strong pressure from certain Member States that these should be abolished in the Reform.  I want to make it clear that any interference that results in Ireland losing the current benefits of the Hague Preferences within the reformed CFP will be totally unacceptable to me.  The Hague Preferences were the payment made for Ireland granting access to our waters to other Member States and a recognition of the high costs involved for the State in the control of these rich fishing grounds and they must be maintained in the new CFP.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Commissioner Damanaki herself has placed discarding of fish high on her agenda for the CFP reform.  Personally I consider that this wasteful practice can not be justified and am determined that appropriate measures will be identified and introduced, in consultation with industry, as part of a reformed CFP.  As part of what will be my ongoing strategy to push Ireland&rsquo;s priorities  on the reform of the CFP and garner support for our stance, I met my Spanish Ministerial colleague Ms Rosa Aguilar on the 21st of March 2011 and I also met Commissioner Damanaki on the 14th April.  On the 3rd of May I took the opportunity to brief Irish Commissioner Ms M&aacute;ire Geoghegan Quinn on the CFP review and I can assure the deputy that I will continue my efforts to seek alliances with similar minded Member States and promote Ireland's case in the run-up to the introduction of the new CFP scheduled for the end of  2012.</P>

	<P>Article 68(1) of Council Regulation (EC) 73/2009 makes provision for the use of unused Single Payment Scheme funds to address specific disadvantages affecting farmers; in recognition of dairying being an economically vulnerable type of farming, it was decided that &euro;18 million of these unused funds would be used to support a three-year Dairy Efficiency Programme. The Programme encourages efficiency gains on dairy farms through an expansion in the level of participation in discussion groups. A total of up to &euro;6 million per annum was made available to eligible participants for each of the three years of the Programme, 2010, 2011 and 2012. </P>
        <P>Payments in respect of the first year of the Programme commenced recently and, to date, have issued to 5,556 participants and are worth a total of &euro;5,462,925. Further payments will issue as individual remaining cases are confirmed eligible. The rate of &euro;975.00 per head is subject to modulation deductions, as the funding for the Programme is from the unused Single Payment funds.</P>

	<P>The Passport Service is not aware of any incorrect information in relation to emergency or standard passport turnaround times on its website at this time.  Should the Deputy be aware of any such misleading information, I would request that he notify my office so that it can be rectified immediately.  Due to a surge in demand, the turnaround time for passport express applications received through the Passport Express system is currently running between 11 and 13 working days.  It normally takes 10 working days.  The Passport Express service is available for passport applications lodged in Ireland only.  The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.  Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website <i>www.passport.ie</i> since 18 April 2011.  The Passport Office has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application.</P>

	<P>A passport application for the person named was received by the Passport Service in July 2007.  The citizenship of a child born on the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 depends on the citizenship or period of legal residence in Ireland of his or her parents at the time of the child&rsquo;s birth and is determined by reference to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004.  In August 2007 the Passport Service wrote to the applicant&rsquo;s parents seeking evidence of legal residence in the State to establish entitlement to Irish citizenship.  The Passport Service has no record of correspondence from the applicant&rsquo;s family since this date.  We would welcome any details that the Deputy could provide in this case.</P>

	<P>It is presumed the Deputy is referring to the pay cut introduced by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009. The reductions apply irrespective of whether a particular post is funded in whole or in part through non-Exchequer funds or income.  It is important to understand that while there is a variety of staff across the education sector who are employed by public service bodies as determined under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, who are either wholly or partly funded from non-Exchequer sources, there are also staff undertaking the same or very similar duties whose posts are fully Exchequer funded.  All of these <Col N="432"/>staff have now been made subject to the terms of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.</P>
        <P>Differentiation between workers paid exclusively through privately raised funds in recognised fee-paying schools and those funded in whole or in part through Exchequer funds would create difficulties as there is a variety of staff across the education sector who are employed by public service bodies but who are either wholly or partly funded from non-Exchequer sources. Within this cadre, there are also staff undertaking the same or similar duties to staff who are fully Exchequer funded. It would be inequitable and inappropriate to exempt the staff paid exclusively through privately raised funds from the pay reductions while other staff continued to be subject to the legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Committee for Performance Awards was established in November 2001 to oversee the operation of schemes for performance awards for certain grades within the civil service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces. The first awards under the scheme of performance-related awards were made in 2003 in respect of 2002.  Subsequent awards were made annually thereafter up to 2008 in respect of performance in 2007.  On 5 February 2009 the Minister for Finance announced in the D&aacute;il the discontinuation of the scheme for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretary and related grades. No awards have been made under the scheme in respect of performance in 2008 to date. The Committee was stood down in January 2010.</P>
        <P>In 2007 a total of 205 individuals received awards under this scheme in respect of 2006, while 221 received awards in 2008 in respect of 2007.  While the introduction of performance related schemes in the commercial and non-commercial State sponsored bodies sector require the approval of the Minister for Finance, once such approval has been given, the operation of such schemes is a matter for the relevant Boards and parent Departments. In this context, comprehensive data on annual performance related payments in the commercial and non-commercial State sponsored bodies sector is not held in my Department but may be sought from the parent Departments concerned. All such schemes are predicated on the achievement of stretched targets &mdash; i.e. payments under such schemes are not to be seen as an automatic addition to basic pay.</P>
        <P>It is to be noted that in the context of Non Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, Secretaries General of Government Departments were advised in 2009 that in current circumstances, but while appreciating that contractual issues may be involved, it would be appropriate that consideration of any bonus payments should be suspended. Secretaries General were asked to convey this position to the bodies under the aegis of their Departments. A similar letter issued earlier this year in respect of performance payments in Commercial State Companies. Details of any performance awards made to CEOs of Commercial State Companies will be outlined in the relevant Annual Reports.</P>
        <P>While not encompassing the Commercial State Companies, it is to be noted that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector (Report No 44: September 2009) stated that the Review Group remained committed to the concept of performance schemes for the <Col N="433"/>higher management grades in the public service but, in recognition of the very serious state of the public finances, recommended that such payments be suspended until 2012 when they should be reviewed again.</P>
        <P>As far as credit institutions are concerned, I do not have the information requested by the Deputy in the form he requested. I will write to the Deputy shortly on this. However, the Deputy may wish to note in relation to the matter of remuneration at the covered institutions (including Anglo Irish Bank) that the NTMA have recently, on behalf of my Department, requested the CEOs of each of the covered institutions to review remuneration policy and practices in their institutions.  The institutions have also been asked to consider measures that could be undertaken to align staff expectations with regard to benefits/remuneration to the changed economic environment and the financial circumstances of the banks.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have reviewed the issues raised, by the Deputy, on behalf of an employee shareholder of Irish Life and Permanent (ILP) who raised concerns regarding his shareholding consequent on the forthcoming recapitalisation of the institution which has been mandated by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI).  In relation to the concerns raised about the capital requirement for the institution, I would point out that such requirements for all of the four institutions, announced on 31st March 2011, were determined by the CBI and its advisors having regard to the situation of the institutions concerned. This process took place completely independent from me as Minister and my Department. I would point out that ILP was not treated any differently to any of the other institutions in this process. The outcomes were a function of each bank&rsquo;s particular circumstances and characteristics, not different targets or processes.  Furthermore, it should be well understood by observers at this stage that given the serious financial circumstances in which the banks and the State now finds themselves, the latest round of stress tests had to be seen by all as extremely credible and <Col N="434"/>robust and I believe the results that were released have been seen and accepted as such by the markets.</P>
        <P>Regarding the concerns raised as to how shareholders may be treated in the forthcoming recapitalisation of the institution, I would point out that, as previously announced, ILP must raise its &euro;4bn requirement by end July, subject to appropriate adjustment for expected asset sales.  ILP currently intends to offer its non-banking businesses for sale by end October.</P>

	<P>Firstly, I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the <Col N="435"/>child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is to promote the principle of inclusive education as envisaged in Section 2 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, Act 2004. My Department, either directly or through the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them cater for students with special educational needs which includes additional teachers, Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and specialist equipment. The precise model of provision made will depend on the pupil&rsquo;s assessed disability.</P>
        <P>The SNA scheme provides additional supports to schools to enable them to support pupils with significant care needs. SNAs are allocated to schools by the NCSE through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs). The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>I have therefore referred this query to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.  I wish to advise the Deputy also that the NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of SNA support to eligible schools.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intends to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</P>

	<P>As part of the Jobs Initiative, an additional 1,000 approved Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places will be made available for the 2011/2012 academic year. On 11 May, my Department wrote to providers inviting applications for the allocation of the additional places.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is under the management of County Offaly Vocational Education Committee (VEC). As such, it is for that VEC to submit an application, rather than the school itself. An application has been received from County Offaly VEC and is currently under consideration by my Department. The closing date for receipt of applications was the 24th of May and allocations will be notified to providers shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>In allocating places, my Department will have regard to current and previous demand from individual providers, current and previous uptake (enrolment trends), current allocations to individual providers and the overall number of places available. All applications will be dealt with equitably and on their own merits.</P>

	<P>The PDST is a team of seconded teachers, which offers professional development support to primary and post-primary teachers on a wide range of topics. The PDST was established in September 2010, following a reconfiguration of the support services in existence prior to that date. 2011 is the first full year of the operation of the PDST, and the service will be centrally involved in implementing measures to improve literacy and numeracy from the 2011/2012 school year. </P>
        <P>The PDST team was established following a competitive process where serving secondees in the 2009/2010 school year were invited to apply for a position in the new service. The successful candidates were chosen on merit, and are able to operate on a generic and cross-sectoral basis. I have no plans to review the results of this competitive process. The distribution of staff across the 6 Education Centre regions is weighted according to the number of schools in these regions. This distribution is subject to review as needs evolve and on consideration of any advice from PDST management in relation to emerging pressures.</P>

	<P>Section 31.22 of the ten year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006 &mdash; 2015 &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; provided that all payments to teachers would be made electronically by the end of 2006 at the latest.  </P>
        <P>In November 2006 teachers paid on payrolls operated by my Department and paid by means of payable order were requested to submit bank account details to enable payment directly to their bank account.</P>
        <P>Payment of the pay increases under the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; agreement were subject to sign off by the Education Sector Performance Verification Group (ESPVG) appointed to oversee the implementation of the actions and could be withheld if the actions agreed were not progressed.   The first three increases under the agreement were paid to all teachers between 1 December 2006 and 1st March 2008 as individual teachers continued to move to electronic payments.</P>
        <P>The ESPVG was unable to sign off on the final increase on the 1st September 2008 as all teachers had not moved to EFT payments.  The ESPVG recommended that the 1st September 2008 pay increase not be paid to teachers who had not made arrangements for electronic payments.</P>
        <P>The increase was not applied to the teacher&rsquo;s salary referenced by the Deputy in September 2008. Six letters issued between November 2006 and August 2008 advising that the increases could not be paid under the agreement if the teacher did not move to the electronic method of salary payment.  Two further letters issued between September 2008 and January 2009 outlining that the Department was prepared to backdate the increased payment to the 1st September 2008 if the teacher signed up to EFT.  The teacher in question did not agree to payment by EFT and was not awarded the increase.</P>
        <P>The teacher took a case to a Rights Commissioner in relation to the withholding of the final pay increase and the claim was rejected.  A subsequent appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal upheld the Rights Commissioner&rsquo;s recommendations.   The teacher has since retired.  Pension is calculated on a teacher&rsquo;s pensionable service and on his reckonable pensionable pay at retirement.  As outlined this teacher&rsquo;s pay immediately prior to retirement did not include <Col N="438"/>the final increase under the &ldquo;Towards 2016&rdquo; agreement.  Consequently his annual pension remains lower than it would be had he agreed to the terms of the agreement negotiated for the education sector.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Programme for Government clearly states that education will be a priority for this Government and that we will endeavour to protect and enhance the educational experience of children, young people and students. To that end, we will endeavour to protect frontline services in education. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that it is necessary to ensure that educational services are delivered within the resources available due to the current fiscal position. I intend to prioritise and support special educational services. However, I cannot re-visit the previous Government&rsquo;s decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme. This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</P>

	<P>I understand the arrangement referred to by the Deputy is one whereby insurance companies actively recommend certain approved repairers to their policyholders with the approved repairers selected on the basis that they meet various qualitative standards and, in return, are guaranteed a minimum flow of work. Service Level Agreements are generally entered into by the insurance company and the approved repairer.  Policyholders, however, are free to select a repairer of their choice.   </P>
        <P>The Competition Authority, which is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State, has previously advised my Department that such arrangements do not appear to breach competition law but, in fact, appear to result in a more cost effective service being provided to the general public.</P><Col N="439"/>
        <P>More recently, the Authority has conducted market enquiries with insurance companies on the matter and it appears to remain the policy of insurance companies to allow policyholders to choose a repairer other than the approved repairer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The exemption from the requirement for certain private limited companies to have accounts audited was first introduced in the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999, based on meeting specific criteria and companies falling within the scope of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986.  The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 and the Investment Funds, Companies Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2006 made amendments to the thresholds applying to the exemption from audit requirement.  Companies who meet the relevant criteria are currently exempt from having their accounts audited where all of the following thresholds apply: turnover not exceeding &euro;7.3m.; balance sheet total not exceeding &euro;3.65m.; and average number of employees in the year not exceeding 50.</P>
        <P>Companies organised as non-profit organisations, such as charities, residential management companies, sports clubs, trade associations and community or special interest groups are generally incorporated as companies limited by guarantee.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) considered the case for extending the audit exemption to companies limited by guarantee.  As outlined in its 2009 Annual Report, the Group recommended that: (i) Subject to consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Charities Regulator, the audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act should be extended to such class or classes of companies limited by guarantee which are charitable organisations (within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009) so as to bring them into alignment with charitable organisations that are not companies, provided that 10% of the members with voting rights should be able to require an audit; and (ii) the audit exemption regime be extended to all companies limited by guarantee which are not charitable organisations, subject to a veto right, (i.e. that any one member who has the right to vote at general meetings of the company may veto the proposal to avail of the exemption), and further subject to the requirement that audit exemption in respect of the following year shall be an item on the agenda of the annual general meeting.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of the CLRG in this matter will be considered in the context of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill, which is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Council.</P>

	<P>I understand that the dispute in question relates to the issue of recognition of a trade union by an employer for collective bargaining purposes, rather than the right of the workers to join a trade union. It <Col N="440"/>appears, moreover, that the matter in dispute relates to the recognition by an employer of a trade union seeking to represent workers located on one of two sites operated by the employer, in circumstances where the employer already recognizes another trade union for the purpose of collective bargaining on the other site. </P>
        <P>While Article 40 of the Irish Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form associations and unions, the question of recognising a body of workers (trade union or staff association) for the purposes of negotiating pay and other conditions of employment is a matter solely for the employer under Irish law.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the dispute in question was referred by a particular union to the Labour Court, which recommended that the company recognise the applicant trade union for collective bargaining and industrial relations purposes in respect of its members at one of the two sites. The Court further recommended that, should any inter union issues arise with any other trade union in respect of negotiating rights in the overall employment, which covers more than one site, the special internal procedures of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should be utilised to resolve such issues. While the trade union that had referred the complaint agreed to be bound by the Labour Court recommendation, there is no obligation on the employer to accept the Court&rsquo;s recommendation.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  Responsibility for the settlement of this dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  The obligation lies with the parties to seek to resolve their differences and to carry their efforts through to completion.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation one of my main priorities is to ensure that State support for enterprise activity, entrepreneurship stimulation and job creation is delivered, is properly targeted and is effective and coherent. I want to ensure that it is cost effective and that the resources available to the State are used to maximise business activity and sustainability across all sectors in order to drive economic recovery. </P>
        <P>My Department provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to business. The role of the CEBs is to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at a local level primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small and micro-enterprises. The Boards form a nationwide support network for small business and are considered to be a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business.</P>
        <P>Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing micro-enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of priming, expansion/development and feasibility/innovation grants.  In addition, the CEBs deliver non-financial supports such as one-<Col N="441"/>to-one mentoring and a range of business advice and training programmes to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, which may be available as appropriate to the needs of the promoter&rsquo;s business.</P>
        <P>In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available, individuals and business owners are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their particular needs with the relevant staff of the Board.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: <i>www.enterpriseboards.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s remit is to work with Irish-owned companies including SMEs that wish to expand and grow on international markets. Enterprise Ireland (EI) is therefore focused on every aspect of the exporting and trade development process for these companies and provides a range of business supports including funding in an integrated and coherent manner to help companies develop the business capabilities required to successfully export.</P>
        <P>Optimising the environment within which all companies can access finance is a key government policy.  For EI&rsquo;s part, the agency has been focused on building relationships with the main Banks to highlight the needs of the Irish-owned exporting base. This has included two-way staff secondments which ensure greater understanding and on-going development of sectoral expertise within corporate and business banking to support emerging sectors. Over the last couple of years and especially a the height of the recession, EI was active in organising workshops across the country for clients on cash management and also discussed hundreds of individual cases on behalf of individual exporters (with those exporting firms participation) directly with banks where appropriate. SMEs also have access to the services of the Credit Review Office. The Credit Review Office was set up to assist businesses having difficulty getting credit and to monitor bank lending to the SME sector. The Office provides an independent review process for SME&rsquo;s (including sole traders and farmers) who have had requests for credit refused or reduced, or existing credit facilities withdrawn by the NAMA banks &mdash; effectively AIB and BOI who provide approximately 60% of all lending to the SME sector.</P>
        <P>In addition to the targeted state supports provided to SMES, the Government is also assisting through other indirect measures across the economy. The recently announced Government Jobs Initiative will assist SMEs through a range of measures designed to assist in employment generation and provide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs, thus continuing to restore confidence and further generate sustainability in the economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together. </P>
        <P>The qualifying conditions for State pension (contributory), as set out in Section 109 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, require an applicant to</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />have entered insurable employment before attaining the age of 56 years.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />have at least 260 paid contribution weeks, from employment or self-employment, since entry into insurance.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />satisfy the yearly average condition.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, under Section 110 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by Section 9 of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009, where a person applying for State pension (contributory) has been a self-employed (Class S) PRSI contributor, the contribution conditions are not regarded as having been satisfied unless all self-employment contributions payable by him/her have been paid. The Revenue Commissioners are the primary collection agents of the Department in relation to PRSI. Income tax and PRSI payable by a self-employed contributor are treated as one aggregate sum in accordance with the provisions of Section 23(4) of the 2005 Social Welfare Consolidation Act. For that reason, it is not possible to separate payments to Revenue between tax and PRSI liabilities.</P>
        <P>Where an individual has partly discharged their aggregate liabilities to Revenue, this amount is apportioned equally between tax and PRSI without any provision for front-loading payments towards PRSI (only) liabilities. Neither will the Department agree to accept PRSI payments separately, when Revenue collection efforts are ongoing. Revenue may decide to cease collection efforts in relation to outstanding tax liabilities in accordance with its own statutory powers and administrative procedures.  In such a case the Department will agree to accept payment of any outstanding PRSI liabilities at that point. There are no provisions under which an outstanding PRSI liability may be cancelled.</P>
        <P>There is no link between the award of State pension (non-contributory) and any outstanding PRSI liabilities a claimant may have. If a claimant satisfies the conditions for receipt of State pension (non-contributory), including the means test, then the pension can be awarded.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that it has refused an application for rent supplement from the person concerned on the grounds that the amount of rent payable was in excess of the prescribed rent limit of &euro;94 per week for a single person. The decision has been appealed to the HSE&rsquo;s designated Appeals Officer and a decision on entitlement will be made in due course. The HSE has further advised that, as an exceptional measure due to the customer&rsquo;s medical condition, it is willing to award a rent supplement in this case provided the person concerned secures alternative accommodation for under &euro;110 per week.

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case. There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432. This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order. In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Each application is determined by the HSE based on the particular circumstances of the case.

	<P>Late last year agreement was reached between the Health Service Executive (HSE) and unions representing the Community Welfare Officers that the staff of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) would transfer to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011 on a secondment basis initially. The period of secondment is to last for 9 months until the end of September 2011. During this period these staff will remain employees of the HSE but are subject to the general direction and control of the Minster for Social Protection.</P>
        <P>From 1 October 2011 it is intended that the staff of the CWS will be transferred fully to the Department as civil servants and will be accountable to the Minister in the same way as other civil servants. I have been advised that a number of staff in the CWS were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months, including some of the staff in the rents unit in question. These contracts were subsequently extended to June 2011 from when they are to be gradually withdrawn.</P>
        <P>In the context of the transfer of functions from the HSE to the Department a number of Transition Managers were appointed from within the Community Welfare Service, to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to the Department. The relevant transition managers are currently in the process of examining the service implications arising from the loss of these temporary staff.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that they do not hold statistics on reasons for allowing appeals. However, that office works with the Department on an ongoing basis to ensure that initial decision making in the Department is improved. This is achieved through meetings with various areas of the Department, including, in particular the Decisions Advisory Office which exercises a supervisory role in relation to the statutory submission of appeal documentation by Deciding Officers. These meetings allow for elaboration of appeal decisions and for feedback to the Department in relation to issues, legislative and/or administrative practices that may have been the subject of contention at appeal.</P>
        <P>The Decisions Advisory Office is responsible for ensuring decisions made on social welfare claims are consistent and of good quality. To this end, guidelines are issued by the Department in relation to the legislation concerned to ensure consistency of decision making by deciding officers throughout the Department. In addition, training is provided to deciding officers on their statutory obligations and the application of the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</P>
        <P>While 42.7% of appeals had a successful outcome for the appellant in 2010, of the 12,029 favourable decisions on appeal cases, almost two thirds of these decisions (7,282) were in fact revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of my Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance. These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original <Col N="445"/>decision on his/her claim. In such cases an Appeals Officer decision was not necessary. In addition, it should be noted that of the 17,499 appeals decided by Appeals Officers, a total of 12,752 (73%) upheld the original decision of the Deciding Officer. In line with the Department&rsquo;s policy to promote the provision of information, the guidelines referred to above are also available to members of the public on the Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or on request from any social welfare local office.</P>

	<P>From July 2009, a new condition for rent supplement was introduced which required that in order to qualify, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement. A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</P>
        <P>In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside). When a person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, the person then becomes eligible for consideration for rent supplement.</P>
        <P>This condition was introduced following consultation with the Department of the Environment, Community &amp; Local Government and ensures that the provision of housing support in respect of new household formations is overseen by local authorities. Responsibility for the rules and guidelines used to determine whether a person is assessed as being eligible for social housing support is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</P>
        <P>However, I understand from my colleague the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government that as part of his Department&rsquo;s ongoing liaison with the Irish Naturalisation <Col N="446"/>and Immigration Service, that his Department has undertaken to review the guidance to local authorities to ensure that it reflects and interprets correctly the position of non-EEA nationals granted immigration Stamp 4 by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.</P>

	<P>The HSE advised that the person concerned received rent supplement at a higher rate than that to which she was entitled thus incurring an overpayment. This transpired as she had extra household income from her participation on a Community Employment scheme and her rent supplement entitlement was not reduced accordingly. The person concerned appealed the decision to raise an overpayment against her to the HSE Appeals Office but the decision was upheld by the HSE Appeals Office. The person concerned should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre in order to make arrangements to repay the overpayment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The profiling model has been developed by the ERSI and is set out in its 2009 report &ldquo;National Profiling of the Unemployed in Ireland&rdquo;. Following on from this my Department has, in conjunction with the ESRI, developed the necessary technological functionality to provide for the capture of profile data from jobseekers and the calculation of each person&rsquo;s probability of exit from the Live Register within 12 months. This functionality will also provide the facility to segment and select customers, based on their probability of exit from the Live Register, for referral to appropriate supports.</P>
        <P>The model uses a range of characteristics, including age, with weightings applied to them. Other characteristics include education level, literacy or numeracy difficulties, number of children, and history of unemployment. The accuracy, or predictive capacity of the model developed, is high by international standards and is particularly accurate in predicting likely duration on the Live Register. It is planned to implement enhanced activation arrangements which will be grounded in a profiling system using the statistical model developed. Profiling will facilitate early targeted interventions for those who need them most, resulting in better outcomes and potential programme savings. The model is currently being tested in the live environment in preparation for a planned roll-out of profiling functionality across local offices nationally.</P>

        <P>EirGrid, the Transmission System Operator, has published a GRID25 development plan which outlines in detail the upgrades and grid reinforcement required in each region in Ireland between now and 2025 to cater for future regional electricity growth and to accommodate new generation, particularly new renewable generation onto the system.</P>
        <P>In the South-West region which includes Kerry and Cork, EirGrid identified the need to significantly reinforce the transmission system in the region by upgrading around 130km of the existing and new transmission system.  This strengthening of the system will facilitate the movement of new electricity generation to the South East and other higher electricity demand regions.  The plan is available to the public on the EirGrid website.</P>
        <P>There is currently over 1,475MW megawatts (MWs) of wind capacity connected in Ireland.  The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid, mainly wind, is increasing very steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed over 13% of all electricity consumed in 2010 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The specific environmental and economic pressures that have informed priorities and project selection in the Programme are: water conservation proposals which meet environmental and economic goals; environmental objectives including works required to respond to judgments of the European Court of Justice; environment and Public Health Objectives arising, for example, from environmental regulation in respect of drinking water standards, wastewater treatment standards, wastewater discharge authorisations, bathing water standards, Pollution Reduction Programme for Shellfish Waters, fresh water pearl mussel plans, etc; and compliance with the Water Framework Directive requirements and projects which support economic development and employment creation.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently undertaking an annual review of the Programme.  There are two components to this review: a review of progress of all schemes and contracts currently in the Programme, and following that a consideration of the need for any reprioritisation of contracts and schemes, including addressing issues which have emerged since the Programme was published and which require an urgent response.  The current scale of the published Programme was set in the context of likely available financial resources over the medium term.  In light of this, and given the short time which has passed since the extensive review undertaken in the development of the Programme, there is only scope for, and should only be a need for, minor adjustments to the Programme at this stage.</P>

	<P>The current pyrite problems were first brought to the attention of my Department in mid-2007 and it acted quickly in taking appropriate action to address them.  Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it addresses the quality standards of new homes and buildings insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.</P>
        <P>The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and the related technical guidance documents provide guidance on how to comply with those regulations.  The relevant Technical Guidance Document of the Building Regulations dealing with Site Preparation was amended to incorporate the revised NSAI Standard Recommendation.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am aware that HomeBond, a private company which provides a ten-year structural guarantee for new houses, has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published 6th edition of the house building manual.  I attach a high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings and I have asked my Department to prioritise the formulation of policy proposals that will enhance compliance with, and enforcement of, the building regulations generally.  I will be meeting a representative group in the next few weeks to establish what can be done to help home owners deal with outstanding issues in the context of recent court decisions and departmental responsibilities.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of one regeneration project, Ballymun regeneration, where higher than acceptable levels of pyrite have been discovered at three locations. These include the Ballymun Central Youth Facility, a new 124-unit apartment complex at Sillogue 4 and completed and tenanted units at Poppintree 5.</P>
        <P>Following the discovery of elevated levels of pyrite in the hardcore fill for the Youth Facility building, remedial works costing an estimated &euro;1.25 million were carried out by the contractor. These works were satisfactorily completed in accordance with the terms of the contract and at no extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In the case of the apartment complex at Sillogue 4, extensive remediation works are deemed necessary to address the pyrite problems at this new development.  The regeneration company, with the support of my Department, has been engaging with the contractor to identify the optimum solution to the problem. As this is a live contract, it is envisaged that the remedial works will be carried out under the terms of the contract and at no additional cost to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>My Department was recently notified of a potential pyrite problem at a completed and tenanted development at Poppintree 5.  The regeneration company, together with Dublin City Council, is currently conducting more detailed surveys with a view to establishing the full extent of the problem and the nature and scale of the remedial works which will be required to deal with it. As soon as all the facts have been established, the regeneration company will put <Col N="451"/>measures in place to ensure that residents are fully informed of the extent of the problems and the solutions to be put in place to address these.</P>

	<P>The Government decided in 2009 to broaden the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on all non-principal private residences.  The charge is payable by the owners of private rented accommodation, holiday homes and any other residential property that is not the owner&rsquo;s sole or main residence.</P>
        <P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which sets out the detail of the charge, defines residential property as including flats, apartments and bed-sits.  The &euro;200 charge is payable on each unit of accommodation used, or suitable for use as a separate dwelling, whether or not <Col N="452"/>any amenity or facility in the building or premises may be shared.  The owner of a house split into a number of bed-sits is thus liable for the charge on each unit in that house.</P>

	<P>In general, planning permission must be obtained for the erection of an antenna support structure or mast.  Under Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, certain classes of development carried out by a statutory undertaker authorised to provide a telecommunications service are, subject to specified conditions, exempted development for the purposes of the Planning Acts.  These include&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the erection of an antenna support structure in place of an existing antenna support structure, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings (other than educational facilities, childcare facilities or hospitals).</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The above exemptions are conditional, <i>inter alia</i>, on the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least four weeks before the attachment of the antennae.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures in 1996, which are intended to inform planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the licensed providers of mobile telecommunications services and the public on how such developments are dealt with in the planning system, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the locational hierarchy in respect of the siting of radio masts in both larger urban centres and in smaller towns or villages and how free-standing masts and antennae should be designed and adapted for the specific location.  Under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities are required to have regard to such Ministerial Guidelines (which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>), in the performance of their functions.  I have no plans at present to amend the relevant Regulations or Guidelines.</P>
        <P>The issue of potential health effects of mobile phone masts was comprehensively covered by the Expert Group Report, published by Government in March 2007, entitled Health Effects of <Col N="453"/>Electromagnetic Fields, which is available for download on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The Expert Group Report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by mobile phone base stations. It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields. The Report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The majority scientific opinion is that to date no adverse short or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).  However, a minority group of scientists believes otherwise and extensive international research continues to be co-ordinated through bodies such as the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>Based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, there is no scientific basis or evidence of adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This applies irrespective of the location of the phone mast.</P>

	<P>Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign, subject to ratification, the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities when it opened for signature on 30 March 2007.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to ratify the Convention as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met.  Ireland does not become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</P>
        <P>The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention.  In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention.  The Committee has developed a programme on which work is progressing to address the matters that need to be aligned with the UNCRPD.</P>
        <P>One of the key requirements in this regard is the enactment of mental capacity legislation. The Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme announced on 5 April 2011 indicates that the Mental Capacity Bill is expected to be published in late 2011. The Bill will replace the Wards of Court system with a modern statutory framework governing decision-making on behalf of adults who lack capacity. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</P>

	<P>Recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by Statutory Regulations, namely the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admission &amp; Appointments) Regulations 1988/2005. The recruitment age was considered as recently as 2004 when, on the recommendation of the Garda Commissioner, the maximum recruitment age was increased from 26 to 35 years.</P>
        <P>This upper age limit of 35 was set having regard to equality legislation and also took into account the following criteria:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) The cost of training;</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The need for recruits to serve for a sufficient period of time as full members of the service to recoup this cost;</P>

        <P FLI="0">The upper age limit is being kept under review and consideration is being given to changing it, in limited circumstances, in any way which would be beneficial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <P>Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling, publishing and responding to queries regarding recorded crime statistics.</P>

	<P>I am committed to supporting the sheep sector, the survival of which is crucial for producers in both lowland and hill areas.</P>
        <P>This industry, which makes a valuable contribution to the overall agri food sector, has experienced renewed confidence in recent times. Its future will depend on its ability to meet the needs of the market and in order to do this there must be a three-pronged focus on competitiveness, innovation and the demands of the consumer.</P>
        <P>Our Programme for Government supports the overall Food Harvest 2020 Strategy, which provides a vision for Irish Agri-Food and Fisheries for the next 10 years. The strategy targets 20% growth in output value for the sheep sector by 2020 and sets out specific recommendations for the industry. Over the coming years, demand for sheepmeat on the European market is expected to outstrip production levels, which could provide opportunities for exporting countries such as Ireland, and the potential for better returns, provided the market and product diversification we have seen in recent years continues.  The producer too should benefit from improved price prospects, as long as there is an increased focus on production efficiency and product quality.</P>
        <P>The recommendations of Food Harvest 2020 for the sheep industry focus both on farm competitiveness and the processing sector. On the farm side the emphasis is on the use of on-farm labour efficiencies and new technologies, breed improvement and the production of a <Col N="458"/>quality product. On the processing side, the report highlights efficiencies, innovation and improved product range.</P>
        <P>Initiatives taken to support the sheep sector in recent years include:</P>
        <P LI="1">The establishment of &lsquo;Sheep Ireland&rsquo; to take over the Department&rsquo;s current breed improvement programme and develop a new one.  An interim Sheep Board, comprising representatives of farming organisations and breeders is overseeing this process, with the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation (ICBF) providing the technical and professional service required.</P>
        <P LI="1">The establishment of the Lamb Quality Assurance Scheme in 2007. This Scheme is operated by Bord Bia and now has over 8,300 participants.</P>
        <P LI="1">As part of its efforts to promote lamb on the home and export market, Bord Bia, together with its UK and French counterparts, is part of a generic promotion campaign on the valuable French market.</P>
        <P LI="1">Teagasc has developed a comprehensive plan to restructure its sheep support services, including a Better Farm Programme for sheep, which aims to establish focal points for the on-farm implementation, development and evaluation of technology that is relevant to the sheep sector. This approach provides an opportunity to engage with sheep farmers on the use of the latest management practices and to identify research and development needs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The sector has also benefitted from a number of key supports, most notably:</P>
        <P LI="1">&euro;7 million from the 2009 Single Farm Payment National Reserve under the Uplands Sheep Payment Scheme, which was specifically targeted at hill farmers;</P>
        <P LI="1">&euro;54 million for the three year grassland sheep scheme which commenced last year; and</P>
        <P LI="1">&euro;8 million for the sheep fencing/mobile handling equipment scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, Bord Bia will also spend up to &euro;1 million this year on the promotion of sheep and lamb at home and abroad and Teagasc has allocated almost &euro;1.5 million for sheep research for 2011.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to pursue the implementation of the recommendations of the Food Harvest 2020 Report to ensure the development of the agri food sector.</P>

        <P>The business plans for the six Fishery Harbour Centres located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel, An Daingean (Dingle) and Killybegs were drafted following consultation with and extensive list of interested parties (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 of Business Plans for the Development of the Fishery Harbour Centres for details).

	<P>A comprehensive review of the bottom grown mussel sector on the island of Ireland was initiated in 2006 by my predecessor and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Northern Ireland.  The outcome of that process &ldquo;The Rising Tide &mdash; A Review of the Bottom Grown (BG) Mussel Sector on the Island of Ireland&rdquo; was published in 2008.  Both Ministers accepted the recommendations of the Report as the way forward for the industry.  The Report makes many recommendations, but perhaps one of the most fundamental was the establishment of a Bottom Grown Mussel Consultative Forum, to involve industry representatives closely in the management of the sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Forum is comprised of elected representatives of the industry from both jurisdictions, together with the various regulatory and development bodies concerned, i.e. my Department, DARD, the Loughs Agency, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  BIM chairs the Forum.  The Forum meets several times a year. The Forum discusses various aspects of the operation <Col N="461"/>and management of the fishery and makes recommendations to me and the Northern Ireland Minister.  The fishery is managed jointly by the two Ministers on a consensus basis.  The operation of the Forum ensures that the management strategy for the fishery is reviewed on an ongoing basis with the full involvement of the industry.</P>
        <P>The Forum met on 8 March 2011 and arising from its discussions, arrangements for the 2011 fishery were recommended to me and the Northern Ireland Minister.  This included a recommendation to open the fishery from 8 May 2011.  Following discussion with DARD, we decided to open the fishery instead from 9 May, to better facilitate the monitoring and enforcement authorities.  A further meeting of the Forum is scheduled for June and this meeting will review the operation of the fishery since its 9 May opening and may make any recommendations to me and the Northern Ireland Minister that the Forum considers appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The plant breeders in Ireland nominated the named organisation to collect the relevant royalties for them.  My Department did not incur any expense in appointing the organisation. Hence a  tendering process was not necessary when appointing the named organisation as the competent body for monitoring the use of farm saved seed and the collection of royalties for same.  SI 273 of 2007 was introduced by my Department to define the nature of information to be maintained and the role of the named organisation in the collection of such data.  It is not proposed to put in place any steps to relieve the named organisation from its position as the designated competent body.</P>

	<P>Ireland exports some 90% of its beef production and around 98% of beef exports go to other EU Member States. The EU is only 96% self-sufficient in beef production and consumer demand for beef is expected to further exceed EU production in the coming years.  Beef exports were valued at &euro;1.51 billion in 2010 but overall export volumes to particular destinations in a particular period will vary in response to demand/supply dynamics in specific markets which in turn is influenced by such factors as product innovation, changing consumption patterns, competitor behaviour and currency fluctuations. Exchange rate movements, for example, are especially significant for the development of trade with our largest single market &mdash; the UK.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The data in tabular format illustrate the success of progressive initiatives to position Irish beef in higher-value EU markets over the past number of years. Across Europe Irish beef is stocked in 3 or more of the top 10 retailers in each major market and in over 70 retailers in total. In this regard, the marketing and promotional activities of Bord Bia play a key role in responding to evolving market conditions. Its strategy to reposition and differentiate Irish beef is aimed at growing premium brand offerings thereby enhancing returns for the producer.</P>
        <P>This approach is endorsed by the Food Harvest 2020 report which targets a growth of 20% in the output value of the sector by 2020. One means of achieving that goal is through product differentiation on the basis of predominantly grass-based production which has the potential to confer a real competitive advantage on Irish beef. As part of the smart, green approach advocated in the report and supported by some &euro;28m in Grant in Aid provided by my Department, Bord Bia is working with the industry and its customers to secure a leadership role for Irish beef in addressing sustainability as a growing consumer issue. These initiatives complement the collective efforts of my Department and other state agencies to support the sector and assist the industry to contribute to the maximum possible extent to our export-led economic recovery.</P>

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector, particularly exports, performed well during 2010. Total trade was valued at &euro;707 million, with exports valued at &euro;374 million and domestic sales at &euro;333 million. Exports were up 13% in value on 2009 and up 29% by volume.  Ireland&rsquo;s processing sector is made up of 140 processors, processing over 270,000 tonnes of seafood annually.  The  seasonal  nature of the catch and the <Col N="463"/>quota restrictions of important species require that there is significant over capacity to process these seafoods in a short time. For instance, most of the pelagic catch is processed between September and March.</P>
        <P>I have made available &euro;1.5 million in 2011 to foster the expansion and modernisation of the seafood processing sector through BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Processing Business Investment Scheme.  A call for proposals has just been completed and despite the present economic climate, the call was fully subscribed by ambitious and enterprising Irish companies.  I take great encouragement from that.</P>
        <P>BIM is working with fishermen and processors around the coast to promote product innovation, differentiation of product, competitiveness, business acumen and management, environmental awareness and compliance.  I recently launched a new BIM support scheme to encourage the Irish seafood sector away from low value commodity exports to value added high quality food products that provide much more employment and greater economic return on investment.  The Seafood Value Adding Scheme will support Irish seafood companies in the area of new product development.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for food labelling is with the Department of Health and Children (DoHC). My Department works closely with the DoHC and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) which has responsibility for enforcement of the relevant provisions of the legislation.  Ireland has favoured the extension of mandatory origin or provenance labelling to meats other than beef, including poultry, and including where such meats are ingredients in processed products and has lobbied for this with the European Commission for many years.</P>
        <P>A draft European Commission Regulation, <i>Food Information for the Consumer</i> which, <i>inter alia</i>, relates to mandatory country of origin/place of provenance labelling is currently at Second Reading Stage in the European Parliament with discussions ongoing between the Parliament, Council and the Commission. This Regulation makes provision for the extension of the mandatory origin/provenance labelling requirements to other meats including poultry meat.  It is expected that this process will culminate by the end of 2011 with a requirement that poultry meat should be labelled with country of origin.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned about the unacceptable practice of discarding fish at sea and I am fully committed to working both nationally and internationally to bring about an end to this practice.  Commissioner Damanaki has placed discarding of fish high on her agenda for the Common Fisheries Policy reform and at my meeting with her on the 14th of April made clear that I  was committed to giving Ireland&rsquo;s  support to assisting the Commissioner in identifying and implementing the appropriate measures to effectively address discards.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P Just="Left">At home I have taken a number of opportunities to discuss this complex subject with the Irish fishing industry. I am happy to say that it is also grappling with ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate discards and is currently engaging in trials on selective gears in the Celtic Sea haddock and whiting fisheries, with a view to bringing proposals to me in the next few weeks.   I intend to bring these proposals to my French counterpart as a possible joint approach to the EU Commission as France and Ireland are the main players in these fisheries. If we are successful in agreeing new measures with France and secure EU Commission support, I would be prepared to promote their introduction at national level in both jurisdictions pending their adoption at EU level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Discarding has been receiving huge exposure across various international media, setting a negative picture of the global fishing industry. Decisive action is required in the short term, however, the problem is complex with many and at times disconnected factors impacting on it.  This level of complexity requires an approach which recognises the multi-faceted issues, the different dynamics of individual fisheries and areas and delivers real policies and change on a number of fronts.  Any resolution will require the buy in of our fishers and a significant behavioural shift will be required from them to successfully eliminate discards. Without this change in operational patterns there will be a real danger that whatever new legislation is introduced will only succeed in pushing discarding further &ldquo;underground&rdquo; and this would worsen the current data situation and not deal with the  problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Discards were a high priority in Ireland&rsquo;s formal submission on the CFP Review forwarded last year, which argued for a fishery specific approach involving remedial actions to reduce or eliminate discards involving changes to fishing gear and fishing practices.  It focused on the development of a strong industry, science, gear technology partnership to best equip our fleets for their specific needs. It also promoted the development of a Code of Practice to incentivise best practice.  My preference is for a clear policy to eliminate discards, backed up by unambiguous and appropriate technical measures and supports which can demonstrably achieve the stated policy goal. To my mind, there has been little elaboration on the suite of measures and supports that will be necessary.  This  is undermining the discussion to date.</P>
        <P>One of the possible measures being looked at is the concept of catch quota management which involves landing all catches of targeted stocks and recording the landings against quota. There are pilot schemes up and running in some Member States and I await the outcome of those, though it is already clear to me that any move in this direction would have to be over a reasonable timeframe, provide some adjustment in quota to take account of the increased landings and be on a voluntary basis in the first instance.   This approach is technical and requires a significant capital investment in equipment and human resources which will have to be facilitated by financial support from the EU if it is to become a reality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">From a national perspective in addition to the industry led trials in the Celtic Sea already mentioned, Ireland is preparing a project proposal for the Biologically Sensitive Area (BSA) of the South and West coasts of Ireland, with a view to developing clear management objectives for the area, with a strong focus on the elimination of discards, in the key Hake, Monk and Megrim fisheries.  I hope to submit project proposals to Commissioner Damanaki before the summer.  The objective is develop a  regionalised plan agreed by ourselves, France, the UK and Spain setting out appropriate measures to meet stringent conservation objectives for the area. It could be a roadmap for other programmes to deal with the discard issue across Europe.</P>

	<P>The bulk of quota species caught by Irish fishing vessels are landed into Irish fishing ports.  In addition, non-Irish vessels fishing their quota in Irish waters land a small and variable proportion of their catch to Irish fishing ports.  Approximately 220,000 tonnes of fish were landed into Irish ports in 2009.</P>
        <P>The potential exists to attract more foreign landings into Ireland and develop Ireland as a European seafood-processing hub. Food Harvest 2020 recognised this as an opportunity for the Irish processing industry.  Such a strategy can offer foreign boats catching off the west coast of Ireland increased efficiencies for landing, grading and processing their catch and better distribution of different species to the relevant consumer markets.  Increased landings offer Irish processing companies the raw material to expand, increase processing efficiencies and increase employment.  During the month of July 2011, BIM will pilot a new initiative to match large French catching organisations to dynamic Irish processors.  The goal is to increase the amount of white fish and prawns landed and processed in Ireland.</P>

        <P>A number of samples are sent abroad annually for tests which are not carried out at my Department&rsquo;s laboratories e.g. typing of bacteria, tests for exotic viruses, confirmatory testing, toxin or residue analysis etc. or where the in-house resources are inadequate to carry out testing. This may vary annually depending on circumstances. It is envisaged that the need for such referrals will diminish in the future, as my Department Laboratories continue to introduce new analytical methods and technologies with the objective of meeting a higher proportion of our needs and thus minimising our dependency on external laboratories.</P>
        <P>There are ongoing discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the recruitment of staff, of which a number will be assigned to laboratory duties. When sanction is received, these staff will be recruited and will contribute to reducing our dependency on external laboratories.  The need to have certain tests done in external laboratories is a function also of resources available to my Department. This, coupled with increased demands from new EU legislation is kept under constant review.</P>

As can be seen from the table, most of our sheepmeat exports are directed to a relatively small stable group of Western European countries with the quantities varying from <Col N="466"/>year to year due to market forces. Export volumes to the EU are a reflection of production trends and market demands in those countries.  Recently, interest has been shown by sheepmeat exporters in diversifying into more third country markets and my Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been making efforts to secure market access to facilitate such trade.</P>

	<P>The pig industry is a valuable component of the overall agri-food sector, and has a farm gate value in excess of &euro;300 million. The sector supports approximately 7,000 jobs including production, slaughter, processing, feed manufacture and services and these are dispersed around the country. Production, prices and exports grew significantly during 2010 and the impact of this growth was felt at all levels of the production cycle.</P>
        <P>Having said that, I am aware of the cyclical nature of the sector and the difficulties currently being experienced. While returns have improved in recent months and are forecast to improve in the medium term, the biggest issue for producers at the moment remains feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed. Pig producers are especially affected by an increase in the order of 35% in cereal prices since June 2010, given that cereals account for 70% of feed. This has reduced margins to below the long-term average, a situation which may have an impact on production decisions in both the short and medium term. Difficulties in maintaining credit facilities with suppliers and banks are exacerbating this situation.</P>
        <P>The normal pig production pattern has long been characterised by its cyclical nature. As units become larger on average and contract production becomes more commonplace, some of this cyclicality is likely to diminish but it will still remain an integral feature of the industry.  At EU level an Enlarged Advisory Group on Pigmeat which met on four occasions during the spring of this year discussed a number of initiatives to address current difficulties in the sector. <Col N="467"/>These included innovation, structural adjustment and greater integration, together with the use of animal based proteins, GMOs and the role of market management tools such as Aid to Private Storage. The Commission operated one such scheme during the early part of the year which resulted in 1,422 tonnes being contracted into storage in Ireland.</P>
        <P>At last week&rsquo;s Farm Council the Commission indicated that they would be coming up with a number of proposals within the process of CAP reform. They also invited Member States to come forward with ideas and solutions. I recently met a range of stakeholders in the sector and discussed many of the issues currently affecting the industry. I also invited stakeholders to consider any suggestions or proposals they may wish to make and to advance them through the Food Harvest 2020 Implementation Process.</P>

	<P>The Food Harvest 2020 strategy, represents the strategic blueprint for the development of the agriculture, food, fisheries and forestry sector for the next decade.  The sector currently employs almost 135,000 people, with a significant weighting of activity in rural and coastal communities, often in areas where few other employment opportunities currently exist.  Indications based on the growth targets in Food Harvest 2020 are that a net gain of 7,000 jobs in the food industry by 2020 is possible.</P><Col N="468"/>
        <P>In addition, prospects of increased employment in micro companies employing fewer than five employees, which are not generally captured in statistics, are also good.   In 2011 a record 183 small companies have been awarded Bord Bia marketing grants totalling &euro;1 million geared at increasing sales by 5%.  A number of these companies envisage expanding full and part-time employment in 2011-2012.</P>

	<P>The Grassland Sheep Scheme is one of three schemes introduced by my Department using funding made available following the CAP Health Check; a total of &euro;18 million per annum is ear-marked for the Scheme out of the total pool available of &euro;25 million, with the balance divided between the Dairy Efficiency Programme (&euro;6 million) and the Burren Farming for Conservation Programme (&euro;1 million). These Schemes are each projected to have a three-year life span &mdash; 2010, 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P>There was a hiatus in making payments for a time, following identification of a funding issue, as the initial payment rates were found to be slightly higher than should have been the case. Given the financial ceiling applicable, it was necessary to review the payment base. The situation has now been resolved and the payments due to re-commence issuing later this week are at slightly lower correct rates than the earlier payments. Those who were in receipt of these earlier payments have been slightly over-paid. However, the intention is that the sums in question will be adjusted and taken from the payments due under the 2011 Scheme.</P>

        <P>BIM is an independent statutory body and has advised my Department that the demands of delivering the 14 week intensive course leading to the Skipper Full Certificate of Competency require the availability of two Master Mariners plus other instructors with maritime qualifications satisfying the requirements of the Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport.  In August, 2008 the employment contract of one Master Mariner Instructor in the Regional Fisheries Centre, Castletownbere concluded. As a result the Skipper Full Certificate of Competency course could not be offered in Castletownbere. Aspiring candidates were redirected to BIM&rsquo;s National Fisheries College, Greencastle, Co. Donegal. Following the retirement of a Master Mariner in Greencastle in December 2010, BIM had to cancel Skipper Full Certificate.</P>
        <P>My Department and BIM have commenced discussions on addressing the personnel needs of delivering the Skipper Full Certificate course in the context of BIM&rsquo;s Employment Control Framework targets. BIM advise that in the interim it intends to seek instructors on a service supply basis on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders site as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>The functions of sea-fishing boat licensing were transferred from the Minister to the Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003.  The Licensing Authority operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act and Ministerial Policy Directives and deals with all applications for sea-fishing boat licences. The head of the Licensing Authority is the Registrar General of Fishing Boats who is a senior official in the Department.</P>
        <P>Section 3(5) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 prohibits me from exercising &ldquo;any power or control in relation to any particular case or group of cases with which the Licensing Authority is or may be concerned&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I have however made enquiries of the Registrar General who advises me that the Licensing Authority was contacted in early 2008 on behalf of the person concerned in relation to an <Col N="470"/>application for a Sea Fishing Boat Licence for his boat MFV The Flower under the Special Scheme for Vessels in the Irish Fleet at 31/12/1984.  From the information provided, it appears that the application would have been submitted in the early 1990s although no more specific date has been given.</P>
        <P>This special scheme was introduced in 1994, following approval from the European Commission, in order to regularise the position of a substantial number of mainly small vessels engaged in multipurpose (i.e. Polyvalent General) commercial fishing.  These vessels had been in the fleet but, for various reasons, had not been formally licensed or registered.  Applications under this scheme had to be received not later than 17th February 1995.</P>
        <P>The scheme closed on 10 March 2006 because of an obligation imposed by the European Commission on Ireland to complete the licensing and registration of eligible vessels under the schemes at the earliest possible date as part of a process of finalising the fishing fleet capacity limits of all Member States.  A number of applications had still not completed the licensing and registration process by that point and were excluded from the scheme.</P>
        <P>The Registrar General informs me that despite several extensive trawls of documentation in relation to the scheme, no such application has been located.  No correspondence with the person concerned has been located, he is not on any listing on file or on the database of applications received.</P>
        <P>At the request of the applicant&rsquo;s solicitors, searches have been carried out under several possible versions of his surname, with no success.  A copy of a vessel survey report carried out in 1999 has been submitted.  However, there is no record of this document in any of the records now in the custody of the Licensing Authority.</P>
        <P>The position now is that the licensing and registration of the vessel was not completed before the closing date of the scheme in March 2006, and the award of capacity under the scheme cannot now be considered.</P>
        <P>It is of course open to the person concerned to apply to the Licensing Authority to licence and register the vessel under current licensing procedures.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the enforcement of food safety and food labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and its official agents, which include the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (DAFF), Local Authorities (LAs) and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA).</P>
        <P>The HSE in 2008, carried out a total number of 18,068 food labelling inspections which identified 2,866 non-compliances. In 2009, a total number of 54,177 food labelling inspections identified 8,425 non-compliances. In 2010, a total number of 52,571 food labelling inspections identified 7,079 non-compliances. It should be noted that an inspection may check compliance with one or more labelling regulations. Many of these non-compliances would be for minor food labelling infringements and Environmental Health Officers follow-up on all of these non-compliances with the food business operators to ensure future compliance. In the other official agencies, food labels are checked at production level as part of routine food controls. The numbers of inspections specifically on food labels is not separately recorded.</P><Col N="472"/>
        <P Just="Left">DAFF Egg and Poultry Inspectors verify compliance with labelling and the marketing standards for eggs and poultry from primary production through to retail. In 2008 DAFF undertook 1,409 inspections in poultry producer establishments to verify compliance with these standards for poultry, of which 28 non-compliances were identified. In 2009 DAFF undertook 1,432 inspections in these establishments and identified 20 non-compliances.  In 2010 DAFF undertook 1,359 inspections in these establishments and identified 7 non-compliances. FSAI has also carried out, in co-ordination with the official agencies, labelling surveys on specific aspects of the nutrition and health claims legislation, allergen labelling, fish and fish products and gas-flushed chicken fillets.</P>
        <P>Following on from the inspections the official agencies undertake appropriate enforcement action with the food businesses. They also verify that compliance is achieved. As already indicated above in most cases breaches of labelling legislation do not pose a serious risk to public health and compliance with the legislation is done through the provision of advice to the food business and appropriate changes to the food label.</P>
        <P>In May 2009 a successful prosecution was taken by the FSAI against a food business in Galway for breaches including the Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products Regulations 2003. One 2009 HSE prosecution cited offences under the 2006 Country of Origin of Beef Regulations and a further prosecution cited the Beef Labelling Regulations 2000.  In 2010 four HSE prosecutions cited offences under labelling legislation including the general labelling, country of origin of beef, fish labelling and beef labelling regulations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 to 192, inclusive, 206, 207 and 211 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Minister for Health and Children has recently been made aware of a serious shortfall in the budget for this year. The HSE has advised that approximately &euro;100m from the Long Term Residential Care subhead is being spent on other services. I should point out that we understand these other services, which include therapies and medications, are being provided to people in nursing homes. However, in order to manage the budget and the scheme effectively, these should not be included in the long-term residential care subhead. The Minister is currently seeking to ensure that only agreed costs are met from the Long Term Residential Care subhead.</P>
        <P>The decision to suspend approvals under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme was made by the HSE on Friday, 13th May 2011 and a letter issued to each Regional Director of Operations for further distribution to all hospitals in their areas. A copy of this letter was sent to the Department of Health and Children on Tuesday, 17th May. The Minister for Health and Children was advised that day and a meeting with the HSE took place that evening.</P>
        <P>The meeting on the 17th May was the first meeting the Minister held with the HSE regarding the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The Department has met with the HSE on a regular and frequent basis since the scheme commenced. Officials from the Department met with HSE officials on the 10th May and subsequently on the 18th May to discuss the funding for the scheme, the cost components which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and the assumptions which underpinned the costings of the scheme in 2010.</P>
        <P>The Minister is seriously concerned that a funding problem should have arisen so early in the year. He is seeking to ensure that only agreed costs are met from the long-term residential care subhead. The main priority at this stage is to establish what steps might be taken to allow more people to benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, applications for financial support under the scheme will continue to be accepted and processed. However decisions to grant approval will be subject to the availability of funding.</P>
        <P>A full examination of the funding situation is underway, conducted jointly by the Department of Health and Children and the HSE. The commitment in the Programme for Government to review the Fair Deal will also proceed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
        <P>The number of people in approved private nursing homes who ceased to receive payment under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in the first quarter of 2011 was 1,283. Data for April is not available at present. Data in respect of public nursing homes is not available.</P>
        <P>Individuals who avail of &lsquo;Ancillary State Support&rsquo; (the Nursing Home Loan), choose to defer part of the payment of their contribution towards their cost of long stay residential care, (generally all or part of the 5% charged against assessable assets), until after their death. Where applicants avail of this loan, the HSE then secures a &lsquo;charging order&rsquo; on the property of such applicants.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Charging Orders&rdquo; refer to the charge that the applicant or their representative has consented to having placed on their property on the approval of the Ancillary State Support which the applicant has sought. The charging order is registered with the Property Registration Authority. To date, 1,238 applicants have had charging orders placed on their property. The purpose of the Charging Order is to secure the loan, similar to a bank issuing a mortgage and placing a charge on the relevant property. When a loan advanced by the HSE has been repaid to the Revenue Commissioners, the HSE is notified and the Charging Order is discharged by the HSE through the Property Registration Authority.</P>
        <P>Of the 1,238 charging orders put in place by the HSE, 176 applicants have since either passed away or sold their property and, if there are no grounds for further deferral, this deems the loan repayable under the legislation. Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for collection of due loan amounts, are notified accordingly for recoupment purposes. The total value amount of the 176 loans is &euro;1.3m.</P>
        <P>The amounts due from persons who died from January to March 2011 are not available. However, as accountable persons have up to 12 months following the date of death of the applicant to pay, these loans are not due for repayment yet.</P>
        <P>The total amount recouped to date is &euro;338,000. This &euro;338,000 value amount represents 57 of the 176 loans due for repayment and which to date has been repaid to Revenue. It is important to note that the level of money repaid to the Revenue Commissioners has no bearing on the level of funding available for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. These repayments go back to the Central Fund, not to the subhead for long-term residential care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196, 197, 205 and 227 together.</P>
        <P>There were 2,994 applications for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme received in the first quarter of 2011. Data for April is not available at present.</P>
        <P>The National Service Plan 2011 sets a target of four weeks for processing all complete applications for the scheme. To date, this target is being achieved.</P>
        <P>The number of people declined funding during March, April and May 2011 is not available given the time constraints on providing a response. However, of the applications received in 2010, only in the region of 140 were refused, cancelled, withdrawn or declined by the applicant. Where applications have been refused it is on the basis that either a) the applicant was deemed not to require long-term residential care or b) the applicant&rsquo;s contribution to care exceeded the cost of care.</P>
        <P>Based on activity to date in 2011, the HSE estimates that approximately 350 net additional persons per month may enter long-term residential care.</P>

        <P>There is no minimum or maximum level of funding available under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. Under the scheme, each person&rsquo;s contribution is calculated based on a national standardised financial assessment. Individuals contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and a maximum of 5% of the value of any assets per annum towards their cost of care, subject to the following important safeguards:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. Applicants will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple&rsquo;s income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. The first &euro;36,000 of the applicant&rsquo;s assets, or &euro;72,000 in the case of a couple, will not be counted at all in the financial assessment.</P>
        <P LI="1">5. Where a person&rsquo;s assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and can be collected from their estate.  This is an optional element of the scheme called the &ldquo;Ancillary State support&rdquo; or the Nursing Home Loan.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. A person&rsquo;s principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or &lsquo;three year&rsquo; cap.  It means that individuals will pay a 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.</P>
        <P LI="1">7. The &lsquo;three year&rsquo; cap also extends to farms and business in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P LI="1">8. If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.</P>

	<P>This Government is committed to the development of our mental health services in line with <i>A Vision for Change.</i>  In this regard the Government will reform our model of healthcare delivery so that more care is delivered in the community; access to modern mental health services in <Col N="479"/>the community will therefore be significantly improved.  It is proposed to ringfence &euro;35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services for both adults and children.</P>
        <P>There are currently 41 consultant psychiatrists with a special interest in psychiatry of later life.  At this time four areas await the provision of a specialist old age team &mdash; Roscommon, Kerry, Kildare and parts of Co. Cork.</P>
        <P>Executive Clinical Directors are working to reconfigure existing resources to create the full spectrum of Specialist Mental Health Teams.<i>  </i>Guided by the recommendations of <i>A Vision for Change</i> the priority is to ensure access to specialist mental health for older persons and to expand the team membership to include all recommended disciplines: Psychiatry, Psychology, Social Work, Occupational Therapy and Nursing.</P>
        <P>In relation to the mental health needs of individuals with a disability, the HSE continues to disaggregate mental health and learning disability services with specialist service providers creating more appropriate care programmes for individuals with learning disability.  For individuals with dual diagnosis who require acute psychiatric care the HSE has developed a strategy in collaboration with voluntary and independent providers and this work is continuing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 216 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in <Col N="480"/>protecting the oral health of all age groups.  In 2010 the HSE spent approximately &euro;4.78 million on fluoridation, of which approximately &euro;1.36 million was spent on hydrofluorosilicic acid, the chemical used for fluoridating water, &euro;2.28 million on operational costs and &euro;1.14 million on capital costs.  I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The issue of consent for the treatment of children is not governed by specific legislation.  What is required in a given situation falls to be determined on the basis of the facts of an individual case.  In medical emergencies, for example, urgent treatment may be provided to a child in the absence of express consents where it is necessary to save the life of the child.  The age of the child is also relevant with this issue being provided for in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for children over 16 years.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised by the HSE that the issue of consent has been the subject of specific consideration with a view to developing guidance on how the complexities of the matter may be addressed.

	<P>In March 2007, the Government published an Expert Group Report titled &ldquo;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo;.  This report examined a wide range of issues in relation to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by mobile phone base stations.  It answers many of the health risk questions raised by the public in relation to the potential effects of electromagnetic fields.  The Report and its recommendations were accepted by the Government and form the basis for current policy in this area.  It is available on the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s website (<i>www.environ.ie/en/publications</i>).</P>
        <P>The current advice to those living in close proximity to mobile phone base stations, based on the conclusions of the Expert Group Report, is that there is no scientific basis or evidence of adverse health effects in children or adults as a result of exposure to electromagnetic fields.</P><Col N="481"/>
        <P>The condition referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question is known as Electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS).  The conclusions of the Word Health Organisation (WHO) are that EHS is characterised by a variety of non-specific symptoms that differ from individual to individual.  EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to electromagnetic field exposures.  EHS is not a medical diagnosis nor is it clear that it represents a single medical problem.</P>
        <P>With regard to the individual case whose details have been included with this Parliamentary Question, I would advise that the person attends her GP and is offered a comprehensive medical review.  Although there is no specific treatment for EHS, treatment of this patient&rsquo;s individual symptoms should improve quality of life scores.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Expenditure on travel and subsistence has been substantially reducing year on year since 2007, with savings of nearly &euro;40 million between 2007 and 2010, approximately 40% of 2007 costs.  These reductions have been achieved through minimising non-client facing travel costs and applying nationally assigned reductions in travel and subsistence rates.</P>
        <P>Expenditure in 2010 on travel and subsistence was &euro;62.7 million and remains a focus in 2011 for continued efficiency wherever possible, whilst simultaneously attempting to minimise the impact on client facing services, which account for up to 95% of all travel and subsistence costs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
        <P>Credit cards are used to meet expenses incurred by or on behalf of that senior official in respect of the carrying out of his/her duties. Credit cards are used to settle vouched expenses incurred on official HSE business which, in the absence of a credit card arrangement, would otherwise be reclaimed by the HSE official by way of vouched expenses in accordance with public sector travel and subsistence regulations.  The credit card constitutes an efficient payment method for this type of expenditure.  Currently, nine senior Health Service Executive officials are approved credit card holders.</P>
        <P>In a small number of circumstances, for operational reasons, it is necessary to hold meetings with third parties at a venue convenient to them, which on occasion are in locations other than HSE sites.  Not all HSE facilities have on-site catering provision.</P><Col N="483"/>
        <P>In the interests of transparency around its financial control measures, the Executive publishes records of credit card usage within the organisation.</P>

	<P>As Minister for Health I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  The Government is committed to establishing a Special Delivery Unit (SDU) to improve access to the emergency and elective care system.  The SDU is a Government priority and is one of the commitments from the <i>Programme for Government 2011-2016</i> to be achieved within the first 100 days.  Extensive work is currently being undertaken in designing the Unit, which will be modelled, in part, on the successful special delivery unit in Northern Ireland which substantially reduced waiting lists over two to three years.</P>

	<P>The national vehicle fleet comprises over 2.4 million vehicles and the online motor tax service can currently be availed of by a very significant 85% of owners. Arrangements being made by my Department, which are now at an advanced stage, will enable commercial vehicles (some 327,000 units) to avail of the online motor tax service in instances where they are covered by a current roadworthiness certificate. This new service, which  will result in over 98% of vehicle owners being able to tax online, will be introduced in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The procedures which are associated with taxing the remaining 2% of the vehicle fleet are complex and do not easily lend themselves to online applications. However my Department will continue to examine and evaluate the possibility of assimilating these categories also into the online service.</P>

	<P>The primary purpose of the transfer of Dundalk Port Company to Dublin Port Company is to ensure an orderly management of the company&rsquo;s affairs.  The current recession has been difficult for the company.  Turnover and traffic are down considerably.</P>
        <P>Dundalk Port Company has a small number of full-time employees and these individuals will transfer to Dublin Port Company. Earlier this year Dundalk Port Company already made a number of employees redundant in order to reduce its costs. Decisions on whether further redundancies may be required will be a matter for Dublin Port Company and will depend on the level of trade at the port.</P>

        <Quest> if he will review the problems the EU Cabotage Directive is causing Irish haulage businesses, working in the UK in particular; if some agreement can be made between Ireland and the UK regarding the enforcement of the rule in both countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>Changes to the cabotage entitlements of all hauliers in the EU were introduced on 14 May 2010, as part of a package of measures adopted in December 2009.  Previously, cabotage was permitted on a &ldquo;temporary basis&rdquo;, but the meaning of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; was never legally defined, leading to different interpretations across Member States.  </P><Col N="486"/>
        <P>EU legislation now clarifies that every operator is entitled to carry out three cabotage operations in a foreign Member State, within a seven-day period after they finish an inward loaded journey.  This new rule applies to all hauliers in the EU.  My Department informed all Irish international haulage operators about the new rules, at the end of 2009 and again in April 2010.</P>
        <P>The change in cabotage does not affect in any way an Irish operator&rsquo;s entitlement to carry goods between Member States &mdash; international journeys of vehicles carrying goods remain fully liberalised, and represent the vast bulk of haulage work carried out abroad by Irish hauliers. </P>
        <P>Because the new cabotage rules affect Irish hauliers operating to the UK in particular my Department has been in contact already with their UK counterparts to establish a common understanding of how the rule change will affect hauliers working in both Ireland and the UK.</P>
        <P>The overall objective is to produce written guidelines for Irish hauliers so that they will know exactly what arrangements fall within the new rules and which do not when working in the UK in particular. This will enable operators to plan their operations for maximum economic efficiency. As soon as the guidelines are settled with the UK my Department will inform every licensed Irish haulier.</P>

	<P>The provision of any traffic calming measures is a matter for each local authority. Section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 empowers road authorities, in the interest of the safety and convenience of road users, to provide such traffic calming measures as they consider desirable in respect of public roads in their charge. These measures would include traffic signs, road markings, ramps, rumble strips and measures to prevent, restrict or control access to a public road or roads by mechanically propelled vehicles. In the case of national roads the consent of the National Roads Authority is required.</P>
