      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice under Standing Order 32.  I call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelHealyRae"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the IFA are rightly highlighting the wrong being done to the farmers of Ireland at present.  Let us compare what they get paid for their produce to the price the consumer pays for it over the counter.  The multinational food companies have a good deal to answer for.  Everyone knows that from farm to gate is the most expensive part of food production and from gate to plate is the most profitable part.  This is not right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, that was not included in your notice.  Will you stick to what is included in your notice?</P>

	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 3, Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and No. 8, statements on Progress on the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in respect of No. 8: the statements of a Minister or Minister or State and of the main spokespersons for Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case, the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, Members may share time, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 8, statements on progress on the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, agreed to?  Agreed.  Matters which are deemed to be in order on the Order of Business may be raised.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on a matter of promised legislation.  Yesterday evening, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, promised legislation on employment orders that will have a serious and detrimental effect on employers&rsquo; rights.  Has the Minister consulted the Labour Party on this matter?  I note that he has gone beyond the terms of the recently published report and that he proposed to bring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You know that as well as I do.  I do not wish to have to deal with you again today, Deputy.  Stick to what is in order on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>Matters that can be raised on the Order of Business include: the taking of business that has been promised, including legislation promised either within or outside the D&aacute;il; the making of secondary legislation; arrangements for sittings; and when Bills or other documents on the Order Paper needed in the House will be circulated.  This is what we can deal with on the Order of Business.  We have Private Notice Questions, the Adjournment debate and other ways of dealing with these issues as well.  I will co-operate fully to try to make certain that Deputies in the House have an opportunity to raise matters that are serious and need attention but please stick to the Order of Business.  I take no pleasure in interrupting.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister facilitate a debate next week on the report of the independent review of employment regulation orders, registered employment agreements and wage setting mechanisms since the Minister has stated in the press that his proposals will be completed by 10 June?  This is a matter of great urgency.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated in the House yesterday that fair deal applications were being processed but they are being refused by the HSE.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not in order under the Order of Business.  The first question was whether we will have a debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I will come to you in one minute.  Will you resume your seat?  Thank you.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for his deep concern about my ability to answer questions.  I strongly welcome his support and I look forward to his participation in the debate on the legislation to facilitate that next Tuesday.</P>
        <P>The Government has authorised the publication of the Duffy Walsh report.  The Minister with responsibility has his own proposals.  There are no predetermined outcomes for the discussions that will be undertaken in the coming weeks with the social partners.  The matter will come back to Government for a decision.  There are no predetermined decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The issues around joint labour committees, JLCs, and employment regulation orders are contained in words in the programme for Government and the EU-IMF programme.  Is it the intention of the Government to bring forward legislation in the House as was announced?  Let us be clear about it.  There is now a public controversy that goes deep into the hearts and households of thousands of families.  Based on what the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated yesterday there is a real fear that he is about to cut the incomes of the lowest paid, including hundreds of thousands of people who depend on these types of unsociable hours and the Sunday hourly rate, arrangements which have been in place and which are legally binding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to expand on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the intention of the Government to bring forward legislation that will dissect legally binding employment legislation orders?  When will that legislation be presented before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AodhanORiordan"><NameTxt>Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not holding a debate.  The question is whether we will have a debate or legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doherty previously raised concerns for workers in respect of the minimum wage which proved to be unfounded.  To allay his fears again, let me be clear: there is a commitment in the programme for Government to review the JLC structure.  A comprehensive report, which was authorised by the previous Government, was conducted by Mr. Duffy and Dr. Walsh and has been published by the Government.  It will form the basis for the discussions that will take place between the Department and the social partners and the Minister will have his own views.  Whatever emerges from this will revert to the Government and at that stage, it will be appropriate to have a full debate in this House on what is proposed, rather than to have speculative debate on what might or might not be involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Labour Party have a view?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="490"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>On the scheduling of business, does the Minister not believe it should be appropriate for Members to debate the findings of this report?  It finds clearly, as Sinn F&eacute;in has advocated, that the cutting of joint labour committee, JLC, rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;would not lead to increased employment.  This is a vindication of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position.  Does the Government agree with this finding within the report?  Will the Minister facilitate a full debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot debate it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;prior to any Government decision on cutting the wages of hundreds of thousands of workers in the economy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for the Minister to reply to that.  I call Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to hear from Deputy Broughan on this.  He has been keeping very quiet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AodhanORiordan"><NameTxt>Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the same issue, will the consultations with the social partners regarding the JLCs be on the basis of the recently published report or on the basis of the statement by the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry Deputy, that is not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AodhanORiordan"><NameTxt>Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in</NameTxt>

	<P>Let us hear from Deputy Stagg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it is envisaged the Minister&rsquo;s Department is to engage in discussions with the Department of Finance with regard to any supplementary budgetary initiative that would be required in light of the proposals emerging from the office of the Minister, Deputy Bruton regarding the JLCs and registered employment agreements, REAs?  I refer to the implication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need to expand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;for the significant burden on family income supplements, were the Minister&rsquo;s proposals with regard to a cut of premium pay to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, the Deputy is out of order.</P>

	<P>They are being hard on the Minister today.  Was there a party meeting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the Deputy and others who are genuinely concerned about an important issue, the Government has authorised the publication of a highly detailed report and the first thing all Members should do is to read a nuanced and balanced report.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Did Deputy Dooley hear that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be the basis on which discussions will take place with the social partners.  I have no doubt that the trade union and employer sides will have strong views on this matter that may go beyond the scope of the report.  The Minister will have his own views and all this eventually will revert in the short term to the Government and there will be a whole of Government decision, which, if it requires legislation, will be brought back to this House for full debate at that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision is taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>

	<P>The decision is down to the whole of Government.</P>

	<P>Did Deputy Keaveney ask whether a Supplementary Estimate will be needed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, whether it would be required.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government plan to publish or initiate legislation that would result in revisiting the Freedom of Information Act to widen public access to information?  This would be a direct follow-on from the manner in which the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, filleted the Freedom of Information Act introduced by the last rainbow Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will beg to leave it for another couple of months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The programme for Government includes a proposal to restore the scope and depth of the Freedom of Information Act and it will be brought before the House as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the fourth report of the child rapporteur, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, I refer to the first report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, in which Deputy Howlin was a participating member, which was published in September 2008 and which included a proposal to give legal authority for the collection and the exchange of information concerning the risk or occurrence of endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of children.  What is the present position regarding the national vetting bureau Bill, about which it has been indicated repeatedly that a date of publication is not possible to indicate?  The most recent statement from the Government has been that the heads of the Bill have not yet been approved.  Will the Minister advise the House, in the context of all the valid criticisms Mr. Shannon has presented to politicians and Members of this House, whether certainty can be provided that this Bill will be fast-tracked?  Moreover, will he advise at the earliest opportunity when Members will see the final verification of the establishment of the Department of children under the aegis of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="492"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Deputy in welcoming the report of the special rapporteur on children, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.  The Deputy and I had much interaction with Mr. Shannon and he certainly is an authority on this issue.  Unfortunately, this report yet again makes for stark reading and demonstrates the depth of the problems that still face the child protection area.  It was for this reason the present Government established a Minister for children at Cabinet rank.  The Bill to which the Deputy refers has been advanced to heads of Bill stage and will be treated as a priority by the Minister for children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should indicate a date for the formal establishment of the Department.  When will this be verified before the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>All the legislative procedures have been followed through and the Government order to formally establish it will take effect on 3 June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the joint labour committees and registered employment agreements, if I understood him correctly, the Minister indicated there would be a period of consultation and debate and then legislation arising therefrom.  However, if this is the case, does he not consider it to be an outrageous pre-emption of the consultative process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, the Deputy is out of order.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>On the subject of future legislation, I wish to follow up on a question asked on the Order of Business yesterday by Deputy Martin regarding whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation.  The Taoiseach replied that such legislation was forthcoming because it is included in the programme for Government.  However, he then stated that a referendum would be necessary in this regard.  I am puzzled as to the reason a referendum is necessary because, as the Minister will be aware, several Bills on whistleblowers have been introduced into this House, including one by his colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, without any need for a referendum.  I am alarmed that it is necessary and will delay the procedure.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="493"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As it distresses me to see the Deputy alarmed, I will try to calm him.  There are two different sets of proposals.  Whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation does not require any constitutional amendment and is being advanced.  As for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reference to a referendum, it refers to a different proposal that sometimes is referred to as the undoing of the Howlin judgment, if I may be so bold as to refer to it.  That was to allow citizens to impart information to Members of the Oireachtas without having themselves disclosed.  It arose from legal proceedings subsequent to the Morris tribunal and the programme for Government includes an undertaking to seek to restore the rights of citizens to impart in a <i>bona fide</i> fashion information to Members of the Oireachtas without putting themselves in hazard.  This legislation also will be advanced.</P>

	<P>The referendum will delay it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They are two entirely separate proposals and the referendum will not impede the progress or the early enactment of the whistleblowers&rsquo; legislation.</P>

	<P>Yesterday, I asked a question on legislation promised in respect of a proposed household utility charge but the answer I was given related to proposed water charges.  Can the Minister enlighten Members on the timeline for legislation in respect of the proposed household utility charge?  When will it be published and to what will it relate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government answered that question yesterday.  There is a commitment in the EU-IMF programme of support and in the programme for Government in respect of water charges.  As for any other matter, no decision of Government has been made and the Deputy can be informed as soon as such a decision is made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>No debate is required as this is a matter for the IMF.

	<P>As regards debate in the House, the Minister indicated that the Government intends consulting with the social partners and others regarding the JLC structure.  Is it the intention to have a debate before the relevant Minister completes his proposals on this report which, as Deputy Howlin said, is of major national importance?  Will that debate take place next week as I asked because if it does not take place, the Minister has indicated the date of 10 June as his decision day in this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it would be preferable to have a set of proposals before the House which it can deal with in detail rather than having an abstract debate about what might be.  I know some Members would prefer that but if the Deputy and his party wish to have a debate I am sure that is a matter his party&rsquo;s Whip can raise.</P>

	<P>It is amazing that the Government does not have to make proposals for the social partners to have a discussion with them but as regards this House, which he said would be brought back into the centre of public life, the Minister is saying that we have to wait for the proposals.

	<P>I refer to residual commitments that were to have been included in last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill regarding the enactment of the civil partnership legislation and its implications for finance.  It was debated whether those provisions should be included in the Finance (No. 2) Bill.  It was determined by the Government that the Finance (No. 2) Bill should deal exclusively with the jobs initiative proposals and those residual matters will be dealt with in a finance (No. 3) Bill.  I do not have a date for it but it is a priority for the Government.</P>

    <Title>Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Joe Costello sharing time with Deputy Tuffy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Tuffy was in possession.</P>
        <P>This Bill gives legal effect to the measures in the jobs initiative, namely, the reduction in PRSI, the restoration of the minimum wage, the abolition of the airport travel tax, the reduction in the VAT rate for certain goods and services, particularly those associated with the tourism industry, and the proposed pension levy.</P>
        <P>A significant amount of spin and misinformation about this levy is being created by a number of vested interests.  It was refreshing to hear Colm Rapple on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio show yesterday morning debunking much of the misinformation and rightly pointing out that the pension and insurance industry is engaging in scare tactics to frighten pensioners and workers paying into pension funds.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative is a significant step towards getting the country back to work.  It is not a cure-all and does not pretend to be such but it is evidence of the Government&rsquo;s serious commitment to tackling the horrendous problems the country is facing in a fair and balanced way.</P>
        <P>The unemployment statistics are horrendous.  The extent of the problem of unemployment cannot be overstated.  Nationally, unemployment rose a colossal 300%, from 4.5% at the end of 2007, to 14.6% at the end of April 2011, while the EU average is 9%.  The number signing <Col N="496"/>on the live register nationally is at an unprecedented 442,627 people.  Dublin accounts for almost quarter of those.  My constituency of Dublin Central is particularly hard hit.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the country has been haemorrhaging jobs.  In the four months to the end of April 2011 we have already lost 17,218 jobs.  In 2010 there were 58,932 redundancies.  In 2009 redundancy statistics reached an astonishing 77,000, with 31,000 of these in Dublin.  This was an increase of 90% on the 2008 figures and represented a massive 202% increase on the 2007 figures.</P>
      
        <P>We are constrained by the terms of EU-IMF bailout deal in terms of what we can do but that is not an excuse for standing idly by, and this Government certainly does not intend to do so.</P>
        <P>We must remember that behind each of these statistics is a tragic human story &mdash; the family in danger of losing their home, the struggle for survival, the exodus of the brightest and best of our workers and young people leaving the country in search of a new future and the broken-hearted families left at home to struggle on. Each week, my clinics are filled with people who struggle to survive, save their homes, save their families and maintain their dignity.</P>
        <P>The main focus of the recent election was jobs and getting the people back to work.  We could not and did not promise a quick fix, but a fair and balanced approach to job creation.  The Labour Party is determined that investment in job creation will not be at the expense of the low-paid workers.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I believe that the measures proposed in the jobs initiative and the provisions of this Bill are fair and balanced.  The reversal of the savage and unnecessary cut in the minimum wage is to be welcomed.  This has been achieved.  The halving of the lower rate of PRSI on jobs that pay up to &euro;356 per week will further stimulate new job creation.  The tourism industry which has lost a third of its 2007 levels over the past three years is especially targeted with a huge VAT reduction from 13.5% to 9% across the entire industry.  At the same time the regressive air travel tax on passengers has been abolished.  The onus is now on the airlines to deliver the tourists they claim failed to travel on account of this tax.  That issue will be looked at very carefully.</P>
        <P>These actions will provide a much needed stimulus to the tourism and services sectors which already received a major stimulus from the recent successful visits of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative contains many innovative proposals for job creation and stimulating growth.  The EU-IMF bailout deal requires that the jobs initiative proposals be budget neutral.  Nevertheless these proposals have a significant cost and we need to find as fair a way as possible to pay for them.  This leads to the pension levy.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 provides for an annual stamp duty of 0.6% on the market value of assets under management and pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners under Irish tax law.  The new temporary pension levy of 0.6% over a four year period will provide &euro;470 million a year which is to be ringfenced for job creation.</P>
        <P>It is important to have a sense of perspective on the pension levy.  The pension levy at 0.6% represents only 60 cent in every &euro;100.  It is limited in time to four years and it is targeted at those who can best afford to pay.  The pension levy is aimed at the vast sums of wealth which have accumulated in private pension funds, funds which have been generated with 100% tax relief from the taxpayers of this country every year over the working life of those who have accumulated those funds and who are still doing so.  Moreover, as the economist Colm Rapple <Col N="497"/>pointed out on RT&Eacute; yesterday, 80% of the money in pension schemes is owned by the highest earners.  Perhaps some people sitting to my left might remember that.</P>
        <P>Pension tax relief is the most generous tax relief granted by the State to any sector of the tax-paying population.  Proposals contained in last year&rsquo;s budget to reduce tax relief on pension funds were inexplicably withdrawn by the Minister for Finance at the last moment when he introduced the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>It is also worth noting that this levy does not apply to the 50% of lowest paid workers, who cannot afford to pay into a private pension fund, or to public sector workers who have already been hard hit by the public service pension levy of approximately 4%.  These workers have contributed their taxes to help fund the tax reliefs which in turn funded these private pensions.</P>
        <P>The 0.6% annual levy is taken in two 0.3% tranches and will cease after a maximum of four years.  It is less than half the amount of the annual cost of administration and management charges levied by the pension managers.  That puts it into perspective.  These are the same pension managers who often mismanaged the same funds with consequent reduction in their value.</P>
        <P>There is scope in the provisions of the legislation for the levy to be built into administration and management costs.  I believe that it would be an act of responsibility and generosity for those same managers to deduct the 0.6% from their management fees, salaries and administration costs for the next four years or to take a reduction over a more extended period.  This Bill is about the economic renewal and regeneration of the country.  It is a start to the difficult job of rebuilding our society.</P>
        <P>I am amazed at the reaction of Members of the Opposition to the pension levy.  Maybe it is not so surprising that Fianna F&aacute;il continues to defend and protect the wealthy bankers and financiers who caused outrage in recent months by siphoning off income into pension funds to avoid paying tax.  It is surprising that Sinn F&eacute;in and other Members of the Opposition, who claim to represent the ordinary worker, most of whom cannot afford to pay into a private pensions, have reacted in a similar vein especially when the levy is targeted exclusively at creating employment for the unemployed.</P>
        <P>We should be in no doubt that it is vested interests and those with large pension pots who are stirring up a storm and engaging in scare tactics in relation to this pension levy.  It is disappointing to see some Members of this House championing their cause.</P>
        <P>This Bill is about recovery, job creation and economic renewal.  The principles underlying it are sound.  If Members on the Opposition benches have difficulty with some provisions of the Bill, they should table amendments not oppose its substance.</P>
        <P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011 deserves the support of all Members of this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of speaking to this very important debate on the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2011.  This Bill comes at the height of our economic crisis and at a time of high unemployment.  That is why we need fresh thinking on the economy and particularly on the jobs crisis.</P>
        <P>Before dealing with the Bill in detail, I should say I am concerned at the Government&rsquo;s policy of making deep cuts to public expenditure.  I hope Deputy Costello is listening because this will hit the poorest the hardest in this recession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is totally untrue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to the urgent need to reduce the interest rate charged on Ireland&rsquo;s EU-IMF loan, which I believe, will leave them in breach of their <Col N="498"/>international legal obligations.  This economic crisis has brought havoc and misery to the country with grave implications for the Irish people.  That is the reality on the ground.  Unemployment is rising and increasing numbers are living in poverty and social exclusion.  This is the reality that has to be dealt with in this debate.</P>
        <P>The Government is seeking to reduce the budget deficit by imposing deep cuts in public spending and this is having a huge impact on the most vulnerable in our society.  Reducing public expenditure will affect the poorest in society.  The Labour Party should hang its head in shame particularly given its false promises during the General Election campaign.  It knows the situation and the truth, yet it misleads the people every day in debates such as that which is taking place today.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill mentions the universal social charge which I would describe as a regressive tax.  I ask the Government to review it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It will.  It is in the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Workers and the unemployed did not cause this economic crisis and they should not be penalised.  Also pensioners and children with a disability should not be penalised for the greedy actions of senior bankers, bad Government decisions, bad regulation and other greedy interests in Irish society.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends the Value Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 to provide for a second reduced VAT rate of 9% in respect of certain goods and services for the period 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2013.  Let us be vigilant in this regard.  I suggest we follow the French on this matter.  I appreciate Mr. Sarkozy and Ms Lagarde may not be popular with many in Ireland at present but, in fairness to the French, when it reduced its VAT on hotels and restaurants and other tourist services three years ago, businesses erected signs showing the tax cut for consumers.  It was open and transparent and great for customers and businesses.  We should consider this approach in the light of the current debate on the cost base of employment.  Let us hope all the businesses affected by the reduction in VAT follow the French example.  Rather than getting carried out away with other issues, perhaps we should be more transparent and democratic and adopt the French approach.</P>
        <P>I welcome the positive aspects of the Bill which have the potential to lead to job creation.  They will have my support, even if only a couple of hundred new jobs are delivered.  Forgive me, however, if I am missing something in the debate on job creation.  How can the Government, especially the Labour Party, justify cutting 250 language support teachers for children with special needs?  These are real people in real jobs providing real services and cutting them amounts to educational vandalism.  Shame on the Labour Party for supporting cuts in services to the most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>On the levy on pension funds provided for in section 4, I will use my vote to prevent any attempt by pension fund administrators to pass on to their customers the 0.6% job creation fund tax levy proposed by the Government.  I support the position taken by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, which has, on behalf of its members, raised this issue with pension fund administrators and providers of additional voluntary contribution, AVC, schemes.  The levy will be imposed on the trustees or administrators &mdash; in the majority of cases, this is the insurer or life company &mdash; rather than directly on the member&rsquo;s fund.  Based on a previous levy proposed in 1998, the industry is assuming it will be given an option to pass on the levy and has run a slick campaign suggesting it will not have any other choice.  The Government must prevent it from taking this option.  Since the announcement of the Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative, the pensions industry, through highly articulate spokespersons, has managed to con<Col N="499"/>vey the impression that this payment towards the nation&rsquo;s recovery must be extracted from the contributors to pension funds.  The levy should be imposed on the profits of the pensions industry or, more appropriately, its wholly unnecessary marketing and hospitality funds.  The Government repeatedly argues that Technical Group and Independent Deputies do not make constructive suggestions.  I have made one such constructive proposal which I urge the Government to adopt.</P>
        <P>The impression is being given that every private sector worker will have to pay the levy.  Up to 70% of private sector workers are not covered by occupational pension schemes.  Further, the industry has in recent decades persuaded many workers to pay into a defined contribution scheme rather than a defined benefit scheme by suggesting the former provides richer returns.  Pension companies then played the markets in a manner unbecoming of an industry charged with the responsibility of providing security for its customers.  So bad has been the management of pension companies that many defined benefit schemes have required massive injections of additional funds to meet their commitments, despite the companies administering them enjoying years of high profits.  I call on the Minister to ensure the pensions industry is not given the option of passing on the levy to consumers.  I strongly support the INMO, the members of which have endured the imposition of the pension levy, pay cuts and increased taxes.  They and other workers need evidence that pension companies are prepared to contribute to national economic recovery.</P>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the abolition of the air travel tax.  I support this measure as a means of attracting tourists.  While I do not know if it will deliver on this objective, it is an essential step if we are to reap the potential financial benefits of having more tourists visit the country.  We must develop our national assets, particularly our beautiful countryside, language, culture and scenery.</P>
        <P>Section 3 amends the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The plight of small businesses appears to have fallen off the political agenda.  We must support such businesses.  I support local small business associations in Raheny and Drumcondra and regularly raise issues on their behalf in the House.  Where possible, we should shop local and buy Irish and not be afraid or ashamed to call on people to do so in the current economic circumstances.  As I noted, independent assessments have shown that if everyone spent an additional &euro;20 per week in his or her local shop, factory, chip shop or pub, 20,000 new jobs would be created.  I welcome the important provision to reduce to 9% the VAT rate paid by restaurants.</P>
        <P>We should not be afraid to target pension fund managers and those who have made money and exploited workers.  In this connection, the Government gave a commitment to consider a number of useful proposals on the pension levy made by Deputy Shane Ross last week.  When will it respond to the sensible proposals made by Technical Group Deputies?</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 5 deals with the management of taxes and duties, the people&rsquo;s money.  Those who mismanaged public moneys in recent years should hang their heads in shame.  Public funds must be treated with respect and spent in a sensible manner.  I remind the House that a lack of regulation and accountability caused the current crisis.  For this reason, many people are sick and tired of comments made by Ministers about sections of the public service.  I remind the Government that public servants were at the forefront of recent high profile visits to the State.  I strongly disagree with the comment by the Minister without Portfolio, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that the public service is not fit for purpose.  How dare a Minister make such a statement about public servants?  It is an unacceptable remark, especially when one considers the work done by nurses, teachers, garda&iacute; and social workers.  Public servants are fit for purpose and embracing and delivering change and reform.  They are not talking but taking action.  I am appalled that the Minister was able to make such a comment without being challenged on the <Col N="500"/>matter.  We are all in favour of an efficient, high quality public service, but how dare anyone claim it is not fit for purpose.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by the latest OECD report on economic growth which suggests the economy will stagnate this year, although I am aware the Government disagrees with the OECD&rsquo;s view.  Many back bench Labour Party Deputies are sympathetic to my view that one cannot cut one&rsquo;s way out of a recession.  What does one expect when one adopts the slash and burn policies of the previous Government?  I note also from newspaper reports this morning that further pay cuts are imminent.  The Government must take a more balanced and measured approach.  If one continually cuts, at some point one will destroy the economy.  While I accept that the public finances must be managed, the issue of job creation must also be on the pitch.  Trade unions and employers must come together and work in the national interest.</P>
        <P>The current climate has given rise to considerable hostility towards trade unions.  I acknowledge that with so many out of work, people are cheesed off and experiencing problems, but certain individuals are showing excessive hostility towards the trade unions.  What really gets up my nose is that some of these people were part of the problem in causing the economic crisis, yet they are the very ones who start bashing trade unions.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and largely welcome its contents.  Last March, when I was Opposition spokesperson on tourism, I tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion which proposed nine solutions to our tourism problems.  I am delighted to see that, as part of the jobs initiative and this Bill, five of those solutions are being delivered by the Government.  This is despite the fact that the previous Government seemed to think that none of the solutions was even possible or desirable.  The Government&rsquo;s good sense in targeting the tourism industry as an area of potential economic growth has been borne out by this morning&rsquo;s news from the OECD that, while our economy is static, other economies are growing.  When economies begin to grow again so does discretionary spending, including on holidays, which is precisely the target audience we are looking for as part of the measures in this Bill.  The tourism sector employs large numbers of workers and in recent years has attracted large-scale public and private investment.  We may have gone overboard somewhat <Col N="501"/>in building hotels, but many other investments were made in tourism attractions and activities.  The legislation is therefore capitalising on investments made in the recent past.</P>
        <P>We have all the ingredients for tourism, including beautiful landscapes, but there is no doubt that we lost competitiveness.  In addition, we were hit worst by the world recession.  We are beginning to recover competitiveness the hard way, but the intention of these legislative measures is to copperfasten that recovery.  For instance, one of the really good measures provided for in the Bill is the 2% reduction in PRSI costs for employers of low-paid workers.  There are many such workers in the hospitality and other sectors.  The domestic economy is depressed, particularly in retail areas such as hairdressing and hospitality.  Those domestic sectors really need a boost, so the Bill&rsquo;s proposed measures should help.</P>
        <P>A lot has been said this morning, both on radio and here in the House, about employment regulation orders and joint labour committee agreements.  The reality, however, is that they are completely out of date, redundant and damaging employment.  They were part of the problem and largely part of the reason we became so uncompetitive.  They preceded labour protection and minimum wage legislation, but for some reason they outlived it and caused enormous trouble to the economy over the years.  Those who say those agreements do not need to be reformed &mdash; we have heard it again here today &mdash; deny the reality of what has happened.  Tens of thousands of workers in the hospitality sector have lost their jobs and, in addition, restaurants are closing hand over fist.  It may not be obvious to us in this little bubble of the Grafton Street and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green area, but outside the city restaurants are closing daily.</P>
        <P>It is almost impossible to get a meal on Sundays outside Irish cities because hotels and restaurants cannot afford to provide meals due to the higher Sunday wages that had to be paid.  It is not the lowest paid workers who are being affected by this situation.  For instance, people were being paid &euro;20 an hour to wash dishes on Sundays, which is over double the minimum wage.  I congratulate the Government for taking on this issue because it is a sensitive one.  Nonetheless, it is ultimately for the good of the economy.  Low-paid workers and the unemployed would prefer to have real wages than to have virtual entitlements to wages if only they had a job.  Jobs are crucial for the economy.</P>
        <P>The real benefit in this legislative package will come from the air travel tax changes.  Obtusely, the previous Government refused to accept that this was having a major impact on tourism.  It was not that potential tourists decided the &euro;10 tax was going to make any difference to the cost of their holidays, it was the airlines which took the impact, which amounted to hundreds of thousands of euro.  Therefore they simply moved their aeroplanes to foreign airports and provided air services to and from other cities, none of which was in Ireland.  Tourism Ireland found itself paying huge sums to try to incentivise people to travel to Ireland from destinations that had no direct access here.  We are a small island nation so easy access is vital via direct flights.  People do not come here for three months or a year, as they do to Australia; they come here for a few days, so direct flights are essential.  That is why the air travel tax had a really negative impact on tourism.  It is now up to the airlines concerned to bring aircraft back here, thus increasing the number of routes they operate out of this country.  The single most important aspect for tourism is that people can get here easily.</P>
        <P>The proposed reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% will also help the tourism industry.  Admittedly, it is just for two and a half years but this measure will kick-start the sector by helping restaurants, caterers, hotels and cinemas.  These are all facilities that add to holidays taken here both by domestic and foreign visitors.  This is all about relative costs.  People did not stop coming here because our economy had crashed or because of the weather.  They stopped coming because we were uncompetitive and these legislative measures recognise that.  We must now capitalise on the publicity received in recent weeks with the visit of Her Majesty, <Col N="502"/>Queen Elizabeth II, and US President Barak Obama.  In addition, money is being spent abroad by Tourism Ireland to promote Ireland as a good value destination.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the visa measure in the Bill.  This is something the previous Government could not possibly deal with and instead blamed the Department of Justice and Law Reform for it.  It is amazing, however, that the new Minister for Justice and Equality has been able, almost overnight, to change the mind of his Department on this matter.  I am not sure how it will work, but I understand there will be mutual recognition of British visas held by people coming from emerging economies such as China and India, which are the current growth areas.  The new measures will give us an opportunity to capitalise on the huge growth in tourism to Europe from those emerging economies as part of the London Olympics next year and the Special Olympics.</P>
        <P>In addition, the new measures will mean that adding a few extra days to a visit here will not involve the complexity of visiting Beijing to collect a visa personally, which up to now was one of the requirements and thus a major disincentive to anyone obtaining a visa to visit Ireland, not to mention the fact that it cost approximately &euro;100.  That measure is very welcome therefore.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the downside of this financial package, that is, the pension levy which nobody welcomes.  It would not be true to say that it would be of little consequence to lose 2.4% of the precious and hard-earned fund one has put by for one&rsquo;s retirement and old age.  Saying that such pensions attracted large tax benefits is also irrelevant, since that was the context in which people made their investments.  Had the benefit not existed, they might have made other arrangements.  We cannot pretend a pension levy is good news, but we hope it will be seen to be justified in the long term by benefiting pensions.  The money accruing from the levy will go entirely into job creation.  I hope this will provide pension funds, which have taken a considerable hit in recent years, and the economy an opportunity to recover.  I also hope it will enable people to provide for their future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, the first of its kind I have encountered since being elected to the House a couple of months ago.  I support the Bill because I agree with its main objective of creating much needed jobs in our faltering economy.  I listened with interest to the Opposition speakers, in particular the far left socialists &mdash; People Before Profit, Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Higgins of the Socialist Party.  The far left socialists in the House have learned nothing from history.  Socialism was tried and tested and failed miserably 20 years ago, when the USSR threw in the socialist towel and knocked down the wall it had built in an effort to stop its citizens from evacuating a failed system.  Socialism failed because it stifled initiative and creativity and denied people the right to earn a living according to their skills and talents.  We live in a modern republic, the hallmarks of which are, as largely defined by the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, liberty and equality. Equality emphasises that each person is entitled to reap the rewards of his or her skills and talents.  Our socialists would drive everyone down to the lowest common denominator.  The enterprising people in a society who use their initiative, creativity and hard work to develop products and services and, therefore, create jobs for their neighbours would be smothered by our socialists.  Their capital would be smothered and the far left socialists would burn bondholders and send the European Central Bank, ECB, packing from these shores.  They would impoverish the people, stifle the private sector and force the poor to eat grass.</P>
        <P>Opposition Members claim the jobs initiative does not go far enough.  They conveniently forget that this is just the beginning of the Government&rsquo;s jobs strategy and that we are working in a fiscal straitjacket.  Later this year, the Government will roll out the NewERA investment, which will give an additional stimulus to our economy.  I am happy with the Minister, Deputy <Col N="503"/>Noonan&rsquo;s analysis of the economy.  He has clearly identified our strengths and weaknesses and the Government has a clear vision of how to exploit our job creating potential.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 1 sets out to improve and enhance the research and development tax credit to be used by companies to offset operating costs.  This change will make the scheme more attractive and, therefore, will lead to increased research and development activity.</P>
        <P>Section 2 will set aside the air travel tax subject to agreement being reached with the airlines that they will bring additional passenger numbers into the country.  I welcome this initiative because it will increase tourism earnings in all parts of the country.  Section 3 will introduce a new 9% rate of VAT on tourism-related goods and services until 31 December 2013.  This will complement the change in section 2 and, if we include the effects of the new marketing budget, we can expect a substantial increase in tourism activity, leading to the creation of jobs in this labour-intensive sector.</P>
        <P>Section 4, which provides the funding for these new measures, has been accompanied by a great deal of scaremongering.  The Opposition is trying to convince people that their bank account savings will be raided.  This is nonsense and the Minister, on behalf of the Government, has firmly scotched the suggestions.  The pension fund managers have agreed that a small increase in stamp duty is preferable to a reduction in tax relief.  Why then have they done an about turn and added to the scaremongering?  Is it possible to do a clinical review of the amount of profit being skimmed off by the pension fund managers?  It should be done.  Some noises from the industry suggest that the stamp duty of 0.6% could be absorbed by the management without affecting individual savings.  We must have this matter clarified, as many people are worried that their pension savings will be adversely affected.</P>
        <P>The new Government has brought a measure of hope and stability to the country.  The jobs initiative is a further indication that everything possible will be done to get Ireland working again.  The initiative is just the beginning.  The NewERA policies will be rolled out later.  The banking system has been restored and is now fit to support our economic activity.  Negotiations will continue with our EU partners, the IMF and the ECB.  Our Government will pursue a programme of radical reform of the labour market to make it more responsive to changing market conditions.</P>
        <P>The private sector is the engine of the economy and pays the bills.  We must do everything possible to prime it.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is right to single out tourism for a quick response in respect of job creation.  I welcome the reduction in VAT, the abolition of the air travel tax, the setting up of a marketing fund for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the reform of the visa application system for entry into Ireland.  I welcome the increase in road funding for this year and the additional investment in the fabric of our schools.  These imaginative and practical initiatives will breathe new life into our tourism provision.  They will be welcomed by the people of the Cooley Peninsula and the beautiful seaside town of Carlingford as well as by the other seaside resorts in my constituency.  Our hotels, restaurants, bars and every other business that supports tourism will get a major boost, inevitably leading to the employment of additional staff.  We can expect a spin-off effect right across the economy.</P>
        <P>I want the Minister to do his utmost to carry out a clinical review of the amount of profit being skimmed off by the pension fund managers.  The 0.6% stamp duty can be absorbed at the pension fund management level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichelleMulherin"><NameTxt>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the jobs initiative, particularly the way in which it sets about tackling competitiveness and the cost base.  As has been stated, these have gone against our ability to create jobs and attract tourists and so on.</P><Col N="504"/>
        <P>I wish to address another jobs issue of which we are all aware, namely, that of subcontractors.  People have done jobs but cannot get paid by main contractors.  I am particularly concerned about State contracts, in that construction companies owed money by the State are using it as a reason not to pay subcontractors.  A well known main contractor in my town has won a number of the State&rsquo;s capital projects and was paid some money yesterday.  When the subcontractors that carried out the work on a project looked for their money, they were told that the main contractor needed to get the rest of the money first.  This is a disgrace.  The prospect of main contractors going to the wall is increasing.  Since they are protected by the corporate veil, their directors&rsquo; personal assets are not affected.  Subcontractors are usually the main employers whereas main contractors are typically project managers.  The latter have incurred bills in a race to the bottom to get projects at any price.  The problem is that the accepted tenders are not realistic.  Therefore, the real price is the difference between the tender amount and what the subcontractors must pay.</P>
        <P>Subcontractors are paying the price for the schools, hospitals, theatres and public infrastructure that we all enjoy as citizens.  They cannot get social welfare payments or turn to anyone.  We can have fine discussions in the Chamber on mental and emotional health and the number of people turning to suicide.  It is a reality that people are under such pressure, yet main contractors will not cough up the taxpayers&rsquo; money we have paid them for State projects.</P>
        <P>I have a proposition for the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  The Construction Contracts Bill 2010 will not solve the problems facing many of the country&rsquo;s subcontractors.  Contagion has set in and people are frantic and desperate.  In the many cases where subcontractors have signed off a final account with the main contractor, where costs are agreed between the two parties and where the State still owes money to the main contractor, I urge that an arrangement be introduced whereby the State can make arrangements with the latter to pay subcontractors directly.  That would ease some of the difficulties in which subcontractors are finding themselves.  It is not good enough &mdash; and I have been on to various Departments about this &mdash; simply to quote the law to these people, because the law is inadequate and there have been abuses left, right and centre.  We have had abuses of the corporate veil where individuals trading under that protection have undertaken reckless commercial behaviour.</P>
        <P>Let us stand up and be counted.  We must find ways and mechanisms to protect subcontractors.  The Construction Contracts Bill will not do it, but we have money in our hands.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to instruct all Departments, where there is a final bill of costs agreed, to seek an arrangement to pay subcontractors directly.  This would go some way towards meeting our moral duty to help these people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome any initiative to provide much needed employment.  However, there are several issues I wish to raise in regard to this Bill.  The tourism industry has suffered severe decline in recent years and the last week has brought much needed benefit in terms of the publicity surrounding the visit of Queen Elizabeth and President Obama.  We all hope it will encourage more people to travel to Ireland as well as encouraging domestic tourism.  It is a labour-intensive industry and any initiative that reduces the cost base is welcome.  The provisions in this Bill go some way in that regard.  The body of employment law and regulation that has built up over the years must be comprehensively reviewed in order to ensure we have a streamlined tourist industry without excessive red tape and bureaucracy.  The industry must be freed up to provide the hospitality for which we enjoy worldwide renown and to provide value to tourists.</P>
        <P>The cost base in recent years was high and many people who holidayed in Britain, on the Continent and elsewhere remarked that it was far cheaper to holiday abroad.  We have pulled <Col N="505"/>back from that situation somewhat with reduced costs and so on.  Spiralling costs in the hospitality sector were an indictment of how our society had developed.  We must continue with the initiatives that have been made and press on with marketing efforts.  Bord F&aacute;ilte and other tourist bodies must continuously work to promote Ireland as a good place to visit with a wealth of diverse locations and a hospitality sector that offers value for money.  It is sad to see local pubs having to close because of nonsensical legislation introduced in this House and which I opposed at the time.  It is vital to ensure that all these outlets, from the smallest to the largest, are open for business, have a low cost base and can offer visitors to this country an enjoyable holiday experience.</P>
        <P>As we try to rebuild our economy following the crash one of the main aspects to consider is support for indigenous industries, the tourist industry being one of the most important as well as agriculture and others.  We must ensure that any legislation we introduce supports indigenous business.  There has been much discussion in this House in recent days on the fair trade legislation and the protest by farming organisations.  The power of the retail multiples to drive down prices for primary producers and the practice of importing food from other countries which could be sourced at home is costing jobs.  We have the ideal climate to produce an array of foods.  We have a substantial green agricultural industry which must be protected at all costs.  The outgoing Government introduced the Food Harvest 2020 initiative and that has been accepted by the new Government.  It is important that the ambitious targets contained in that policy are met.</P>
        <P>We must ensure the fair trade legislation that is promised is brought forward as a matter of urgency and that there is protection for producers from multiples who are interested only in reducing their bottom line.  Some Members observed last night that it is producers who are carrying the cost of two-for-one offers and other incentives in supermarkets.  The multiples have always hidden behind data which include their Irish sales figures within broader statistics which give little indication of the actual profits they are making in the State.  Deputy Finian McGrath observed that we should not be ashamed to shop locally.  We lost that during the Celtic tiger years and we must row back.  We must be proud of our own produce which in the last week was showcased the world over.  It is an important aspect of the export-led economy that is emerging and which will lead to more jobs in the future.</P>
        <P>The multiples have enormous power and have starved primary producers of reasonable payment.  They must be tackled.  People might say it is a case of the consumer versus the primary producer.  However, one need only look to the banking sector to see where we may be headed.  When competition was introduced in that sector customers were offered lower rates and mortgage terms of up to 40 years.  The view was that the indigenous banks were not keeping pace in this regard and there was subsequently a race to the bottom.  We all know the consequences of that.  If we do not impose serious safeguards and regulations in respect of the multiples in the legislation which I hope will be before the House soon, perhaps even before the summer, we could end up devastating primary producers.</P>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> there is a call to reduce social welfare benefits in order to encourage people into the workforce.  Everybody in this House would agree there is a myth, perpetrated for generations, that people on social welfare are creaming it.  The reality is that the vast majority of people on welfare, including those who have lost their jobs in recent years following the economic crash, are anxious to return to work as soon as possible.  The current welfare rate is barely keeping the wolf from the door for many households.  In many cases individuals and families are accumulating substantial debt because they can no longer service the financial commitments they made while in regular employment.  It is a nonsensical notion that reducing welfare rates will encourage people into work.  The reality is that jobs must be created.</P><Col N="506"/>
        <P Just="Left">There are certainly anomalies within the social welfare system such as the disincentive to take up low-paid work.  Various schemes have been developed over the years and there is a need to streamline the entire system.  However, there is also a need to be absolutely clear in preventing scapegoating of social welfare recipients.  It is not the case that the rates are too high.  The reality is that there is not sufficient employment for everyone.  The first thing people who are unemployed and whom I meet at my constituency clinics and elsewhere &mdash; I am sure other Members have had similar experiences &mdash; say to me is that they want to return to gainful employment as soon as is humanly possible.  I will take every opportunity to refute the nonsense contained in the OECD report with regard to cutting social welfare payments.</P>
        <P>We have developed a good social welfare system and, by and large, catered for the needs of the vulnerable.  The position of carers has been improved, as has that of people with disabilities.  We must ensure we protect the gains that have been made.  There are other ways to raise funds.  My party bore the brunt of people&rsquo;s criticism when it came to balancing the books, introducing cutbacks, etc., during the past two and a half years.  As a then Government backbencher, I was subjected to flak when various schemes and so forth were either cut or abolished.  I accept that there are major political decisions to be taken and that there will be a major outcry about some of these.  If, however, we set ourselves a target of looking out for those who are less well off or vulnerable, that will be an important development.</P>
        <P>A number of issues have arisen in respect of the pension levy.  There are serious concerns in the pensions sector with regard to what is proposed and also in respect of the methodology that has been used.  There is a need to provide for clarification on both fronts.  It is all very well to use words such as &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo;, etc., but there is no doubt that this is a serious issue.  In the past we have tried to encourage people to invest in their future and make provision for their golden years.  That was a good decision on our part and it is one which other societies have not taken.  It is important to continue to state people must be prudent, careful and make financial provision for their old age.  As a society, we must ensure an incentive is always provided and that we remain committed to this matter.  People have always saved money outside of their pension funds.  For historical reasons, putting funds away for a rainy day has always been an attractive proposition.  It is extremely important, therefore, that the State continue to be seen to be encouraging people to save and put money into their pension funds.</P>
        <P>The Bill relates to the jobs initiative.  We must ensure we engage in diplomatic efforts to keep various people across Europe on-side in this matter.  In that context, it is important to develop good relations with various nations.  However, the French have been our great allies in agricultural matters almost since we joined the then European Economic Community in 1973.  It is vital, therefore, that we maintain our good relationship with the French in that regard, irrespective of whatever other issues may arise between us.</P>
        <P>The reduction in PRSI is welcome.  In that context, however, employers will always state their greatest difficulty relates to employment legislation and the bureaucracy that has developed in respect of it.  I am familiar with the owner of a small restaurant who employs 12 or 13 people and is obliged to comply with a raft of regulations and so on.  In addition, the individual in question must also deal with visits from health and safety and other officers.  There is a need to streamline the position in this regard.  One officer, rather than a plethora, should be responsible for carrying out the various visits to restaurants, etc.  The position in the agriculture sector in the context of cross-compliance and other matters is similar.  An almost separate industry has developed with regard to the number of checks and cross-checks that occur in compliance with regulations.</P><Col N="507"/>
        <P>The person to whom I refer and other business people are aware of the importance of providing food that is safe.  They will not, therefore, do anything to jeopardise their business.  However, the notion that they must submit to the agents of Big Brother coming into their premises and checking their compliance with a huge raft of health and safety and other regulations is crazy.  Business people want to ensure they are compliant.  They know what is required of them under both the regulations and the law.  What they do not want is to be bogged down under a pile of bureaucratic red tape.  The amount of regulations in place has stifled a great deal of business.</P>
        <P>During the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il the Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs considered the amount of regulations in place and invited people from various sectors to come before it to discuss the matter.  Some Departments have made a concerted effort to reduce the level of regulation that applies.  In the period prior to the recent general election the Department of the Taoiseach launched a campaign to have the level reduced by 20%.  Every item of legislation passed by the House from this day forward should be checked in order to estimate the bureaucratic effect it will have on various sectors.  While the legislation the House may pass could be important and well intentioned, it may contain certain provisions that will have a serious effect on certain sectors and even stifle economic growth.  If such legislation gives rise to the loss of one or two jobs in a particular sector, it will be bad for society as a whole.  That must be borne in mind.  The position is the same when it comes to agriculture.  Some farmers have been beaten into the ground in complying with regulations.  We must, therefore, take action in dealing with this matter in a fair and even-handed way.</P>
        <P>People who travel to France and other countries on the Continent will state the food markets one sees on the streets are not subject to the same level of regulation as are markets in Ireland.  This is despite the fact that the same regulations are meant to apply across the European Union.  There is a view that we tend to go overboard when transposing European regulations into Irish law.  We must ensure we protect both our people and industry by not introducing too much regulation.  We must also ensure any legislation passed by the House will not jeopardise employment.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to the jobs initiative.  I also welcome those relating to the tourism industry.  We must make a concerted effort to ensure as many people as possible holiday at home this year and that we capitalise on the publicity the country has received in the past two weeks by encouraging more tourists to come here.</P>
        <P>As the Food Harvest 2020 report indicates, there is major potential for development in both our agriculture and fishing industries.  The Government has given a commitment to meet the targets set out in the report.  It is extremely important, therefore, that the promised fair trade legislation be brought before the House prior to the summer recess.  The power of the multiples must be curtailed and we must not allow primary producers to be driven into the ground.</P>
        <P>The Government and the State have made a huge commitment to the banks.  However, the banks continue to stifle the extension of credit to small and medium-sized businesses.  They have provided figures which indicate that they are making money available, but that is not the case.  Every politician is aware that those involved in the small to medium-sized business sector are being starved of credit and that cheques are being bounced on foot of overdrafts being exceeded by &euro;5 or &euro;10.  That is not acceptable.  We are all aware of the grief caused to small to medium-sized businesses.</P>
        <P>I strongly refute the headlines in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to the effect that the rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit should be cut in order to encourage people to return to work.  That is not acceptable and pursuing such a policy would not assist us in getting people back into employment.  The main aim of the vast majority of those who have been on the live register <Col N="508"/>for one year or so is to return to gainful employment in order that they might reclaim their sense of self-worth and have their dignity restored.  Irrespective of the rate of payment that applies, they want to return to employment.  We also want to streamline payments such as family income supplement, medical cards and so forth to encourage people back into employment.  I am grateful for the opportunity to have spoken on this Bill.</P>

	<P>I wish to address some of the comments made by previous speakers, in particular Deputy Finian McGrath, the selective socialist who sits with a Technical coalition composed of Deputies, some of whom have a pathological hatred of working people.  He has a selective memory, especially when it comes to his outstanding support for the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  In fact, he voted for the appointment of the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney.  It is ironic that he gave his independent support to a former Administration in return for deals.  Deputy Finian McGrath spoke earlier about the historical waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money by Administrations he supported, particularly when he voted for the bank bailout deal.  In that context, we must examine the sincerity of Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s earlier contribution.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is important to look at the positives of the jobs initiative.  I am delighted to be associated with a Government that has taken great steps to penetrate areas of the economy that were in need of significant attention.  The jobs initiative goes into some detail on its assistance for the tourism sector.  I welcome the changes in VAT rates, the abolition of the air travel tax and the common visa treatment with the United Kingdom that will focus on the sector.  We are trying to take as many steps as possible to ensure certain pillars of the economy that are struggling will get a boost.  The measure regarding employers&rsquo; PRSI is also a significant movement for the tourism sector.  The Government has take great steps to date to ensure vulnerable areas receive a concentrated effort to make certain they can get our people back to work.</P>
        <P>This week saw the publication of the independent review of the employment regulation orders by Mr. Kevin Duffy and the eminent economist, Dr. Frank Walsh,  a review commissioned by the Government.  While great steps have been taken in the jobs initiative to assist the tourism sector, I share many people&rsquo;s concerns about the domestic economy and any further attempts to deflate it and take money out of circulation, thereby reducing consumers&rsquo; spending power.  Those working under the joint labour committee, JLC, rates in the retail and tourism sector are the backbone of the economy.  We need to tread carefully in this area and avoid solo runs like that which emerged in the print media this morning by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, regarding personal initiatives and attacking premiums associated with working on Sundays.  We need to consider carefully the implications for the domestic economy and retail sector if we reduce the spending power of those working people in question.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that hotel and restaurant employees are the lowest paid workers of any sector.  The latest Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show the average weekly pay in this sector was &euro;351, half the national average of &euro;698.  Research undertaken by the Vincentian Partnership found that in 2009 a family of two, with one parent in work, needed an average of &euro;525 per week to have a minimum essential standard of living.  This means that the average <Col N="509"/>weekly pay in the hospitality sector represents 67% of the income required for a basic standard of living.</P>
        <P>Hospitality workers did not experience the same level of pay rises that workers in other sectors obtained during the boom years under the Administration with which Deputy Finian McGrath was compliant.  In comparison with other sectors, hospitality workers received the lowest pay increases since 2002.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ColmKeaveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Colm Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>It should also be noted that the hospitality sector suffers from one of the highest levels of breaches of employment law.  The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, inspectorate found that between 70% and 80% of businesses investigated in the catering and hotel sector were in breach of employment laws.  In 2008 and 2009, NERA found workers in the sectors receiving as little as &euro;3 to &euro;5 per hour.  Over this two year period, NERA recovered almost &euro;2 million in wage arrears.  The living standards of workers in this sector &mdash; predominantly women, young people and people from new communities &mdash; are already precarious.  Were the JLC rates to be abolished with a resulting fall in wages, this would result in an annual wage cut of more than &euro;1,250 for general catering workers.  This would also increase the level of income inequality in society.</P>

	<P>My friend is conscious of my need to communicate this message regarding this morning&rsquo;s announcements that were above and beyond the terms of reference set out by the independent review of the employment regulation orders.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is cognisant of protecting working people in the economy.  Any decision on JLC rates will be made by the Government and not one individual.  We will remain faithful to our constituency and the programme for Government.  We are also faithful to the country and we will ensure economic recovery is based on ensuring the domestic economy is vibrant and the people have spending power.</P>
        <P>A Member stated that if everyone spent an extra &euro;20 on local produce, up to 20,000 jobs would be created.  Any deviation from a strategy of buying local would result in job losses.  I welcome the publication of the independent review of the employment regulation orders which categorically states that reducing JLC rates will not create one extra job.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues for bearing with me while I made these observations on the recovery of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Irrespective of which side of the House one is on, it is clear no progress will be made in the challenges we face with the banking and deficit crises unless we concentrate on economic growth and jobs.  It is all about jobs, which every Member accepts irrespective of their perspective.  It is not enough, however, to make rhetorical calls for jobs.  The Government has a responsibility to intervene, albeit in a measured and prudent but ambitious way, to bring jobs back to the economy.  That is why I support the Finance (No. 2) Bill&rsquo;s measures.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I found it strange that Deputy Pearse Doherty complained the Bill was too short, as if the shortness of a Bill was something to criticise.  The legislation contains the measures required to be enacted arising from the jobs initiative.  Given the constraints on Government and the difficulties we face, the jobs initiative is an imaginative proposal introduced early in the life of this Government.  It sets out a number of areas in which the Government is in a position to intervene.  A considerable element of it relates to the tax code, VAT reductions for <Col N="510"/>a particular period in particular sectors, the treatment of research and development and the air travel tax.  Each of these measures has been welcomed.  I do not believe I heard anyone quibble during the course of this debate with any of those individual measures.  I may be wrong but the only quibble I heard was that the measures on research and development did not perhaps go far enough.</P>
        <P>Each of the measures which the Government intends to introduce, all of which have considerable merit, must be funded somehow.  It is unfair of Deputy Finian McGrath and some Fianna F&aacute;il Members to acknowledge that these are interesting measures, to state that they support any measure that will create jobs and to then disappear from the argument when the Government puts forward a proposal on how such measures are to be funded.  The Government must fund them.  It is dishonest and disingenuous for people to say they support one part of the proposal and not the other.  In this instance, we cannot have one without the other.  No one is ecstatic or delighted at the notion of a pension levy: no one could be.  However, we must balance the positive opportunities that this revenue will provide for Government to implement these measures of which people are so supportive.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent on those people who say they welcome the first three parts of the Bill but not the final part to tell us from where funding could be alternatively obtained given the overriding requirement for budget neutrality in what the Government does.  Many people will be affected by the pension levy.  To avoid conflict, I should say at this point that I too will be affected by it.  Many people who put together pension funds will be uncomfortable and unhappy that the Government is reaching in and taking away some of their money.  This is an equitable proposition.  What the Government proposes to do is, essentially, engage in a temporary claw-back of the tax relief extended to people fortunate enough, as I and others have been, to put aside money for a pension.  Why should the Government not do that?  I understand Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s point on people&rsquo;s expectations in regard to their pensions.  People&rsquo;s expectations of many things have been undermined in the past two or three years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>True.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Deputy Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is unaffected.  That people&rsquo;s expectation, legitimate or otherwise, five years ago that this pot would grow and grow, assisted by the tax reliefs provided, will not be realised is unfortunate.  We are faced with a crisis.  We must get people back to work and this requires intervention.  The Government has intervened in an imaginative way by way of this temporary claw-back.  The Government has clearly stated that this levy will only apply for four years.  There are no other sources of income available to Government and there are limits in terms of what can be in relation to income tax.  However, there remains merit in the proposal, which should be revisited, to increase income tax for high earners.  This issue will have to be revisited in the future in terms of funding of the type of programmes we need.  The programme for Government is in place and there is agreement on what is required.  This is an imaginative step forward.  It will help get people back to work.  While this may not be the most ambitious stimulus programme in the history of the universe it will assist in getting people back to work.  There are plans in place to invest millions of euro in the education sector, the repair of roads and the retrofitting programme.  These are real proposals which will yield real jobs in our economy.  This legislation deserves the support of every Member of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcNamara"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McNamara</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy White said, this is all about jobs.  In the run up to the last election Members on this side of the House promised initiatives to create jobs.  This is one such initiative.  For the future of confidence in politics in our State it is increasingly <Col N="511"/>important that politicians, following elections, do what they promised during the election.  I am happy to commend this Bill as one important promise on which Members on this side of the House are following through.</P>
        <P>The initiatives in this Bill have been widely welcomed in my constituency of County Clare by those who create jobs in the tourism sector.  According to the Shannon branch of the Irish Hotels Federation, it could save the season in 2011 and is one of the most pro-tourism initiatives from Government in the past ten years.  It is a good first step to recovery, an important one, and is commendable on that basis.  The initiative includes the suspension of the air travel tax, the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for tourism related services, the introduction of a new scheme of discounts on airport charges, a major tourism marketing campaign and a visa waiver programme in an effort to entice tourists travelling to the UK for the London Olympics next year to include Ireland in their itineraries.  In this regard, it is important to stress the proximity of Ireland and our major airports, including Shannon and Dublin Airports, to Stansted Airport, which is the nearest airport to the London Olympics site.  The sports facilities of Limerick University, part of which is currently in County Clare and which I hope will remain in County Clare following the announcements of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, could be utilised and must be marketed by our airlines and those who have sports facilities in the midwest region.</P>
        <P>The jobs initiative has prompted a change in thinking in local as well as national government, which is to be welcomed.  I am pleased to learn that Kilrush town council has announced a retail incentive scheme in Moore Street, Kilrush, to incentivise retailers to occupy empty retail premises in the town.  In this regard, a grant of 50% of the rates applicable to the premises is envisaged in year one and a grant of 25% is envisaged in year two.  It is proposed that this initiative, which I welcome, if successful will be replicated in other local authority areas in County Clare and beyond.</P>
        <P>As Deputy White pointed out additional funding is being made available for road schemes, which is important in the context of people being able to travel to and from work and retail premises.  Also, the repair of roads will generate jobs.  More than &euro;60 million has been set aside for regional and local road investment schemes, of which &euro;2.5 million has been set aside for County Clare, which I welcome.  In this regard, the Department of Transport has published a list of roads in each local authority area.  However, it is important to stress that this list is provisional and that there is scope for county councils and local authorities to prioritise roads in their areas which may be lower down on the list.  It is important that county councils and local authorities examine their lists and identify the roads most important to economic growth in their areas in the context of people being able to travel to retail premises and so on.  Retailers on Moore Street, Kilrush, recently highlighted the fact that the bad state of roads there is forcing people out of the centre of the town into shopping centres run by large multinationals.  In that regard, I call upon local authorities to prioritise for improvement roads leading to the centres of our towns as this will benefit retail outlets which create employment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The 0.6% levy on private pensions which has been proposed to fund the jobs initiative, in section 4, is clearly the most controversial aspect of the initiative and of the Bill.  Like you, a Cheann Comhairle, I voted against cuts to pensions by the previous Government, and public sector pension holders have already been hard hit by cuts to their pensions and by levies. </P>
        <P>However, many of my constituents who are currently receiving defined benefit pensions have been in touch with me.  They are upset at the prospect of a reduction in their current pension entitlements.  These are senior citizens who are not receiving massive pensions but who spent <Col N="512"/>decades working on modest wages in private or public companies such as Cadburys, in my constituency, or Dublin Bus, and hope to enjoy their retirement on their modest pensions.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister for Finance, on the next stage of the Bill to look seriously at putting in place a legislative mechanism to stop administrators passing on this levy to those who are currently receiving pensions.  We heard from many Deputies on all sides of the House the outrageous administration costs of pension funds.  The journalist, Kathleen Barrington, did a fine analysis of this a few weeks ago.  That is the area at which we should aim.  When the Bill was published, the excellent Oireachtas library and research service confirmed to me that the legislation clearly allows the levy to be passed on to those receiving benefits, at the discretion of the administrator.  Is there a constitutional issue here, as there was with public sector pensions?</P>
        <P>I warmly welcome everything in the jobs initiative, particularly as it relates to housing, roads and so on.  However, it follows from our continuing failure to deal with macroeconomic issues.  I commend Deputy Peter Mathews and others who continue to ask the House and the Government to redouble the efforts to achieve a cut in the bailout interest rate.  I commend the T&aacute;naiste for what he has done so far in that regard.  I urge the Government to look at broadening the tax base, if necessary.  My colleague referred to a tax on very high incomes and asset taxes that do not include the family home.  There are other ways.  Some of our colleagues on the Opposition benches, such as Deputy Mick Wallace, have indicated ways for the Government to respond.</P>
        <P>I ask the Government to look closely at the pension levy and see if the jobs initiative can be funded in a way that is sustainable and fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is an important initiative, promised by the Government parties when campaigning in the general election.  Job creation is one of the key issues to which the people want to the Government to respond. </P>
        <P>There is nothing so devastating as being unemployed and not having an opportunity to obtain employment.  Nothing  attacks one&rsquo;s self esteem so much.  The sense of hopelessness that results from it has a very deep effect on one&rsquo;s psyche.  I can speak from experience.  When I was elected to the Oireachtas I came off the live register, having had a senior position in a company until two years previously.  While I did some consultancy work, for much of that time I signed on at my local Garda station every Monday and travelled every Friday to get unemployed benefit to feed my wife and four young children.  There is nothing as devastating as to be in a situation like that.</P>
        <P>The late 1980s were a hopeless time, especially for people who had been professionally involved in a company.  There were no employment opportunities for someone who had spent 18 years in a management capacity.  Employers are, rightly, careful to match the employee to the job.  I fully understand that people who are overqualified for positions are not employed because of the difficulties that can arise from frustration and lack of job satisfaction in such a situation.  I believe I was the only new Oireachtas Member in 1989 to come off the live register when elected.  At the time, I was an employer&rsquo;s nominee on the Employment Appeals Tribunal and I was paid for that one week in six.  I also got some management consultancy for six weeks at one stage and for a couple of months at another.  For much of the time I was unemployed and I can relate to that situation.</P>
        <P>There is a human aspect to the initiatives being taken.  We often miss the human aspect of political decisions.  We sell them as political initiatives, and rightly so.  We must also remember the human factor in all decisions that we politicians make.  This is true for the work of all Departments.  It is particularly true of the work of the Department of Justice and Equality.  I <Col N="513"/>have had much contact with prisoners because of the level of mental ill-health among the prison community.  At a previous time there was a high level of suicide in prisons.  Thankfully, this is no longer the case.  I have spoken to prisoners and to ex-prisoners.  I visited Mountjoy Prison on many occasions with the former governor, Mr. John Lonergan.  We can say prisoners should be put away and locked up forever, but there is a human and family aspect to every prisoner.</P>
        <P>We promised a jobs initiative.  The credibility of our profession rests on our meaning what we say when we make a promise.  If we cannot fulfil a promise we must explain why as clearly and as often as possible rather than allowing the matter to drift and speculation to develop.  One may not be able to fulfil everything one promised in opposition when one is in Government.  When one is in opposition one does not have the resources fully to assess the implications of what might be a very good proposal.  I came across many examples of this in the work I did on mental health while in opposition.  For generations, the mental health services were insignificant in the political process.  Things are improving but at a very slow rate.</P>
        <P>There is a common call that Ireland should default on our IMF-EU agreement.  People are talking about this as a solution.  This is especially so since the Professor Morgan Kelly intervention and his prediction that our national debt could reach &euro;270 billion.  I recently read a very well researched article by Louise McBride in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> .  Ms McBride analysed the effect a default would have on the social fabric of the State and how it would affect people.  Default may be an economic solution but what are its social implications?  It would destroy our international reputation and there would be serious implications for life opportunities and the standing of our citizens.  We may decide to leave the eurozone, but if we default we are likely to be thrown out of the eurozone and would revert to our own currency.  The value of that Irish currency would likely collapse, causing a currency crisis.  This happened in Argentina.  Before Argentina defaulted on its foreign debt in 2001, the Argentine peso was on a par with the US dollar.  After the default it lost 70% of its value.     Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Doherty, the director of the regulatory consultants, Compliance Ireland, has claimed a default would probably wipe out the value of savings and could also make it impossible for people to get their hands on those savings.  He stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">If Ireland defaulted on its foreign debt and reintroduced the punt, the money in most bank accounts would be in punts rather than euro.  Because of the economic situation the country would be in, the value of the punt would plummet.  The value of your savings would go down as the currency depreciated.  If you have your life savings squirrelled away in the credit union, you&rsquo;d find the value of those savings diminished as the price of foreign goods and services becomes more expensive.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am quoting the experts in this area because I am not an expert and I believe both sides of the argument should be presented.  Mr. Cian Twomey, a lecturer in financial economics at NUI Galway, said the value of people&rsquo;s savings would be at least halved if Ireland defaulted and left the eurozone, and claimed &ldquo;Our savings would be worth between 50 and 70% less in punts than they would have been worth in euro&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>People might also find themselves locked out of their savings accounts.  When Argentina defaulted in 2001, the Argentine Government froze deposits to prevent savers converting their deposits into a more valuable foreign currency.  It also restricted the amount of money Argentinians could withdraw from their accounts to about 250 pesos a week, worth about &euro;135, in the wake of the default.  Not long afterwards, it was a common sight for Argentinians to search for ATMs that were not empty.  People could lose their savings if their bank or credit union went bust.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>The Irish Government currently guarantees savings of up to &euro;100,000 and in excess of that figure in some circumstances.  In this regard, Mr. Cian Twomey stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">If Ireland defaults, how would the Government continue to guarantee deposits?  The Government can only continue to guarantee deposits if it can continue to borrow.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If Ireland defaults on its IMF-EU loans, the chances of finding anyone to lend us money at non-prohibitive interest rates are slim.  More than &euro;100 billion worth of savings were withdrawn from Irish banks last year amid fears caused by our banking crisis.  If Ireland defaults and the Government clamps down on savings, as the Argentinians did, billions of euro could leave the country and people would take desperate measures.  In this regard, Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Doherty stated: &ldquo;People with a bit of money would fly off to France and other European countries and open a euro bank account&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>With regard to mortgages, if a person has a cheap tracker mortgage, some believe he or she might have to kiss goodbye to it if Ireland leaves the eurozone.  According to Mr. O&rsquo;Doherty:</P>
        <P LI="1">The interest rates on your mortgage would be set to the Irish punt.  That means your ECB tracker would disappear.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The tracker mortgage is a contract which the person has with his or her bank, so whether the person would lose it if Ireland left the eurozone remains to be seen.  However, in circumstances where the interest rates on mortgages were tied to the Irish punt after an Irish exit of the eurozone, interest rates would soar.</P>
        <P>Less than 20 years ago, a currency crisis hit Ireland.  The Irish punt was devalued by 10% and Irish interest rates reached unprecedented levels.  Mortgage interest rates in Ireland climbed as high as 16% in 1993.  What would be the level of interest rates if we were to devalue by 50% to 70% against the euro?  Those who had taken out a loan from a European bank would also be in deep trouble.  An Irish citizen would find it much harder to pay back a mortgage in euro if he or she is being paid in punts, as the punt would very rapidly be worth much less than the euro.</P>
        <P>What would be the situation if Ireland followed in the footsteps of other countries that have defaulted?  When Argentina defaulted, it expropriated pension funds, transforming them into government-backed loans to service debt.  The price of foreign goods has exploded in countries that have found themselves embroiled in currency crises.  In Argentina, inflation hit 30% just a few months after the default.  The same would probably happen here.  Domestic prices, such as for newspapers or milk, would remain the same because they would be based on the punt, as devalued.  However, as Mr. Kevin O&rsquo;Doherty has stated, the price of products made outside of Ireland would become much more unaffordable, including foreign holidays, cars and half of what consumers purchase in the supermarket given that 50% of what we purchase in the supermarket is sourced from abroad.  To pick out a positive in all of this, tourists would be one of the few to benefit from a currency crisis as their foreign dollars or euro would be twice or triple the value of the Irish punt.</P>
        <P>With regard to what might happen in regard to social welfare, I will give the view of the Department of Finance, although some might worry about taking its view on board.  It stated that if Ireland defaults on its EU-IMF loan, it would no longer have the financial support it needs to plug the massive budget deficit.  The Government would have to unleash spending cuts of &euro;18 billion to fund itself.  To achieve that, the Cabinet could slash by about a third child benefit, dole payments, State pensions and public sector wages for our doctors, nurses, local authority workers and those working in other sectors.  That is what default means.</P><Col N="515"/>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation might never recover.  Multinationals could pull out of Ireland, leading to major job losses.  Foreign companies eyeing up Ireland as a possible base could pull back from their plans.  Mr. Cian Twomey of NUI Galway stated: &ldquo;If Ireland suddenly defaulted, it would damage future investment in the country and dissuade people from doing business with us&rdquo;.  Paying by credit card could be impossible if Ireland defaults.  Following default in Argentina, stores would not accept credit cards and millions of Argentinians were forced to barter for food and petrol that year because they were not allowed to spend the money in their bank accounts.  The very least we can expect is a thriving black economy.  By 2005, only four years after Argentina defaulted, it was believed about half of its population worked in the black economy, which lead to a big drop in the Argentinian Government&rsquo;s tax revenue.  For Ireland, this would mean less money for public services and, in essence, we would become a Third World country.</P>
        <P>Perhaps these economists are the prophets of doom but when we had prophets of doom warning us about what was happening, a certain Taoiseach made a statement that upset us all, which I will not quote here because it is too sensitive to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to express my opinion on this very important Bill.  I know how serious Deputy Neville has been about many issues during the last D&aacute;il and all through his public life, and I am interested to hear his views in this regard also.  The people have now had a chance to absorb fully the ramifications of the recent jobs initiative proposed by the Government, which received a mixed welcome from those directly affected, with some reaction favourable but much of it not.  People expected more.  It is opportune that Deputy Neville mentioned the promises made.  Promises are often made by the Opposition but these ones were reckless.  I was critical of the EU-IMF bailout and voted against it.  No rocket science was needed to understand how serious and perilous the situation was, or the pressures on the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and his Department.  Even if the Opposition had made no reckless promises it would have been elected because people wanted change and voted for it.  Now they are disappointed and deflated not to have seen any change other than of the seating arrangements in the House.  They are becoming more bemused by the day and the hour. </P>
        <P>The most recent confusion concerns the perceived support by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and other colleagues in Government for the nomination of and campaign by the French lady, Ms Christine Lagarde, for the IMF post.  A theory being put around is that this is to get her out of Europe because she has been so damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s cause.  Many of the Franco-German alliance have been that way but I do not accept that theory.  We got a reasonable hearing from the IMF which supported us for better rates than our so-called European friends gave us.  With friends like those, one would wonder who needs enemies.  I would be worried if Ms Lagarde were to take that job.  It is said to be a European position but surely there is somebody who might be more favourably disposed to our country.  I supported the Minister&rsquo;s nomination and I support many of his efforts so I call on him to come to the House and explain the thinking behind this because it seems to be a very cosy arrangement.  People are confused and are becoming more so all the time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the jobs initiative because I believe any such initiative is a good start.  Tosach maith leath na h-oibre.   However, this was only a tiny dip in the ocean.  Deputy Neville spoke of a personal experience of being unemployed which was very generous on his part.  We know of the perilous situation that exists for people who are out of work or about to lose their jobs, the despair that goes with that, the stifling of their relationships and their will to contribute to their communities and provide for their families.  It is very humiliating and demoralising.  There is a proposal to reduce the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% from 1 July for many businesses <Col N="516"/>operating in the tourism sector and this is very timely in view of the two successful visits of last week.  I compliment all involved, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and everybody who engaged, including the previous Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, who had invited the queen to this country.  I met her in Cashel, where, I am told, bookings have already doubled.  People will come to see the famous Rock of Cashel which must be a good thing.</P>
        <P>In that way the initiative was a good start because we must maintain the jobs we have.  It will be very hard to create new jobs but every small business should at least be supported, given a breather and have the shackles of the harrowing and over zealous legislation and the official application of same removed.  There is a great downturn in the economy, yet there is a myriad of teams of inspectors who have nothing else to do now because the construction industry has stopped.  They are just making a nuisance of themselves.  I do not condone law breaking or any undermining of people&rsquo;s work conditions but inspectors are making a nuisance of themselves with small businesses.  I am tired of saying this but anybody who employs more than six people needs one person to deal with the bookwork, the inspectors and everything else.  Many inspectors arrive unannounced.  I do not say they should not come but they are over zealous in their work and must be called off.   We must support the jobs we have.  Many businesses need strengthening to offer better conditions regarding the jobs they have.  Then they may be able to stay open on Sundays and other days, employ extra people or offer more hours to the staff they have.  The hotel industry has experienced a number of very tough seasons, as have cinemas, theatres and sporting facilities, and I hope they will embrace this initiative and run with it.  I hope that by 1 July it will be easy to handle and not involve too much paperwork.  Management and staff in the local hospitality industry hope the move will boost tourism and football, as I believe it will.  It is timely after the State visits and the exposure we received but we must be aware there is still a long way to go before the industry is back on its feet.   Everybody knows that.</P>
        <P>Another unfair aspect, about which one hears anecdotal stories on a daily basis, concerns hotels that are in NAMA.  They are competing with ordinary, Irish, home-grown and, in many cases, family-run businesses which cannot compete.  Yesterday under Standing Orders I tried to raise the appalling way NAMA is treating businesses.  Those involved lack a basic understanding of how these businesses are run.  They might have one business in NAMA but many other businesses are being stifled and having the tap turned off.  There are cases in my county of pig farmers who have ended up in NAMA not being allowed to provide proper sustenance for their animals.  They are given barely enough meal to keep going.  NAMA wants them to sell the animals to repay some of their debts in order to make itself look good, yet it will not allow the farmers to feed proper rations to the animals to make them fit for sale.  It is totally shoddy because those concerned do not understand how businesses are run.  That is only one instance but it is the same way in the hotel industry.  The people concerned have no understanding because they are accountants and solicitors.  I do not say anything about them in regard to their careers but many of them are young and inexperienced and do not understand the situation.  That is a basic flaw in NAMA which must be sorted out.  These people have no problem about closing down accounts and bouncing cheques on suppliers and all of that, which causes trauma to businesses that have been trading for generations and decades.</P>
        <P>The decision to create a national internship scheme in the coming two years, with 5,000 places on offer, is very welcome.  That must be rolled out and the positions must be relevant and the projects worthwhile.  It must try to involve young people, their brains and their enthusiasm.  I give the scheme a cautious welcome but there is a need to be careful and to have more creative <Col N="517"/>and innovative thinking to get the economy going and, in particular, to get the manufacturing and exporting sectors back to full capacity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The recent report on joint agreements was disappointing, given the lack of clarity on the issue of wage rates in the sector.  This, again, is part of a wider problem.  I welcome the consultation on this by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I hope there will be full meaningful engagement.  I know of many cases where employers and workers, for the sake of their jobs, the company and the bond built up over the years, expressed an interest in wage cuts rather than to abide by the letter of the law to onerous agreements.  They were happy to do that but then came the intervention of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and other bodies which arrived on the scene flashing their badges and waving their wands, putting pay to that.  Again, this showed no basic understanding.  When NERA delegates came to the House, I questioned them on the numbers of staff and the facilities they had.  It was unbelievable.  NERA has five different regional offices and 130 or 140 staff, at a time when businesses are on the floor.  When there were local agreements and staff were willing to participate in a fair way, with fair remuneration,  NERA undermined that initiative.</P>
        <P>Under the jobs initiative, &euro;60 million will be provided for the repair and restoration of local and regional roads, with &euro;10 million to go for school works and &euro;15 million for improvements of footpaths, rail stations and pedestrian crossings.  This is a pittance but I welcome it.  I am aware of the difficulties that arise from the pensions proposal and this money is substantial from that point of view.  However, we must get value for money in those areas.  It is available and we cannot afford not to get it.  In many works that are done today, for example, water schemes, etc., the builder or developer in charge must run and maintain them for ten years.  There must be a link, as there is with roadworks, so that there will be a fall-back to the contractor.  There are many good contractors but sometimes work is done that is not up to quality and there is no redress.  Public money goes down the Swanee which is a bad outcome.</P>
        <P>It is hoped that the jobs initiative will alleviate many of the problems that exist and also that it will deal with the human factor, as mentioned by the previous speaker.  The human factor is seen when one walks into a household where a father and perhaps three or four sons and daughters are unemployed.  It is demoralising for them and very tough on parents and everybody else.   I refer to the 0.6% pension levy.  My colleague in the Technical Group, Deputy Ross, pointed out some issues and the matter has received some media exposure as well.  We must have private pensions and the slippage in private pensions is frightening.  The take-up has waned in the past decade but we must encourage rather than diminish provision.  We are looking in the wrong place.  We should have examined the significant levies and fees that the middlemen get and the exploitation that goes on.  We should have looked in that area for at least 0.3% of the amount to spread the balance.  We should not scare people from investing in their future and pensions; we should encourage them.  This is a negative move.  I realise we must get the money somehow and from wherever we get it there will be criticism.  There have been pension levies on public sector workers already and the move was seen to be fair from that point of view.  Nevertheless, it is driving people away from investing in pensions.</P>
        <P>I am not in favour of default.  The word &ldquo;default&rdquo; is anathema to anyone in business.  No one seeks to default because one has built up good relations with the bank, customers and everyone else.  The word &ldquo;default&rdquo; is easy for economists to use and this is a pity because it is damaging.  The previous speaker went into some depth on the matter.  There are significant, unthinkable ramifications to a default in the case of ordinary business people or family home owners who cannot pay the mortgage and who are in negative equity.  The last thing such people would choose is to default because it affects them for decades and it affects their ability to function properly mentally, physically and financially.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>I was greatly in favour of the Government&rsquo;s proposals to renegotiate the terms of the deal.  The Government led the people to believe it was simply a matter of new energy and new people going to Brussels and the IMF and that if they came over here we would deal with them and have the deal changed in weeks.  Sadly, the people have been let down.  I had hoped we could do this as well but it appears there is intransigence.  Our new-found friend, Christine Lagarde, was one of the main obstacles to this.  Perhaps there are clever plans to shift her to the IMF.  However, we received some favourable terms from the IMF and certainly more so than in the case of the EU.  To put Ms Lagarde there is like putting one&rsquo;s best player elsewhere.  We are playing Cork next Sunday in Cork but we will not give Lar Corbett to the Cork team and it is like doing that, which bemuses me.  The public seek explanations and are confused.  I look forward to reading the newspapers at the weekend to see how they deal with it.  The course of action is letting down the people and their hopes.</P>
        <P>Before coming here, I attended a meeting involving Chuck Feeney&rsquo;s organisation.  The purpose of the organisation is to connect people with the Parliament and their civic duties.  This process has been set up and is being funded.  We are representatives of the people.  I do my humble best as do the vast majority of the 166 Members as well as the new Senators.  Confidence in the House is being eroded as a result of the great expectations which were built up in the knowledge that there was not one penny in the pot.  This happened previously in 1977.  I was involved at the time and the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government made promises that were not necessary.  At that time, the people sought change as well.  They wanted the coalition in place at the time out as quickly as possible.  Thankfully, the electorate is more sophisticated now and it can see through this.  There is a need for a sense of civic duty among ordinary young people who should get involved and stay involved.  The situation at present is demoralising, concerning and disconcerting and they are switched off by it.  They believe they have been let down and hurt.  I could continue to say a good deal more but I am being repetitive.  The initiatives taken by the new Government are perceived to be more up-front and honest, including the appointments to the Seanad which were imaginative and independent-minded and which I welcome.</P>
        <P>Everyone knows with regard to the financial issue that the thing is on the floor.  We must support and encourage the jobs already in place in the first instance and we must stabilise these and stop the haemorrhage taking place.  We must explore new ways of creating and stimulating the creation of jobs.  The receiver industry is a racket and must be tackled.  It is the fastest growing industry in the country at present.  They are merciless when they move in and they charge exorbitant fees, legal and otherwise.  Receiver fees are of phone number proportions.  Receivers go into companies in trouble, including hard-working family businesses and other businesses that have been in operation for many decades and which are being demoralised.  They are being plundered.  Legislation must be changed rapidly.  The stories one hears are disturbing.</P>
        <P>The Judiciary gives scant regard to the rights of chief executive officers of companies, company owners and company law.  There is little right to defence.  This is demoralising and is driving away entrepreneurs.  It is leaving them with a bad taste, showing them in a bad light and stifling their initiative to recover and to return to business again.  When self-employed people become unemployed they have no access to support from the State for a long time and this must be examined.  This area must be tackled.  Reference was made to &euro;60 million but money is scarce although I recognise we are critical of where it has come from.  We must examine where there are disincentives for business which are driving people out of work and we must deal with this.</P>
        <P>The regulators are legion.  We are altogether over-regulated in this area but we have no financial regulation.  These people should be put into more constructive, supportive roles for <Col N="519"/>business and companies.  They should go out to see if they can help.  I welcome the initiative from the Bank of Ireland this week.  It is running a business enterprise week.  This is the type of thing we need from the many institutions of State.  The intention is for representatives to arrive into a business and indicate that they are there for half an hour to talk and to determine if they can provide support.  That represents a positive change and is the type of new thinking we need.  This type of re-training and re-skilling must be carried out by officials working in State agencies.  I do not mean to knock them; it is simply the way they were trained for the positions in a different time when the Celtic tiger abounded.  They must be re-skilled, reinvigorated and arrive in a supporting role.</P>
        <P>If there are breaches of the law they must be dealt with.  As a businessman, every letter I get from the Revenue contains at the end a reference to a sizeable monetary fine or prison sentence.  This is simply not fair.  This amounts to threatening people.  It is a case of them and us and the old baggage of the State against the people and this is being encouraged.  We need a sea change.  These agencies must come out and support businesses.  I realise Enterprise Ireland, the enterprise boards, certain officials in county councils, the IDA and many other groups carry out tremendous work.  However, the people who police this area and who are stifling the initiatives must be re-trained and re-skilled in a supporting role rather than a negative role to try to keep the jobs we have.  If these people and small businesses are supported in a small way, if each company created only one extra job, we could halve the dole queue at very little or no cost.  These agencies should provide a supporting role and companies should be allowed to trade.  A little credit from the banks which are in receipt of taxpayers money would help as well.  I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jack Wall, for his forbearance and I look forward to further engagement on this matter in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everyone for their contributions.  I recognise the matters raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath with regard to Bank of Ireland.  I attended one such session in Ballybay last week which was very effective.  We need such initiatives where the banks come to meet the people rather than the other way around.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Finance stated when he announced the jobs initiative in the House on 10 May last, the country does not have the resources available at present to fund large-scale policy initiatives to help to generate economic activity.  Any costs associated with the measures the Government is implementing as part of this initiative must be paid for through the introduction of off-setting measures to ensure the measures are budget-neutral during the period to 2014.  This means that the stimulatory effect on the economy of this package must be modest but it represents the first step by the Government towards improving the competitiveness of important sectors of the economy and enhancing the functioning of the labour market.  Further measures will follow with a view to developing the Government&rsquo;s vision of rebuilding a prosperous and productive economy by the end of its term in office.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Finance stated in the Chamber last Tuesday, the Finance (No. 2) Bill has been drafted specifically to give effect to those taxation-related measures he announced in the jobs initiative.  These measures are the research and development tax credit, the suspension of the air travel tax, the introduction of a second lower rate of value added tax and the introduction of a pension levy.  Many Members have spoken eloquently on these and other related measures and I now will turn to the points raised during the course of the debate.  Although time will not permit me to address them all, I will try to cover as many of the relevant issues as possible.</P>
        <P>Deputy Michael McGrath asked whether the pension fund levy would end as promised in 2014.  The legislation governing the pension fund levy provides that it applies only for the years <Col N="520"/>2011 to 2014.  The Government intends to use the pension fund levy to pay for the jobs initiative and it is not proposed to extend the levy beyond this period.  Previous levies have been introduced for limited time periods, such as the previous pension fund levy, which applied for the year 1988 only and the bank levy that was in place for three years at the beginning of the last decade.  The same Deputy asked about IMF concerns regarding the pension levy.  The Government renegotiated the memorandum of understanding with the EU, ECB and the IMF to allow for the jobs initiative, including the pension fund levy.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Deputies Michael McGrath and Sean Fleming suggested that more funds will be raised through the pension levy than will be spent on the jobs initiative.  Given our commitments under the joint EU-IMF programme of financial support and current difficulties in the public finances, the jobs initiative is being funded on a cost-neutral basis over the four year period 2011 to 2014 and a careful examination of the figures will show this to be the case.  There should be a small net positive to the Exchequer this year as the yield from the pension levy is forecast to be greater than the estimated combined loss of revenue from the VAT, PRSI and air travel tax measures and the small additional level of spending.  It is important to view the initiative in the round over the four-year period, remembering that the goal is not direct economic stimulus but rather a targeting of existing resources towards more employment-rich areas of activity.</P>
        <P>Deputy Michael McGrath also suggested that the location of pension schemes in Ireland by multinationals might be re-evaluated as a result of the pension levy and Deputy O&rsquo;Dea stated that were a pension fund to be moved offshore, it would no longer be liable to the levy.  The levy will not apply to the assets of occupational pension funds in respect of the provision of retirement benefits to active, deferred or former retired members whose employment in respect of the scheme is and always was exercised outside the State.  In other words, the levy will not apply to the extent that a scheme is intended to provide retirement benefits outside the State.  A similar provision was included in the previous pension fund levy some years ago so that there should be no substantive deterrent to cross-Border pension funds remaining or being established in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The levy will apply to the assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation by the Revenue Commissioners that are providing retirement benefits to relevant members or beneficiaries in this State, irrespective of whether the administrator of the scheme is based in the State or in another European Union member state.  Such overseas schemes providing retirement benefits to relevant members or beneficiaries in this State require approval by the Revenue Commissioners and as part of that approval process, they will be subject to the requirements of the levy.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sean Fleming sought to suggest that the exclusion of assets attributable to people working wholly outside the State might be a sop to so-called tax exiles.  On the one hand, Fianna F&aacute;il wrongly complains that the levy will have an impact on pension schemes in Ireland that provide services outside the State while on the other, its members complain that a measure that allows for the exemption of such pension funds will encourage avoidance by tax exiles.  Deputy Michael McGrath asked whether the Pensions Board was consulted about the introduction of the levy and Deputy Dooley asked whether other State bodies were consulted.  Department officials have been in contact with a wide number of interested parties in the public and private sectors, including the Pensions Board, about the practical, logistical and other issues surrounding the introduction of the levy.</P>
        <P>Deputies Michael McGrath, Sean Fleming and Boyd Barrett asked about the non-application of the levy to approved retirement funds, ARFs.  This issue also was raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty, who referred to ARFs being used to invest in pensions.  Some confusion in respect of <Col N="521"/>ARFs and pension funds needs to be cleared up.  ARFs do not come within the scope of the pension levy scheme in the same way that an annuity purchased in the name of an individual on retirement also is outside its scope.  This is because neither such annuities nor ARFs are pension funds.  An annuity essentially is a pension in payment, that is, a stream of income purchased for an individual from a life assurance company for a capital sum at the point of the individual&rsquo;s retirement.  ARFs are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested, also on retirement.  ARFs are designed to provide a stream of income to their owners on retirement in the same way as annuities.  In fact, they were introduced as an alternative to annuities but with more flexibility and control for the beneficiaries over the funds involved.</P>
        <P>The stream of income provided by way of annuity is subject to tax at the annuity holder&rsquo;s marginal tax rate and drawdowns from ARFs are similarly taxable at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.  If drawdowns are not made from ARFs, a notional or imputed drawdown amounting to 5% of the assets in the ARF is deemed to take place each year, which notional drawdown is liable to tax at the ARF owner&rsquo;s marginal tax rate.  Therefore, while money held in an ARF will not be subject to the pension fund levy, the money in the fund is taxable even where an individual does not make a withdrawal from that fund.  Unlike the pension fund levy which is temporary, the 5% annual notional distribution requirement, which was increased from 3% in the last budget and Finance Act, is permanent.  The ARF option on retirement is not just available to the chosen few.  It was extended in the Finance Act 2011 to all defined contribution pension arrangements in respect of the main benefits from such arrangements.  Members of such schemes and defined benefit schemes always had the ARF option with regard to additional voluntary contributions, AVCs, to pension saving arrangements.</P>
        <P>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan asked about the position of the levy with regard to the Constitution.  While it is a matter for the courts to decide what is and is not constitutional, the Minister obtained legal advice on the levy and the scheme being introduced has taken account of that advice.  Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan also mentioned a letter from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation concerning whether pension fund administrators should pass on the levy.  This issue also was raised by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Joan Collins and it will be a matter for pension fund administrators to decide how to fund the payment of the levy.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Dea suggested that the previous pension fund levy provided for in the Finance Act 1988 was charged on the capital gains of pension funds.  This is not correct as the previous levy was charged as a percentage of the imputed income of pension funds.  The imputed income was taken to be a percentage of the capital or market value of the fund.  For example, if a fund was worth &euro;1 million, it was deemed to earn an income of 9% or &euro;90,000 and the levy was charged at a rate of 6% of this deemed income.  However, to calculate the levy under this deemed or imputed income method, one still must work out the capital value or market value of the assets in the fund and consequently there is no essential difference between using the method to calculate the 1988 pension fund levy and the more straightforward method used in this Bill.</P>
        <P>Several Members asked the reason a form of wealth tax was not introduced.  There are a number of current taxes which are in effect taxes on wealth, such as capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and the domicile levy.  Deputy Sean Fleming asked about AVCs paid by public servants.  These are paid into funded pension schemes and such schemes are subject to the levy.  It also should be noted that some public sector and public service pension schemes are funded schemes and as such will be subject to the levy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy O&rsquo;Dea asked whether the purpose of introducing the levy was not to interfere with the current tax regime on pensions.  I am aware the pension fund levy comes at a time when <Col N="522"/>the gradual reduction from marginal to standard rate tax relief on pension contributions forms part of the fiscal consolidation measures in the agreement with the European Commission, IMF and the ECB over the period 2011 to 2014.  In this regard, I can state the Government has initiated a comprehensive review of expenditure to provide it with a set of decision options to meet the overall fiscal consolidation objectives and realign spending with the programme for Government priorities.  The review is due to be completed by the end of September 2011.  The Government will then examine the findings and, in consultation with the EU, IMF and ECB, will introduce neutral changes to the detail of the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, while maintaining the overall commitment to consolidation.  The Minister is undertaking to examine the scope for any change to the proposed standard rating of tax relief on pension contributions in that context.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n had previously asked whether company directors and high earners would be exempt from the levy.  The assets in the pension schemes of such individuals as approved by the Revenue Commissioners under tax legislation will be subject to the levy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked whether there would be any difference in how the levy applied to defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.  I do not see the difference he may be referring to, given that the levy applies at the same rate to the market value of assets within both types of the scheme on the valuation dates.  Perhaps he might elaborate further on this at a later stage.  As regards Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s request for precise details on the exact impact and cost of the levy on individual pension holders, I am not in a position to provide those specific details.  It is up to the trustees and administrators who will be chargeable under the law for the levy to decide whether and how the levy should be passed on and who should be impacted upon and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans for which they are responsible.</P>
        <P>Deputy Clare Daly launched an attack on our research and development tax credit scheme.  The purpose of the scheme, which is open to all companies big and small, is to encourage research and development in this country in order to improve our economy and increase employment.  A credit of 25% of the incremental spend on research and development is available for this purpose and the scheme has been enhanced in most years since its introduction in order to improve its effectiveness.  The latest amendment in this Bill represents a further such enhancement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The fruit borne by the tax credit scheme may be seen in the fact that of the 79 new investments won by the IDA in 2010 from existing clients, some 37, or nearly 50%, were in the area of research and development.  The value of investment in Ireland arising from these new research and development projects is about &euro;500 million as well as involving considerable numbers of jobs.  Perhaps Deputy Daly might inquire of those of her constituents working in research and development-related projects how they would regard incentives which deliver this type of activity in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony&rsquo;s call for the return of the patent income exemption and further improvements to the research and development tax credit scheme, the tax credit has been enhanced over the years and further enhancements can be considered in the future.  The decision to abolish the patent income exemption relief was taken on the basis of a recommendation to this effect by the Commission on Taxation.  The commission found that the relief has not had the desired impact on innovation and research and development activity and that despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, it was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money.</P>
         <P>Deputy Michael McGrath referred to the new 9% VAT rate which is focused towards the tourism sector.  The Deputy suggested this new rate should also be applied to the construction <Col N="523"/>sector.  As Deputies will be aware, the jobs initiative otherwise makes provision for assisting the construction industry in the form of the investment of an additional &euro;30 million in 2011 in the national home retrofitting scheme.  This will directly benefit the construction sector.  In addition, separate funding in the initiative for schools, local and regional roads and smarter travel projects will also be of benefit to the construction industry.  Furthermore, under EU law it is not possible to apply a 9% rate to a large section of the construction sector.  In this regard, commercial construction, for example, is regarded as a parked item, for which the VAT rate may not be lower than 12%.  The passing on of the 4.5% reduction in the VAT rate to the consumer is of course necessary if the initiative is to be successful.  The measure will be reviewed by the end of 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the tourist industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has no or little effect then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished.  Deputy O&rsquo;Dea raised the question of certain tourism-related services which will not be covered by the new 9% rate.  These include short-term car hire, hire of caravans and tour guide services.  Ireland continues to apply a reduced VAT rate to a wide range of goods and services under an EU derogation on the basis that a reduced rate was in operation for these items on 1 January 1991.  However, in the majority of cases, as in the case of tour guide services, short-term hire of cars and the other items mentioned, the derogation restricts that reduced rate to 12%.  These items are often referred to as parked items under EU VAT rules.  Therefore, it would not be possible to apply the rate of 9% to all, or indeed most, of the economic activities that currently apply at the 13.5% rate in Ireland.  While these items could in theory be reduced to a 12% rate, that could only be done if all items remaining on 13.5% were reduced to the 12% rate, as under the EU VAT directive, a member state can only have two reduced rates.  Ireland will now have a 9% rate and a 13.5% rate.  Furthermore, such a reduction from 13.5% to 12% for all items that will be remaining on the 13.5% rate would be very expensive for the Exchequer to implement.</P>
       <P>The Deputy also referred to items such as domestic fuels, electricity and gas.  The position in regard to these fuels is similar to that I have already outlined with regard to short-term car-hire, that is, they are parked items.  It would therefore not be possible to apply the new 9% rate to them.  The application of the new reduced VAT rate of 9% to the tourism sector is a key aspect of the overall jobs initiative and one which I am confident can provide a much needed stimulus for this important and highly labour-intensive sector of our economy.</P>
        <P>As regards the suspension of the air travel tax raised by a number of Deputies, I must again clarify that the commencement of this measure is subject to an agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his officials have had discussions with the Dublin Airport Authority and the main Irish airlines about the proposed suspension of the travel tax.  The measure is part of a three-pronged strategy to encourage inbound tourism.  It also includes a new growth incentive scheme which has been introduced by the DAA and more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, DAA and the airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.  I understand the Minister has also written to all other airlines operating services to and from the State airports in relation to these proposals.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has made it absolutely clear in all his contacts with the airlines that the Government is only prepared to commence the legislative provisions in relation to air travel tax if the airlines demonstrate a willingness to respond positively to these initiatives.  The DAA is also actively engaged in discussions with the airlines in relation to the growth incentive scheme and it is ensuring the airlines are fully aware of the Government&rsquo;s position which is that the air travel tax measure will only be commenced when the <Col N="524"/>airlines commit to deliver more tourists to Ireland.  This position will continue to be reviewed in the context of traffic performance in the current year as well as stated plans by airlines for growth in future years.</P>
        <P>I agree entirely with the many Deputies who have stressed the importance of the tourism sector.  As the Minister noted in his Second Stage contribution, much economic activity within the tourism industry is highly intensive in its use of labour and this is particularly true of hotels and restaurants, recreation and entertainment.  We must recover the ground we have lost in this area and then tourism can make a very substantial contribution to our economic recovery and to the creation of employment in all parts of the country.</P>
        <P>Deputies Barry and Buttimer both mentioned the issue of companies which have difficulty in making the necessary returns of VAT to the Revenue.  I can advise the Deputies that Revenue is conscious of the need to strike the appropriate balance between giving some latitude to viable businesses experiencing short-term difficulties and ensuring timely collection of tax debts.  Indeed, Revenue responded to the current problematic environment as it emerged by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to engage proactively with them when issues emerge so an agreed approach can be put in place and timely compliance speedily restored.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Deputy Pearse Doherty is aware, the Government has committed to a review of the universal social charge.  This review will be completed in time for budget 2012.  As I have stated a number of times in this House, my Department is accepting submissions from all parties interested in contributing to the review and I encourage such submissions.  I have also emphasised that if changes are being proposed to the USC, I would request well thought-out and workable solutions to fill any Revenue gaps created.  The focus must be on maintaining the &euro;4 billion yield.  My Department is still awaiting a submission from the Deputy or his party but I do not consider that an immediate abolition of the USC and a reintroduction of the income and health levies as suggested by the Deputy as a well thought-out and workable solution.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has claimed that the USC is a regressive charge but this is not the case.  The USC is, in fact, a progressive measure.  Under the USC, the more one earns, the higher a percentage of one&rsquo;s income is paid.  When the USC is considered in the broader context of how we tax income generally, the overall effect is highly progressive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to a recent European Commission publication, Monitoring tax revenues and tax reforms in EU Member States 2010<i>, </i>Ireland has the most progressive taxation of income of all the EU member states in the OECD.  If Deputy Peader T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has concerns about the taxation system, lack of progressivity should not be one of them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Doherty inquired about the date of introduction of taxation provisions in respect of civil partnership.  As the Taoiseach stated in the House on Tuesday, a Bill providing for the necessary taxation measures for civil partnership will be brought before the D&aacute;il shortly.  I expect the Bill to be published in the coming weeks and enacted before the summer.  It will provide for the necessary changes to the tax Acts arising from the Civil Partnership Act 2010 and will not include any other taxation measures, austere or otherwise.</P>
        <P>I thank all those Deputies who perhaps do not agree with some or all of the measures proposed but who have made considered and useful contributions to this debate.  As the Minister indicated, there are still a number of matters under consideration for inclusion in the Bill on Committee Stage on which he looks forward to a constructive and informed discussion.  Consideration will, of course, also be given to the constructive suggestions made on Second Stage.</P>

	<P>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis t&uacute;s a chur leis an bpl&eacute; sa Teach inniu ar an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go bhfuil an-&aacute;thas orm a bheith ceaptha mar Aire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. C&eacute; nach bhfuil m&eacute; l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge, t&aacute; sp&eacute;is ar leith agam sa teanga agus t&aacute;im ag obair go dl&uacute;th leis an Aire St&aacute;it i mo Roinn, Dinny McGinley.  Mar is eol daoibh, is fear de bhun&uacute; na Gaeltachta &eacute; an tAire St&aacute;it a bhfuil tuiscint ar leith aige ar ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta. N&iacute;l aon dabht agam ach go bhfuil s&eacute; go maith in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in at&aacute; roimhe ina r&oacute;l mar Aire St&aacute;it agus freagracht speisialta aige do ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeltachta.</P>
        <P>Is &iacute; an obair is m&oacute; at&aacute; idir l&aacute;mha ag mo Roinn maidir leis an nGaeilge n&aacute; an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain. Mar is eol daoibh, t&aacute; an pr&iacute;omh-ch&uacute;ram ar mo Roinn maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na Strait&eacute;ise. Beidh mise agus an tAire St&aacute;it ag obair go dian d&iacute;cheallach chun feidhm a thabhairt do na molta&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la at&aacute; sa Strait&eacute;is.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don dea-obair a rinneadh sa Teach seo chun an Strait&eacute;is a fhorbairt. T&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh dua m&oacute;r ag baint leis an obair sin.</P>
        <P>Chabhraigh s&eacute; go m&oacute;r go raibh taca&iacute;ocht ar f&aacute;il &oacute; na p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la difri&uacute;la sa Teach seo agus sa Seanad. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go leanfaidh an chomhoibri&uacute; seo idir na p&aacute;irtithe polaiti&uacute;la maidir leis an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.  Ar an dara dul s&iacute;os, t&aacute; mise an-s&aacute;sta go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht an Rialtais tugtha don Strait&eacute;is &oacute;n t&uacute;s. T&aacute; s&eacute; luaite go sonrach i gCl&aacute;r an Rialtais go nd&eacute;anfaidh an Rialtas na spriocanna ind&eacute;anta sa Strait&eacute;is a chur i bhfeidhm. T&aacute; taca&iacute;ocht an Taoisigh tugtha don Strait&eacute;is &oacute;n gc&eacute;ad l&aacute; freisin. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go spreagfaidh an dea-shampla seo taca&iacute;ocht don Strait&eacute;is i measc an phobail i gcoitinne.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Tuigimid go l&eacute;ir c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an Ghaeilge chun muid fein mar n&aacute;isi&uacute;n a chur in i&uacute;l don domhan. Go deimhin, chonaiceamar Banr&iacute;on na Breataine &Eacute;il&iacute;s II agus Uachtar&aacute;n Mheirice&aacute; Barack Obama ag &uacute;s&aacute;id c&uacute;pla focal i nGaeilge agus iad ar cuairt anseo le d&eacute;ana&iacute;.  Is<i> </i>cinnte gur f&eacute;idir linn a bheith br&oacute;d&uacute;il go bhfuil an Ghaeilge f&oacute;s beo sa Ghaeltacht agus ar fud na t&iacute;re.</P>
        <P Just="Left">T&aacute;im an-d&oacute;chasach go n-&eacute;ireoidh linn go leor a dh&eacute;anamh sna blianta amach romhainn faoin Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain in ainneoin deacrachta&iacute; airgeadais na t&iacute;re faoi l&aacute;thair. Mar Aire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, is f&eacute;idir liom a r&aacute; go mbeidh mise ag tac&uacute; a mh&eacute;id is f&eacute;idir chun an obair sin a chur chun cinn.  Ba mhaith liom anois iarraidh ar an Aire St&aacute;it l&eacute;argas n&iacute;os ioml&aacute;ine a thabhairt don Teach ar an dul chun cinn at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh maidir leis an strait&eacute;is a chur i bhfeidhm. </P>

	<P>T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith bu&iacute;och an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt sa Teach inniu maidir leis an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain don Ghaeilge.  T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och freisin don Aire, an Teachta Deenihan, as ucht an taca&iacute;ocht at&aacute; tugtha aige dom agus muid ag obair i bhfochair a ch&eacute;ile ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge agus an nGaeltacht.  Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; gur on&oacute;ir mh&oacute;r dom a bheith ceaptha mar Aire St&aacute;it sa Roinn Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta le freagracht ar leith do ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Mar dhuine de bhunadh Ghaeltacht Dh&uacute;n na nGall, is pl&eacute;isi&uacute;r m&oacute;r at&aacute; ann a bheith ag pl&eacute; mar Aire St&aacute;it leis an &aacute;bhar is gaire do mo chro&iacute;.  N&iacute;l aon cheist ach go bhfuil an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht mar an ch&eacute;ad chloch ar mo phaidr&iacute;n mar Aire St&aacute;it agus m&eacute; ag obair go tr&eacute;an, i gcomhar leis an Aire sinsearach, chun an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain a chur i gcr&iacute;ch.</P>
        <P>Mar is eol don Teach, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc ag an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain l&iacute;on na ndaoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge gach l&aacute; lasmuigh den ch&oacute;ras oideachais a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; &oacute;n bhfigi&uacute;r reatha &mdash; 83,000 duine &mdash; go 250,000 duine as seo go ceann 20 bliain.  T&aacute; s&eacute; mar sprioc freisin an l&iacute;on daoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht gach l&aacute; a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; faoi 25% sa tr&eacute;imhse ch&eacute;anna.  Is &eacute; an cur chuige faoin strait&eacute;is go mbeidh creatlach taca&iacute;ochta ann chun an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in laistigh den teaghlach agus den phobal.  Mar is eol dom go r&iacute;-mhaith, t&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht ar leith ag baint leis seo i gcomhth&eacute;acs na Gaeltachta.  Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite sa strait&eacute;is, leanann &uacute;s&aacute;id teanga as cumas sa teanga, deis an teanga sin a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus dearcadh dearfach i leith na teanga.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, t&aacute; cur chuige an Rialtais faoin strait&eacute;is d&iacute;rithe go h&aacute;irithe ar chumas an phobail sa teanga a fheabhs&uacute;, na deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;idte at&aacute; ag an bpobal a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; agus dearcadh dearfach i leith na Gaeilge a choth&uacute;.  Tugann an strait&eacute;is deis don St&aacute;t t&oacute;g&aacute;il ar an dea-thoil agus an dearcadh dearfach i leith na teanga at&aacute; neadaithe i measc an phobail go ginear&aacute;lta.  Mar a d&uacute;irt Uachtar&aacute;n St&aacute;it Aontaithe Mheirice&aacute; agus &eacute; ar cuairt chun na t&iacute;re seo i rith na seachtaine &mdash; m&aacute;s f&eacute;idir liom &eacute; a aistri&uacute; &mdash; is fearr Gaeilge bhriste n&aacute; B&eacute;arla cliste.  C&eacute; gur f&eacute;idir leis an gc&oacute;ras St&aacute;it iliomad gn&iacute;omhartha a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge, ag deireadh an lae is faoin bpobal at&aacute; s&eacute; an teanga a labhairt.  Faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain, is g&aacute; don St&aacute;t, na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge agus an phobal obair as l&aacute;mha a ch&eacute;ile ar mhaithe le buan&uacute; na teanga.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs seo, t&aacute; r&oacute;l ar leith ag p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara na Gaeilge a gcion a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le normal&uacute; na teanga sa socha&iacute; go ginear&aacute;lta agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do chaomhn&uacute; na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail agus mar theanga theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom anois tagairt don m&eacute;id at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas agus mo Roinn maidir le tosa&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don strait&eacute;is.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite go soil&eacute;ir sa chl&aacute;r Rialtais go dtabharfaidh an Rialtas taca&iacute;ocht don strait&eacute;is 20 bliain agus go nd&eacute;anfaidh an Rialtas na spriocanna ind&eacute;anta at&aacute; luaite inti a sheachadadh.  &Oacute;n uair gur th&aacute;inig an Rialtas seo i gcumhacht, chinn an Taoiseach, an Teachta &Eacute;anna &Oacute; Coinnigh, an coiste Rialtais faoin nGaeilge agus faoin nGaeltacht a athbhun&uacute; faoina chathaoirleacht f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; chruinni&uacute; den choiste tion&oacute;lta aige go dt&iacute; seo, ceann i m&iacute; Aibre&aacute;in agus ceann an tseachtain seo caite.  Is d&oacute;igh liom go l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo tiomantas an Taoisigh don Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil s&eacute; toilteanach agus &aacute;balta am suntasach a chur ar leataobh sa sceideal gn&oacute;thach at&aacute; aige chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar chur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise, in ainneoin an iliomad &eacute;ileamh eile at&aacute; ar a chuid ama.  Is l&eacute;iri&uacute; &eacute; freisin ar thiomantas an Taoisigh i leith na Gaeilge go bhfuil cinneadh t&oacute;gtha aige go mbeidh an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain faoi sti&uacute;ir an Aire Eala&iacute;on, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta agus m&eacute; f&eacute;in, mar Aire St&aacute;it le c&uacute;ram ar leith do ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.</P>

Ar nd&oacute;igh, mar dhuine de bhunadh na Gaeltachta, t&aacute; taith&iacute; phearsanta agam f&eacute;in ar mheath na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht le tamall de bhlianta anuas.

D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, teasta&iacute;onn &oacute;n Rialtas gn&iacute;omh f&oacute;nta a dh&eacute;anamh faoin strait&eacute;is 20 bliain chun todhcha&iacute; na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht a shl&aacute;n&uacute; i gcomhar leis an bpobal ar an talamh gur leo an teanga.

I bhfianaise an taighde faoin staid&eacute;ar teangeola&iacute;ochta, bheinn b&aacute;&uacute;il don choincheap go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; for&aacute;il faoi Bhille Gaeltachta nua do shainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; reacht&uacute;il ar an nGaeltacht a bheadh bunaithe feasta ar chrit&eacute;ir theangeola&iacute;ocha, le hais an tsainmh&iacute;nithe mar a sheasann s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair at&aacute; bunaithe ar limist&eacute;ir shonracha gheografacha.

	<P>I am one of those who went through the education system with Irish as a compulsory examination subject, even going to the Gaeltacht on several occasions.  While I have the c&uacute;pla focail, I can only just about follow a conversation in Irish and cannot hold one in it.  Yet, I feel I have made a contribution towards the revival of the language by sending both my children to a gaelscoil.</P><Col N="536"/>
        <P>In the early days of the gaelscoileanna, there was great resistance to recognising many of the schools.  The quality of the classrooms was of a much poorer standard than those I was educated in decades earlier.  The revival of the language and the large increase in those speaking it has not come from the Gaeltacht but from urban areas.  The phenomenon was almost an anti-establishment revival, rather than a product of the establishment towards the development of the language.  I recall seeing children outside my children&rsquo;s gaelscoil gates have their little arguments through Irish.  It came naturally to them as the command language in the school was Irish.  In many ways, it was a language revival rather than a cultural revival.</P>
        <P>I was a member of my children&rsquo;s school&rsquo;s parent committee.  While the majority of members spoke Irish and, despite the fact most meetings were conducted through Irish, they made sure I was included because I was reflective of so many others in the school.  There was an absence of elitism.  While there was a cultural dimension in the school such as Irish dancing and Gaelic games, the culture in the school remained urban.  Great effort was made to translate appropriate text books and reading material for use in the school, which were not readily available, an example of the resistance to these schools.</P>
        <P>If we are to grow the language, we cannot be elitist about it.  We have a Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, but none with the sole or co-ordinating responsibility for language revival.  It is somewhat paradoxical that there is no equality of treatment.  The remit of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, is to promote the social, physical and economic development of the Gaeltacht areas and to strengthen Irish as the principal language in the Gaeltacht, in particular in terms of passing it on from one generation to the next.  The Department seeks to achieve these objectives through its own programmes and schemes and the bodies under its aegis.  The key underlying objective of Government policy in this regard is to maintain the primacy of the Irish language and its related culture in the Gaeltacht.  However, in being exclusive in regard to where the language is protected, we give greater emphasis to rural culture and ignore new avenues for revival of the language.  I am not against holding on to what we have in Gaeltacht areas because it is unique.  However, this approach is, in my opinion, exclusive.  Development of the language needs to be inclusive.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the day when Irish at leaving certificate level is taken by choice rather than compulsion.  I am not in favour of Irish not being a compulsory subject because I believe that if it is not compulsory, many students will drop it.  However, this could be considered as an interim or short-term measure.  The culture in terms of how Irish is taught is important.  One cannot exclude urban people from that culture, which is very often the case.  Many people who want to see a revival of the language are not particularly interested in Irish dancing or Gaelic games, which is fine.  I watch Spanish football through the medium of Irish and it is quite entertaining.  There are some people who believe Irish has to encompass all things or nothing.  This creates a resistance in some people, which is not in the interests of the continued revival of the language.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s remit needs to be much wider than Gaeltacht affairs.  It should include a co-ordinating function for the development of the Irish language.  While the Department of Education and Skills has a role in relation to Irish schools and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a role in relation to broadcasting, there is no co-ordination between these Departments.  Also, I do not believe this issue is being driven at Cabinet level.</P>
        <P>There are a number of reasons people who have been through the primary and secondary education systems lose their Irish, including a lack of opportunity to speak it, the need to use it, the manner in which it was taught and its relevance or irrelevance.  We must examine the curriculum from this perspective.  I was fortunate enough to get a response today to a <Col N="537"/>parliamentary question I submitted only this morning in relation to the 1996 and 2006 census.  In 2006, some 235,000 more people than in 1996 could speak Irish, which is positive.  Some 12,000 of those people live in the Gaeltacht and 223,000 do not.  We must look at where we are going to grow the language in terms of numbers.</P>
        <P>I do not have a difficulty with the Gaeltacht being viewed as a unique area that needs to be protected.  However, we must be much more inclusive and this needs to happen at Cabinet level.</P>

	<P>Some people might think this a less important issue than our banking debt, health service and so on.  However, I believe it is equally important.  It is the essence of who we are.  If, as some people have predicted, the Irish language dies out, we will have to hang our heads in shame.  We have so many things for which to hang our heads in shame these days that were we to hang them any more they would break.</P>
        <P>In my experience, and that of my friends and school mates, learning the Irish language was the highest form of torture known to humankind.  Although at school my class was not the &ldquo;smart class&rdquo; we were expected, despite not knowing what &ldquo;N&iacute; thuigim&rdquo; meant, to speak in Irish about the symbolism of An Droimeann Donn D&iacute;l&iacute;s, My Faithful Brown Cow.  We did not even know how to ask for a loaf of bread in Irish, yet we were learning about the symbolism of My Faithful Brown Cow.  Many people I know, who are good communicators, would have difficulty describing in written form the symbolism of My Faithful Brown Cow, yet we, who did not know what &ldquo;N&iacute; thuigim&rdquo; meant, were expected to do so.  The only policy then was that Irish be made compulsory.  However, just because something is compulsory does not mean one will be good at it.  If it was made compulsory in the morning that everyone in this country should run 100 metres in less than ten seconds, that would not happen.  To be able to do that would require people to be properly trained or, perhaps, genetically modified.  Making something compulsory will not make it happen.</P>
        <P>When I left school I despised the Irish language with a passion.  The only time I enjoyed Irish was when I had to speak it for my oral examination.  It was the first time I ever spoke Irish.  During that examination I was asked who I thought was the best golfer in the world to which I replied Ignatius Hayden, a man who played at Castlerea golf course.  The interviewer laughed and told me she had asked not who was the best golfer in Castlerea but who was the best golfer in the world.  However, when I left the examination, which I thought was fun, I regretted I had not learned how to speak Irish.  I decided then that although I had failed to do so, I would, if I had children, ensure they did not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was told that one of the main reasons people did not like the Irish language was because of a negative attitude.  While I am a little concerned I might be teaching my children incorrect Irish, I try my best.  I use phrases like &ldquo;L&eacute;im isteach sa charr&rdquo; and &ldquo;gabh i leith&rdquo;.  My children love the Irish language &mdash; at least they did so until they turned eight years of age.  Two years ago, when I asked my then six year old daughter and her classmates what they thought of Irish they said they loved it.  My now eight year old daughter recently told me when I asked her what she thinks of Irish that she hates it, that it is boring and irrelevant and that all her classmates think the same.  What has changed?  They have moved on from having a bit of craic in Irish, playing bingo and other games.  They now have to write it and their hands are getting sore and they find it boring and irrelevant.  I accept that some subjects require hard grafting.  However, we are speaking here about a language, which is about communicating and having fun expressing oneself.  Why can Irish not always be taught as it is when children are six years old?  Other strands could be set up to cater for those wanting to express the symbolism of My Faithful Brown Cow.</P>
        <P>Prior to being elected to Government, Fine Gael had a fantastic idea when it elected my constituency colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, as their spokesman on Irish.  While Deputy <Col N="538"/>Feighan got a lot of ribbing for not being fluent in Irish &mdash; he may be now &mdash; I believe that was a great idea.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like me, Deputy Feighan would have a good understanding of how not to teach Irish.  If one knows how not to teach it, then one at least has some idea of how to teach it.  From the perspective of most people not having a clue about Irish, this was a good idea.  The Deputy could have learned the language along with the public and we could have progressed together.</P>
        <P>There is hope for the Irish language if it is approached in the right way.  I think Des Bishop has done more for the Irish language than any politician.  I do not say that to run down politicians.  I have a few ideas on what could be done.  I exchange texts with one of my friends solely in Irish.  I do not have the n&aacute;ire or the embarrassment of making a fool of myself, as I might in spoken Irish, of getting it wrong and not communicating properly.  There is a translation dictionary and before I reply to a text, I can get all the words perfectly.  For the past year we have communicated like this and it works.  Someone who did not know how to say &ldquo;n&iacute; thuigim&rdquo; in the Irish language can now communicate through text messaging.  I suggest, perhaps for seachtain na Gaeilge, that people text in Irish for a whole week.  Perhaps for one day of the year we could have a text-in-Irish day.  That would make using Irish cool and trendy.  It is something young people absolutely and utterly love doing.  There is hope for the Irish language if we take the issue seriously.  The way around the problem is to make it relevant and interesting for people and tie in technology.  TG4 is a massive help.  My daughters can watch cartoons in Irish.  The language is relevant and real and that is how we will save it.</P>
        <P>I hope the next generation of Members of the Oireachtas will not need headphones.  I do not use them much of the time, even though I do not completely understand what people are saying, because that forces me into trying to understand them.  If I used headphones, I would become lazy.  Today as I had to understand everything that was being said, I wore them.  I probably understood more, but I did not learn much about Irish by listening to the English translation.</P>
        <P>There is hope for the Irish language and if we go down the right road, we can save it.  We can be proud that we did not abandon or destroy it.</P>

        <P>I welcome this debate on the Irish language and the 20 year strategy which is the way forward for the hundreds of thousands of people, like myself, who spent up to 13 years in school without a huge love of the language.  We have now grown up and see the language and all its traditions as a way forward.  We are more confident about how we speak it.  It is not the property of those who speak it on a daily basis or teachers and academics.  It is about generating a renewed interest.  It is open to everyone on the island of Ireland to embrace our culture, history and language.</P>
        <P>I enjoyed working closely with Coimisi&uacute;n na Gaeilge and Conradh na Gaeilge, visiting gaelscoileanna and various groups around the country.  One group in Kilrush springs to mind, where middle aged people from many different countries came to have tea in the evening and discuss various daily matters through the medium of Irish.  There is a huge and fertile ground for people who have overcome their fears of not being able to speak the Irish language with proficiency.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>Let us be honest, we cannot speak the English language very well yet we beat ourselves around the head in trying to speak Irish.  If we get it wrong or make one or two mistakes, so what?  There are people who do not represent the best of the Irish language.  They are an elite, which perhaps includes some of those who wrote a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>, stating they were very disappointed about my appointment.  I know that 99% of those who represent the Irish language and whom I have met do not share that view.  I want to put on the record of the House that the trust and support I received was second to none.</P>

	<P Just="Left">T&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;or bhu&iacute;och as an seans seo caint ar an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Mar Theachta D&aacute;la nua &oacute; Ghaeltacht Chonamara agus &oacute; dh&aacute;ilcheantar Gaillimh Thiar, t&aacute; a fhios agam c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; an teanga n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta.

C&eacute;n caighde&aacute;n a bheidh ar an teanga i gceann 20 bliain eile?  I gConamara, t&aacute; Gaeltacht l&aacute;idir ann &oacute; na Forbacha go dt&iacute; Carna agus t&aacute; Gaeilge freisin i mBearna, i mo cheantar f&eacute;in i Maigh Chuilinn, Corr na M&oacute;na agus &aacute;iteanna eile.  T&aacute; an-bhr&uacute; ar an teanga sna h&aacute;iteanna in aice le cathair na Gaillimhe de r&eacute;ir an m&eacute;id tithe a t&oacute;gadh ar feadh na mblianta.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the commitment in the programme for Government to support the 20-year strategy for the Irish language which was introduced last year.  As outlined, the vision is to ensure that Irish is a living language, spoken, used and cherished in communities across Ireland.  By virtue of our Constitution, Irish is the first official language.  It is illuminating to note that it is the oldest spoken literary language in Europe.  It was long overdue, therefore, when, in 2007, the language was afforded official and working language status in the European Union.</P>
        <P>The 20-year strategy calls for a continuation of a senior ministry and a Department with central responsibility for Irish.  The new Government has retained this practice by appointing as Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, and as Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, who has special responsibility for the Gaeltacht.  I congratulate Deputy McGinley on his appointment, which was a very popular choice.  He has a long record as Fine Gael spokesperson, and has the most wonderful language and voice which encourage people to listen and to speak the language.</P>
        <P>The strategy also proposes to establish an &uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge and na Gaeltachta, which should be headquartered in a Gaeltacht area and have powers to carry out functions in regard to Gaeltacht policy.  It is envisaged that this &uacute;dar&aacute;s will have a significant enterprise function <Col N="542"/>which complements the Government&rsquo;s determination to ensure that Gaeltacht areas benefit from the recent jobs initiative.</P>
        <P>I note in the strategy the emphasis based on normalisation or, in other words, the steps taken to secure the social position of Irish through a campaign of awareness, positive attitudes and greater natural use of Irish in everyday routing tasks and communication.  It is a sad fact, as other speakers mentioned, that many people have been put off the language through poor educational experience and, for want of a better phrase, a certain literary snobbery.  This is where a person&rsquo;s efforts to engage in and use the language are met, not with encouragement but with criticisms about grammar or pronunciation.  We all lived through the m&oacute;dh conn&iacute;ollach, what it means and its place in schools.  It is off-putting.  The school experience of many people is that once they put down the pen after the second leaving certificate Irish paper they do not take it up again to write any other word of Irish.  Very often they do not speak any Irish either, except perhaps in a small capacity.  People often say when they go abroad and do not want anyone to know what they are talking about they might use Irish.  Other than that, the use of spoken Irish is fairly poor throughout the country, which is unfortunate.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we move away from this to a position where encouragement is the key.  Such a shift has been occurring, helped enormously by the creation of TG4 with its new generation of Gaeilgeoir&iacute; role models and ambassadors for the language as well as by the continuing role of Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta in promoting the language throughout the State.</P>
        <P>We cannot talk about the strategy without reference to Irish and its place in the educational system.  Prior to the election there was a certain amount of concern regarding the policy on compulsory Irish for the leaving certificate.  I took a great deal of flak because I took a stand on this.  I used to be a half-decent student of Irish in respect of the intermediate certificate, or whatever, and got an honour in honours Irish at the time.  However, when one finishes the leaving certificate one tends to drift away.</P>
        <P>We need to change the emphasis in the teaching of Irish.  There will be a change to the curriculum in that 40% of marks will go for oral assessment and this Government plans to increase that figure to 50%.  I believe conversational Irish is the key to the survival of the language and that there should be two subjects in the leaving certificate, one being Irish as it stands, the other, which would be compulsory, being conversational Irish.  In this way every student would be required to become involved and speak the living language, without being concerned about grammar, etc.</P>
        <P>There are other issues we must face.  Gaelscoileanna are extremely popular but there are many such as the school in Oranmore which has endured prefabs for many years  We need to address aspects of that kind if we are to be serious about the language.  We must also examine measures such as occur in my own area of Connemara where students from English speaking areas are bussed to a Gaeltacht area to attend leaving certificate classes in secondary schools where they do all subjects with increased emphasis on Irish.  That should be promoted and encouraged as the kind of way we should promote the Gaeltacht.</P>
        <P>The United Nations reported that half of the world&rsquo;s 6,700 languages spoken today are in danger of disappearing.  I hope this Government, working in conjunction with the 20-year strategy, will ensure that Irish is stronger in 20 years&rsquo; time than it is today.</P>

N&iacute; cainteo&iacute;r &oacute; dh&uacute;chas m&eacute; ach t&aacute; gr&aacute; faoi leith agam don teanga.  Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an Teachta Adams agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute; againn an t-&aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute; sa D&aacute;il.  I am not a native speaker but I have an interest faoi leith in this topic.  I welcome it and thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in the debate today.</P>
        <P>I represent a constituency which has a Gaeltacht area, Cape Clear in south-west Cork.  If the momentous events of the past week were to bring anything home to us it is the importance of our Irishness.  We all shared pride when our distinguished visitors made utterances as Gaeilge.  Our pride levels reached a new high when we heard them speak in our native tongue.</P>
        <P>In an era of increased co-operation across states, especially in the European Union where there are ever fewer boundaries and more common denominators, currencies and laws applied across the member states, there are ever increasing challenges to our identity as a State.  Our culture and heritage are more under threat.  As there are fewer and fewer distinguishing factors separating countries the threat to our identity has never been greater.  We need to assert our own national identity and one way to do this is with a vibrant, strong and proud language of which we can all avail and make use.</P>
        <P>In my background as a teacher I had the pleasure, or whatever one might term it, of teaching from junior infants to sixth year at both primary and secondary level.  I taught Irish as a language to students at every level along the way.  The teaching of the language is the single greatest challenge to the survival of this language.  In this country, unfortunately, our approach is to teach children to read, spell and write the language before we teach them to speak it.  It is a simple anomaly but for generations it has caused mayhem to the successful teaching of Irish.  We come at it from a reverse point of view because, of course, we should teach our children to speak first and foremost before concentrating on aspects such as spelling, grammar, verbs and all the different aspects we emphasise.  I would like to see that very simple step being taken.  I believe it is coming in gradually and recognition is dawning over time but we need to work more diligently towards that position.</P>
        <P>Apart from the anomalies I mentioned in the teaching of the language I consider compulsion to be the great enemy of the Irish language.  It did not matter who said it, or which leader of which party brought it about but as it happened it was the leader of Fine Gael, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who first proposed getting rid of compulsion for the Irish language.  I cannot agree more.  It was the most welcome step I heard mentioned in the debate on the Irish language as long as I have been discussing it, even before my college days.</P>
        <P>It is time we set the language free.  In this modern day and age Irish is the only compulsory subject on the leaving certificate syllabus.  Typically, 17 is the age of students who have completed transition year and are heading into fifth year.  In this State we allow 17 year olds to drive a car on the roads if they have a licence but we do not allow them the freedom to choose whether they wish to study Irish.  Any teacher, without exception, who has taught in a fifth year or leaving certificate classroom could tell of the hatred and animosity towards the Irish language that may build up by forcing students at that stage of life to study Irish against their will.  This makes it difficult and challenging for the teacher who is trying to foster an environment of genuine passion and love for the language.</P>
        <P>We must set the language free and move away from the compulsory element.  We should realise that we are a grown-up State and that there are more than enough students who are keen to learn the language, who enjoy studying the language and who relish the challenge presented by learning our language and keeping it alive.  There is no need to force anyone of 17 years of age in the school system to do anything relating to Irish.</P><Col N="544"/>
        <P>Contrary to what some fanatical elements of the pro-Gaeilge lobby might suggest &mdash; I have encountered many of them during this debate and earlier a speaker referred to writing letters to <i>The Irish Times</i> &mdash; the proposals suggested by the Taoiseach do not suggest banning the language.  However, it is noteworthy that the time in our history when our language flourished most was when the language was banned.  However, I do not propose or support this.  Rather, I prefer to encourage the freedom to choose and to encourage by rewards and points, thus providing the incentive to take Gaeilge to leaving certificate level.</P>

An important issue regarding the future of the Irish language is that it could be perceived to be the pursuit of the middle classes.  I refer to those who have resources available to send their children to the Gaeltacht in the summer or to purchase grinds.  I refer to those who live in areas that have gaelscoileanna, which unfortunately in some cases have managed to attract parents who, to be blunt, are suffering from a case of white fright and are using the Irish language as a means of having their children in a monocultural setting in school.  This issue has arisen in certain parts of this city and country.</P>
        <P>Having taught in an area of disadvantage for the past 11 years, I have come across many wonderful children who would make wonderful teachers.  However, the Irish language is becoming a barrier to them becoming teachers because of the insistence of the Department of Education and Skills or, more importantly of the third level institutions, that is, the teacher training colleges, that one must have an honour in Irish in the leaving certificate examination to become a primary school teacher.  There is no reason to exclude any student who shows ability or creativity or who wishes to become a primary teacher, having acquired the requisite points and having been identified as someone who would be an excellent teacher at either primary or secondary level but the former in particular.  There is no reason we cannot find a mechanism by which such people could enter into third level teaching colleges and acquire their Irish language qualification whilst there.  I conclude by making a point about which I feel strongly, namely, that if the Irish language is being used as a mechanism to prevent those from certain backgrounds to advance their education, become teachers or to change the way in which education is delivered in schools, it then is becoming destructive in the education system.</P>

        <P>One of the great simultaneous bilingual speakers to whom I really enjoy listening is Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh.  During the warm-up to President Obama&rsquo;s arrival at College Green, he introduced six sports people of Ireland who are at the top of their game, to use that phrase.  While so doing, he moved seamlessly from English to Irish and back again with the mellifluous music of an anam gaeilgeoir and it was fantastic.  Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan evoked once again for me what it is all about.  Language is what it says; it is using the tongue, making sounds with it, having fun with it.  &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; exploded on to the stage for the entertainment of this country and the world at that Eurovision contest and has never lost its allure and sparkle.  It brought Queen Elizabeth down from the viewing ranks of the convention centre and on to the stage because she was thrilled, I would say, literally, by that experience.  Our language can do <Col N="548"/>the same but we must unclutter it from the algebra of grammar and all that stuff.  Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan described his eight-year old becoming a ten-year old and suddenly the language was boring.  Let us bring some fun back into the textbooks by introducing quizzes and by cross-blending the learning with sport.  &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; is the badge of the expression, dance and music-wise, of the Gaelic language and tradition.  Imagine having the &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; troupe at the Aviva stadium as the warm-up event for one of the big matches and some Irish language used in the signage.  This would express in 21st century terms what it is we love about our language.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment which is to do with the smooth running of secondary schools.  We all acknowledge the difficult economic times for the country and the moratorium on appointments.  However, when these measures were introduced some years ago it was found that they had an <Col N="549"/>effect on the functioning of schools with regard to the appointment of assistant principal teachers or &ldquo;A&rdquo; posts.  The Government at the time introduced alleviation measures.  For instance, a school with a normal complement of eight assistant post holders was reduced to a complement of four or whatever.  Without notice, the previous Government withdrew these alleviation measures in a particular school.  The functions of these post holders include year head teachers who oversee a year class, are in charge of pastoral care and examinations.  A reduction in the number of posts is understandable in the economic circumstances but what has happened in some schools is that with the retirement of teachers, schools are left without any assistant post holders to help run the school.  The only management person is the principal of the school.</P>
        <P>Many schools have contacted me on the issue but I refer to Mount St. Michael school in Claremorris in my constituency.  According to the alleviation measures as this school had between 400 and 500 pupils it would have been originally entitled to eight posts but this has been reduced to four by the cutbacks.  A teacher retired on 31 December 2010.  Because of the alleviation measures the principal was under the impression that the school would be entitled to replace the post.  The first indication of the change was in a letter from the Department which stated that the alleviation measures had been withdrawn and therefore sanction for the fourth appointment could not be granted.  Schools need a minimum number of post holders.  Teachers do much extra voluntary work in schools such as training teams or extra-curricular activities such as debating.  These posts are needed so that the school can function efficiently.  Some schools are at breaking point as a result of the cutbacks.</P>
        <P>This Government had neither hand, act nor part in taking away the alleviation measures as this was done by the previous Government.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the situation.  Whole school evaluation inspections cost thousands of euro and they are necessary.  However, in the case of some schools, the whole school evaluation report will state that they are not fulfilling the policies stipulated by the Department.  The reason is that they cannot carry out these policies because the appointments have not been sanctioned.  I appeal to the Minister to examine this situation to see if there is a way to alleviate it.  I have referred to the school in question in Claremorris with the full agreement of the school in order to illustrate the point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, the Minister for Education and Skills who regrets he is unable to be present today.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it affords me the opportunity to outline the position with regard to the issue of posts of responsibility in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>When the moratorium was introduced, the Government exempted principal and deputy principal posts in all secondary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner.  The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the director of adult education, assistant principal and special duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion.  Vacancies at this level arise due to retirements in the specific grades and typically also from the knock-on effect of filling principal and deputy principal posts.  Some further limited alleviation was introduced for post-primary schools most acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium and these alleviation arrangements are set out in Circular 42/2010.  This provided some delegated sanction for post-primary schools to fill assistant principal vacancies if they fall below certain minimum thresholds.</P>
        <P>Most of the limited alleviation focused at director of adult education and assistant principal level.  I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in post-primary schools and the limited alleviation measures were aimed at helping those schools that have been significantly impacted by the moratorium.  It is a matter <Col N="550"/>for each school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for holders of posts of responsibility in the context of implementing the moratorium.  Given the current budgetary position there is a public service-wide challenge about how to deliver public services with a reduced level of resources.</P>
        <P>The Department will liaise with the Department of Finance regarding a limited alleviation of the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility for the 2011-12 school year.</P>
        <P>This Government will endeavour to protect front-line education services as best as possible.  However, this must be done within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country.  The challenge will be to ensure the resources being provided are used to maximum effect to achieve the best possible outcomes for pupils.  I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony for raising this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The loss of 250 English language teachers from September is double the cut that schools had expected and the Minister needs to explain how he can implement these measures which will impact on an education system that is already failing the literacy needs of many of its children.  The extent of the cut came as a surprise to many in the education system as it is double the reduction expected.  It is a decision that will have the most profound impact on primary schools.  The timing of the announcement last Friday was clearly an attempt to bury bad news when the media focus was on the visit of the English Queen, President Obama and the death of a former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald.</P>
        <P>At present, 1,400 posts are dedicated to supporting children whose English is weak and 80% of these posts are in the primary sector.  The loss of 250 posts represents a cut of 18% to the number of language support teachers currently working in the system.</P>
        <P>How can any Minister for Education and Skills justify cutting of 250 English language teachers when just last year an OECD report found a dramatic fall in literacy standards in Irish schools across this State?  Has the Minister and his Department considered the impact this decision will have on children from international backgrounds who cannot speak English or whose English is too weak to enable them to thrive in the classroom?  It also affects other children within the classroom.  For example, I am aware of a school in my area where at one stage 50 countries were represented in that school.  The reduction will create major problems in the school.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the Labour Party&rsquo;s &ldquo;Plan for Fairness in Education&rdquo; pledged to reintroduce up to 250 teaching posts of the 1,200 posts being taken out of the system under the four year plan proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I challenge the Minister to explain how he can implement these cuts after making this commitment, while accepting the difficult situation in respect of finances.  The Minister does have an envelope and it is up to him how he spends it.  I do not think this is the correct approach to move forward.</P>
        <P>The Irish National Teachers Organisation rightly pointed out that these cuts by a Labour Minister are yet another attack on disadvantaged and marginalised children.  It raises serious questions about the Government which claims it is committed to improving literacy standards in schools yet it cuts vital resources needed to achieve these aims.</P>
        <P>Many of the children are in schools in areas which are deemed disadvantaged, areas where their parents can get rented accommodation.  The cut does not affect many of the middle class areas but it is a further attack on the disadvantaged children, particularly the cuts in SNAs and the Traveller education support service.  The cut is a double whammy for many of those schools and will seriously affect outputs and the proper running of those schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who unfortunately cannot be present.</P>
        <P>As was recently announced, the numbers of students staying in the education system as a whole will be significantly higher than expected in the 2011-12 school year.  The increase meets the objective of this Government to reduce the incidence of early school leaving nationally.</P>
        <P>However, this also raises a challenge for us, as approximately 160 additional mainstream teachers are required, primarily to facilitate these additional numbers.  In view of the restrictions on numbers employed in the public service imposed by the employment control framework, it is not possible for us to simply recruit more teachers.  This is a reality within which we all have to operate.</P>
        <P>At present there are about 1,125 language support posts in primary schools and 275 such posts at second level.  These 1,400 posts are in addition to mainstream classroom teachers.  They allow schools to withdraw pupils for varying amounts of time to concentrate on the teaching of English.</P>
        <P>The previous Government announced that this number would be reduced by 125 from September, and by the same amount annually over the next three years.  In other words a reduction of 500 posts over four years.  Regrettably, we have now had to take a decision to speed up this process.</P>
        <P>The result is that the number of language support teachers will be reduced by a further 125 posts from this September, leading to a total reduction of 250 posts this year.  This will impact in two main ways.  First, schools where less than 25% of pupils need language support will limit that support to two years.  This change will affect about 2,500 students, all of whom have already received two years support.  Second, schools that missed the deadline for applications of 5 May will not be told until the autumn what support, if any, they will get.  In previous years, applications have been permitted all year round but this year it will be very difficult to meet demand from any applications received after the deadline of which all schools were notified.</P>
        <P>The change will have little or no impact on schools with high concentrations of pupils in need of language support, that is, greater than 25%.  A reduced number of positions will also be made available to the primary staffing appeals board for some additional language support posts.  These positions will be reserved for schools with more than 25% of their students in need of language support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RobertTroy"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Troy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for facilitating my request to raise this matter.  This is a matter I have submitted on a number of occasions with a view to bringing it to the floor of this House.  It is an important issue for me but it is much more important to the people of Multyfarnham and Milltownpass.  Both community groups are extremely hardworking and have put many hours of voluntary work into these projects.  The projects have received the unanimous support of Westmeath Community Development, of which I was a board member.  I had the pleasure of proposing one project and seconding the other.  The projects received unanimous support at Westmeath County Development Board level in January 2011.  We referred them to the Department and were advised it would take, at best, six months before we would have a response.  Four months on the deliberations are still going on.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Perhaps I can give the background on both community projects.  Planning permission was received for the Milltownpass project in October 2010 and funding was sought from Westmeath <Col N="552"/>Community Development.  Millltownpass community group has worked for the past 20 years to bring about a communal facility for this much expanded village.  There were various difficulties such as land disputes, a change in the village plan, and a zoning change.  However, it now has a piece of land, a project for which planning permission has been received and 25% of its resources in place.  Milltownpass needs this community building which will be used by the local schools, the young at heart, the ICA, keep fit, active retirement groups as well as many other community groups.</P>
        <P>Multyfarnham is a village close to my home.  Last week the President visited the village where she opened a new cancer care centre.  In 2008 the village won a national pride of place award.  In recent years this community group developed a park, a playground and a football pitch through voluntary work and communal effort.</P>
        <P>The two projects will cost approximately &euro;900,000, which in bad times is a good deal of money to have circulating in the local community.   Apart from the social benefits they will deliver to the local area, the projects will generate economic benefits and employment, including during the construction phase of the two facilities.</P>
        <P>We are not seeking fresh money to pay for the projects as money has been committed and Westmeath Community Development Limited has a budget of &euro;7.5 million.  The Government cannot blame the previous Government, as it has done in respect of every other issue, because funding has been allocated.  I call on the Department to remove the red tape and complete its deliberations.  Both of the community groups in question have responded to every request from the Department for information.</P>
        <P>I know from first-hand experience that the community groups in question are dedicated and of a high calibre.  They have proved that they are not fly-by-night groups, having worked on the relevant projects for many years.  I ask the Minister of State to request that the relevant Minister intervene to determine what is delaying a decision.  We were informed it would take four to six weeks to complete deliberations.  We have now been waiting for almost five months.  What is causing the delay?</P>
        <P>As I stated, &euro;7.5 million has been allocated and fresh money is not required.  Let us spend this money and support community groups whose members are putting in long hours on a voluntary basis.  The Government&rsquo;s jobs initiative was launched to great fanfare two weeks ago.  The project in question would immediately create dozens of jobs in this rural community.  I ask the Minister of State to contact the relevant Minister to ensure a decision is taken and communicated without further delay to the community groups in question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I thank Deputy Troy for raising the matter.</P>
        <P>Axes 3 and 4 of the Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013, which are known as the Leader axes, provide substantial support for the diversification of the rural economy and activities to enhance the quality of life in rural Ireland.  The rural development programme is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities, including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation, improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources.  It is critical for all areas, both rural and urban, to ensure the maintenance of vibrant communities not only for the people living in such communities, but also to create attractive environments where people want to live and work and where enterprise initiatives can thrive.</P><Col N="553"/>
        <P>The rural development programme will see the investment of &euro;427 million in rural areas over its lifetime.  In keeping with the bottom up philosophy of the Leader methodology, the local action groups delivering the programme on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are the principal decision makers on the allocation of project funding.  In general, an overall ceiling of &euro;150,000 grant aid per project applies to projects under the Leader axes of the programme.  In certain circumstances local action groups may award grant aid in excess of &euro;150,000 where they secure the approval of the Department to do so.  It is in this context that the Department is examining the projects to which the Deputy referred.</P>
        <P>Given the level of funding involved and the need, in our current economic climate, to ensure value for money for every cent spent, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a full and detailed assessment of such projects is vital.  It must also be remembered that the Leader activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 55% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded.</P>
        <P>The assessment of projects usually involves detailed consultations with the relevant local action group.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications and may in some instances result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.  These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way.</P>
        <P>Regarding the projects referred to by the Deputy, a number of issues had to be considered internally by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and subsequently queries were raised with the local action group.  I assure the Deputy that when all of the required information has been received, a decision will be made on the projects without delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Amnesty International for its interest in mental health and the programmes, documents and advice it recently provided in its briefing pack for Members of the Oireachtas, which is extremely helpful and well written.  The organisation will be 50 years old on Saturday, on which I congratulate it and thank it for the work it has done throughout the world.  It has been of great assistance to me and other Members of the Oireachtas who believe mental health is a human rights issue.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments have called for fundamental reform of the mental health system.  The Planning for the Future report published in 1984 was followed in 2006 by the expert report, A Vision for Change.  However, progress on implementing reforms has been painfully slow.  A Vision for Change set out a policy framework for the mental health of the whole population.  In addition to recognising the importance of mental health promotion and primary care, it called for a person-centred, recovery orientated and holistic approach to mental health services.  It also called for a shift from the current system, which is excessively reliant on institutional care and medication, to a system centred on community-based care provided by multidisciplinary mental health teams.  These teams would include psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists and service users who would work alongside psychiatrists, mental health nurses, psychotherapists and counsellors.  Such services allow people with mental health problems access to the services and supports they choose while continuing to live and participate in their community, as is their right.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>Ireland is more reliant on institutional mental health care than any other country in Europe.  While there are examples of good practice in certain areas, notably County Monaghan, implementation of the plan to which I referred has been inadequate overall.  Services remain widely deficient with few complete multidisciplinary mental health teams in place and limited access to community care for the full range of psychological supports that should be part of a modern mental health service.</P>
        <P>In 2009, only one in five staff in the mental health service was working in a community setting.  Inpatient facilities remain completely unsuitable, with 15 of the 63 approved inpatient centres dating from the Victorian era or earlier.  The Inspector of Mental Health Services has described some of these facilities as entirely unacceptable and inhumane.  The position in respect of older people and people with intellectual disabilities is even worse as specialist mental health services in these areas are almost non-existent.</P>
        <P>Non-capital expenditure on mental health services was cut radically from &euro;1.1 billion in 2008 to &euro;770 million in 2009.  These cuts continue an historical trend in which expenditure on mental health services declined from 13% of the overall health budget in 1986 to only 5.3% in 2010.  A Vision for Change recommends that 8.4% of health expenditure should be allocated to improving mental health services.  The public sector staffing moratorium has also disproportionately impacted on mental health services which account for just 9% of the health care workforce but for 20% of the 1,500 posts lost as a result of the moratorium last year.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a welcome commitment to establish a cross-departmental group to ensure good mental health will be a policy goal across Departments.  In addition, under the programme a sum of &euro;35 million will be allocated each year, which will be ring-fenced to introduce the reforms outlined in A Vision for Change.  This sum has been ring-fenced because when the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, allocated funding, it was hived off for other purposes.  During the two-year period 2007 and 2008 some &euro;50 million was allocated but only &euro;27 million was spent on what the then Minister wanted the money for.  In 2009, when I asked her if she was going to allocate further funds for that purpose, her reply at a D&aacute;il committee was: &ldquo;Why should I give it to them when they are not going to spend it on what I want them to spend it on?&rdquo;  That has shades of the fair deal scheme.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The commitment given needs to be implemented as a priority by the Government in order that it can build on the good work already done by the Office for Disability and Mental Health which has a cross-departmental remit.  The group should include representatives from the following Departments: Health and Children; Education and Skills; Social Protection; Justice and Equality; Defence; the Environment, Community and Local Government; Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht; and public expenditure and reform.  The group should outline how responsible Departments will progress the social inclusion recommendations made in A Vision for Change, as well as reporting publicly on progress.  It should also ensure mental health issues are adequately reflected in the work of other Government structures such as the national disability strategy and the Office for Social Inclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter of the implementation of A Vision for Change on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The Government has prioritised reform of the mental health service in line with A Vision for Change and is committed to reforming our model of health care delivery in order that more and better quality care services are delivered in the community.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is committed to this model.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for <Col N="555"/>primary care, I subscribe to the principle of moving services, to the greatest extent possible, from the institutional setting to the community.</P>
        <P>It is the intention that over time access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved.  It is proposed to ring-fence a sum of &euro;35 million annually within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services both for adults and children.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is working with officials in the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to achieve further progress in this regard.</P>
        <P>In 2006 A Vision for Change was universally welcomed as a progressive, evidence-based and realistic document which proposed a new model of service delivery that would be patient-centred, flexible and community-based.  Progress on implementation has been slower than anticipated when the report was launched.  However, it is also important to recognise and acknowledge that in many parts of the country services are pressing ahead with implementation of A Vision for Change.  Progress to date includes: a 17% decline in the number of patients resident in psychiatric facilities since 2006; fewer admissions, including involuntary admissions; while the number of patients readmitted to hospital has shown a year on year reduction since 2001.  This reduction points to an improvement in community-based services.</P>
        <P>The child and adolescent mental health service has seen a significant improvement.  There are now 61 multidisciplinary teams in place around the country and further teams will be developed in line with A Vision for Change.  In-patient bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 52 at present.  Through the See Change campaign, we are attempting to positively change social attitudes and behaviour in order to encourage people in distress to seek help.</P>
        <P>Work on the capital programme is continuing.  Acute admissions to St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital, Grangegorman, have ceased following the opening of the Pine Unit in Connolly Hospital.  During 2011 and 2012 HSE South will complete the process for the closure of St. Senan&rsquo;s Hospital, Enniscorthy, with the implementation of a &euro;16 million capital investment programme.  A residential unit is under construction in Clonmel which will allow for the closure of St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital.  In addition, work is progressing on the development of a new 60-bed unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the existing facility at St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital, Portrane.</P>
        <P>Implementing A Vision for Change will involve using existing resources more efficiently and effectively.  It will require the reallocation and remodelling of existing resources to move away from the provision of care in institutions to providing it in alternative settings or an individual&rsquo;s own home.  We need to be in a position to provide care in the best interests of the individual concerned.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that we are experiencing unprecedented challenges, not just in mental health services but also across every walk of life &mdash; challenges that, in turn, may impact on people&rsquo;s mental health.  As 90% of mental health needs are dealt with at primary care level, the Government is committed to developing closer links between mental health and primary care services, a key recommendation in A Vision for Change.  The focal point of modern mental health services in the community and the development of community-based facilities which house both primary care and mental health professionals will represent a significant step forward for service users and their families.  Having a community mental health team in the same building as a primary care team will help to build and cement closer relationships which will benefit everyone, including service users and their families, carers and professionals alike.  It has also been shown that people with a severe mental illness have poorer physical health than the general population.  Having primary care services available alongside mental health services <Col N="556"/>will ensure the physical health needs of those persons with mental health problems can be dealt with effectively.</P>
        <P>I assure the House of the Government&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to improving mental health services and the implementation of A Vision for Change.  We will continue to engage closely with the service user movement, one of the most significant reforms to have taken place in mental health services in recent years.  We will work tirelessly to change attitudes to mental health, place the service user at the centre and embed the recovery approach in the delivery of mental health services.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I join him in commending Amnesty International for its outstanding work.</P>

	<P>I remain concerned about the political and human rights situation in Sri Lanka.  Last year Ireland, along with the other Member States of the European Union, suspended the duty-free access which had been granted to Sri Lankan exports under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP plus).  This was prompted by the refusal of the Sri Lankan authorities to deliver a written undertaking on three human rights conventions dealing with torture, children&rsquo;s rights and civil and political rights.  </P>
        <P>Ireland is ready to support a discussion with Sri Lanka regarding the steps which it must take to implement the three conventions to allow GSP plus to be re-instated.</P>
        <P>A critical issue in any discussion would be the treatment of members of the Tamil population and more broadly, the question of national reconciliation.  It is my view that national reconciliation will not be possible without addressing the grievances of the Tamil people.  This is borne out by the ongoing exchange of allegations of war crimes and human rights abuses levelled at both parties to the conflict.</P>
        <P>To address these allegations, last year UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed an expert panel, chaired by Marzuki Darusman, the UN&rsquo;s special rights investigator to North Korea, to investigate the allegations.  The panel delivered its report to the Secretary General on 12 April.  The report states that there are credible allegations of serious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law by both the Sri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</P>
        <P>I fully support the call by High Representative Ashton of 10 May for an independent investigation to be undertaken into the allegations of misconduct on both sides, particularly during the final stages of the conflict.  As we know from our own experience, such an investigation could make an important contribution to building lasting peace and stability in Sri Lanka. <Col N="558"/> Officials from my Department have recently reiterated this point to their Sri Lankan counterparts.</P>

	<P>A number of countries, principally in Latin America and including Brazil, Argentina and Chile, have in recent months decided to recognise a Palestinian state.  This is in addition to those states &mdash; mostly in Africa or in the Islamic world &mdash; which have recognised Palestine for many years.  Over thirty years ago, Ireland, in a speech by my predecessor of the day, the late Brian Lenihan, was the first EU Member State to declare that the resolution of the Palestinian issue must involve the establishment of a Palestinian state.  That is now the policy of the EU and of the international community.  I share the commitment of successive Irish Governments to this policy and will continue to work, both nationally and at EU level, towards its realisation. </P>
        <P>It would be premature to declare such recognition now, in advance of actual control of the territory in question, a condition to which we in Ireland attach significance.  It is also important to recall that the Palestinian leadership, while clearly working towards the declaration of a State in the near future, have not yet done so.  The timing of such a declaration will be an important decision for them to take, and may involve potential negative consequences on the ground.</P>
        <P>If the peace process remains stalled, it is widely expected that the Palestinians may in September seek recognition at the United Nations for a Palestinian State.  They have made it clear, however, that this would be a last resort, and their preferred option would be the resumption of direct negotiations with Israel, to achieve the State of Palestine through a comprehensive peace agreement.</P>
        <P>Separately, a number of EU partners, including Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and the UK have recently taken steps to upgrade the status of the Palestinian Delegations in their countries, largely in recognition of the continuing progress being made by Prime Minister Fayyad and the Palestinian Authority in building up the institutions of a future Palestinian state.  By a decision of the previous Government in January &mdash; which I fully endorse &mdash; the Palestinian representative office in Ireland was upgraded to Mission status, headed by an Ambassador.</P>
        <P>I very much hope to be able to extend Irish recognition of an actual, functioning Palestinian state during my time in office.</P>

Applications may be made through the Passport Express Service through some 1,000 post offices across the country and some 70 post<b></b>offices in Northern Ireland as well as through the ordinary post.  The Passport Express Service ensures easy and local access to the passport services for citizens across Ireland through the local post office and is the fastest and most <Col N="559"/>efficient means of obtaining a passport.  A public counter service is also available in Dublin and Cork.  The special passport facility whereby Oireachtas members could submit passport applications on behalf of their constituents was discontinued in January 2010.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
        <P>Due to a surge in demand, the turnaround time for passport express applications received through the Passport Express system is currently running between 11 and 13 working days.  It normally takes 10 working days.  The Passport Express service is available for passport applications lodged in Ireland only.  The Passport Service regrets the delay and any difficulties caused in this regard.  Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website <i>http://www.passport.ie/</i>.  The Passport Office has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application.  An Post bears no responsibility for the current delays.</P>
        <P>During the peak summer period, application processing times for this service can lengthen and the processing period for ordinary post applications is currently six weeks or longer.  In such circumstances, priority continues to be given to applications made through the Passport Express Service.</P>
        <P>Passport demand in general is currently running at a level 13% higher than the same period in earlier years.  At present the Passport Service is receiving an average of 4,260 applications per day.  This is an unprecedented level of demand, with the number of applications received from Irish residents alone in two recent days at over 5,200, exceeding by 700 the highest number previously for any one single day.</P>
        <P>The largest increase has been observed in passports for children between the ages of 3 and 18 and is running 16% over previous years.</P>
        <P>The system is also coping with an unprecedented demand for passports at short notice, with some 350 people per day coming to the public office seeking passports within a period of less than 10 days.  To protect the integrity of the system and the quality of the passport, the Passport Service cannot provide standard passports within a single day.  The shortest turnaround time available is three working days for applications received over the public counter accompanied by proof of travel, other than in cases of genuine emergency.</P>
        <P>The processing of a passport is a complicated and highly skilled process.  Irish passports are among the most advanced in the world.  Each passport contains biometric technology to assist with identity verification and to provide a high level of security.  The Office has also recently strengthened the passport issuing process by providing further safeguards against fraudulent applications.</P>
        <P>Additional temporary staff have been recruited and are in training.  Within a short period, seasonal overtime and the additional output provided by temporary staff will bring processing times back to normal levels.  The delays being experienced at present are not related to the <Col N="560"/>operation of An Post&rsquo;s passport service and I see no necessity to review the An Post service in this regard.</P>
        <P>We would strongly appeal to the public to assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports before making bookings to travel abroad.  A valid passport should be the first item on any check list when considering foreign travel.</P>

	<P>Due to peak seasonal demand on all passport services at present, passport applicants may experience some delays in the delivery of their selected passport service.  This is very much regretted.  This is due to high demand on passport services which so far this year is currently running at a level 13% higher than the same period in previous years.  To cope with this, additional temporary staff have been recruited and overtime is being provided.  It is intended that these measures will bring processing times in respect of all passport services back to normal in the next few weeks.  In the case of the person in question, an application for a passport was made to the Passport Office in Balbriggan through the ordinary post passport service on 12 April.  Applications made through this service do not have a guaranteed turnaround service, as is the case for the Passport Express service, referred to in Question No.28 of 19 May 2011.  During the peak summer period, application processing times for this service can lengthen and the processing period for ordinary post applications is currently six weeks or longer.</P>
        <P>This person was in contact with the Passport Service on 9 May and 16 May to advise that she is travelling on 5 June.  On this basis, her passport application is on schedule to be processed by this date.  The Passport Officer in Balbriggan, Mr. Kevin Walzer, would be glad to provide the applicant with an update in regard to her application.  He may be contacted at kevin.walzer@dfa.ie.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware the levying of commercial rates is a matter for local authorities.  The role of the Valuation office is to value all commercial properties for the purposes of the calculation of rates by the local authorities.  The valuation of a property is multiplied by the annual rate on valuation, set by the local authority, to give the amount of commercial rates payable per annum.  The Valuation Act, 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act.  Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes.</P>
        <P>The basis of valuation for all commercial property, including small businesses, is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property.  Valuation revisions set for modified or new properties are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</P>
        <P>The legislation also provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State and the Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Act, is implementing the revaluation programme on a nationwide basis.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system.  I am satisfied that, following completion of the programme, there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and that this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.</P>
        <P>Under the  2001 Act, the commercial rates income of the local authority will be capped in the year following a revaluation.  Any increase will be limited to the rate of inflation.  The purpose of revaluation is to redistribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers rather than to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by a local authority.</P>
        <P>The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007, Fingal was completed in 2009 and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown was completed in 2010.  In the next phase, the revaluation of the Dublin City Council area commenced with the signing of the Valuation Order on 5th May, 2011.  This will entail the valuation of circa 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in December 2013.  It is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas later in 2011 and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway with local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council.  Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner is actively reviewing options which might hold potential for accelerating the delivery of the revaluation programme within a shorter timeframe.  While I have no immediate plans to amend the Valuation Act 2001, my officials are reviewing various provisions of the Act to achieve greater efficiencies, including streamlining the appeals process.  I should emphasise again that while the list of rateable valuations produced and maintained by the Valuation Office are the basis on which rates are levied, the amount of rates to be collected is a matter for each local authority to decide.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that contractors comply with the provisions in the Public Works Contracts in relation to pay and conditions of employment of all personnel working on public projects.  These contracts were developed by my Department as part of the Construction Procurement Reform Initiative.     Clause 5 of the Public Works contracts, require main contractors and all subcontractors employed by main contractors to comply with the rates of pay and conditions of employment including pension contributions in employment agreements registered under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004. The one exception is in regard to the registered agreement for pensions where a firm registered in another Member State and working in this country has employees temporarily posted from that other jurisdiction and who subscribe to a national pension scheme in their own country, then the firm or its employees do not have to subscribe to the Irish pension scheme.  </P>
        <P>The Public Works Contracts also requires a main contractor to provide a certificate of compliance (titled &lsquo;Rates of Pay and Conditions of Employment Certificate&rsquo;) with each interim statement submitted (normally on a monthly basis).  Failure to provide this compliance certificate will result in payment not being made by the contracting authority.  If a main contractor provides a certificate of compliance and it is subsequently found to be untrue or partly untrue the contracting authority has the right to deduct the money relating to the work or part of the work covered by the certificate from any sums due to the main contractor.  This money can be withheld until the pay and conditions of employment issue is made right.  The ultimate sanction if a main contractor continues to be non-compliant is for the main contract to be terminated.</P>
        <P>Under a Public Works Contract a contracting authority has the right, whenever it is deemed necessary, to access data and records on pay and conditions for work persons employed on the site.  In the case of capital works projects in excess of &euro;30 million and with a contract duration in excess of 18 months, contracting authorities provide in their contracts for random checks of the records of contractors and sub-contractors to assess compliance with the requirements of the Registered Employment Agreement, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>In order to ensure greater participation of small to medium sized enterprises in tendering for public works contracts a threshold of &euro;250.000 and below has been set where only the open procedure is to be used.  This means that tenderers&rsquo; suitability is assessed at the same time as their tender prices.  It is a requirement that tender documents for public works projects state that the standard Public Works Contract is to be used at award stage.  The standard Public Works Contract has specific provisions included in it dealing with pay and conditions of employees employed by the main contractor and its sub-contractors.   </P>
        <P>Under the Treaty principles and EU procurement directives contracting authorities must conduct their procurement affairs in a transparent and non-discriminatory way.  This is to ensure <Col N="563"/>that companies interested in tendering for public works projects from another member state are permitted to do so even though they cannot demonstrate compliance with our registered employment agreements because they have not worked here before.</P>
        <P>The body that is responsible for carrying out inspections regarding compliance with the agreements is the National Employments Rights Authority (NERA). Firms found by NERA to be non-compliant are prosecuted in the courts.</P>

	<P>VAT is charged on the supply of goods and services, and the rate applying is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The provision of sporting facilities is among a number of tourist related services being made subject to a new temporary lower reduced VAT rate of 9% from 1 July next.  All other goods and services that apply at a reduced rate will continue to be liable at the 13.5% rate.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that certain goods and services that were at a reduced rate of VAT on 1 January 1991, under the provision of Article 118 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, cannot be reduced below 12%; these are known as parked goods and services.  It is not possible to apply the 9% VAT rate to services consisting of the care of the human body supplied in the course of a health studio business or similar business, such as a yoga studio, since this service is the subject of a parked rate.  The rate of VAT on the provision of facilities for taking part in sporting activities by a person other than a non-profit making organisation can be reduced to 9% since this service was not the subject of a parked rate.</P>

	<P>My Department is the supervising Department, in cooperation with the Department of Finance and Personnel Northern Ireland, for the Special European Union Programmes Body (SEUPB), a north-south body established under <Col N="564"/>the Good Friday Agreement.  The SEUPB is responsible for managing the cross-border PEACE and INTERREG programmes which are both co-funded by the EU.    The SEUPB has advised that an application, of which the group was a co-applicant, was rejected in June 2010.  This application was under theme 1.2 (acknowledging and dealing with the past) of the PEACE III programme.  Theme 1.2 is managed for the SEUPB by the consortium of Pobal and the Community Relations Council of Northern Ireland. </P>
        <P>PEACE funding allocation is based on a comprehensive and robust application and approval process.  The process involves full project appraisal and scoring which is based on specific criteria relating to the overall aims, priorities and themes of the programme as well as a number of non-specific criteria such as value for money/value added, need and contribution to a number of cross cutting themes.</P>
        <P>All funding applications are subject to the above process which ensures that funding is allocated in an effective manner.  After a thorough assessment, the decision on whether or not to allocate funding to an application is taken by a Steering Committee, which is composed of nominated representatives of various government and public sector organisations both in Ireland and Northern Ireland, as well as representatives from civil society and the voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>The Steering Committee determined that the application in question, for a project entitled &lsquo;Living History&rsquo;, failed to meet the minimum threshold necessary for the Programme Specific Criteria.  The Programme Specific Criteria for the theme 1.2 (acknowledging and dealing with the past), under which the application was submitted, include:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Evidence of how the project contributes to the overall objective of the Programme, which is to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to promote reconciliation.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Evidence of how the project contributes to Priority 1: Reconciling Communities, Theme 1.2, Acknowledging and Dealing with the Past.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Assessment on whether the project is targeted at a clearly identified area that has been affected by the conflict and has experienced particular problems of segregation, marginalisation and isolation.</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />The intention to work with any of the target groups named in the Operational Programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The application also failed to meet the efficiency and effectiveness criteria, which was assessed on the basis of the information provided within the application and of an Economic Appraisal specific to the project conducted as part of the assessment process.</P>
        <P>Following a decision by the Steering Committee, applicants have a period of four weeks from the date of issue of the letter of rejection to appeal the decision and ask for a review of the application.  This procedure was outlined to the lead applicant during a meeting with the Community Relations Council, in which the reasons for rejection of the application were explained in detail.  The lead applicant did not request a review of the application.</P>

	<P>I take it that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to this school in the context of the value for money review on small schools which is under way at present.  The value for money review on small schools is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews.  These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained and the public consultations were designed to achieve this aim.  This was done by issuing a direct invitation to relevant interest groups to provide a submission.  The interest groups included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, national parents&rsquo; council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion. </P>
        <P>A letter, inviting submissions, issued on 8th February 2011 to these interest groups and a deadline for reply was given for 18th March 2011.  As these groups represent a wide spectrum of membership it could be reasonably expected they would communicate with their membership in regard to the review.  In addition to the direct letter of invitation issued to these groups, a general invitation for submissions was posted on the Department&rsquo;s website also at the same time.  Indeed the large response of in excess of 1,000 submissions seems to support the view that there is high general awareness of the review and a lot of interest in it.</P>
        <P>The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for re-organisation of small schools including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools.  I think it is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Government Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.</P>
        <P>This review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna Fail &mdash; Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology.  The study is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy.  It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or that any particular outcome is sought.  Given that the Government has recently announced a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities.  In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, the Department of Education and Skills is conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.</P>
        <P>Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities.  The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type.  It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</P>
        <P>Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size.  We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors.  Decisions on school provision and reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable.  These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</P><Col N="566"/>
        <P>With regard to the specific school referred to by the Deputy the existing rules and current sustainability limits will continue to apply and there are no plans at this time to close this school.</P>

        <P>Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs.  In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  They act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational <Col N="571"/>needs.  Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.  I have therefore referred this query to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s policy is focused on ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.  For example some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full-partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school&rsquo;s best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</P>
        <P>I have made inquiries with my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service in relation to the pupil referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question and can confirm that no approach has been made by school authorities in relation to the current assessment or review of the child.  The NEPS service is available to provide any relevant assistance requested by school authorities in this instance and I would suggest that the child&rsquo;s parents raise the matter with the school principal.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the 1998 Education Act provides the legal framework for the delivery of education to children through recognised schools.  All recognised schools are legally owned by the school patrons or trustees and managed by a school&rsquo;s Board of Management which is also the employer of teachers in a school.</P>
        <P>If a parent wishes to make a complaint against a teacher or school they should contact the relevant school authorities.  The complaint procedures adopted by most schools are those that have been agreed between the teacher unions and school management bodies.  The details of these procedures for primary and post primary schools are in Appendices.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for Education and Skills provides funding and policy direction for schools, neither I nor officials of my Department have powers to investigate individual complaints, except where the complaint involves a refused enrolment, expulsion or suspension, in accordance with Section 29 of the 1998 Education Act.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of a Vocational Educational Committee (VEC) school to the VEC in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children may independently investigate complaints about schools recognised with the Department of Education and Skills, provided the parent has firstly and fully followed the school&rsquo;s complaints procedures.  The key criterion for any intervention by the Ombudsman for Children is that the action of the school has had a negative affect on a child.  The office can be contacted at Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, Millennium House, 52-56 Great Strand Street, Dublin 1, (Phone) 1800 20 20 40 or (01) 8656800, E-mail oco@oco.ie.</P><Col N="573"/>

        <P LI="1">Unwritten complaints not in the above categories may be processed informally as set out in Stage 1 of this procedure.</P>
        <P LI="1"><b>Stage 1</b></P>
        <P LI="1"><b>1.1</b> A parent/guardian who wishes to make a complaint should, unless there are local arrangements to the contrary, approach the class teacher with a view to resolving the complaint.</P>
        <P LI="1"><b>1.2</b> Where the parent/guardian is unable to resolve the complaint with the class teacher she/he should approach the Principal with a view to resolving it.</P>
        <P LI="1"><b>1.3</b> If the complaint is still unresolved the parent/guardian should raise the matter with the Chairperson of the Board of Management with a view to resolving it.</P>

        <P LI="1"><b>Introduction</b></P>
        <P LI="1">Procedures are necessary to ensure fair treatment for all in the school and acceptable procedures should be known, agreed, and observed in the interest of good relationships with Parents/Guardians/Students, good industrial relations with Teaching Staff and harmony in the school environment.  Throughout the procedures outlined below all communication between the Teacher, Parent/Guardian and or Student (who has reached the age of 18 years) must take place in an atmosphere that is calm, dignified and in a climate that respects the viewpoint of either party involved in the Complaints Procedure.</P>
        <P LI="1">It is to the advantage of the parties to the complaint that a speedy resolution be secured by the complaints process.</P>
        <P LI="1">Periodic review of all procedures should take place to ensure practices are good and adhere to any developments in employment legislation or other legislation or case law.</P>
        <P LI="1"><b>Purpose of Complaints Procedure</b></P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</P>
        <P>The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year.  A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</P>

	<P>Under current legislation, a person is not entitled to receive jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance while attending a course of study.  A person aged 18 or over is regarded as attending a course of study:</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is understood that the Deputy is referring to the situation where a person is not entitled due to one or other of the reasons outlined above and where the parent or parents of that person are in receipt of a welfare payment in their own right.  For the purposes of weekly social welfare income maintenance payments, an increase for a qualified child is payable in respect of each qualified child.  Qualified children include children who are 18 years or over following completion of second-level education or the Leaving Certificate, provided he or she does not qualify for a social welfare payment in his/her own right.  This increase can continue to be payable up to the end of the academic year in which a son or daughter attains the age of 22 years of age provided that person remains in full time education.</P>
        <P>Increases for qualified adults are payable in respect of a spouse, civil partner or a person cohabiting with a welfare recipient who is wholly or mainly maintained by that recipient.  There are no plans to further extend the categories of persons in respect of whom an increase for a qualified adult is payable.  Any changes to the provisions relating to persons regarded as attending a course of study would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the HSE based on the particular circumstances of the case.  Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  The community welfare officer (CWO) in the HSE has advised that the application for assistance with home heating costs made on 6th May 2011 has been granted and a payment has already issued to the person concerned.

        <P>T&uacute;s is a community work placement initiative which will provide up to 5,000 short-term, quality work opportunities for those who are unemployed for more than a year.  Some &euro;30 million has been provided in the Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2011 to fund the roll-out of the initiative.  This initiative is delivered through the network of local development companies and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in Gaeltacht areas.  Participants will, in the first instance, be identified by the Department for Social Protection by applying the following conditions:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />A person must be unemployed and in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for at least 12 months, and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Currently be in receipt of jobseekers allowance, and</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />Be fully unemployed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of T&uacute;s is to focus on those people who are long-term unemployed.  For this reason, eligibility is at present confined to those on the Live Register for 12 months and in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  These provisions are to ensure a targeted approach to those currently affected by long-term unemployment.  Persons already in employment are not eligible for these positions.  The operation of the scheme, including eligibility criteria, will be kept under review and will inform the evaluation process in due course.</P>

	<P>The National Internship Scheme is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s Jobs Initiative. It will provide up to 5,000 unemployed people with an internship opportunity ranging from 6 to 9 months in an organisation in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  Under the National Internship Scheme, internship opportunities should provide participants with valuable work experience, which enhance their skills and competencies, with the aim of improving their prospects of securing employment.  Provided both an organisation and the internship opportunity they intend to offer meet the scheme&rsquo;s eligibility criteria, they will be allowed to participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Work is being finalised on the development of the National Internship Scheme so that it will be ready for launch by the beginning of July.  It is expected that a website will be available in the coming days so that potential host organisations and interns can access information and also express their interest in participating in the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 45 together.</P>
        <P>The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable <Col N="583"/>rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the state.  It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplement tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low paid employment.  Community Welfare staff have the authority to set levels lower than those provided for in the regulations, in respect of sub-divisions of their functional areas, where this is appropriate.  This power is provided to reflect the fact that lower rent levels may apply in certain locations within counties.</P>
        <P>Under normal circumstances rent supplement is not paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum rent limit. Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent limits as an exceptional measure, for example where there are special housing needs for a disabled person in specially-adapted accommodation or on a short term basis until the tenant is in a position to resume responsibility for his/her rent.  This discretionary power is only used in special cases, but it ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, where a person is availing of an income disregard in respect of part-time earnings, the applicant may be allowed to contribute an additional amount towards his/her rent where the rent is in excess of the rent limits.  This is only allowable where the person in question has sufficient income after paying the rent to meet his/her basic needs. &ldquo;Sufficient income&rdquo; in this context means the relevant basic supplementary allowance rate less the prescribed minimum contribution to rent.</P>
        <P>The most recent rent limit review established new maximum rent limits from June 2010 which were in line with the most up to date market data available.  The current rent limits are in place until December 2011 and will be reviewed later this year.  The review will be based on analysis on data on private rental prices supplied by the Central Statistics Office, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and publicly available data.</P>

	<P>The rules governing Carer&rsquo;s Allowance include the following conditions for receipt of the payment:</P>
        <P>The Carer must:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be aged 18 or over;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />satisfy a means test;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be living with the person s/he is looking after, or be in a position to provide full time care and attention to a person who is not living with him/her;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be caring for the person on a full-time basis;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />not be employed or self-employed outside the home for more than 15 hours per week;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />not be living in a hospital, convalescent home or other similar institution;</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be fit to care.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Community Employment (CE) involves working a 19&frac12; hour week, therefore, by taking up a CE position a Carer would breach several of the above conditions for retention of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, which would cause the payment to cease.  When a person&rsquo;s caring responsibilities do cease, s/he can transfer to another CE qualifying social welfare payment such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and have his/her time spent in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance counted towards the CE qualifying period  which is generally 12 months in addition to time spent on his/her new payment.</P>

        <Quest> if she will provide an additional member, a money advisor, to the north Mayo Monetary Advice and Budgeting Service office which has a seven week waiting list and services from Blacksod to Ballaghaderreen and south Sligo which includes an area with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and has not had an increase in staff numbers since 2004. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  The role of money advisers is to help clients to assess their financial situation, make a budget plan and deal with creditors.</P>
        <P>There are 52 independent MABS companies operating the local MABS services from 65 locations throughout the country, including offices in North Mayo, South Mayo and Sligo, with national support provided by the MABS NDL.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9am to 8pm Monday to Friday and the MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day at <i>www.mabs.ie</i>.  Some 90% of clients presenting to MABS are assisted through the telephone helpline, which provides assisted self-help to ensure clients take steps to assess and address their situation.</P>
        <P>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has responsibility for MABS, compiles information on the waiting times in each MABS office on a quarterly basis and posts it to the <i>www.mabs.ie</i>  website.  At the end of March 2011 the average waiting time from first point of contact to first appointment with a money adviser is some 6 weeks.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.</P>
        <P>The focus of MABS is in ensuring clients get the level of support they need and as such client assessments and effective case management are important components of the overall approach.  During the waiting period, clients are assessed and those in need of immediate assistance are given a priority appointment, others are provided with assisted self-help to ensure that they have taken steps to assess their situation and if appropriate they are supported to take holding action with their creditors.  In this context MABS highlights the importance of creditors proactively working with their customers to resolve arrears difficulties at an early stage.</P>
        <P>In 2010, the CIB allocated a total budget of some &euro;18.2m for the delivery of money advice and budgeting services and this figure was increased to &euro;18.3m in 2011.   As well as funding, the Citizens Information Board also provides management support to ensure services are delivered effectively.  The Board is aware of the client demand for money advice services in the north west region and a request for additional staffing in respect of North Mayo MABS has been received.  This is under review in the context of requests from other services, the increased demand for services throughout the country, and the financial resources available.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, there are three agencies under the remit of my Department with specific roles in the promotion of the Irish language.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is responsible for the economic, social and cultural development of the Gaeltacht. Further details are available at <i>www.udaras.ie</i>.  Foras na Gaeilge, one of the two agencies comprising the North/South Language Implementation Body, An Foras Teanga, is responsible for promotion of the Irish language on an all-island basis. Further details are available at <i>www.gaeilge.ie</i>.  The Office of An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga was established under the Official Languages Act 2003 as an independent, statutory office and is responsible for ensuring the legislation is implemented. Further details are available at <i>www.coimisineir.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, following an extensive consultation process, the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language was officially launched in December 2010 and received significant cross-party support. The Strategy identifies nine areas of action to be addressed in order to sustain and strengthen the Irish language over a 20-year period both within the Gaeltacht <Col N="587"/>and on a national basis. To that end the Strategy proposes various policies and structures to assist in the achievement of the overall goal of increasing the number of Irish speakers on a phased basis over a 20-year period.  These matters are currently under active consideration in conjunction with the Cabinet Committee on the Irish Language and the Gaeltacht which is chaired by An Taoiseach. I expect that specific proposals in this regard will be brought to Government shortly.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> the reason a draft net licence for 2011 was refused in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; if he will explain the workings of Article 6 of Order 2011, Statutory Instrument No. 123, 2011; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 305 of 17 May 2011, the application for a draft net salmon licence by the individual concerned was unsuccessful.  As the Deputy is aware Article 6 of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 2011 (S.I. No. 123 of 2011) sets out the order of priority under which licence allocations are decided. There were only three commercial licences available in the Kerry Fishery District.  In accordance with Article 6 of the Control Order, three other applicants who had higher priority status were granted these commercial fishing licences.</P><Col N="588"/>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware there is a statutory public consultation process currently underway in relation to the commercial fishery in Castlemaine Harbour.  In the event of the re-opening of the commercial fishery in Castlemaine Harbour, it will be necessary to revise the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order to set out the order of priority in which additional licences would be granted in the Kerry fishery district.  I intend to make such an order in the coming weeks.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest> if he will review the categorisation of schools which generate their own electricity through renewable sources, for example, wind turbines, and instead place them in the not-for-profit farming and residential category and thereby promote schools&rsquo; participation in sustainable energy generation while avoiding the situation of schools being forced to supply energy for free to the national grid at certain times while having to pay for electricity at others. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no statutory function in the categorisation of schools which generate their electricity through renewable sources. </P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation is an independent statutory body with responsibility for regulation of electricity market in Ireland since 1999.  In 2007, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) published the &lsquo;Arrangements for Micro-generation&rsquo; decision paper (CER/07/208), which outlined the technical and commercial arrangements for micro-generation including installation, safety, notifications to the network operator and metering for microgenerators that are sized at or below 11kW.  In this paper, microgeneration was defined as generation from units that rate at or below 11kW.</P>
        <P>In 2008, as part of the regulation of ESB Customers Supply&rsquo;s retail tariffs, the CER approved a proposal from ESB Customer Supply to make a 9 cent payment for domestic microgeneration output from domestic customers.  Non-domestic customers, including schools, were not included in the ESB Customer Supply proposal at that time.  The CER also encouraged all suppliers to offer innovative products, which reward appropriately for any export by microgenerators and which could be extended to non domestic microgenerators.  In parallel to that, ESB Networks offered an initial 10 cent per kilowatt hour payment for output for domestic microgeneration, but this a voluntary rate introduced by the company itself and was not a regulated offering.</P>
        <P>As prices in the retail market have now been fully deregulated, effective since 4th   April, there is no longer scope for specifying a regulated tariff/payment for microgeneration in the retail market as part of the CER&rsquo;s tariff setting process.  However, individual supply companies remain free to make such offerings on a commercial basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 62 together. </P>
        <P>With the reduced resources available for Department funding programmes, the CL&Aacute;R programme is being wound down. My Department has provision of up to &euro;0.5m for the Programme for 2011; this will be used to meet existing commitments arising during this year. There are currently approximately 143 projects under the Programme on hands with my Department. Most of these are in the area of support for Sports Capital projects.  I understand that no new funding applications have been invited since August 2008 under the main CL&Aacute;R programme measures.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within designated RAPID areas nationally. </P>
        <P>It is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with regard to projects under their responsibility in the different RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>My Department administers the RAPID Leverage Schemes, which are designed to support small scale projects identified locally by Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas. These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies, and the schemes support projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities and the provision of playgrounds.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;3.16m is being provided in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2011 to support a number of projects under the leverage schemes.  My primary focus will be to ensure that the front-line services being supported by my Department &mdash; and especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities &mdash; are protected. Given that the schemes are demand-led, it is not possible to indicate the extent of demands during 2011. However, I am satisfied <Col N="590"/>that this year&rsquo;s allocation will be sufficient to enable progress to be made with small-scale co-funded projects in RAPID areas.</P>

	<P>The Dormant Accounts Acts provide for an annual transfer by credit institutions and insurance undertakings of monies in accounts determined to be dormant into the Dormant Accounts Fund (DAF).  Since its establishment in April 2003, to the end of March 2011, the transfers to the DAF have totalled some &euro;589m, which includes interest earned of some &euro;35m.  Funds reclaimed in that period by account holders amounted to approximately &euro;209m.</P>

	<P>Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was amended by section 28 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.</P>
        <P>While the provision remains whereby an extension of permission is automatically given on application in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration (subject only to the condition that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period), a new provision was introduced whereby the duration of a permission may be extended where substantial works have not been done, or where the development has not even commenced, in cases where the planning authority is satisfied that there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works, pursuant to the planning permission (again provided that an application complying with the relevant Regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period).  This latter provision is, however, subject to the following qualifications&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />that the planning authority is satisfied that there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the Regional Planning Guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area,</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />that the planning authority is satisfied that the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28, notwithstanding that they were so issued after the date of the grant of permission in relation to which an application is made under this section, and/or</P><Col N="592"/>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />that the planning authority is satisfied where the development has not commenced, that an environmental impact assessment, or an appropriate assessment, or both of those assessments, if required, was or were carried out before the permission was granted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Some necessary consequential amendments to the Planning Regulations were made in the Planning and Development Regulations 2010 to take account of these new provisions.  Planning authorities are required to implement section 42, as amended, and the relevant Regulations.   I am not aware of any instances of their not doing so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current pyrite problems were first brought to the attention of my Department in mid-2007 and it acted quickly in taking appropriate action to address them.  Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December <Col N="594"/>2007 and it addresses the quality standards of new homes and buildings insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.</P>
        <P>The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and the related technical guidance documents provide guidance on how to comply with those regulations.  The relevant Technical Guidance Document of the Building Regulations dealing with Site Preparation was amended to incorporate the revised NSAI Standard Recommendation.</P>
        <P>In addition, I am aware that HomeBond, a private company which provides a ten-year structural guarantee for new houses, has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published 6th edition of the house building manual.  I attach a high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings and I have asked my Department to prioritise the formulation of policy proposals that will enhance compliance with, and enforcement of, the building regulations generally.  I will be meeting a representative group in the next few weeks to establish what can be done to help home owners deal with outstanding issues in the context of recent court decisions and departmental responsibilities.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As set out in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 36 on 18 May 2011, following the completion of the pilot project which tested the use of electronic monitoring technology in this jurisdiction, a comprehensive review of its viability in the management of offenders along with a cost benefit analysis is underway.  This process will be completed by the end of September. In addition, I expect to bring legislative proposals to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to Government in the coming months.  Measures being considered in this context include the electronic monitoring of sex offenders in specific circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The criminal law treats the offence of rape extremely seriously.  A person convicted of rape is liable to imprisonment for life.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is acutely aware of the special care and attention which complaints of rape require because of the vulnerable circumstances in which victims find themselves and attaches great importance to combining professionalism with sensitivity and compassion in the investigation of rape.</P>
        <P>In 2010 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na published a new comprehensive policy document on the investigation of sexual crime, crimes against children and child welfare, which is available on the Garda website <i>www.garda.ie</i>.  The fundamental principle underpinning the policy is the vindication of the rights of victims and all those with whom members of the Force come in contact and the protection of the public by the thorough and professional investigation of this form of crime.  The functions of the Garda Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit include the promotion of best practice within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of rape and other sexual crime.  The Unit also liaises with relevant State bodies and voluntary groups, taking a multi-agency approach to tackling these crimes and their causes.  Initiatives introduced <Col N="595"/>by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also include a crime training facility which trains senior investigating officers in the investigation of such offences.</P>
        <P>The National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2010-2014, contains a specific action to minimise attrition levels in sexual violence cases.  Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is an Executive Office within my Department, led a committee which considered the attrition problem.  The committee finalised its work in February, 2011 and made a number of recommendations on attrition in sexual violence cases which are being pursued.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The person concerned was approved under the IBC/05 Scheme which resulted in her being granted permission to remain in the State for a two year period, valid to 7th October, 2007.  A request for the renewal of this permission to remain was refused as the person concerned was not living continuously in the State.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her application for the renewal of her permission to remain in the State, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 23rd June, 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>In advance of a final decision being made, the case of the person concerned will be examined to determine what, if any, impact the recent European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case may have on her case.  The Deputy might wish to note that a representative of my Department wrote to the legal representative of the person concerned on 24th May, 2011 to advise of the documentation and information that must submitted before the case of the person concerned can be considered under the terms of the Zambrano Judgment.  Upon receipt of the requested documentation and information, the matter can be considered further.</P>

        <Quest> the position <Col N="597"/>regarding the implementation of provisions of the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2009 in respect of the registration of rights of way; if he intends to make any changes to the provisions in view of the expense of registering such rights; if he intends to extend the deadline for registration of such rights; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements based on reform recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, provides that easements shall be acquired at law by prescription only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</P>
        <P>Late last year the Law Society made a submission to my Department containing proposals to amend the 2009 Act with a view to simplifying the procedures for registering easements acquired by prescription. During subsequent discussions involving my Department, the Law Society and the Property Registration Authority, agreement was reached on the outline of a draft scheme whereby the Authority would be empowered to register such easements without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act on being satisfied that the claim had been substantiated.</P>
        <P>In order to give statutory effect to the proposed scheme, amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 will be required.  I intend therefore to include the necessary amendments to both Acts in the forthcoming Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will be published later this year.  I intend also to take advantage of this legislation to extend from 3 years to 12 years the period referred to in section 38 of the 2009 Act during which easements acquired, or in the course of acquisition, prior to 1 December 2009 may be registered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about the length of time currently being taken to process vetting applications.  I recognise that it is important to process these applications within a reasonable time frame both for the benefit of the applicants and the organisations involved.</P>
        <P>A number of immediate measures are being taken to improve the situation.  The sanction of the Department of Finance has been obtained to retain the services of ten temporary employees in the GCVU.  A further sanction has been obtained to engage an additional ten temporary employees for the Unit and the process of recruiting these is underway.  This should have an impact on processing times.</P>
        <P>In addition, further steps are under consideration with a view to alleviating the pressure on the staff of the GCVU and to reduce the time taken for the processing of applications.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that, at present, the average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 10 weeks.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  In processing an individual vetting application, additional time may be required in cases where clarification is needed as to the details provided or where other enquir<Col N="600"/>ies need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out what are very necessary checks.</P>
        <P>The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives from around 188,000 in 2007 to almost 292,000 in 2010.  At present, there are approximately 55,000 applications in the course of being processed.</P>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why Deportation Orders should not be made against her and the children. Representations were received on behalf of the person concerned at that time.</P>
        <P>The person concerned subsequently submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</P>
        <P>The person concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal in her case. Following the refusal of the judicial review proceedings, the earlier decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Minister stood.</P>

        <P>The application for Subsidiary Protection submitted by the person concerned will be considered next and a decision notified.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recent correspondence from the Cork South West Lobster Fishermans Co-Operative in relation to funding for the cooperative.</P>
        <P>This Cooperative wrote to me in April seeking funding of &euro;50,000 over 5 years for the cooperative, to enable it to continue to fund its contribution towards payments to lobster fishermen who are members of the Coop and who engage in lobster v-notching.  Under the <Col N="605"/>Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013, BIM pays cooperatives 55% of the market price of berried lobsters presented by coop members for v-notching by a BIM officer and returned alive to the sea by the fishermen in order to spawn.  I understand that this Coop and some others pay their members the remaining 45% of the market value of the lobster from funds derived from the subscriptions of their members, while other cooperatives do not.  Where this other 45% is paid to the coop member by his coop, he or she receives the full market value of the lobster and this makes participation in the v-notching programme a very attractive option for the coop members.  V-notching rates tend to be higher for such coops, but this practice also places a great strain on the finances of those coops, particularly if coop membership numbers are falling.</P>
        <P>V-notching is a very important conservation measure for the lobster stock.  In areas with strong v-notching programmes, the scheme has had a very positive impact on maintaining and increasing the lobster stock.  It is very much in the interests of lobster fishermen to maximise v-notching rates in their area in order to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and their livelihoods into the future.  I too am very supportive of the Programme and would urge all lobster fishermen to think to the future, their future, and to participate fully in the Programme.</P>
        <P>If I was to accede to a request to provide additional funding to the Cork South West Lobster Fishermans Co-Operative, I would have to provide similar funding to all other cooperatives engaged in the v-notching scheme.  Funding for fisheries is limited and BIM endeavour within its budget allocation to support a range of important programmes and initiatives and at this time there are no additional funds available.  I regret, therefore, that it is not possible to provide additional funds to the Coop on top of the present 55% funding rate.  However, I would welcome the views of the Coop on how, in other ways, v-notching rates might be better promoted and increased and indeed proposals on other possible conservation measures for the lobster stock.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
        <P>In June 2010 UCD launched a report entitled &lsquo;Challenges and Solutions to Support Good Equine Welfare Practice in Ireland&rsquo;. The report highlighted a number of factors including the increasing numbers of horses at risk of being abandoned and the necessity for a comprehensive system of equine identification.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The response from the Equine Industry to the report has been positive. It remains committed to working with the Department to address welfare issues as they relate to the equine industry and considers that a quantitative study of equine welfare cases in Ireland should be established.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department together with the Industry takes a very serious view of the issue of horse welfare and our response, notwithstanding the fact that the primary responsibility for the welfare of an animal rests with the owner or keeper, is to ensure there is comprehensive legislation in place to deal with horse welfare issues arising.</P><Col N="606"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibility in the area of animal welfare extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in, or for the purposes of, the farming of land or of animal husbandry. The relevant legislation in this area is The Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, S.I. 311 of 2010. Animals used in competitions, shows, cultural or sporting events or recreational activities fall outside the scope of S.I. 311 of 2010.</P>
        <P>The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including horses, in Ireland is The Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and The Protection of Animals (amendment) Act 1965. This legislation is enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who may on receipt of a complaint investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.</P>
        <P>The Turf Club while having no statutory responsibility for animal welfare can, depending on the nature of a complaint made, investigate such complaint (provided it relates to a licensee) and refer the matter to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if intervention is required. If the Turf Club investigators find that welfare issues concerning a licensee are of such magnitude that the matter requires immediate intervention, there is power under its rules to suspend the licence of any person. In the event of a licensee being convicted in court for an animal welfare offence relating to a racehorse the Turf Club can then deal with that person under its rules concerning the preservation and good reputation of horse-racing.</P>
        <P>Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) has responsibility under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 for the provision of support it deems appropriate to maintain the health and welfare status of the thoroughbred horse. In order to carry out this function, HRI provides annual grant aid to the Irish Equine Centre and, from time to time, to horse welfare organisations. In 2009, all the key bodies in the industry produced a comprehensive booklet entitled &ldquo;Promoting Responsible Thoroughbred Ownership&rdquo; to provide advice for owners in relation to best practice in relation to welfare matters.  At race meetings, the racecourses employ specialist vets to deal with horse injuries or fatalities under guidelines issued by the Turf Club, while the Stewards of the meeting have the power under Turf Club rules to deal with specific welfare matters such as use of the whip.</P>
        <P>There are legislative commitments relating to animal welfare in The Programme for Government 2011, including a commitment to amend and strengthen animal welfare legislation. A draft Animal Health and Welfare Bill giving effect to this commitment is in the course of preparation. The Bill will consolidate and update existing legislation in the area of animal health and welfare with the aim of ensuring that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected.</P>
        <P>Mindful of the equine identification issue highlighted in the UCD report, national legislation on equine identification is currently being finalised in my Department.  The Industry had identified the necessity for a quantitative study to be carried out on equine welfare cases in Ireland. In this regard I have recently announced funding of &euro;10,000 to assist the Irish Equine Centre who is undertaking, at the request of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, a demographic study to determine the extent of the unwanted horse population in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to actively engage with all stakeholders to ensure the continued protection of equine health and welfare.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the issues raised by the person to whom the Deputy refers. There has been extensive contact between the individual concerned and officials from my Department. It is my understanding that the complaints made by this individual to the relevant regulatory bodies have been investigated and the outcome of those investigations have been made known to the complainant. </P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s responsibility, which is set down in legislation, extends to the welfare and protection of farmed animals only i.e. animals normally bred or kept for the production of food or for use in or for the purpose of farming. The relevant legislation in this area is the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984 and the European Communities (Welfare of Farmed Animals) Regulations 2010, SI 311 of 2010. Animals &ldquo;used in competitions/shows, cultural or sporting events or activities while so being used&rdquo; are outside the scope of SI 311 of 2010. Accordingly it is clear that the complaints forwarded by the named individual to this Department are not covered by this legislation and thus fall outside the remit of the Department. My Department must act at all times in accordance with legislation. The principal statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including horses, in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for pursuing cases under this legislation rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who may on receipt of a complaint investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under these Acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Department has clarified its position in this matter both verbally and in writing in recent months by way of direct contact with the individual and also in a response issued to earlier representations made on his behalf.  I have written to this person (12th   May 2011) and explained to him that my Department has no role, or jurisdiction, in resolving the issues referred to and that it is for him to decide if he wishes to report these matters to the Garda&iacute; or indeed if he wishes to institute civil proceedings. Officials from my Department will meet with the person named this week to explain the Department&rsquo;s position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s National Financial Regulation (NFR) 10 sets out the policies and procedures for the approval, set-up, usage and transaction processing of credit cards. It also sets out the policies and procedures for the monitoring and audit of credit card transactions . The National Financial Regulations stipulate that the use of credit cards is not intended to avoid or bypass <Col N="608"/>appropriate procurement and payment procedures, and all purchases must be made in accordance with applicable HSE purchasing policies and procedures.</P>
        <P>Currently, nine senior HSE officials are approved credit card holders. Credit cards are used to meet expenses incurred by or on behalf of that senior official in respect of the carrying out of his/her duties. Credit cards are used to settle vouched expenses which are incurred on official HSE business. In the absence of a credit card arrangement, this expenditure would otherwise be reclaimed by the HSE official by way of vouched expenses in accordance with public sector travel and subsistence regulations. The credit card constitutes an efficient payment method for this type of expenditure.</P>
        <P>With regard to the use of credit cards to pay for institute membership, the Executive reimburses certain employees for institute membership which is incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily by an individual in the performance of the duties of his or her employment with the HSE and where: the duties of the employee and the duties of the employment require the exercise or practice of the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers; the employee so exercises or practices the occupation or profession in respect of which the annual membership fee refers; and membership of the professional body is an indispensable condition of the tenure of the employment.</P>
        <P>The credit card constitutes an efficient payment method for this type of expenditure which in some instances is incurred in foreign currency, e.g. GBP (&pound;).</P>

	<P>The 2008 consultants&rsquo; contract includes measures to strengthen the management, monitoring and control of activity in hospitals with a view to ensuring that the level of consultant private practice within public hospitals does not exceed the permitted ratio.  The HSE in conjunction with the ESRI has introduced a range of new measurement systems in order to meet the requirements of the contract.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently auditing the implementation of the contract. Revised performance measures are currently being developed which will enable the Executive to publish summary statistics in relation to compliance towards the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>Since January 2009 each consultant is issued with a monthly public/private mix measurement report.  This documents the consultant&rsquo;s activity in relation to inpatient, day case, outpatient and diagnostic activity over the previous three months.  Under the terms of the contract, written <Col N="609"/>notification will issue within a period of a month to a consultant who exceeds the permitted level of private practice.</P>
        <P>The contract provides that the employer may require the consultant to remit monies in respect of any private practice excess to a research and study fund.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is not planning to cut funding for the HSE West (Mid West Area) in 2011. The budget for health services in the Mid West Area for this year was allocated in January at &euro;605m and this remains unchanged. What is apparent from the April accounts is that the Mid West Area is overspending by approximately &euro;4m per month for the first four months of this year. While acknowledging that service pressures are highest in the 1st Quarter, it is clear that corrective action is urgently required to address what is potentially a major financial problem.</P>
        <P>The core objective in the Mid West Area remains the delivery of the 2011 service plan activity and performance targets, which overall provides for a similar volume of services to that provided in 2010, but within the budget allocated for the year. A range of cost containment plans and control measures have been prepared by management in order to address the financial challenge. These measures are targeting non front-line service areas in the first instance in order to ensure that services for patients and clients are protected. This includes measures to improve productivity, secure better procurement and value for money and deliver efficiencies under the Croke Park Agreement.</P>
        <P>The package of cost containment plans with a value of &euro;17m in the current year includes measures to address areas such as:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Streamlining management structures and functional supports</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Streamlining service delivery</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />improving day case activity levels</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Improving same day admission for services and operating theatre efficiency</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Reducing average length of stay</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Controlling overtime, agency and on-call costs</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Reducing absenteeism</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Controlling travel and subsistence costs, legal costs and professional fees</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Securing better pricing for non pay items and consumables</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />Improving income collection</P><Col N="611"/>
        <P FLI="0">All areas of expenditure and income generation are being examined across the services to ensure that maximum value for money and efficiency is being achieved. Measures that do not have front line service implications are being implemented in the first instance. Measures that have a potential to impact on front line patient or client services will only be considered following a full evaluation and impact assessment and consideration at a national level.</P>

	<P>A Working Group was established in 2008 to &ldquo;discuss the question of the sponsorship of sporting events by the alcohol industry with a view to phasing it out&rdquo;, its report was published in June 2010.  The Report showed that there were two different views represented in the Working Group; but it was not charged with finding a means of reconciling these opposing views or to assess the relative merits of the arguments made.</P>
        <P>The Report was then referred  to the Steering Group that is developing the National Substance Misuse Strategy to assist it in its deliberations on actions to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by alcohol use and misuse and on the issues of alcohol marketing and sponsorship.</P>
        <P>The Steering Group is made up of representatives from the Departments of  Sport, Tourism &amp; Culture, Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government, Justice &amp; Equality and Education &amp; Skills along with a representative from the former Department for Community , Equality &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>In addition, as part of its work, the Group invited individuals and groups to submit proposals with regard to alcohol.</P>
        <P>The question of alcohol branded sponsorship in sporting and cultural events is under consideration and the report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group will be finalised in the coming months.</P>

	<P>This case was investigated under the National Incident Protocol by the HSE, using the Investigation Procedure and Toolkit to identify factors that contributed to this maternal death.  To address these contributory factors and to prevent future harm arising from them 11 actions were recommended.</P>
        <P>Recommendations were made in relation to the need to identify clinical pathways for the management of such cases.</P>
        <P>The recommendations are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">1. The need to identify clinical pathways relating to management of women with an intrauterine death in third trimester to complement existing medical management policy.</P>
        <P LI="1">2. The Guidelines for Medical Management of Intrauterine Death should be revised in line with a review of the medical literature.</P>
        <P LI="1">3. Details of all patients for Induction of Labour, regardless of place of induction should be centrally documented.</P>
        <P LI="1">4. This recommendation cannot be disclosed as it contains personal, private, sensitive and confidential  information relating to the individual patient.</P><Col N="613"/>
        <P LI="1">5. Develop a brief operational outline of the Gynaecology Department to assist staff who are sent there on an occasional/intermittent basis.</P>
        <P LI="1">6. Due to the complexity of work, there is a need for an updated training needs analysis of all midwifery and nursing staff on the gynaecology ward.</P>
        <P LI="1">7. There should be a designated individual with responsibility for coordinating, monitoring and auditing the Basic Life Support attendance and Advanced Life Support Skills attendance, ideally a designated Resuscitation Training Officer.</P>
        <P LI="1">8. An Obstetric Early Warning System should be introduced and evaluated.</P>
        <P LI="1">9. Install additional phone lines in the ward.</P>
        <P LI="1">10. A review of the possibility of emergency call bells or designated phones for emergencies in each room should be carried out and measures taken to address this.</P>
        <P LI="1">11. Hospital wide analysis of all doorways in clinical areas to establish the feasibility of moving a bed in a critical event.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have been informed by the HSE that all but the 7th recommendation have now been implemented. Discussions are under way in the HSE to bring the implementation of this recommendation to conclusion.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Health and Children has recently been made aware of a serious shortfall in the budget for Long-term Residential Care for this year.  The budget is coming under pressure from, amongst other things, increases in overall costs and increases in net demand for long term care.  Furthermore the HSE has advised that the Long-term Residential Care subhead is also funding services other than those covered by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.  I should <Col N="614"/>point out that we understand these other services, which include therapies and medications, are being provided to people in nursing homes.  The Minister is currently seeking to ensure that only agreed costs are met from the Long-term Residential Care subhead.</P>
        <P>The Minister has sought further information about the level of funding provided for, and the costs drivers impacting on the Long-term Residential Care subhead.  The main priority at this stage is to establish what steps might be taken to allow more people to benefit from the scheme.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, applications for financial support under the scheme will continue to be accepted and processed.  However decisions to grant approval will be subject to the availability of funding.</P>
        <P>A full examination of the funding situation is underway, conducted jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE.</P>
