	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That, not withstanding anything in Standing Orders, or in the Order of the D&aacute;il of 25 January 2011,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(1) the Report and Final Stages of No. 4 should be taken on the conclusion of the Financial Resolutions proposed in respect of Report Stage;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(2) the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of No. 4 shall be brought to a conclusion in accordance with the following timetable:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">Amendments offered to Part 1 to conclude after three hours,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">Amendments offered to Parts 2 to 5 to conclude after one hour and 20 minutes,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">Amendments to Part 6, including Schedules and Fifth Stage, to conclude not later than 5 p.m.,</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(3) where the proceedings have not concluded by the stated time, they shall be brought to a conclusion by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(4) where a division is claimed on the proceedings on No. 4, other than a question put as provided for in accordance with paragraph (3), that is, a guillotine question, the taking of such a division and the putting of any question contingent thereon shall be postponed until</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) immediately before the next time appointed for the putting of a question in accordance with paragraph (3), that is, a guillotine question; or</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>b</i>) in the event of such a question not being put, when proceedings on Report Stage, including on recommital, on the matters which would have been decided by the putting of such a question would have otherwise been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from that, will the Chief Whip or the Minister for Finance indicate to the House the Government&rsquo;s intention with regard to the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and the holding of the general election?  The order that has now been agreed will provide for the completion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I am very happy to deal with the matter because once again Deputy Gilmore has displayed considerable constitutional ignorance.  The Government has no function&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>He will be more successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position, of course, is that the Government does not dissolve the D&aacute;il and has no function in regard to its dissolution.  The President dissolves the D&aacute;il on the advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the courtesy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of the Taoiseach and that is a matter that lies between the President and the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a seminar we do not need now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore, I ask for your co-operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>On that point, I assure the Minister for Finance I am very familiar with the provisions of the Constitution, so familiar, in fact, I understand the constitutional requirement to be that the Taoiseach should offer his resignation when he no longer commands the support of a majority of Members of the House.  That is manifestly the case at&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot open up a debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Hold on a second&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an inappropriate time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are here to discuss the remaining Stages of the Finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a Constitution which clearly states the Taoiseach shall submit his resignation to the President when he no longer has the support of a majority of Members of the House.  That is clearly the case currently and there is precedent for this.  It is a matter for the President to allow the Taoiseach to continue in a caretaker capacity.  When <Col N="811"/>does the Taoiseach intend to comply with the provisions of the Constitution, submit his resignation to the President and make arrangements for the dissolution of the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Noonan and ask him to be brief as we must move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is not irrelevant I would like to return to the order for the Finance Bill as that is what we are here for.  Supposing we proceed more rapidly and Report Stage concludes before 5 p.m., at what time is Fifth Stage scheduled and when will the vote for the passing of the Bill take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It follows automatically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling and procedures of the House, the Government can proceed directly to Fifth Stage if that is the wish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the question because I wonder if it is a satisfactory position for the Whip.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be the sequence as ordered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always the sequence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is always the sequence.  Committee Stage went down last night earlier than expected.  There was no vote at that point.  After Report Stage we will move to Fifth Stage and out of delicacy and interest &mdash; the Whips have a difficult job &mdash; I wonder if the vote is brought forward from 5 p.m. will the troops be lined up?  What would happen if we go down at 2.30 p.m., for example?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy&rsquo;s troops be here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy could have a job that is just as difficult.</P>

	<P>I have allowed the Deputy&rsquo;s party leader to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>With just two Government amendments to the Bill on Report Stage, I suggest it is possible for everybody in the Chamber who wishes to contribute to finish the debate possibly an hour earlier than set out in the schedule.  We would like to be advised of the flexibility available in the event of that possibility becoming a reality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is provided for in the schedule.</P>

	<P>I rise to oppose the guillotine placed on Report Stage of the Finance Bill.  I am conscious that last night the debate fell on certain sections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have put the question and the House has agreed it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="812"/>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>This relates to the ordering of the business of the House today and the timeframe being set out for different stages.  I raised the matter yesterday.  We took 88 amendments in what is probably the most crucial part of the Finance Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This has already been agreed and we cannot revisit the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in one hour and 20 minutes of debate.  There is no reason not to allow it if Deputies want to allow the debate to continue later in the night.  We are paid to be here and should stay until 11 p.m. or midnight.  If the debate falls before that, so be it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We had unanimity on this all of ten minutes ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be flexibility and I oppose the ordering of the business of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>We must move on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We stayed until the end of the debate last night.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in did not even table an amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no provision for this type of debate on the ordering of business this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The party did not put down amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>We did.  The Deputy should look at the list.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Doherty should resume his seat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>She should read the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are moving on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Whip provide clarity on the point?  As I understand it, the order provides that the amendments offered to Part 1 should conclude after three hours.  Given that effectively all the amendments deal with Part 1, there could be a position where the House would have dealt with the grouping by 1.45 p.m.  The question is whether we can have more time if we have only dealt with 28 of the 52 amendments by that time?  This would ensure that the House could reach all the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an agreed schedule for the business today and the Government will comply with it.  If there are reasonable requests for variations, we will examine them as we proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the way to deal with the matter.  I do not wish to get involved in the ordering of the House beyond that.  Deputy Gilmore introduced an extraneous matter which I must refer to as he was allowed to deal with the matter on the record of the House. <Col N="813"/> He suggested that the Taoiseach was somehow under an obligation to furnish his resignation forthwith but he is not.  The procedures of the House govern this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He is obliged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>By agreement, the motions of confidence have been deferred until next Tuesday.  The House must express its will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not have the support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach made the point the other day that for too long there has been a constant insinuation that properly constituted and nominated officeholders, appointed by the President, have no authority because they do not have a mandate arising from an opinion poll or from an undefined and ascertained parliamentary procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the clear implication of Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s comments this morning and from the last two years.  Now that we are submitting ourselves to the people, we should show a little more respect for our representative institutions.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TAX EXPENDITURES</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">1.&mdash;The Minister shall within one month from the passing of this Act prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures provided for by this Act, setting out the costs of tax foregone, and the benefits in terms of job creation or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">To advise the House, what speaking times are available on Report Stage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chief Whip has outlined the arrangements.  On Report Stage all Members may speak twice on each amendment or group of amendments, with second contributions not exceeding two minutes.  The Member who moves the amendment retains the right of reply; effectively, the mover of an amendment may speak three times &mdash; a contribution when <Col N="814"/>moving the amendment, a second contribution of two minutes and a third contribution to conclude the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move this amendment on behalf of the Labour Party.  It makes a provision that all tax expenditure and schemes would be subject to a full cost-benefit analysis to be published.  If the D&aacute;il and Fianna F&aacute;il while in government had adopted this approach, particularly after 1997 and 1998, we probably would not have had the kind of economic crash which the country has since suffered.  Last year in the debate on the Finance Bill the Minister brought forward new tax expenditure schemes relating to tax reliefs for certain kinds of actions.  At the time, the D&aacute;il accepted an amendment in the name of the Labour Party to provide that one month after the publication of the Finance Bill, a cost-benefit analysis on tax expenditures would be published.  The report was published.</P>
        <P>I cannot see why the Minister would not agree, in a spirit of bipartisanship, to committing to a cost-benefit analysis.  We have a number of schemes in the Finance Bill today, particularly a series of schemes which change the rules in various ways with regard to companies spending money for business expansion.  The old business expansion scheme is being transformed into a new scheme with higher investment capacity which is focused on employment and innovation.  Where tax incentives are used, they should be for stimulating employment, growth and innovation with the goals of long-term employment and job creation.  However, unless we have a detailed table showing the implications of each new scheme, it is impossible to determine what will be the relevant scheme&rsquo;s ultimate effects.</P>
        <P>As the Minister will be aware, the amendment to the Bill regarding changes in the business expansion scheme runs to tens of pages.  It is probable that only professional tax consultants and lawyers are able to fully understand it.  This is the democratic gap that arises with such schemes.  To be incorporated into law, they must be the subject of immensely detailed technical legislation, the detail of which most parliamentarians are not equipped to understand.  For this reason, parliamentarians and members of the public require a summary explanation of the costs, benefits, employment creation and innovation support that changes in a scheme involve.  Such information would enable us to make rational decisions on whether a scheme is worthwhile or targeted to benefit a select few.</P>
        <P>The critical issue in the economic crisis into which this country has been brought is that we have hollowed out our tax system through the introduction of a range of tax breaks and expenditures.  While tax breaks and expenditures have a role in stimulating employment, investment and growth, we are buying a pig in a poke when we allow the D&aacute;il to pass into law tax breaks and expenditures which, as we know from recent history, end up being used and abused to feed a construction bubble.  It was this approach, combined with the crazy behaviour of bankers and their associates, that brought the economy crashing down.</P>
        <P>If we are to learn any lessons from what went wrong and try to avoid it being repeated in the future, we need a simple explanation of tax reliefs and schemes setting out their costs, benefits and duration and indicating who is likely to utilise them.  We specifically want information indicating whether a scheme will enable someone with an income in excess of &euro;1 million to avoid paying tax when ordinary taxpayers are contributing at such a heavy rate, as they will have discovered when they opened their wage packets this month.  This is what the amendment boils down to.</P>
        <P>We saw from annual Revenue reports published in recent years that many people on incomes of more than &euro;2 million per annum ended up with a tax rate of less than 20% because they were able to use tax shelters to shield their income in a manner that is not available to other taxpayers.  If we are to emerge from the current economic morass, we must have a tax system <Col N="815"/>which taxes moderately and fairly and under which everyone makes a contribution.  The problem with tax shelters is that they have been used and abused by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to provide tax reliefs to people close to the party who are involved in the construction, development and financial services industries.  The beneficiaries may lobby for and laud such reliefs but they have hollowed out our tax system and, as a consequence, ordinary people must make a much heavier tax contribution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister agreed to this simple amendment last year.  On the final day of the 30th D&aacute;il and in a spirit of bipartisanship, besides apologising, I want the Fianna F&aacute;il Party to do the right thing for once in the interests of economic recovery and repairing a society that has been broken by its mismanagement of the economy over 13 long years.  That is my net point.</P>
        <P>I heard the new leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party being contrite in a generalised way about the actions of the party that has ruined the country and economy.  While this is helpful for moving on, contrition is also being offered by way of this simple amendment proposing the publication of cost-benefit analyses.  If Fianna F&aacute;il and its new leader are contrite, they have an opportunity to show contrition simply and at no cost by accepting the amendment.  It involves nothing more than the publication of clear cost-benefit analyses of various schemes.  The party&rsquo;s position will tell us if the words of Deputy Martin yesterday were just talk or whether there is, to use the old phrase, a firm purpose of amendment in the approach he outlined yesterday.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke in support of this amendment on Committee Stage.  It is particularly welcome because it focuses on job creation, an area that is missing from the Bill.  I tabled amendments on Committee Stage and have tabled further amendments on Report Stage.  One of my Committee Stage amendments proposed a stimulus package for jobs.  It would be illogical for the Government not to accept the simple amendment before us.  As Deputy Burton indicated, it does not impose a charge on the Exchequer but requires only that a cost-benefit analysis be laid before the Houses.</P>
        <P>We hear a great deal about political reform.  I am one of the sceptics who believe the type of political reform many people seek will not materialise because of a lack of will.  A real starting point would be for the Government to provide information to other political parties on analyses of the costs and benefits of tax reliefs provided for in the Finance Bill.  To be the best legislators and make correct decisions in the interests of those whom we represent, we must have the full information at our disposal.  The facts and figures on tax reliefs devised by the Department of Finance are only available to the Government party and possibly only the Minister for Finance.  It is also possible that a trawl for this information has not been done, in which case one must ask what is the reason this information is not available.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">If we are to get out of the mess in which we find ourselves, information should be shared and the impact of tax reliefs introduced in the Finance Bill examined to ascertain how they affect the Exchequer and citizens.  Although we are consumed with our deficit, the need to balance the books and how we will deal with the banks and engage with the International Monetary Fund and European Union, Ireland is not a set of accounts but a nation of people.  While it is necessary to balance the books and determine what are the effects of the measures introduced in the Finance Bill, we must also examine what affects they will have on real people in real communities.  On that basis, the Government should agree to this sensible amendment requiring that analysis be done to determine how tax reliefs measure up against job creation.</P>
        <P>I speak one day after the devastating and crippling news emerged that 124 jobs will be lost in Gallagher&rsquo;s Bakery in my constituency.  The announcement did not receive anything like the attention it deserves.  The loss of 124 jobs in the small community of Ardara in west Donegal <Col N="816"/>is the equivalent of thousands of jobs being lost in Dublin city centre.  The matter has not received the necessary focus or media and ministerial attention.  The Ministers for Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Innovation should travel to Ardara to meet representatives of Gallagher&rsquo;s Bakery and discuss what they can do to retain 124 jobs.</P>
    
        <P>It is a home-grown company that has provided so much to the area, as well as additional revenue in terms of spin-offs for other companies relying on that business.  That has not happened, however, because in reality the Government has closed down.</P>
        <P>We know that this is the last piece of legislation to come before the 30th D&aacute;il, so it is about Government Deputies saving their own jobs rather than worrying about jobs that are being lost in the real economy.  Even at this late stage, I am appealing for action to be taken.  I understand the company is meeting with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and Enterprise Ireland this morning, so I appeal for direct ministerial intervention to try to do the best that is possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I am saying that tax reliefs are valuable in certain circumstances.  They are valuable if, as a direct consequence, they provide employment.  As we have seen, however, tax reliefs can be damaging if they are not for the benefit of the economy or the people, but only a select few.  Unfortunately, this country has been consumed by tax reliefs that have benefitted builders but, as we know, that over-heated the property market and in turn crippled the country with debt.  The Minister should agree to this amendment which does not cost the Exchequer anything.  It is about providing the best information to all Deputies so that we can legislate to best effect.</P>
        <P>Over the next four weeks we will be discussing many issues, one of which is political reform.  In the spirit of those discussions and as a starting point before the election campaign kicks off in earnest, we could have a real change of direction by publishing information that should be made available in any case by the Department of Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment in general terms.  It is a good idea and should be normal practice when a Minister proposes changes in the tax code and particularly ones that involve tax increases.  This arises from our previous debate on tax breaks, specifically on section 23 and capital allowances.  While some people are against these in principle, I am not.  By and large, people respond to the profit motive and if such a tax break is introduced they will respond to it.  If the way in which they behave gives an economic or social benefit to the wider community it is worth examining the proposed tax break.  As I said on Committee Stage, we have seen examples of where such breaks were quite beneficial.  For example, tax breaks have stimulated inner-city regeneration projects all over the world, starting in some American cities and then in Europe.</P>
        <P>I recall that in the 1980s the late John Boland, as a Government Minister, was one of the great advocates of tax breaks.  He applied a series of them to derelict inner-city areas, which were successful at a time when there was little such activity to provide jobs.  More than anything else, they removed acres of dereliction from city centres.  In my own city of Limerick, 39 acres of derelict sites were designated within half a mile of the city centre.  They were all rebuilt and it was a good development project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other tax breaks were provided for social purposes.  I remember when it was virtually impossible for families to get any relative into a nursing home because there were not enough homes and consequently insufficient beds.   A tax break was provided by a former Minister for Finance, <Col N="817"/>Charlie McCreevy, which provoked a rush to build and invest in nursing homes.  That provision had beneficial social consequences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem with tax breaks is when they become an industry driven by tax lawyers for the purposes of tax avoidance.  One of the objectives of that industry is to enable people to turn income into wealth at the expense of the taxpayer.  The crucial concept is that tax breaks designed to turn income into wealth are of no benefit to the wider community.  It works very simply in that instead of paying the tax one should pay to the Revenue Commissioners, one gets a break.  One then converts that tranche of income into a house, apartment, hotel or some other kind of fixed asset.  Consequently, a small group of people is increasingly enriched.  The common factor in all such tax breaks, however, is that if unpaid tax is used to convert income into a fixed asset, certain individuals are enriched.  It is therefore a device for turning income into wealth, which is of no benefit to the wider community.  It hurts the wider community because the income paid to the Revenue is used for social and economic purposes by the State, but if certain income is forgone then there is no such benefit.  All budgetary measures should therefore be analysed carefully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a flaw in our budgetary system that proposals from the Minister for Finance are, in the first instance, examined to see how much money they will yield.  The test is tax yield or tax forgone.  The second analysis is the political effect of the proposed measure and whether the party proposing it will lose or gain votes as a result.  However, there is no real assessment of the social or economic effect of many such measures.  There is a crossover between political fallout and social effect but when a tax break is being introduced there should be an analysis of its economic and social effect.  The tax forgone should also be assessed, in addition to the potential yield of a tax increase.  In view of the business we are in, there is an assessment of the political impact but not of the social or economic impacts.  In general terms, therefore, I agree with the proposition in the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I broadly support this important amendment.  We have had a valuable public debate on institutional reform during which I suggested that a working democracy requires moving from dealing just with political power and accountability to dealing with administrative power and accountability.  On earlier Stages, I cited examples in this regard.  I suggested that people often try to achieve legislative change through advocacy.  However, if they are excluded from the process of administering that legislative change it can often come to nothing.  That is the view of those who have been analysing political systems in Europe, including a leading theorist whom I quoted in my speech on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>I wish to make another point that, unfortunately, has not surfaced in the public debate so far.  Important professions in this country have been degraded by the actions of some of their members.  As a former Member of the Seanad, I recall that when the Finance Bill came to the Upper House &mdash; as it will later this week &mdash; the legislation was analysed in great detail by some Senators.  I often wondered why they were dealing with the Bill in such detail.  I knew the answer within a few months, however, when I read the publications from their legal or accountancy firms.   The profession of accountancy, the legal profession and other related professions have served this country very poorly in terms of their scrutiny of some of their practitioners.  Their investigations into certain practices tend to be rather cumbersome and often happen very late after the fact.</P>
        <P>I would like to say something else that may be quite shocking.  I am afraid it is slightly different from what Deputy Noonan has been saying.  I believe in a republic.  If one is to take that seriously, one has to commit oneself to transparency.  We need a kind of professional practice that tries to illuminate the consequences of legislation, rather than one that seeks to hide facts from the public.  It might sound like an arcane view on my part, but it happens to be <Col N="818"/>my strong view that there is something lesser about a professional practice that seeks to remove benefit from the people in general through the taxation system.  During one of the most colourful debates I can remember on a finance Bill, the late Oliver J. Flanagan added some particularly valuable theological colour to his lecture on the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion by comparing it to the difference between venial and mortal sin.  We have moved on, but the standard in professional practice has not moved on.  I wanted to take this opportunity to make that point because when I was a young student of commerce, I examined the obligations that flowed from signing off on one&rsquo;s balance sheet of assets.  I am simply saying that what has happened in recent times in the professions has served us badly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will move on to discuss what this specific amendment has to say.  Its contents would be of value to any future Minister for Finance of any party.  Ministers are not required to effect the kind of omniscience that they find valuable, although some of them think it necessary to do so.  They are required to make proposals that may or may not work.  Some of their proposals are unsuccessful.  If it is agreed that the best way of testing whether something is successful is by reference to its intent in terms of social benefit, as well as the economic benefit to those participating in it, why does the Minister not accept this amendment and get on with it?  The great advantage of this proposal is that it would require the Minister of the day to say that when he introduced a measure, it was his hope that certain people would participate in it, that it would have certain consequences and that it would lead to the transfers about which Deputy Noonan spoke.  What is wrong with stating that the investment in question should be judged on whether it facilitated job creation, assisted social inclusion and was to the spatial advantage of communities?</P>
        <P>In the old days, chartered accountants used to sit down with their clients and occasionally pick up some original documents.  There has been a big change in the modern crisis practices that I mentioned.  A partner in the firm now has lunch with the client to secure his account, brings in a small army of lower paid people to do the drudge work and has lunch with the client again when the time comes to hand over the bill.  All of these institutions have to change.  If the Minister of the day finds that his proposal has not had the desired effect because after he made it, a small army in the predator section of one of these unreformed institutions &mdash; they have a long way to go &mdash; decided to go after it, he can change it.  In such circumstances, the Minister would be entitled to the respect of the other side of the House.  He or she would have my respect as well.  This is a valuable amendment because it provides for administrative justice and democracy, offers transparency and represents a small gesture towards improving standards in professions that need to improve.  I am sure the Minister for Finance, who has been one of the more thoughtful members of the Cabinet for a long time, will consider accepting the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the most important of all the amendments that will be discussed on Report Stage.  It is seeking to provide a framework, a rationale and some underlying principles for any decision to forgo taxes.  It aims to clarify the benefits of doing so.  Why should the taxpayers of this nation forgo a range of taxes and tax reliefs in the absence of a costing of what the benefit to the country will be?  That is the nub of the matter.  This amendment proposes that the Department of Finance &ldquo;shall within one month&rdquo; have conducted &ldquo;a cost-benefit analysis of&rdquo; the range of tax reliefs included in this Bill.  I expect the departmental officials will throw up their hands in absolute dismay at the thought of being required to take such action within such a space of time.  I accept it would be difficult to do.  It is obvious that the work in question should have been done before the budget was introduced and this Bill was presented.  We need to put down a marker that no further tax reliefs will be introduced to benefit wealthy landlords, <Col N="819"/>large pension funds and property developers &mdash; they have already been enriched and any such benefits would enrich them further &mdash; unless there is a return to taxpayers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>At this difficult time of recession, there should be a return in the specific areas of job retention and creation.  Such a link should be made.</P>
        <P>When I read the Minister&rsquo;s speech, I was disappointed by the section that indicated he intends to undertake research and preparation on property-related tax expenditure, and subsequently publish his findings, before he introduces cutbacks to existing tax reliefs.  He said that although the property-related tax expenditure provisions which were announced in the budget are retained in sections 22 and 23 of the Bill, the Government has decided they will be subject to a commencement provision which may only take effect in the next tax year after the preparation and publication of an economic impact assessment on the proposed changes.  Anybody in their right mind would expect that all of this would have taken place before these proposals were made on budget day or introduced in the Finance Bill.  As it is, the proposals have been made but are on hold until some future stage.  The Minister will not be in a position to ensure they are implemented in the future.  A new Government will deal with the matter.  The Government is reneging on a commitment that was made on budget day by not delivering it in the context of the Finance Bill.  It should have known before it made its budget day commitment that the research had not been done.  Why is it being done now, <i>post factum</i>?  It is another way of removing the proposal, which is not a good enough way of conducting business.</P>
        <P>If the amendment being proposed by Deputy Burton had been in place, all of the necessary homework would have been done.  We would have seen a cost-benefit analysis of the continuation of any property-related or pension-related tax reliefs.  That is how we should be moving forward.  There is an example of a good provision in a later section of this Bill.  The Minister has proposed to offer tax relief with regard to the energy efficiency of residential premises in the State.  This welcome measure will create jobs and stimulate employment.  Although we will forgo income tax in that respect, it is obvious that there will be a return to the State from it.  It is an example of what this amendment proposes to achieve.  Unfortunately, even on a desirable project such as that, there will be tax relief of only &euro;30 million per annum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have seen obscene figures for the total value of tax reliefs to the people who benefit from it; some economists say it is in the region of &euro;11 billion annually.  I do not know what is the Department of Finance figure but economists said last year in Killarney at the annual IBEC get-together that the amount of tax forgone annually in tax reliefs for various sectors that have benefited outrageously from such policies is &euro;11 billion.  It has got totally out of hand.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to know the total quantity of tax forgone and we then need to establish a framework to ensure that we have a rationale and basic underlying principles for tax reliefs in the future.  Most importantly, any reliefs must be of substantial benefit to the community.  In this time of recession, they should be directed towards the area that would be most of benefit, which is job creation and retention.</P>

	<P>Deputy Burton appealed for support for her amendment on the basis of bipartisanship and then introduced a rather partisan version of modern Irish economic history, which is understandable given the proximity of the poll.  I was pleased to hear Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin make the point this morning, which was widely reported, that our expenditure base was too high and our revenue base was too low.  I am sure Deputy Burton recalls I made that point the centrepiece of my Budget Statement in October 2008.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have all been practising in sackcloth and ashes for some time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many worthy sentiments were expressed in the House this morning.  Of course job creation is important.  Deputy Pearse Doherty argued that the Bill lacked any employment incentives.  The budget contained numerous job creation incentives.  Quite apart from the need to ensure economic stability, the Bill provides for the employment and investment incentive scheme and reliefs for energy efficiency works, as well as an extension of the film relief, which has generated an amount of activity.  There are a number of other matters which I hope we will have an opportunity to consider in what remains of this debate.</P>
        <P>While I do not propose to accept the amendment, I must make the point that economic impact assessments of two measures in this year&rsquo;s Bill will be undertaken.  The House will be aware that the issue of cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures was examined by the Commission on Taxation, which was of the opinion that tax expenditures should be subject to ongoing evaluation and appropriate and timely cost-benefit analysis.  Under the Finance Act 2010, there was a cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures following the acceptance of an amendment from Deputy Burton, although her proposed period of one month for completing the report was extended to three months by a Government amendment.  In order to undertake the report suggested by this amendment, my officials and those of the Revenue Commissioners would need appropriate data from tax returns.  The commission acknowledged that such a requirement would add complexity and volume to standard tax return forms and increase compliance costs for taxpayers.</P>
        <P>I agree it is desirable to provide for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to ensure that tax expenditures remain fit for the purposes for which they were designed and that they continue to be economically efficient.  It could be argued it is reasonable and proportionate that where taxpayers are availing of tax expenditures they should supply such information to the Revenue Commissioners.  However, I trust the House will understand that given the current economic position, I do not consider this an appropriate time to introduce additional complexity and cost for hard-pressed taxpayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will make a few points on the amendment itself.  One month is an insufficient time, as I pointed out.  Second, as stated in last year&rsquo;s cost-benefit analysis report, there is an underlying principle of proportionality in cost-benefit analysis which states that the level of resources invested in carrying out the analysis should be commensurate with the scale of the expenditure involved.  Third, this is not the time to conduct cost-benefit analyses of all tax expenditures in the Bill, which involve a total of 13 sections.  Deputies will be aware that another finance Bill will need to be passed before 1 April to give effect to the civil partnership Act and possibly to other measures which have had to be postponed because of the truncated timescale for this Bill.  Given the pressing issues facing the economy and the country, including the possible change of Government and of ministerial personnel, it would not be a good use of the Department&rsquo;s time to produce a cost-benefit analysis of measures in this Bill at the same time as it prepares for a new finance Bill and, very possibly although not necessarily, for a new political regime with different policy requirements from those of the current Government.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Burton that the completion of cost-benefit analysis is warranted in the majority of tax expenditures before they are introduced.  As mentioned in the context of the current Bill, my officials have already prepared an economic impact assessment for the employment and investment incentive scheme.  This assessment will be completed shortly and I intend it will be published.  With regard to the new relief for energy-efficient measures, a similar <Col N="821"/>advance assessment will be prepared before the section is commenced, and that measure is subject to a commencement order.  A cost-benefit analysis of tax expenditures before their introduction is more appropriate than an analysis after the event.  For that reason and for the others mentioned, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>Deputy Higgins made an eloquent case for the general principle of conducting cost-benefit analyses, and it has become an established administrative practice within my Department irrespective of legislative vesture.  The crucial tax reliefs provided for in the Bill &mdash; the new employment and investment incentive and the energy efficiency works incentive &mdash; will be subject to cost-benefit analysis.  As a matter of practice, this matter is already being attended to.</P>
        <P>With regard to Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s theological reflections on the distinction between tax evasion and tax avoidance, I do not think his comparison to the contrast between mortal and venial sin is quite accurate.  In terms of the theology of that era, I would prefer to say it is the distinction between the natural and the artificial method.</P>

	<P>Can we keep to the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  There was a famous professor from Cork in the Seanad when I started out, who argued that condoms could be as dangerous as liqueur chocolates were in their day, when he had originally spoken on the Intoxicating Liquor Act.  History would want to be charitable to him.</P>
        <P>I will be brief in replying to the Minister.  What I have to say is important.  When people speak about cost-benefit analysis, they are not talking only about monetary consequences but also about social consequences.  The next Government, and those that follow it, must test everything they do for its job creation potential and economic activity, measured in social terms.  Perhaps it is because I am leaving the D&aacute;il, and I hope its officials will forgive me, but after my long analysis over the years of the officials in the Department of Finance, I feel they need to move on.  They must accept the theoretical thinking that cost-benefit analysis must be considered in view of the social dimension rather than just the narrow economic one.  I also think they must abandon the Sir Humphrey principle that if it is good we have considered it and if it is not good we did not bother with it.  The fact of the matter is that they, too, occasionally make mistakes.  It is important that the Department is entirely open to testing new measures.  I say this with no enmity but solely with the intention of being practical.</P>
        <P>More recent events are in my favour in this regard.  For example, if we consider what Regling and Watson suggest were the consequences of measures whose implications were relatively unexamined, they allude, frankly, to matters that are social.  I am not saying &mdash; because I would be quickly corrected &mdash; that the Department of Finance is unaware of social implications, but I can say without any contradiction that both the Department of Finance and economic and social&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Yes.  I am finishing with this sentence.  What I have to say also applies to what was the Economic Research Institute but became the Economic and Social Research Institute.  Frankly, it is past time that we had rigorous examinations of the social consequences.  The issue should not be the yield in terms of tax forgone, but people should be invited to pay their tax in social solidarity to make a contribution to creating employment.  That <Col N="822"/>is the thinking we need.  The notion that the world moves on the motivation of profit and the acquisition of wealth is as dead as the dodo, but unfortunately not before it has brought about horrific consequences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It has always been the interpretation, wish and determination of Government and the Minister for Finance to the effect that there is a job creation aspect to measures that are being brought forward in this Bill and indeed in other finance Bills.  To go back to a point made by Deputy Noonan and reflected upon by Deputy Higgins, the social dimension is very much apparent.  We only have to look at the areas of regeneration right around the country, say, Ballymun, Fatima, the Dublin docks, Limerick, etc., to find that the social dimension is plain to be seen.  Deputy Noonan knows that from his own city and we have seen the fruits of this already.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there might have been some bad press about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in recent times, anybody can see that at this stage there is a whole new community there in the docks area.  People who never would have sought second-level education are now in secondary school, and there are even people going on to third level in this area, which was unheard of ten or 15 years ago.  Therefore there is a social dimension and a job creation aspect to finance Bills, as indeed there is in this one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to press the amendment, a Cheann Comhairle, because this goes to the heart of why the economy collapsed and why so many people are suffering unemployment and many of the young have very little immediate prospect of getting work.  Basically, we hear tax breaks work because we have a hunch they will actually encourage this person or that to invest.  Of course everybody wants to see derelict run-down areas in any town or city being redeveloped.  My first involvement in politics was in relation to large parts of Dublin city centre falling down; people were being killed when houses collapsed on them. </P>
        <P Just="Left">However, it is not good enough to say one wants to redevelop if the system then turns that redevelopment process into a type of casino lottery win for super-wealthy people.  The social dividend must go not just to the developers but to the ordinary taxpayers.  In future, if we decide to exempt certain people or actions from tax, we must have evidence which says it is worthwhile not to charge this or that section the full range of taxes, because we will get jobs and development.  What Fianna F&aacute;il did became the trigger for a mighty episode of gambling and mad speculation on property.  This morning, for instance, we see we are going to have fields all around every town in Ireland, because people speculated on buying four fields, say, for some enormous housing development that will never happen.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il was in contrition mode yesterday.  It used to be the case that there was confession, but we have never yet had a confession from Fianna F&aacute;il for what it did.  We had some contrition, yesterday, but there is the purpose of amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Amendment No. 2 seeks to require the Government to publish within a month of the Finance Bill being passed information about the bonuses earned by bankers.  I do not know whether Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot have been used by the Department of Finance, but there has been the strange case of the missing information about the bonuses paid to bank staff since the bank guarantee.  I and other Deputies have asked the Minister for Finance over the last year whether he would come clean and find out from the institutions bailed out by the taxpayer the level of bonuses they paid to staff in each year since the guarantee, that is, since September 2008.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, it has been extremely difficult to extract this information.  Banks are very anxious to tell us about their wonderful contributions to this, that and the other but they are extremely diffident and shy.  They are somewhat akin to the lesser spotted something or other.  One would have to go deep into the undergrowth to figure out what bonuses, exactly, are paid by banks.  What we know, after a good deal of parliamentary questioning, is that in the period since the guarantee, the banks, other than Bank of Ireland, have paid about &euro;40 million in bonuses and next month I understand AIB has another &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million in bonuses to pay which it says it has committed to.  We know that Anglo Irish Bank has paid &euro;21 million in bonuses since the guarantee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The bonus culture destroyed the banks.  It turned bankers not into people who managed relationships for customers, particularly small to medium-sized businesses, but into bonus earners.  If they sold products, regardless of how risky, they got very fine fat fees and many of them ended up earning incomes of several million because of the bonus culture.  This undoubtedly made many of the people at the top in the banks reckless in the extreme.  They gave crazy loans for projects that would never happen.  They gave loans for developments of massive quantities of housing and industrial development in areas where, even in a century from now, there would not be a sufficiently high population numbers to support those levels of development.  It is the considered view of the Labour Party, which I believe is shared by many of our social democratic colleagues in Europe and elsewhere, that bankers need to have some disciplinary framework imposed on them.  We need to call a halt to the bonus culture and the reckless decision-making that it gave rise to.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What we want to know, to start off with, is what happened to these Bank of Ireland bonuses.  When I got the answer to my parliamentary questions there was a little asterisk and a blank line where the Bank of Ireland data should have been to say that the information was not <Col N="824"/>available.  I thought that they had reclassified bonuses, and perhaps that is what they sought to do.   The institutions bailed out by the State have an obligation to put what they paid in bonuses into the public domain for the information of taxpayers.  The point I made about Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot was that the Minister recently confessed to me that a high-level, urgent investigation is taking place in the Department of Finance into the Bank of Ireland bonus figures.  I am not sure who is Miss Marple and who is Hercule Poirot in the Department of Finance but this particular amendment, if passed, will require our sleuths in the Department of Finance, one month after the passing of the Finance Bill, to publish information about all bonuses paid since the guarantee by the banks and institutions the taxpayer bailed out.  This is a reasonable requirement in a modern democracy where we are trying to come to terms with the economic disaster that has overtaken us because of mismanagement by Fianna F&aacute;il.  As Fianna F&aacute;il leaves office and possibly goes out of government, it is incumbent on the party in the last days of that Administration to publish this information.  It is very difficult for this country to move on from the banking disaster unless we have a full telling of who did what and, in respect of bonuses, who got what.</P>
        <P>We are not talking about small bonuses for staff in call centres and banks.  Such people may be on the minimum wage which is increased slightly by the payment of bonuses.  This is not what we are talking about.  I refer to the people at the top of the banks, who were making millions of euro per annum.  At one stage, the former chief executive of Bank of Ireland told a shocked Irish public that his income had fallen to below &euro;2 million a year because of the cuts he had taken.  He clearly felt sorry for himself and that he had made a major national sacrifice.  Publishing this information is part of giving a sense of control to our citizens so that there is some level of accountability required and demanded of the banking institutions that are costing us so much and will cost us so much to bail out.  I commend the Labour Party amendment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Burton but I have no expectation the Government will accept it, irrespective of how good it is.  There has been a crazy convention during my period in this House whereby the Government refuses to accept Opposition amendments.  It will not accept this amendment or any other in this grouping because the Government has closed down and is operating in a perfunctory manner so that it can get through to Monday or Tuesday of next week when the Taoiseach will go to the park and finally dissolve this D&aacute;il, allowing for an election to bring in a new Government.  It is depressing to be standing here two and a half years after the major banking crisis and discussing a situation that should have been resolved long ago, where the banks appear to be a law unto themselves and accurate information is still not coming through to this House and the representatives of the people of this State.  I see no prospect of that regime &mdash; the Government-banker relationship &mdash; altering in the next few days.  It will be more of the same.  The Government will allow the banks to paddle their own canoe while pouring billions of euros of taxpayers' money into the banks to try to keep them barely standing.  It is beyond belief.  I look forward to a new Government, of whatever hue, being more open on this point and being more forceful in dealing with this bonus crisis.</P>
        <P>Hopefully it will also deal with the bondholders because we remain tied to the private debt of banks, where private international speculators sent money into private investment schemes here, called banks, which were not underwritten by the taxpayers or the Government.  Nevertheless, the taxpayers are expected to pick up the tab for all of that.  It beggars belief that it is happening.  We can consider other examples, such as Iceland, which dealt with this in a more proactive way.  Iceland is beginning to move forward at long last.  We have been through this more than enough.</P>

	<P>This problem is persisting and is not improving because of the way the Government has dealt with it.  Had the Government taken a different course of action, we would not be in the mess we are in today.  I hold no hope that this Government will do anything about it at this late stage.  They will sleepwalk through until Tuesday.  Let us get on with the job of bringing in a new Government of some kind.  It would have to be better than the current Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Other speakers referred to the extent that the bonus system caused great difficulties in banking.  Certain officers, particularly at senior level in banks, were incentivised to be reckless.  That was the bottom line of the bonus culture.  Bonuses related to activity or profit generated by senior bankers contained the seeds of the downfall of the banks.  It is a culture that spread from the United States to London, other main financial centres and into Ireland.  We have seen the consequences of it.</P>
        <P>Regarding the amendment before us, I do not like the idea of publishing lists of names of people in any particular profession.  Ireland is a small country and there is always the risk of scapegoating.  It would be sufficient to meet the concerns in the House for a list of the number of people at different levels and the bonuses received was published.  The Government could publish the range of bonuses and the fact that a certain number of bank managers received a bonus.  Publishing the names and details of employees is something I do not like and there are other ways of achieving the same end.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to explain to us how Bank of Ireland gave bonuses and the Department of Finance did not know about it.  There is a well-developed banking division in the Department of Finance and in a situation where Bank of Ireland is a covered institution and there is Government policy on bonuses, they should not have been paid without the Department of Finance being aware of it.  We have had no explanation of what happened.</P>
        <P>There is a case made that some divisions of banks are profitable and that the employees there deserve bonuses because they were not in loss-making divisions.  Investment banking has been profitable in the past number of years.  There should be a renegotiation of contracts in order to reward people in a different way.  If this was a large garage that became insolvent and had to be bailed out, the salesman selling Land Rovers would not receive commission simply because he made a profit on the sale of Land Rovers when everyone else was losing their shirts and driving the garage into hock.  To talk about the profitability of a particular division in an insolvent institution and argue that the taxpayer should subsidise bonuses given to people working in that division lacks logic and does not stand up to normal commercial scrutiny.</P>
        <P>I agree with the spirit of the amendment but I would not find it acceptable to have lists of names of employees down to the most junior who receive bonuses.  A line must be drawn somewhere.  It might be possible that the names of people with the top ten most lucrative bonuses would be published but it is not appropriate that the names of every person who got a bonus down to the girl in the call centre who got a few euros at Christmas should be published, listed and held up to opprobrium and ridicule.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In a sense this has been an unreal debate because the Government has tabled an amendment to address the question of bankers&rsquo; bonuses.  I would have preferred <Col N="826"/>to have had more time to formulate that amendment.  However, the Finance Bill was formulated in circumstances of haste, published earlier than it would normally be and when the Government became a minority Government, there was an insistence that the Bill be processed with great haste, which is also being done.  Fortunately, through the industry of my officials, we are in position to submit an amendment, which is part of the Report Stage consideration, which will deal with bankers&rsquo; bonuses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a sense, I do not believe there is much point discussing the merits of this amendment but I assure Deputy Noonan the issue about which he raised concern in the proposed amendment before us, namely, striking the right balance between publication and the power of the Revenue to investigate matters with the necessary confidentiality, which it requires, and the protection of the privacy of individuals where it is appropriate in the Government amendment.  These balances are not, as Deputy Noonan rightly said, struck in this amendment, but it has been superseded by the fact that the Government has tabled an amendment.  I am content to leave it at that stage.</P>
        <P>Naturally, the opportunity of this amendment was used by Deputies Morgan and Burton to give again a very inaccurate political history of the banking crisis in recent years.  The first point that everyone must recognise and that, I note, does not feature in this public debate is the fact that the European Central Bank happily has supported the Irish banking system to the extent of more than &euro;100 billion.  It provided the Irish banking system with the necessary funding when a very substantial flight of money out of our banking system took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>It had to do that to save the euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The bulk of that flight of money took place because of a loss of corporate deposits, not bond finance, which is term debt and which expires at certain dates.  Corporate deposits were crucial to the funding and the excessive funding that took place in the banks during the period culminating in 2007.  Those corporate deposits and that base was eroded out of the Irish banking system and happily the European Central Bank provided us with the necessary collateral to ensure that the banking system did not collapse.</P>
        <P>The Government guarantee also assisted in ensuring that a collapse did not take place.  It has been pointed out time and again that were a collapse permitted, we would have had mass unemployment.  Despite all the old guff about jobs from Deputy Morgan and others, that is what would have happened.  In fairness to the Deputy, he saw the merit of that argument when he voted for the guarantee.  I will give him credit for that.</P>

     <P Just="Center" el="5">EXAMINATION OF TARGETED VAT REDUCTION FOR LABOUR INTENSIVE SERVICES</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">1.&mdash;The Minister for Finance shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on the potential economic stimulus impact, and cost benefit analysis, of a targeted VAT reduction for labour intensive services.&rdquo;.</P>
       <P FLI="0" el="5">Essentially, this amendment seeks the preparation of a report on the potential economic stimulus impact and cost-benefit analysis of a targeted VAT reduction for labour intensive services.  Such a measure has been tried in other countries.  In the context of employment creation in places of employment such as pubs, restaurants and hairdressing establishments, this amendment proposes that VAT would be reduced on the employment content of the costs of such businesses to enable them to be in a better position to recruit staff.  In other words, it would cost them less to so do.  We are not seeking that such a measure be introduced now.  In view of the fact that other countries have tried such a measure, we believe it is worth exploring if it would lead to the creation of additional jobs in such businesses.</P>
 </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the spirit of this amendment.  We did some work on this area in the Fine Gael Party prior to the budget.  The House knows that one of the conditions negotiated by the Government with the IMF and the European institutions is that the higher rate of VAT at 21% will be increased to 23% in two moves of a 1% increase on each occasion.  When we examined this in our party we decided that it would be worth forgoing some of the yield from this by reducing the lower rate of VAT from its current level of 13.5% to 12%, a reduction of 1.5%.  We did this because when one examines the activities to which the different rates apply, the 21% rate applies to practically everything other than the exceptions at the lower end.  Certainly, the 21% rate includes a range of imported goods.  Less activity in the purchase of imported goods, while it would impact adversely on the retail sector, would not have an adverse impact on manufacturing industry in this jurisdiction.  On the other hand, the activities to which the lower rate of VAT applies includes, for example, the building industry.</P>
      
        <P>Regardless of what is said about developers, Ireland&rsquo;s modern economy needs a building and development industry.  The problem with the industry was that it is was responsible for approximately 20% of GDP, although a sustainable rate is probably 6% or 7%.  There is no activity in the industry at present, yet people need houses, offices, hotels and replacement and renewal activity.  There needs to be a viable building and development industry in the country.</P><Col N="829"/>
        <P>If we are to get people back to work and provide jobs for all those who are skilled in the building trades but now seeking to emigrate, we can start in a small way.  If the VAT rate were 12% rather than 13.5%, it might trigger some activity in the form of building extensions and insulating homes under the Government&rsquo;s energy schemes.</P>
        <P>Deputies Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Shea referred to the hospitality industry, restaurants, bars and hairdressers, all of which pay VAT at the lower rate.  The newspaper industry, which is under severe pressure from the alternative media, pays VAT at the lower rate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I welcome the idea of having an in-depth analysis of the effect on job creation of a lower rate of VAT, we have done some work on this already.  It is worth doing.  The Minister will ask where the additional money will come from if one forgoes the yield by reducing the lower rate of VAT.  One could analyse the additional activity that would be generated by lowering the rate.  The net loss of revenue might be quite small if additional activity were generated in a growing economy.  There might be a net gain if the adjustment were made.  Mr. Charlie McCreevy was a great advocate of this practice.  When he reduced capital gains tax to 20%, more tax revenue was being generated within 12 months than when the rate had been higher and more penal.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile considering ideas such as this.  For the foreseeable future, Ireland will have only limited scope to become involved in demand management through large stimulus packages according to a Keynesian model.  It is possible, however, to generate growth and create jobs by examining the other side of the economic balance.  Instead of concentrating on demand stimulus and demand-side initiatives, it is always worth considering whether low-cost steps can be taken on the supply side that would generate economic activity and create jobs.  A rebalancing of VAT rates is one such step.  The retail sector will not welcome an increase in VAT from 21% to 23% because much of the sector is on its knees at present and, owing to the adverse weather conditions, it had a very bad Christmas period.</P>
        <P>There is negotiation on the proposal and it is in the memorandum of understanding.  It is one of the conditions for drawing down the bailout funds.  We should determine whether we can tweak the facility to our advantage by using some of the yield to reduce the lower rate of VAT considering its job-creation and economic-growth potential.</P>

        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the intent of this amendment.  I am addressing my comments to the Opposition parties because there is no point in addressing them to the Government at this stage.  The Government&rsquo;s term of office is to end in a few hours and it would not act on the proposal in any event.  I hope the new Government, irrespective of its composition, will introduce a stimulus package.  The economy will not move unless that is done.</P>
        <P>I commend the agrifood sector, which presents a great opportunity.  We know the arguments in favour of it and the production capacity on this island.  There are food riots and starvation in some parts of the world owing to a gross lack of food production.  We have a great opportunity but it will require a stimulus package and a well thought-out programme with appropriate marketing and logistical measures.  It must be rounded off, not just piecemeal.  If this occurs, there will be great potential.</P>
        <P>I referred on a number of occasions to the tourism industry, to which Deputy Noonan referred.  There is potential to introduce a stimulus package for this industry but, again, it requires proper marketing.  The logistics must be correct, not only in terms of where and how <Col N="830"/>we market but also in terms of tourism-related connectivity throughout this island, especially the north west and western seaboard.  There are great opportunities.  I address my comments to all the Opposition parties in the hope that they will be supported in the 31st D&aacute;il.  I have no doubt my colleague Deputy Doherty will be doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Noonan supports this amendment, which was proposed by the Labour Party.  I do not propose to accept it as it is one I have examined as Minister for Finance.  Deputy Morgan, whom I wish well in his retirement and who sparred very well with me in recent years, will know this issue has arisen before.  I have considered it several times in the Department.  The position on it is informative and will assist Deputies in formulating policies in this area.  As Deputies are aware, labour-intensive services in Ireland are, in general, subject of the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%.  The purpose of having a rate lower than 21% is precisely to stimulate activity in labour-intensive industries and stimulate job creation and retail demand.</P>
        <P>The rate of 13.5% applies to hairdressing, small repair services, window cleaning, the repair and renovation of private dwellings and restaurant services, for example.  The reduced VAT rate for labour-intensive services is available on the basis that Ireland applied a reduced rate to those services on 1 January 1991.  One of the difficulties is that one cannot extend the list; one is confined to the existing services.</P>
        <P>Prior to the recent adoption by the Council of Ministers of a proposal in May 2009 on labour-intensive services, the majority of other member states were dependent on an experimental scheme for reduced rates for labour-intensive services that was introduced under an EU VAT directive of 1999.  In that regard, ECOFIN agreed that reduced rates for certain labour-intensive services, including restaurant services, should be a permanent option for member states under the VAT directive.</P>
        <P>With regard to the proposal, it would be possible to further reduce the VAT rate applicable to labour-intensive services.  I have examined this as Minister for Finance several times but noted it would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer.  A 1% reduction in the reduced VAT rate &mdash; from 13.5% to 12.5%, for example &mdash; would cost &euro;260 million in a full year.  Given the current Exchequer deficit, reducing VAT rates would not help support the public finances.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael proposal on this subject at the time of the budget was that we should reduce the 13.5% rate but increase the 21% rate to compensate therefor.  That would have a very detrimental effect on cross-Border trade, and that is why I resisted it.</P>
        <P>An issue that arose in the negotiations surrounding the IMF-EU agreement concerned the question of VAT rates.  There is no doubt that the European Union regards the VAT income or tax base as a crucial part of a prospective remedy for the Union.  It is anxious, therefore, to increase the take from VAT in all the member states.  One can see this in the Commission&rsquo;s analysis of the various member states&rsquo; approaches.  Our approach was taken in the discussions on the EU-IMF agreement.  I took the view that, while we had to leave open the possibility of VAT increases in future years under the plan, it would be wise to defer it for the time being.  For this reason, the VAT increases will occur in the later period of the plan.  In this way, there will at least be some opportunity to harmonise the VAT arrangements in the Republic with those in Northern Ireland so that we do not create a disparity between the two jurisdictions leading to an unnatural loss of trade and custom.</P>
        <P>I have never been against shopping in Northern Ireland.  Rather, I have been against what I call predatory shopping where an advantage is given to one jurisdiction over the other because of tax arrangements.  The plan gives us the flexibility to manage this process in our own way in the years ahead.</P><Col N="831"/>
        <P>Reverting to the amendment, seeking an examination of a targeted reduction in VAT for labour intensive services imposes a further administrative burden on business and would add to pressure to extend such favourable treatment to all goods and services.  The amendment advocates a cost benefit analysis, but any Minister for Finance can have such an analysis done within the Department.  While I appreciate the spirit in which amendments to have cost benefit analyses done as a matter of statute law are tabled and I welcome that they have been tabled to have these subjects discussed, a Minister for Finance can ask his or her officials for their assessment of something.  He or she could also ask the Revenue Commissioners for their assessment of how a measure would work in practice.  Plenty of information is available and the Deputies should put it into the public domain if that is what they want.</P>
        <P>The amendment is an interesting one and puts the focus on one of the crucial issues surrounding consumption taxes which I have pointed out for the past two years and which is not recognised sufficiently.  The improved transportation arrangements between Northern Ireland and the State mean that access to the North is not just a matter for residents in Border counties.  The largest conurbation in the country is now within 50 minutes of Border shopping.  Any Minister for Finance must examine the risks of predatory loss of revenue through disparate tax rates with Northern Ireland.  It is not just an issue for Donegal, Cavan or Louth as it was during previous decades of the State&rsquo;s existence.  Rather, it is an issue for the bulk of the State, given our transportation arrangements and the further transportation arrangements, fully protected in the plan, that envisage the completion of works between Monaghan and Donegal to improve the north-west corridor.  It is important that this issue be understood as a matter of public policy.  This fundamental issue has crept up on us.</P>
        <P>I am sure Deputy Morgan will recall our 2008 and early 2009 debates on what was then a significant loss of trade to Northern Ireland.  Deputy Burton or Fine Gael suggested that a study be done.  When that study was done, it was interesting to see that cheaper alcohol prices along with low predatory pricing on certain baby products and so on were the greatest inducements.  We have undoubtedly tackled this issue and stabilised trade to some extent.  There are wider issues of competitiveness, but we will not get into them this morning.</P>
        <P>Although I do not have a strong objection to the Department conducting an analysis, it should not be required as a matter of statute, given the pressing range of duties the Department will need to perform in the next few months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment was tabled because if there was an advantage to the Exchequer, primarily in terms of job creation, this type of measure would be merited.  From the Minister&rsquo;s comments, I understand the Department keeps this matter under regular review and it has the capacity to carry out the type of analysis we are discussing.  The analysis would continue irrespective of who was Minister.  The amendment was not tabled to seek to tie the Department to an expensive cost benefit analysis or impact assessment.  Given that other European countries have adopted this measure, it could be useful for Ireland.  Against this background, it is not my intention to pursue the amendment.</P>
        <P>This will probably be my last day in the D&aacute;il.  With the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s indulgence, might I make a short personal statement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Proceed.  I am sure I will get into trouble for facilitating the Deputy, but I am honoured to do so.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="832"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  I have been a Member for 21 years, having been elected to the D&aacute;il five times.  Few of us have the great honour and privilege of attending the Chamber and I thank the people of County Waterford for bestowing that honour upon me.</P>
        <P>There have been outstanding Deputies during my time in the D&aacute;il.  The majority of Members are motivated by patriotism.  Good, decent people, they are motivated by and pursue the public service ethos.  However, I leave the House with some concern regarding the standing of politicians and the noble profession of politics in the public eye.  For the incoming D&aacute;il, my party has developed proposals on a major reform of governance, the way in which Oireachtas affairs are conducted and the manner in which the Civil Service does its business.</P>
        <P>I have the utmost respect for all of the House staff I have encountered.  In particular, I remember their kindness during the 18 months or so I was on crutches.  People could not do enough to help.  The professionalism, dedication and hard work of staff in the D&aacute;il and the two Departments where I was Minister of State, those being, the Departments of Health and Agriculture, should be mentioned by Deputies.</P>
        <P>While the public and civil services get a lot of undeserved criticism in the media, there are major issues with the country&rsquo;s governance, how Members do their business and how the Civil Service works.  The next D&aacute;il must be a D&aacute;il of renewal.  In my time in the House, people on all sides have desired reform.  They realise that what we do is not fit for purpose, our methods are antiquated and so on.  The moment in which these matters can be addressed should be grabbed now if the D&aacute;il is to provide taxpayers and citizens with a better service.</P>
        <P>I leave the House with great hope and look forward to seeing matters progress in a way that restores the country to a position of prosperity, job creation and all that goes with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I genuinely wish the Deputy well and thank him for his friendship during my time in the House.  Is he withdrawing the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for withdrawing the amendment.  I also wish him well in his retirement.  Deputy O&rsquo;Shea is one of the fair-minded Deputies whose opinions are always listened to with great care, given that they are considered opinions expressed on the record of the House about the welfare of the country and how we can progress policy in different areas.  He has never been a Deputy who has sought the limelight through unthinking utterance.  He has always made a significant contribution to the proceedings of the House.  By saying that he has never sought the limelight through outrageous comment, I am not to be taken as saying that he has not been a consistent and dedicated parliamentary performer.  He has contributed greatly to the proceedings of this House.</P>
        <P>I as aware of the very great respect in which Deputy O&rsquo;Shea has always been held by his constituents in Waterford.  He was a Minister of State for a period when I came into the House and he discharged his duties in an exemplary way.  I am sure he will miss the House, to some extent, but we all admired how he bore up so well in his parliamentary duties, despite a considerable illness.  We all want to wish him well in his retirement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised a very important point about political reform.  I too have given this a lot of thought in recent times and I have had an opportunity in the context of the recent leadership contest in Fianna F&aacute;il to express a view about it.  This is a matter about which I would not have been free to express a view as Minister for Finance.  I acknowledge the importance of reforming the Houses of the Oireachtas but we should be careful that reform is not simply confused with a pandering to a populist wish to abolish, to reduce, to eliminate.  Much of the public discussion <Col N="833"/>in recent years has suggested we need a smaller D&aacute;il, that we do not need a Seanad and that we need fewer Ministers.  It may well be the case that we need a smaller D&aacute;il or a smaller Seanad or fewer Ministers but the case should be made on rational grounds and not on the basis that we simply believe that it will please the public.</P>
        <P>It is a fact in the consideration of this Finance Bill that the position of the Seanad has become of value because my officials are reflecting on the Bill as it goes through and their only opportunity to advise me of the need for further amendment arises from the somewhat limited power of the Seanad to make recommendations on the Bill next Saturday which permits a final tidying up of the legislation.  This is a small example, but it is an example which has arisen in the context of a severe political and economic crisis, of how the Seanad can be of value in bringing matters to a conclusion.</P>
        <P>I believe everyone will accept that the current arrangements regarding the composition of the Seanad are unsatisfactory.  I put forward the idea that it should be elected by means of a list system on the same day as the D&aacute;il election, with higher technical qualifications in order to bring in a new stream of people into Parliament and Government.  This is not to take away from the fundamental primacy and the work and the mandate of this House but the people want to see a different type of politics and they want to see a politics that is focused on the common good.  One of the difficulties with the electoral system in the D&aacute;il to which, I believe, the Irish people are unalterably attached, is that it puts a large focus on the local and the parochial at the expense of the national.  We need some way of balancing this in our representative institutions.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence as I have wandered far away from the subject of the Finance Bill.  I wish Deputy O&rsquo;Shea well in his retirement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 arises out of Committee proceedings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
        <P Just="Center" el="5">&ldquo;PART 1</P>
          <P Just="Center" el="5">PROPOSAL TO OFFSET TAX LOSSES FROM RESEACH AND DEVELOPMENT AGAINST PRSI</P>
        <P LI="2">1.&mdash;The Minister shall within one month of the commencement of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a report on proposals to reduce the effective tax rate that is applied to intellectual trading losses that are incurred by companies and if he will further report on a possible option of offsetting such losses against employers PRSI.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Before I deal with the amendment I wish to add my brief comment on the occasion of Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s retirement and to wish him luck in his retirement.  I worked with Deputy O&rsquo;Shea when I was deputy spokesperson on communications and on the drugs problem.  I enjoyed listening to his debating and to his ideas as he had a great understanding of what was needed.  Progress is slow in that area but he was very conscious of what had to be done.  I watched in great admiration how he dealt with his own suffering because he must on occasions have been <Col N="834"/>in great pain and he still did his job.  I am glad to see he has recovered quite well.  It is nice to see someone still doing their job even when it is very difficult to do so.  I wish him well in his retirement and I am sure my other colleagues would say the same if they were here in the Chamber.  On behalf of Fine Gael I extend to him all the best and we hope to see him around Leinster House.</P>
        <P>I also wish to make a point in response to the Minister&rsquo;s reference to reform of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The problem was best summarised when he said that as Minister for Finance he was not in a position to discuss political reform.  That is what is wrong with the place, in my view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I had enough to do as Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree and it is also the case that party politics would have prevented him.  This is not a criticism of the Minister but rather it is what all of us have to overcome because this place has to be reformed in order to become a modern Parliament which reflects modern views and which can move at a greater speed when dealing with day-to-day issues.  This is what people want to see happening; they want the Houses to be more effective and streamlined.</P>
        <P>To return to the discussion of the amendment, Fine Gael is of the view that employment could be encouraged if losses could be offset against employer&rsquo;s PRSI.  The intellectual trading market is large and active and the aim is to enlarge this market if possible.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s views on this amendment.  This is a practical measure which would encourage job creation.  Fine Gael is unhappy with the budget and the provisions of the Finance Bill as they do not do enough for job creation but this amendment could help make a difference.</P>
        <P>Allied to this amendment is the matter of patent royalties.  Fine Gael accepts that the reliefs were too generous in that area but we do not agree they should be ended as this would be a step too far.  I suggest they could be retained at 50% because expenditure in this area must be encouraged at a time when innovative new ideas will help towards job creation.  We will do all we can to encourage job creation.  The areas of patent royalties and intellectual trading lead into the necessity for a venture capital market and venture capital funds.  These are not matters to be dealt with in this Bill but there is not enough happening in those areas and there needs to be more co-ordination and direction from Government to try to attract more investment.  This amendment will be pressed as it is about job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I see nothing wrong with this amendment but I would need to study the proposal in more detail if the amendment were accepted and if the effective tax rate were to be reduced for intellectual trading losses, and how this would affect job creation as mentioned by Deputy English.</P>
        <P>We discussed earlier a report on how tax reliefs might impact upon job creation.  I take the Minister&rsquo;s valid point that the Minister and the Department of Finance have much to deal with and issues have to be prioritised ahead of reports being commissioned on these matters.  The Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners expressed viewpoints with regard to VAT and the Minister agreed to provide these.  Can such information be provided to this side of the House as well as to the Minister?  Since I became party spokesperson on finance my office has been in regular contact with the Department.  However, even though the officials have been more than helpful, we cannot telephone a Department of Finance official and ask for a briefing paper on a proposal. Replies to parliamentary questions are not as extensive and will only provide a summary of any examination conducted by the Department.  This is allied to the issue of political reform.</P><Col N="835"/>
        <P>The general election campaign will be an ideological debate and I am very satisfied that my party will offer a very clear alternative to what is being proposed by other parties.  Others will say that such and such information is incorrect and that we have plucked figures out of the sky.  However, my point is that if my figures are being challenged then it is a challenge to the figures provided by the Minister for Finance because the Minister, through the Department of Finance, has provided me and my party with the figures we are using to show how we would run the Exchequer this year without the IMF-EU bailout.  One has to submit many parliamentary questions to get that information and also to study all the answers to arrive at that point.  If we are not afraid to allow others to express views that can stack up and are accurate, then we should have no fear about providing all relevant information.  As I stated in my opening comments, I understand there are pressures on the Department of Finance.  It is not reasonable to ask the Department of Finance to commission hundreds of new reports on the effect of every measure.  However, my party&rsquo;s central point of view is that we will get out of the mess through creating jobs.  It will not be done through reducing expenditure so it is on par with tax intake, it will be done through growing the economy to reach the level of expenditure.  At the same time, savings can be made on the expenditure side.  Job creation will be essential this year.</P>
        <P>If an issue has been examined &mdash; I am not sure but I presume these issues have been examined in the context of this and previous Finance Bills &mdash; then let us publish any information we have on the matter to the benefit of the Opposition, namely, the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents, and those outside who do not have the privilege of serving in these Houses.  This would mean those commenting on where we are and on the solutions to getting us out of the mess can make their comments with the best information available.  We may not necessarily agree with the information provided by the Department of Finance but at least the information should be there.</P>
        <P>As I mentioned, approximately 34 colleagues will leave the D&aacute;il and this is either the second last or last day on which we will meet, depending on whether we meet on Saturday evening.  I want to wish them well, in particular Deputy O&rsquo;Shea who made his parting speech.  I have been in the D&aacute;il for only five weeks so I have not had the experience of sharing the Chamber with him for long but we have served together on committees and I wish him and all the retiring Members well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Doherty knows, a service is available in the Department and I am not aware of a request made for the service.  My information is that 40% of the requests for the use of this service on costings has come from Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s party and these requests have been facilitated through the Department.  There is no difficulty with the Department providing costings and this is important.  It should be also put on the record of the House &mdash; not specifically with regard to Deputy Doherty but with regard to the House generally &mdash; that the Oireachtas is funded from the central fund and has substantial access to moneys to conduct research on various topics.  I accept that as with all economic research, the research done by the Department is most interesting to Deputies because it is the research which informs Government thinking and therefore gives a greater prospect of evaluation.</P>
        <P>The precise proposal before us from Deputy Noonan is that we shall within one month of the commencement of the Act prepare and lay before the D&aacute;il a report on reducing the effective tax rate applied to intellectual trading losses incurred by companies and examine the option of offsetting such losses against employers&rsquo; PRSI.  In dealing with the earlier Labour Party amendments, I made the point that I do not believe this is an appropriate time to put statutory obligations on the Department to engage in research on a wide range of subjects.  The Department has had much work to do in the past two and half years and will have much work to do <Col N="836"/>in the next nine months.  I do not want to rehearse these arguments again.  I put them on the record of the House this morning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My one note of caution to Fine Gael about this amendment is that the precise subject it wants us to examine is the possible option of offsetting losses against employers&rsquo; PRSI.  Employers&rsquo; PRSI is a very important revenue base for the State in making a contribution to the social insurance fund.  I have been a very strong defender of our 12.5% corporation tax rate.  It is a key feature of our general strategy to attract inward investment to Ireland in manufacturing and services.  I and the Government sustained considerable criticism over our conduct in the EU-IMF negotiations because we decided to hold out on this issue and not simply automatically enter negotiations.  We ensured that we received satisfactory political assurances on the subject before we even embarked on a process of strict negotiation.  This was a considerable diplomatic success at the time.</P>
        <P>Our strategy is to have a 12.5% corporation tax rate.  The suggestion that whatever funds can be received out of this 12.5% rate can be then further offset by an obligation not to pay employers&rsquo; PRSI is very far reaching .  We have introduced intellectual property reliefs which in effect reduce the residual corporation tax liability in the case of research and development enterprises.  As Minister for Finance I introduced many of these incentives in successive Finance Bills.  They fit in with the general strategy that not alone do we want to attract inward investment in trade, services and manufacturing but we also want it to have a high research and development content so that employment in these enterprises will go up the value chain.  There is consistency in the tax reliefs we offer multinational companies establishing here.  The basic 12.5% rate is at the heart of the attraction strategy and this is complemented by further inducements with regard to research and development to fit in with the character of what we want to attract.</P>
        <P>When we state we will allow employers&rsquo; PRSI to be offset against tax liability in effect we are stating the enterprises involved should not pay PRSI.  This is what would be legislated for in practice.  I do not believe we should legislate for this and I must state this.  I believe these companies have to meet the minimum social requirement of contributing for social purposes to the funds which ensure the various contingent risks, whether during life or on retirement, are met by a reasonable payment from the State.  If the demand is that these companies should be dispensed from these obligations, one is establishing a differentiation between these enterprises and domestic enterprises, smaller businesses and firms and occasional employers who will remain, and rightly so, under an obligation to pay PRSI.  A contrast would be established between these smaller struggling businesses and larger multinational enterprises attracted here which would be dispensed with an obligation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In fairness to Fine Gael, I know it states this is only an option we should examine and I am not making a direct political criticism.  However, I have heard the case reflected in the amendment made by some tax planners who speak on behalf of the international enterprises and I must state I have viewed the case with a degree of scepticism.  There must be recognition that these companies have basic social obligations.  If those social obligations do not exist in other jurisdictions and exist here then the issue is why they do not exist in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I do not want to go back to speaking about banking as we had our discussion earlier, but one of the key issues we will have to examine at European level is how various states can co-operate to ensure minimal standards are maintained, whether with regard to labour conditions and practices, tax practices or practices with regard to social insurance.  The idea that multinationals can forum shop whereby certain countries acknowledge no social obligations and therefore one is put under pressure to dispense with one&rsquo;s own is not, in my view, acceptable. <Col N="837"/> In general terms, I do not propose to accept the amendment because of the burden it would put on the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand from where the Minister is coming on this, but we hold the view that while PRSI is important, in some cases it acts as a deterrent to employment because it can represent a high cost for employers.  In our two most recent alternative budgets we suggested that the Minister should consider reducing employers&rsquo; PRSI because in some cases it is a deterrent to jobs.  The Minister spoke about a social contribution from companies but the social contribution of many foreign direct investment companies is to give our people jobs.  One can look at this both ways.</P>
        <P>Like the Minister, we have received advice and evidence to suggest that perhaps a reduction or offset of PRSI might stimulate job creation.  We are not stating we are convinced of this, but we think there may be an argument to be made.  This is why the amendment suggests that the Department conducts a study and makes a decision.  We want to check out what we have been told.  There is always an agenda behind information that comes forward and the best way to find out about the information is to investigate it.  This is why we tabled the amendment.  I hold the view that if PRSI must be offset to create jobs, it would be worthwhile to do so.  At the end of the day if there are no jobs there will be no PRSI in the first place coming from that &ldquo;tax unit&rdquo; &mdash; a term the Minister used yesterday which I do not like and which the Minister probably does not like himself.  As it was proposed with good intentions and for good reasons, we should check it out.  I accept officials at the Department of Finance are extremely busy.  Even if the Minister does not accept it today, we will need to consider it because we need to investigate all these areas with a potential for job creation.  Some businesses are sensitive to certain taxes and we are led to believe this could make a difference.  We will pursue it when, hopefully, we are on the Government side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be good to have all these ideas subjected to a cost-benefit analysis and from that point of view I welcome the proposal.  However, I would be wary of the development of terms such as &ldquo;intellectual trading losses&rdquo; which is quite broad.  I would be somewhat concerned that people with imagination who design tax schemes might be excessively imaginative.  We need to be cautious and restrained when we extend definitions in taxation law because of the law of unintended consequences.  There appears to be all-party agreement across the floor of the House that as far as possible we should in future have a baseline system of analysing, evaluating, costing and time-basing particular proposals.  If we could achieve that it would mean considerable change in the structure of how entities such as the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners approach the collection of information, and the analysis and presentation of data.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service has had the opportunity to meet Commissioner Rehn, Mr. Watson and Mr. Regling, who are all firmly wedded to the notion of the European semester.  As I understand it, a basic proposition of that is that in the near future Ireland will be required to do what is done in many other parliaments, which is essentially to prepare, publish and have debated in April of each year outline budget and capital spending proposals, including taxation proposals.  Inevitably that will mean, particularly for the public service, a very big shift in the demands that are made.  Regarding renegotiating the interest rates on the loans, in Europe there is broadly a conception that Ireland got a poor deal from the IMF-EU deal.  We are being charged 3 percentage penalty points on the interest particularly on the euro and ECB parts of the loan.  If the country is to be able to meet the burden it is essential that they are renegotiated, reopened and reconsidered, which will require considerable diplomatic finesse and effort.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> will be that this semesterisation and bringing <Col N="838"/>forward of economic information will come much earlier than we have been used to in the Irish system.</P>
        <P>Every party represented here this morning is indicating a different approach because we will need to be very tough with Europe in saying that Irish people cannot take the burden.  Equally from what I have heard of the debate today, there is initial broad agreement among all the parties that we will prepare much more detailed information with more cost-benefit analysis.  That is a really important reform and the EU and IMF should be aware that there is a strong appetite for reform here, which is essential if we are to get people back to work and turn around the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course that appetite for reform is displayed in the four year plan and in fairness all the parties contributed to the chapter dealing with fiscal reform.  So there is all-party agreement on that important issue.  However, the word &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo; is being used all the time and it may become a semantic issue in the general election campaign.  Of course the reality is that the rates applied by the IMF and by the European mechanism, and the rate supplied in the European facility were all fixed by relevant prior instrument and were not the subject of negotiation.  While people may shake their heads all they like, that is the reality the Government had to face.  Any commentator who knows anything about the IMF will explain that its lending rates are fixed by its own internal regulations and procedures.  There is not a special rate negotiated for Ireland any more than there was a special rate negotiated, for example, for the United Kingdom when it got an IMF loan in the 1970s.  The existing regulations are applied.  The same arrangement exists for the European facilities and mechanisms.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton is correct about a debate under way in Europe about the extent to which this is imposing an excessive burden on the sustainability of the finances of member states that participate in the facilities and mechanisms.  I have been fully participating in this debate at the January euro group meeting and the debate will continue at the February meeting, which clearly will take place during the general election campaign and which I will need to attend because of the vital national interest involved.</P>

	<P>The case needs to be made and it will require considerable diplomatic activity because it will require the agreement of the other member states.  That is the second issue of fundamental importance; this cannot be negotiated on the basis that Ireland is looking for this uniquely.  It can be negotiated on the basis that the other member states agree that the current arrangements impose an excessive penalty on member states.  On that basis, negotiations can proceed which will require the construction of diplomatic alliances and building up good will.  In the context of building up that good will we must acknowledge that our banking system has more than &euro;100 billion on loan to it at a very low interest rate &mdash; slightly above 1% &mdash; from the European Central Bank.  That is another reality that does not seem to cloud this debate very much domestically but of course is of great interest to European analysts who look at the position in Ireland.</P><Col N="839"/>
        <P>There is a third factor influencing this debate.  I am optimistic that real progress can be made in the months ahead regarding the interest rates that are applied.  We can have an international agreement on that issue.  The idea that the European Central Bank and the European authorities would encourage default on senior debt obligations in Ireland has become a particular obsession in our domestic debate.  That would be a very difficult idea to develop at European level.  As all Deputies know, it is not possible to proceed along those lines without the backing of a central bank and the European Central Bank has set its face against this.  I raised the issue in the last negotiations and it refused.  My intelligence at this stage is that there is considerable resistance to this in Europe because of Ireland&rsquo;s very high GDP.  Ireland is not seen as being the same as Greece; it is seen as a comparatively wealthy country that should not be allowed to default on its obligations.  I am only reporting to the House what I hear in these circles.  However, there is scope for progress on the rate of interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Central Bank embarked on a particular course on the euro.  The euro has been of great value to Ireland and I do not believe Ireland should leave the euro even though others in this House have a different view.  It should be noted that if Ireland left the euro all the mortgages would be restated in a new Irish currency and would therefore be heavily increased in cost almost immediately, which would be a nightmare for the people who have difficulties with their mortgages here.  The ECB made a strategic decision, according to the Minister, that banks could get their funding at 1%, which is a very attractive rate.  However, they were not doing that simply for Ireland but to ensure that the German, French, United Kingdom and other banks, which had lent recklessly and foolishly to reckless crazy banks in Ireland, eventually had to recognise the moral hazard principle applies to the European banks.  This applied particularly to the Germans and the French who appear to have loaned without making any kind of check.  We do not know the full story yet but they were pumping in money.  People in Ireland will remember it was a British-based bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland, now gone, which set up business in this country with a new competitive regime of 100% mortgages, trackers and much discounted interest rates in order to gain market share.</P>
        <P>In these negotiations we need to be tough.  We have an enormous responsibility in regard to the faults of which this country is guilty, namely, the irresponsibility of our banks and the lack of supervision.  However, the European banks and the ECB have some counterparty responsibilities for their system which was meant to regulate and curb wild behaviour by banks.  The Minister should remember the 1% is, in effect, to facilitate the repayment, and thereby, the security of the European banks which lent recklessly and crazily to our crazy Irish banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I will return to the amendment but it was interesting to listen to what the Minister had to say on the 3% penalty we are paying as part of the bailout money.  He said, rightly, the rates are fixed &mdash; he was one of the finance Ministers who fixed the rates at the ECOFIN meeting.  However, the Minister told the House he did not even ask for a reduction in those rates.  He was correct to say there was no negotiation &mdash; the rate was fixed.  However, he merely accepted that, which is absolutely unbelievable.  This was the first time any country had availed of this fund and the first time it was tested.  It is hard to think we would not have said, &ldquo;hang on, we know we agreed in part to this rate but things have changed, Ireland is in deep trouble and we cannot afford these rates&rdquo;.  It seems there were no negotiations whatsoever, only a complete acceptance of the rate.</P>
        <P>I agree with the previous speaker in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister and his party have ample experience of negotiation, as does our party.  One makes the demand, one listens to the response and continues to press for the demand and then after discussions or negotiations, one aims to meet somewhere in the middle.  That is the art of negotiation.  There cannot be negotiation if one does not make the demand.  In this instance the demand was not made by the State for a reduced rate.</P>
        <P>Of course, the ECB does not want us to default on senior bondholders.   That is completely understandable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say we did not make a demand; I said it was not negotiable.  There is a distinction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister made the demand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course, we raised these issues but they were not negotiable because the rates were already fixed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a change of position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not, if the Deputy were to listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is.  I am not convinced the Minister made the demand in the first instance because he has contradicted himself a number of times in the past couple of minutes.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the ECB does not want us to default on senior bondholders as many of the major banks in Europe would be liable for those bonds because of their reckless lending to the Irish banks.  It is important that information is accurate.  I cannot be sure as I have not been in the House for long but I have not heard any Deputy argue we should pull out of the euro.  That would be a very damaging position for this country to take.  The idea of reconstructing a new currency and trying to sell it, with the probability of defaulting straightaway, would be impossible.  I do not know who is making such charges in the Houses.  It is an important that we do not send out a signal that such positions are dominant in this House.  In all the debates I have never heard those points being made.</P>
        <P>I return to the point and will conclude in brief.  As Deputy Burton made very clear in her opening remarks, a new model is needed.  None of us is infallible on these issues.  Nobody claims to know the perfect ways to get out of these problems or to have the perfect solutions for dealing with them.  We come from a point of honesty and from our own political and ideological perspectives and we do what we believe is best.  To assist us in that process we need as much information as possible.  Take the Finance Bill, for example.  This Bill is very difficult to deal with, particularly when one does not have the experience or expertise or perhaps academic qualifications.  However, there is information.</P>
        <P>In the development of the Finance Bill and the budget in December 2007, it is obvious that each of these measures was looked at by the Department of Finance.  Not only did it present the positive aspects of all these measures, as the Minister rightly argues in this Chamber, but I presume it also looked at the possible negative aspects of some of them.  In such a case a political judgment must then be made by the Minister for Finance, as he is entitled to so do.  In all circumstances we have to make political judgments because there is no single solution or answer for any of these questions.</P><Col N="841"/>
        <P>However, this point is important if we are to have as accurate a political debate as possible.  I recall the Minister&rsquo;s remarks to Deputy O&rsquo;Shea about having measured comment on such issues.  If we had that type of information or the analysis which is available to the Minister, we could dispute it if we wish but it would allow for a more rounded, civilised and accurate debate.  If we had had such an analysis a number of years ago we would not be in our current position because we would have had a more in-depth and genuine debate on these matters.</P>
        <P>I hope with the next Finance Bill we will see that type of focus and presentation being put forward.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 9, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;3.&mdash;<i>Section 3 </i>shall not come into operation save by order of the Minister which may only be made after the Minister has carried out an economic and social impact assessment of the introduction of the universal social charge, particularly in respect of those on medical cards or over the age of 70 who were previously exempted from the health and income levies, and has laid the assessment before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">All these amendments concern the universal social charge.  Amendment No. 6 in the name of the Labour Party provides for an assessment of the impact of the universal social charge</P><Col N="842"/>
      
        <P>There would be an economic and social impact assessment of the introduction of the universal social charge, particularly in respect of people with medical cards or those over 70 who were previously exempt from the health and income levies.  The assessment would be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The universal social charge was announced by the Minister on budget night and referred to by the Minister in his speech in December 2009 dealing with the 2010 budget.  It is fair to say that for most people, the announcement of this new tax &mdash; despite being made in December 2009 &mdash; passed them by.  The Minister announced significant changes in December&rsquo;s budget.  Previously we had the health levy and the emergency tax levies on income which were introduced when the banks collapsed and had to be bailed out.  It is still not fully understood by people that the previous health levy and the emergency income levies have been transformed and transferred to this new universal social charge.</P>
        <P>A difficulty arises because with the health levy, people were exempted if income was less than &euro;26,000, they were over 70, they were widows or widowers or if they held a medical card.  This has an impact on somebody on an income of &euro;15,000, for example, from a private or public service pension or who also has a medical card.  The Minister knows from the data he gave me in recent weeks and subsequent discussions that many pensioners from public employment are on low pensions, with the bulk of public service pensions below &euro;25,000.  If such a person also had a medical card, the change would mean the universal social charge would be applied.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s amendment, on foot of the deal done with the Independents, reduced that levy by approximately two percentage points, or by between 30% and 40%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That decision came before any discussion with the Independents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We will tell Deputies Lowry and Healy-Rae they had absolutely nothing to do with that Committee Stage amendment that we heard about yesterday.  It must be news to them because they were up and down the plinth and on every radio station, particularly in their home counties, claiming a fair degree of credit, if not the total credit, for the amendment.  That is in the newspapers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government meeting was on the Tuesday and the backbenchers were in total agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>They were play-acting so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is a very odd Government to have had this very relieving and helpful news for people with medical cards but which forgot to relay that news.  That means the Government must be close to breaking up.  I always thought Fianna F&aacute;il worked on the Margaret Thatcher principle of telling them you will tell them, telling them and then telling them you told them.  Fianna F&aacute;il is in a fair old &ldquo;state of chassis&rdquo; if what the Minister outlined &mdash; that the party decided this on Tuesday but it slipped its members&rsquo; minds to tell very scared people with medical cards that there would be some reduction in the burden &mdash; actually occurred.</P>
        <P>To cut to the chase, for people on middle and higher incomes, the universal social charge means that the health and income levies previously paid will be combined in the charge.  For many people there is not much difference and as we know, for self-employed people there is <Col N="843"/>a significant potential gain.  The cumulative levy they would pay is below what would be paid with health and income levies.</P>
        <P>We want a detailed impact assessment of the social and economic impact on the categories of people I have outlined who are badly affected.  These are the widows, people on medical cards and those who earn less than &euro;26,000 per annum.  We want a fair and balanced system.  Yesterday the Minister transferred some of the burden to people who are self-employed and earning over &euro;100,000, which is a way to rebalance the issue.  It takes in people with a very high level of income.</P>
        <P>That is very similar to the Labour Party proposal that people on very high incomes &mdash; individuals on over &euro;100,000 per year and a couple on over &euro;200,000 per year &mdash; would contribute proportionately more.  That differed from the approach of other parties.  Fine Gael suggested the hit should be balanced through social welfare cuts, at a rate of &euro;6 per week for three years, whereas Fianna F&aacute;il condemned the Labour Party for suggesting the approach but did not say how it would act.  The Minister&rsquo;s actions yesterday strike a balance so that less of a burden falls on people with low incomes, with more of a burden falling on those who earn above &euro;100,000 per year.  The Minister did not mention it would affect couples who earn over &euro;200,000, which is the Labour Party position.  The Minister&rsquo;s amendment relates to an individual tax unit, which includes a couple, unless I am mistaken in what was put down yesterday.</P>
        <P>The Minister has much more to do in order to help relieve the burden on people who find themselves landed with this very unexpectedly and without warning.  It is taking a very large chunk out of wage packets and the proposal of the Labour Party is to relieve it.</P>
        <P>As we are debating a number of amendments, amendment No. 17 deals with bank bonuses.  I welcome the amendment and I am very relieved that although we had much political discussion &mdash; with proposals from the Labour Party and others &mdash; on taxing bank bonuses, we were brushed off repeatedly and told it was not possible.  It seems that the way the new universal social charge is structured, it is much easier to achieve a result through this mechanism.  The Labour Party will support this proposal.</P>
        <P>In the case of bank bonuses over &euro;20,000, a universal social charge of 45% will be applied.  Taking the basic rate of income tax at 41%, with PRSI at 4%, an additional 45% universal social charge will bring the total deduction to the 90% mark.  That is how I understand it and the Minister might indicate if this is correct.  I welcome the measure because the bonus culture is part of what destroyed our banks.</P>
        <P>Like tax breaks, the bonus culture gave rise to a climate of irrational greed in the country, where structures like banks &mdash; some of them a hundred years old &mdash; were turned around by their own actions and risk-taking because senior executives could make millions in annual pay through bonuses by selling products and ignoring risk.  Years ago when people were selling in ordinary commercial companies, it was always part of general controls for salesman bonuses to be clawed back if sales were inflated by selling to risky or bankrupt customers.  In that case, the bonuses were not paid out.  This is a standard feature of the operation of many private firms.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I am pleased that this amendment has been introduced, I would still like to know if any Hercules Poirot or Ms Marple in the Department has found out what really happened to the Bank of Ireland bonuses.  These have become one of the final mysteries of the Thirtieth D&aacute;il given that this is probably the last full working day in respect of legislation.</P>
        <P>I understand the measures will not apply to bonuses below &euro;20,000.  This is a welcome decision as many bank employees work in call centres and receive a low basic salary.  As with salespeople, their basic pay can be as low as &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000, with a bonus paid at the end of the year to bring their final salary up to the average industrial wage.  I am pleased the Minister has given specific consideration to the position of low level bank employees who work <Col N="844"/>for modest basic salaries, including those employed on a shift basis in call centres handling queries.  A number of companies, including some of the banks, operate the European and US system of paying ordinary staff a bonus equivalent to an extra month&rsquo;s pay.  This is sometimes referred to as the 13th month and the payment is generally modest for low and moderately paid staff.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While there is nothing wrong with operating a bonus system as an incentive to work harder, the extreme bonuses offered by banks to senior executives formed part of the risk culture that drove the banks and our economy into the ditch.  Unfortunately, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, during its 13 year reign in government, was blind to this, although its early coalition partners, the Progressive Democrats, positively encouraged this type of greed.  One of the party&rsquo;s political mantras was that greed is good, as Gordon Gekko used to say in the film &ldquo;Wall Street&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party supports amendment No. 17.  Does the Minister agree that a review is needed of the economic and social impact of the introduction of the universal social charge on people on incomes below &euro;26,000, including widows, widowers and medical card holders?  It is essential that consideration be given to the severe difficulty such persons will face.  Under the legislation, someone on a social welfare contributory pension will not be affected by the charge, whereas a person on a small State or private pension who does not qualify for a contributory or non-contributory old age pension will be subject to its full rigours.  For this reason alone, it is necessary to carry out a careful examination of the impact of the universal social charge on vulnerable older people on low incomes before the charge proceeds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief as I am aware of the time constraints and wish to ensure the spokesperson from the Fine Gael Party and the Minister are able to contribute before the division.  Deputy Burton spoke about all the relevant issues.  I differ with her only on bankers&rsquo; bonuses, an issue I will address presently.</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 9 proposes that the universal social charge does not take effect until at least 60 days after the publication of an impact assessment of the charge.  This issue has been debated on Committee Stage and raised outside the Chamber, notably by those involved in the retail sector.  People were taken by surprise by the full impact of the universal social charge when they opened their pay cheques at the start of the year.  They cannot get over what has happened to them, especially given that many of those who are already on the bread line have had their pay walloped again by the charge.</P>
        <P>Much of our discussion of the Bill has focused on jobs and how to stimulate the economy.  Taxation measures serve the dual purpose of stimulating the economy and ensuring that the State has adequate revenue.  The universal social charge will damage the potential for growth and result in job losses, especially in sectors that are dependent on expenditure from disposable income.  The imposition of the charge on all income for those earning more than &euro;4,004, as opposed to all income above a certain threshold &mdash; perhaps &euro;10,000 &mdash; is a crude measure which is having a major impact on individuals and the business community.  It will result in job losses.</P>
        <P>I was fair to the Minister earlier when I spoke about the additional workload for the Department of Finance created by our demands to have reports laid before the House.  While I appreciate the Department is under severe pressure given the turbulent times, it is vital to carve out sufficient time to carry out an economic impact assessment of the universal social charge.  This is the most important aspect of the Finance Bill on which such an assessment is needed.  The consensus on this side of the House is that the charge has the potential to seriously disrupt the domestic economy, not to speak of its impact on individuals.</P><Col N="845"/>
        <P>I welcome amendment No. 17 on bankers&rsquo; bonuses, having been critical of the Minister and his officials on Committee Stage for not having an amendment prepared.  I note it is two pages in length.  This provision should have been introduced a long time ago.  The only point on which I differ with Deputy Burton in respect of the amendments before us is the threshold of &euro;20,000 provided for in amendment No. 17.  It is wrong to allow top bankers to receive bonuses of &euro;20,000.  This Bill will enable Anglo Irish Bank to pay out bonuses of &euro;19,999 to all its officials tomorrow morning.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate Deputy Burton&rsquo;s point that much of the income of people working in call centres is dependent on bonuses, this matter could be adequately addressed by inserting a new line in the part of the amendment that refers to exemptions for bonuses under &euro;20,000.  We could, for example, link the exemption to income and provide that it only apply to those who have a salary of less than twice the national average wage.  I have suggested a fairly arbitrary figure because the amendment was only circulated a couple of hours ago.  The insertion of such a condition would protect those on low basic salaries whose income primarily consists of bonuses.  It would also ensure the top officials in the banks, many of whom were in place before the guarantee and who got us into this mess, will not be paid bonuses.  Imagine the furore if <i>The Star</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent </i>contained stories tomorrow morning that every top official in all of the guaranteed institutions are paid bonuses of &euro;19,999.  That is twice as much as the 440,000 people in receipt of social welfare receive in a year.  I accept the amendment because it at least stops these bankers being paid in excess of &euro;20,000 but to allow them to be paid up to that amount is wrong.  If this cannot be done now, it should be dealt with in the Seanad.  An income link should be introduced, where the exemption of &euro;20,000 would only be applied to the relevant figure.  We are all coming at this from the same side and I believe the Minister&rsquo;s intention is good &mdash; we want to stop the bonuses being paid.  An income link can be inserted into the legislation to achieve this.</P>
        <P>The Minister threatened to withhold recapitalisation funds from the bank if bonuses were paid and those bonuses have not been paid as a result, although legal cases are pending.  As a result of the amendment, where bonuses in excess of &euro;20,000 will be captured in the tax net at a rate of up to 90% through the universal social charge and taxation measures, that threat will no longer be valid.  The bonuses could now be paid up to &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to look at this again.  The clock is ticking towards the dissolution of the D&aacute;il but the Bill is fundamentally flawed in this aspect.  I genuinely believe the vast majority of the public would not tolerate a situation where hundreds of bonuses would be paid out to officials of guaranteed banks when we are bailing them out.  We are taking money from those who earn &euro;80 per week under the universal social charge and under the same legislation we will allow well-paid bankers to get bonuses of up to &euro;20,000 without it coming under the universal social charge or being taxed.  That is not acceptable and we must look at it again.</P>

	<P>I am glad the Minister has found a mechanism in amendment No. 17 to achieve this; it was essential to send a message out about bank bonuses.  I am sorry there had to be so much confusion about it, with the impression that the Minister was not going to do anything.  Deputy Mattie McGrath might try to claim credit but the Minister was no doubt trying to do it.  I hope so because I am sick listening to someone like Deputy McGrath claiming responsibility.  It appears, however, that Fianna F&aacute;il is facilitating him because it keeps giving him speaking time.  It looks to me like a cosy arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Deputy McGrath.  He gets speaking time and then waits until the very last minute to vote to ensure everything is safe.  It is a bit too obvious and I am surprised journalists are falling for it.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il will change its way of going about things.</P><Col N="846"/>
        <P>This had to be done, and we raised the issue with the Minister before Christmas.  This was done in other countries and it makes sense.  I am glad the Minister has done it and I fully support the measure.</P>
        <P>Whoever becomes Minister for Finance in the next couple of months must give proper consideration to the Central Bank report on the payment structures of banks.  The Governor is still concerned that there is a possibility of a repeat performance in some of our banks.  The system and culture have not changed not just regarding bonuses, but payment structures as well.  I am concerned about the contents of that report and that things have not changed.  I appreciate the Minister was trying to get things in order in his Department but this key area should have been examined.  The amendment tackles the past bonuses but in the years ahead we must look at payment structures in banks.</P>
        <P>The universal social charge is wrong; it penalises those on very low incomes.  I accept there have been some movement but it does not go far enough.  It was talked about in the last budget that taxes would be put together but that there would not be any increased payment but this will result in most people paying more.  That is not what was planned and there is also confusion about it.  People were told income levies were a short-term measure but that has changed.  They are now long-term measures.  People were misinformed.  The Minister was guilty of that in the past and I wish it had not happened again.  Even at this stage he should consider a reduction in the rates of the universal social charge.  It affects those on low incomes too much.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am thankful for the general welcome for the provision on bankers&rsquo; bonuses.  The Government also looked closely at the social charge.  Deputies will appreciate that with the pressure of negotiations, arrangements were arrived at and when we evaluated those arrangements, it was clear there was an unintended benefit to the self-employed in the budgetary arrangements and there was a particular hardship for medical card holders.  Having said that, the effect of the social charge provisions was to put them in the same position as another person on the same income despite the possession of a medical card.  That said, the effect of the budgetary measures, and the impact on that category was such that it was an immediate and substantial impact and it required to be lessened.  That is why the Government introduced these changes, not, as Deputy English correctly said, at the request of particular independent Deputies.  There was considerable discussion of this within the Government and within Fianna F&aacute;il about this issue.  The Government finalised its arrangements on this, and advertised them, in advance of the decision.</P>
        <P>There will be representations for further changes in the social charge, as there are proposed amendments for further changes here.  They must be costed and it must be shown where the alternative source of revenue might be.  No such information is before the House this morning in any of these proposals.</P>
        <P>I thank all parties for their general welcome of the measures on bankers&rsquo; bonuses.  There is, however, a fundamental flaw in Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s argument and I am alarmed that it will get him another misleading propaganda piece for the Sinn F&eacute;in propaganda machine in this election.  Let us be clear &mdash; there are no bonuses payable in the future in any of the guaranteed banks.  It was suggested this afternoon by Deputy Doherty that senior executives could get a bonus of &euro;20,000 out of this but that is not true because those bonuses are not permitted under arrangements I have already put in place.   The arguments about Bank of Ireland and AIB related to retrospective issues in the past.  In the future, however, no bonuses are payable and this tax is the same.  It simply copper-fastens it.  Sinn F&eacute;in is advocating that lowly paid workers in call centres should pay 90% on their marginal income.</P>

That is my advice.  He should invent something else to tell the people, rather than addressing the economic realities we face in this country.  I welcome the general welcome that has been extended to our proposal on bonuses by Deputies Doherty, Burton and English.  It was difficult to draft it, but it has been drafted and tabled on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>We welcome the proposed restriction on the payment of exorbitant bonuses to higher executive officials in the banking industry.  Most people in society cannot comprehend why one would get a bonus after virtually destroying the country and the bank for which one works.  We all know people &mdash; most of them are women &mdash; who receive an appallingly low income for working in call centres and shop floors.  Their only additional source of income is the bonus they receive at the end of the year.  It is very seldom &euro;20,000, to be honest.  It is usually between &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000.  It is always based on aspects of employee performance, such as the amount of business he or she has brought in.  It is a welcome source for income for such people in the run-up to Christmas and in early January.  It would be deeply and grossly unfair if the bonuses given to workers on low incomes were taxed at 90% as a result of our efforts to ensure certain people do not get massive bonuses.  Indeed, those who brought down the country and wrecked the banking system should not get any bonus at all. <Col N="848"/> We have to be conscious of the possibility that such people will discover additional loopholes at some stage in the future.  We have to ensure that does not happen.  That is why we have to be on our guard at all times.  We need to avail of all ways and means of protecting the public purse.  I do not think anyone would suggest we should claw back 90% of the bonuses paid to people on low incomes.  The gross incomes of many of these people, who work in new industries with which we are just starting to come to terms, increase when they receive bonuses related to their performance over the year as a whole.  It would be unreasonable to tax such bonuses at a high rate.  The average person is not worried about such bonuses.  He or she is conscious of the difference between a low-paid worker who is doing a strenuous job and the type of bank official who swans around enjoying a lifestyle that does not seem to have been affected by the national downturn and the collapse of the banking industry.  People are looking for fairness in the treatment of people in both categories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Lynch.  In light of the type of discussion we have had today, I was astonished to hear the outburst of the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  He made a cheap effort to score points in the Chamber through the complete and utter misrepresentation of what I said.  He needs to clean out his ears, listen to what I have to say and represent it properly.  I did not say people on low incomes should not get bonuses.  I did not say they should not be exempt from the imposition of the universal social charge on their bonuses.  That is not what I said.  I said clearly that it should be income-linked.  I suggested that the cut-off point should be twice the average national wage.  Perhaps the Minister thinks low-income women working in call centres earn in excess of &euro;67,000.  In my book, that is not what low-income workers are paid.  I said specifically that this provision should be &ldquo;income-linked&rdquo;.  I genuinely believe everyone in this House is trying to achieve the same position.  I was not trying to score a political point or get a media headline.  I acknowledge that there is some kind of cap on bonuses at this time.  The Minister accepted in his contribution that bonuses will continue to be paid.  Is he telling me that those working in the call centres of the guaranteed banks will not get their bonuses?  Of course they will get their bonuses.  Payments in addition to salaries will continue to be made to certain people who work in the guaranteed banks.  That is a fact.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kathleen Lynch made a valid point when she said certain people will try to drive a horse and carriage through this measure.  Under this measure, if the bonuses that have been on the table since 2008 are paid at a level of &euro;19,999, they will not be subject to the universal social charge or the 90% tax rate.  If I am wrong, the Minister should say so.  I said earlier that none of us is infallible.  This amendment was thrown to us a couple of hours ago.  We have not had enough time to scrutinise it properly.  Am I wrong when I suggest that the universal social charge will not apply to the bonuses which are due to be paid to senior officials in the banks if they are reduced to a level of &euro;19,999?  The Minister should place a correction on the record of the House and apologise to me.  I said they should be &ldquo;income-linked&rdquo;.  The suggestion that I want to take away the bonuses of low-income workers is an appalling attack, a misrepresentation and a mistruth on the part of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Clarification is not a crime.  It is welcome.  I am sure a finance (No. 2) Bill will be introduced at the next meeting of this Assembly.  I do not doubt that the officials and the Minister will be well able to close off any potential loopholes that have been identified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I could be completely and utterly wrong, as I said.  I am approaching this from a genuine position.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Pat Carey, can tell me whether, after this Bill has been passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, the <Col N="849"/>bonuses that were due to be paid to bankers but are on hold because of the threat of recapitalisation can be reduced to a level of &euro;19,999 in order to ensure the universal social charge does not apply to them.  I am talking about reductions in bonuses that were accrued in 2008.  I do not know what the individual value to each person is.  Would the universal social charge apply if a personal agreement was reached between the bank and an individual to the effect that &euro;19,999, rather than &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, would be paid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that under the capitalisation agreement, no bonuses for senior officials can be paid.  Officials at lower salary levels will pay 50% tax.  I cannot say I fully understand the ramifications of this.  I think adequate safeguards are in place to prevent any abuse of the kind suggested by Deputy Doherty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the officials in the Department of Finance, particularly those dealing with banking, might prepare a note later in the day for the benefit of Deputies.  The Minister advised us during a debate on another Bill and in different arrangements that he had given himself enormous powers under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Bill 2010.  He verbally assured the House that senior executives would not receive bonuses and that the bonus culture was at an end.  That was my understanding when I spoke.  I am concerned about those who work in bank call centres, many of whom are women, as Deputy Kathleen Lynch said.  There have been bank call centres at various times in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency, as he probably knows, as well as other parts of the country.  Those people are paid a relatively low or sometimes very low basic wage &mdash; &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 &mdash; and make up the rest of their pay through bonuses.  Calls are overseen by a supervisor whose job is to make sure they do not go on too long.  The Minister knows himself that if one telephones the bank, one is given only a few moments to answer.  That is the bonus structure.</P>
        <P>We in the Labour Party are anxious to ensure that such low-paid employees &mdash; who are mostly women &mdash; are not penalised inadvertently by this measure, which we strongly support and which the Government is at last introducing.  Perhaps later the officials will be able to provide clarification for us in a note, but that is our legal understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested by Deputy Burton and, I presume, by others will be made available as quickly as it can be prepared &mdash; that is, this afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that.  We are on the same page as the Labour Party in this matter.  We agree there should be an exemption for the circumstances mentioned by the Labour Party Members, but the measure should be income-linked so that it does not catch the rest.  I advise the officials, through the Minister, that the note needs to deal with the question of recapitalisation.  I made this point to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, but he decided not to answer it and instead made a political charge at me.  Will that recapitalisation measure now be defunct as a result of this change?</P>
        <P>The Minister should also remember &mdash; the note needs to deal with this issue &mdash; that there are a number of cases before the courts to do with these bonuses.  I understand that one has already been adjudicated on and the bonus will be paid.  I am not sure whether it has been paid already, but if it is to be paid, the recapitalisation threat does not exist &mdash; it will be paid.  If the others are successful, they will also be paid, regardless of the recapitalisation threat.</P>
        <P>We understand the nature of the Constitution and the role of the courts in these matters.  Regardless of what the courts say, if every single one of those bankers went to court to get his or her bonus, and agreed with the bank that the bonus would be paid at only &euro;19,999, there is nothing we can do in terms of threats about recapitalisation; we would have to pay them.  Thus, the 90% tax is where we catch them.  The point that needs to be clarified is as follows: if a <Col N="850"/>banker goes to court to get his or her bonus, which will be paid at &euro;19,999 under an agreement with the bank, will he or she be subject to a combined tax of 90%, which I believe is the intention of the Government?</P>
        <P>This is rushed legislation and it is important that we try to address flaws, loopholes and things that might not have been envisaged beforehand.  I will repeat my question, to be clear: in the case of a banker who goes to court to get a bonus which, it is agreed, will be paid at &euro;19,999, will the universal social charge kick in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will attempt to have a clarification prepared for the information of the House.  However, I am informed that linking the composition of the bonus to income would give rise to unfair impacts.  For example, if the income limit was &euro;50,000, anyone with an income of &euro;49,000 and a bonus of &euro;15,000 would not pay the charge, but a person with a salary of &euro;51,000 and a bonus of &euro;15,000 would pay.</P>
        <P>On the issue of past bonuses&mdash;&mdash;I am sorry; there is no point in reading out a garbled note into the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine, and I appreciate the efforts taken by the officials to give us the information.  However, I am concerned that there may still be a weakness in this amendment, which may result in a need for further amendment.  If this proves to be the case when the officials look more closely at the Bill, can we deal with it this afternoon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>

I have laid before the House a specific question which can be answered simply by a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I think I know the answer &mdash; in fact, we all do &mdash; and the answer is yes, the bankers would get their bonuses without the universal social charge.  That is the honest answer.  If that is the case, it should be said here on the floor of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 192, line 19, to delete &ldquo;&euro;3&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;&euro;2&rdquo;.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P FLI="0" el="5">Fine Gael has been campaigning for some years to abolish the travel tax.  The tourism industry is one of the sectors of the economy with great job creation potential and it should be stimulated.  Most industries need massive investment before one makes a material change.  In the tourism industry, we have five star hotels all over the country, many of which are half empty; we have a surplus of self-catering accommodation, much of which is not rented; our golf courses are the finest in Europe and the United States, many of which are underused; we have a fine airport terminal in Dublin Airport at half capacity; Shannon and Cork Airports are at one quarter capacity; and the motorway network links the main cities, yet there is little traffic on them.  We have all the services for a much bigger tourism industry and the only thing we lack is tourists.  The number of tourists declined last year by over 1.5 million.  We do not need to invest in the infrastructure but we need to attract people to the country.  That involves marketing and reducing the imposition on tourists flying into Ireland.</P><Col N="853"/>
        <P>The majority of tourists, particularly short-term visitors to the country, arrive on Aer Lingus or Ryanair flights.  We all use the facility of booking on the Internet.  People, especially young people, search for bargains.  One can book flights for 1 cent and &euro;5.  When all the adding up is done, several flights are available from &euro;25-&euro;40.  People may say the imposition of a travel tax of &euro;10 is a nugatory amount but when one looks at the pricing of flights it is a serious imposition.  It might influence the decision of whether a young German couple fly to Dublin or Prague.  From the point of view of the airline, there is the opportunity to adjust fares upwards when the travel tax is abolished.  One may say that another &euro;2 on tickets will not make a difference.  If the travel tax was abolished completely and the airline companies raised average fares by &euro;2, the &euro;2 is not a turnover issue; it runs straight to the bottom line.  The flights are profitable anyway so the extra &euro;2 runs straight to the bottom line.  Ryanair carried 27 million passengers last year and if it had received &euro;2 per passenger, we are talking serious money.  There is a major incentive for flights to be repackaged to attract people.</P>
        <P>The Minister has moved a long way to meeting the arguments made by Fine Gael but a problem exists in respect of domestic flights.  A lower levy applied to people flying to airports in the UK from Irish locations.  The effect of the Minister&rsquo;s changes is to increase the charge between Ireland and the UK by 50% rather than reducing it.  He is applying the same level to everything.  I ask him to examine the travel tax in respect of the concessionary level between Ireland and the UK.  It should be revisited.  I table this as a debating amendment rather than in the expectation that the Minister will accept this on Report Stage late in the afternoon when debate has been truncated.</P>
        <P>Our view is that the travel tax should be abolished completely for all categories of flights.  This should only be done if there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> offered by Ryanair, Aer Lingus and other carriers.  The <i>quid pro quo</i> is to give them what they are looking for if they commit, over a period of time, to bring a certain number of passengers into the country.  If they do not achieve the target, we can put the travel tax back on in two years&rsquo; time.  Business is business and the way to structure it is to give the airlines an incentive to bring in more people while having the stick of restoring it in the other hand if they do not bring in extra passengers.  An opportunity was missed by not having that level of negotiation with the carriers.  There is still a margin for some renegotiation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in favour of amendment No. 36, tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  He suggests a reduction to 1 cent.  This is a technical matter because he would have been ruled out of order if he reduced it to zero as that causes a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The sentiment underpinning the Fine Gael amendment and our amendment is similar.  We need to staff up and introduce traction into the tourism sector.  This sector has been badly hurt in recent years and that is likely to continue for some time yet.  The proposed substantial reduction or virtual abolition of the travel tax, as put forward in Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment, is an important move to assist the sector.  I accept such move would not by any means solve the problem facing the tourism sector but it would provide substantial assistance.</P>
        <P>It is important that the incoming Government would examine the tourism sector as it offers serious prospects for development and it could provide a stimulus to enhance economic growth.  I hope that whatever Government is in place after the election will recognise the need to give a boost to our tourism sector.  Tourism is almost a natural resource at one level in terms of the physical infrastructure and scenery on this island.  We have a great deal of built infrastructure in place and there is massive untapped capacity in the sector in terms of its further development.  There needs to be a new Government-led approach to this sector.  Some hotel chains market themselves on their own or partially on their own steam and F&aacute;ilte Ireland does its job.  Such marketing has been significantly joined up in recent years but it has not been joined up sufficiently to capture the full value of the market spend.  It is important that such marketing <Col N="854"/>of the sector is rolled out, first, on an island basis and, second, on a region by region basis.  There is a huge opportunity to develop the sector and I hope it will be taken.</P>
        <P>If the Minister were to indicate he would accept amendment No. 36, at least it would go some way towards throwing the ball in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members who have contributed to this debate.  Section 49 confirms the budget day change to the rates of air travel tax.  A single rate of &euro;3 per departing passenger will come into operation on 1 March, replacing the existing distance-related rates of &euro;2 and &euro;10.  Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s amendment proposes that the new lower rate should be &euro;2 rather than &euro;3 and Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment proposes that the new lower rate of &euro;3 should instead be 1 cent.</P>
        <P>The measure I provided for in the Finance Bill, namely, the reduction from &euro;10 to &euro;3 will cost the Exchequer about &euro;56 million in tax this year.  In a full year the cost will be close to &euro;70 million.  Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s amendment would raise the cost by about &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million.  Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s amendment would cost in the region of an additional &euro;35 million in a full year, in effect, abolishing the tax.</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan that the whole basis of such a change must be whether delivery takes place from the carriers and in my budget speech I made that very clear.  I hope the incoming Government will review the air travel tax in the light of its experience with the carriers.  The announcement in the budget was not restricted to the air travel tax but also allowed free landing rights at Dublin Airport Authority airports beyond certain levels of passengers.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in applying a tax on air travel.  A number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes, including the United Kingdom and France.  Both Australia and New Zealand apply similar taxes.  The United States has introduced a tourist tax for tourists travelling to the United States by air.  Germany and Austria have just introduced an air travel tax to apply from January 2011.  The rates of tax applied by many of those countries are higher than the Irish rates, substantially so in some cases, and the trend in Europe is towards applying a tax on air travel.</P>
        <P>There have been calls to abolish the tax on the basis that it adversely affects the number of people travelling to Ireland.  I have some difficulty accepting that proposition and I consider that the impact of the air travel tax is being over-stated.  I take Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s point about the effect of this on the balance sheet.</P>
        <P>The numbers travelling appear to be more closely related to other factors, including the level of economic activity.  Notwithstanding reservations, I decided that a single revised rate of air travel tax at &euro;3 would come into effect on 1 March 2011.  I stated in the budget that this reduction should apply only on a temporary basis with the rate being increased unless there is clear and decisive evidence of an appropriate response from the airlines through increasing capacity and the numbers travelling to Ireland by air.  I am glad that the budget announcement is being supplemented by the incentive scheme introduced by Dublin Airport Authority for a full rebate of airport charges for additional traffic delivered above a certain threshold based on 2010 passenger levels.</P>
        <P>A modest air tax of &euro;3 will yield close to &euro;35 million in a full year.  The case for reducing that tax rate any further does not stand up, especially when we are under ongoing fiscal pressures where, understandably, there is a requirement that the tax system be as fair as possible.  In addition, I would point out that the reduction in the air travel tax was a significant concession and it would be right to see if passenger numbers rise on foot of the change in the Finance Bill.</P>
        <P>It is important as a matter of general policy, and apart from the particular details of this matter, that we protect the Revenue base of the State.  It would have been possible, for <Col N="855"/>example, at the time of the original abolition to maintain air travel tax at a certain low level.  In general, I believe that is a better way to proceed than to proceed to complete abolition of the tax. History shows that when one gives a total exemption from any particular head of taxation, one generates a climate in which it becomes impossible to reintroduce it.   I took a similar view in regard to stamp duties in the budget.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office has ruled out of order the amendments I submitted, amendments Nos. 37 to 42, inclusive, on the basis that they would pose a charge on the people.  What I am trying to do here is to raise more revenue for the Minister and the State.  It is a strange definition of the people in terms of posing a charge on them that levying an additional tax on an international Internet operator in Gambia or in Gibraltar would be regarded as a charge on the people.</P>
        <P>I wonder, Sir, if I could address one or two of the issues involved for which, I suspect, there would be a fair hearing on the other side of the House?  This involves the betting tax.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We are.  I have taken the trouble of putting down these amendments and I want to briefly raise the issues involved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to raise revenue for the Minister in a difficult situation.  In the Finance Bill the Minister proposed a 1% turnover tax and there is fair support for that as a fair compromise in terms of the measure that has been proposed.  The problem is that seven of the ten providers have their servers outside this State; they are offshore companies.  What the Minister proposes to do in trying to determine the 1% turnover tax will be a difficult task because these companies are based outside this jurisdiction.  What I have suggested in these amendments is that the annual licence fee to have such a facility, or the new charge, would be a minimum of &euro;50,000.  As the Bill stands, it is &euro;5,000.  Increasing it to &euro;50,000 would have a number of advantages.  It would raise revenue.  For some fly by night operators in existence outside this State who offer services to citizens of this State, it would set an important financial threshold that they would have to obtain were they to get a licence to operate in this country, and that would be significant.  If they did not have the &euro;50,000 upfront, they should not be registered or have a licence here.  Many of these operators, be they in Gibraltar, Gambia or wherever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="856"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concerned the Deputy is broadening the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I will conclude on this point.  These operators will simply put on their websites that they have been fully recognised by the Irish State as an operator in this country for a licence fee of &euro;5,000.  We are underselling ourselves.  An amendment I proposed, which astonishingly is regarded as a charge on our poor people, given the fact that it is a charge on companies outside this jurisdiction, would simply create a fair licence fee for these operators to operate in this country.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on this.  This could be a provision for inclusion in a new finance Bill.  It seems strange that, for &euro;5,000, we will be allowing these companies to publish on their websites that they have been recognised by the Irish State as operators here.  We are underselling ourselves.  The charge should be &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000 at a minimum; that would be fair.  I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the merits of the argument.  One difficulty with not having had the legislation to revise the bookmakers legislation before the House is that we will not have had a proper discussion on it before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il.  The incoming Government will have to introduce the bookmakers legislation to complete the legislative picture.</P>
        <P>I believed Deputy Hayes would raise the issue as to whether the duty should be 1% or 2%.  There is a Fine Gael amendment tabled that seeks to give the Minister power to increase the betting duty from 1% to 2%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not mine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is No. 43, in the name of the Deputy Barrett.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael is not necessarily committed to amendment No. 43 as a party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making another point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wisely not doing so because it would lead to a lot of unemployment, both among bookmakers and employees in online businesses that have located in Ireland.  Fine Gael is prudently withdrawing from that proposal.</P>
        <P>The difficulty with the amendment to which Deputy Hayes spoke is that I am advised there are difficulties associated with putting in place a very high license fee.  The Deputy referred to Gambia and other exotic locations.  Some of the locations are within the European Union.  In drawing up legislation in this area, we must be conscious of the various freedoms that apply within the Union.  If one introduced a very high licence fee, it could be deemed restrictive on trade grounds in the context of a Single Market.  For example, a licence fee of &euro;5,000 for a company that may take only a handful of small bets from Ireland could be deemed onerous.  The Commission is always mindful that member states cannot put in place provisions that could be regarded as disproportionate.</P>
        <P>This area could be re-examined in the context of the betting legislation.  The essential legal technique being used in this case is to provide that an Internet betting facility provider must register as a bookkeeper here.  Thus, the traditional bookmakers legislation, which applied to the mainstream bookmaker, is extended to the Internet scene.  The devising of legal formulae to provide for this is quite difficult.  We must be very careful about how we do so.  It is a matter to which the House can return in the context of the bookmakers legislation, which will be essential before the 1% charge comes into force.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="857"/>
      <Speaker pid="ChrisAndrews"><NameTxt>Deputy Chris Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the licence fee, &euro;5,000 seems very low for shady online operators.  An increase would certainly be helpful because these operators are claiming respectability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his very helpful comments.  He is absolutely correct.  Ireland has many people employed in this area and it has done well at devising Internet gambling websites and ensuring the relevant technologies are in and place.  We have a very proud new industry that has done very well.  The only dilemma involves determining the 1% turnover to a company that, while registered here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to hear me out on this point.  Unless we have an army of people in the Revenue Commissioners who are prepared to go to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man constantly to check the books of the operators in question, we will face a dilemma.  We must consider the issue of fairness.  We must ensure that the industry that has been established here has a level playing pitch for everyone.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment that the House will have to return to this matter when a new D&aacute;il is assembled in order to ensure the loopholes are addressed.</P>

	<P>What is the purport of the amendment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>A section is being excluded that allows the Minister to increase betting tax.  We do not know why the Minister does not want to retain that discretion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Section 50 provides for the taxation of bets that remote bookmakers enter into with persons in this State.  This means, for example, that a business that engages in online bookmaking and which accepts bets from individuals in this country will be liable for a betting duty on those bets, irrespective of where that business is based.  The existing betting duty of 1% is being applied to such bets.</P>
        <P>The section also provides for the taxation of remote betting intermediaries.  These operations, which are generally known as betting exchanges, facilitate clients in entering into bets with one another and charge for this service.  A new duty, which will be called betting intermediary duty, will be charged on commission earned from persons in this country at a rate of 15%.  Excise <Col N="858"/>duties are also being applied to the granting and renewal of remote bookmakers&rsquo; and remote betting intermediaries&rsquo; licenses.  The betting (amendment) Bill being drafted will establish the statutory framework for these licences.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many Deputies in this House used the opportunity afforded by Committee Stage to welcome these provisions, and I am glad we appear to have cross-party support in an area that has thrown up many logistical challenges for my advisers and the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Section 50 provides for the repeal of the provision in the Finance Act 2009 that allowed for an increase to 2% in the rate of betting duty subject to ministerial commencement order.  The Deputies amendment is seeking to remove this element of section 50 and effectively keep in place the possibility of the Minister raising the betting duty to 2%.  My decision to repeal that provision is simply based on the practicality of the position we are in.  I do not envisage a scenario in which the 1% rate could be raised to 2% given the obvious pressures on betting shops across the country.  We have seen significant job losses from shop closures, and one way of ensuring further job losses would be to move to a rate of 2%.  Further shop closures have been flagged for later this year, even without the rate increase.</P>
        <P>The prospect of a rise to 2% prompted significant levels of correspondence from staff working in betting shops across the country who would be worried about their jobs if the increase were to occur.  Most of the letters were forwarded to me by Deputies of all parties and virtually all constituencies.  That significant job losses have occurred, even without a move to 2%, should inform Deputy Barrett of what is appropriate in this instance.</P>
        <P>Jobs in the betting sector are as important as jobs in the horse-racing sector.  My approach has been to move towards a level playing field in a way that widens the tax base but protects employment across the betting and horse-racing sectors.  This is a balanced approach that should be welcomed by the House.  If a future Government decides the betting duty should be increased, it can introduce a legislative change to that effect in the finance Bill.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.  I understand the college referred to by the Deputy is a private college and is not on the list of approved institutions for the purpose of the scheme.  </P>
        <P>However, Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provides for the introduction of tax relief for fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU Member States as well as in private colleges in this state. This relief, which applies at the standard rate of tax, is available to full time and part time students and includes distance education courses offered by publicly funded colleges in other EU Member States. Further details on claiming this relief are available from local tax offices or on Revenue&rsquo;s internet site at <i>http://www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>Skilled trades persons who are registered with F&Aacute;S as apprentices and who wish to validate their competence may apply for the National Craft Certificate or the Advanced Certificate (Craft) awarded by FETAC under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) procedures. The RPL procedures cover three categories of applicant:  &mdash; F&Aacute;S registered time-served craftspersons applying for a National Craft  Certificate &mdash; Apprentices newly registered with F&Aacute;S and who are seeking exemptions from the Standards Based Apprenticeship Programme. Exemptions are based on a portfolio of evidence submitted by the applicant to F&Aacute;S Apprenticeship Services for subsequent subject matter expert analysis. &mdash; F&Aacute;S registered apprentices under the Standards Based Apprenticeship Programme  who have completed Phases 1 &mdash; 7 (including Phase 7 equivalent assessments where appropriate) of their apprenticeship but who have not completed four years in employment as an apprentice from the date of registration. These persons can submit a portfolio of evidence to include further training, education and work experience to the Redundant Apprentice Accreditation Committee for  consideration for award of the Advanced Certificate (Craft).</P>
        <P>Skilled trades persons who wish to make an application under the RPL procedures can request an application form from their local F&Aacute;S Services to Business office and will be duly assisted in establishing their eligibility.</P>
        <P>In relation to qualifications under the Standards Based Apprenticeship  Programme an apprentice who has successfully completed an apprenticeship in  Ireland is awarded the FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate (Craft). This is a  compulsory requirement for craftsperson status in Ireland and has both national  and international recognition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the Government has taken a decision to provide educational teaching supports to Traveller students on the same basis as other students in schools. This means that Traveller students who require additional tuition will receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.</P>
        <P>All schools will be advised to select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.  The principle of &ldquo;individual educational need&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Traveller identity&rdquo; is central to The Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy and the key criterion <Col N="864"/>underlying the recommendations of the report for the provision of additional resources to all children, including Traveller children.</P>
        <P>Resource Teacher for Traveller posts will be withdrawn, effective from September 2011. It is intended that alleviation measures will be provided for schools with high concentrations of Traveller children and that schools will shortly be advised of the alleviation measures which will apply and of the qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>My Department will advise all schools of their staffing allocation in advance of the next school year. With regard to the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers, the decision to remove the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers is just one of a range of measures, included in the National Recovery Plan 2011 to 2014, to secure some &euro;24m in savings in the 2011/2012 school year. The service will therefore be discontinued with effect from 31 August 2011. At present there are 41 posts in this service. Until September 2009 the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers was managed directly by the Regional Office Directorate within my Department. In September 2009 the Service was transferred to the National Education Welfare Board to be integrated with existing school support services.</P>
        <P>The set of measures included in the National Recovery Plan 2011 to 2014 impacts on every sector of the public service and will unquestionably lead to significant challenges for schools as well as the Department in the coming years. The major challenge will undoubtedly be to seek improved outcomes for children with fewer resources prioritising available resources to maximum effect across the education sector to enhance educational outcomes for all including Traveller children and adults.</P>

	<P>As I previously outlined to the Deputy the Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of analysing all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017. Overall post-primary requirements in the North Kildare area, including the case for the provision of a new Irish language post-primary school will be considered in this context.  However, as the Deputy may be aware, a multi-million Euro building project has been provided for Col&aacute;iste Cois Liffe, Lucan to cater for a long term projected enrolment of 600 pupils. This Gaelcholaiste, under the aegis of Co. Dublin VEC was built to serve the needs of the west Dublin /north Kildare area, including Maynooth and Kilcock. The enrolment for 2009/10 in Col&aacute;iste Cois Life was 345 and therefore this school would appear to have capacity to cater for the North Kildare area.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale capital projects and assigned a Band 3 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.education.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>I recently announced the projects which will be commencing the process of appointing design teams in 2011 and in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it was not possible to include a project for the school to which he refers on this list.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including the project for this school, from initial design through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s future multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.</P>

	<P>As I have previously outlined to the Deputy a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being carried out under the Commission on School Accommodation. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the <Col N="870"/>provision of new schools. The Commission is due to report to me shortly at which time I will have to consider the policy matters and necessary arrangements and revised procedures that will need to be put in place.</P>
        <P>The establishment of new schools, including the request for a new school in the Clane/Prosperous area, will be considered in this context.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the new procedure requiring cars that have been adapted for disabled drivers to wait two weeks to be assessed by national car test is causing hardship; whereas pre-September 2010 they could be seen straight away by the vehicle registration office and if he will take steps to eliminate the wait </Quest>
        <QRef>[4251/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under the revised registration procedures (operated by the National Car Testing Service (NCTS) since 1 September 2010), the Revenue Commissioners continue to manage and administer the scheme of relief from vehicle registration tax (VRT) for Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers.  In this regard, where Revenue approves an application for relief under the scheme, a letter confirming the appropriate relief from VRT is issued to the applicant, which must then be presented at an NCTS centre in order that the particular vehicle may be registered.   The Deputy may wish to note that where a letter confirming relief from the payment of VRT under Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers relief is presented by a person at the time of registration (along with other required documentation (e.g. drivers licence, utility bill, evidence of PPS number)), for a vehicle that has previously been declared to Revenue by the distributor, vehicle registration can be completed at that time.</P>
        <P>However, for a specific model, whose details have not previously been declared to Revenue and for which Revenue officials have not determined the value for registration tax purposes, that vehicle must first be valued by Revenue&rsquo;s officials before registration can be completed. Revenue have confirmed that at present this process generally takes 2/3 days.</P>
        <P>In order to streamline registration procedures, Revenue will, from the end of March 2011, be providing electronic facilities so that <i>new</i>   vehicles purchased by disabled drivers and disabled passengers from authorised traders may be registered by the trader at their premises through the Revenue On-Line Service (ROS). This represents a significant improvement on the pre-September 2010 service.</P>
        <P>Additionally, a further facility is being introduced in March to allow authorised traders to have <i>used</i>   vehicles supplied to disabled persons under the relief scheme, subjected to a pre-registration examination in advance of the sale so that they can again be registered at the dealers&rsquo; premises through ROS. This procedural development will again represent an improvement on the pre-September level of service, as it will eliminate the need for the disabled driver/passenger or his/her agent to present the vehicle at a vehicle registration office for examination which will expedite the registration of such vehicles.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the person named is currently taxed under PAYE on a private pension and his tax credits have been reduced to take account of a Department of Social Protection pension of &euro;5750. In view of the age entitlements of the named individual, it is not however clear that the correct DSP pension amount has been included in the tax credit reduction, and Revenue will be in contact with the named individual to clarify the matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">If an employee is given free shares by his or her employer, the employee is normally chargeable to income tax on the value of the shares, just as the employee would be chargeable to income tax on the value of a cash bonus. However, where the shares are awarded by an employer to an employee through a Revenue approved profit sharing scheme, the employees are not chargeable to income tax on the value of the shares awarded, subject to a general annual limit of &euro;12,700 on the value of shares. The cost to the Exchequer is essentially the income tax forgone on the value of any shares awarded under such schemes.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of this tax relief is estimated at &euro;99 million for the income tax year 2008, the most recent year for which final information is available.</P>
        <P>As regards the yield from a possible withdrawal of the tax relief it should be borne in mind that the scale of any such yield would arise in terms of current values which, in view of the impact of the recession, might now be less than those underlying the 2008 cost.</P>

        <QRef>[4333/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes outlined 43 rationalisation measures concerning State agencies and other bodies and information on the status of these proposals, including information on the numbers employed, as reported to my Department is set out in Table 1. In summary, 3 decisions have been taken to implement the proposed rationalisations in full. There will be a reduction of 20 bodies as a result. Decisions have also been taken to implement a further 11 proposals in part. Further information in relation to individual rationalisation decisions should be sought from the relevant Minister. These rationalisation decisions are in addition to the 30 decisions announced in Budget 2009, 19 of which have been implemented to date. Given the variety of factors that affect public service numbers policy, it is not possible to determine accurately the total reduction in public sector numbers associated with individual policy decisions taken to date. Overall public service numbers have reduced by over 12,000 since end 2008. This is due to a range of factors, including the moratorium on recruitment and promotion, the introduction of a new numbers control framework as recommended by the Special Group, the rationalisation of State Agencies and bodies and Government priorities in regard to public service provision. In addition, the public service numbers ceilings as set out on Page 64 of the <i>National Recovery Plan 2011-2014</i>   will see the number employed in the public service reduced to under 295,000 by the end of 2014.</P>
        <P>I would also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Page 69 of the <i>National Recovery Plan 2011-2014</i>   where it is stated that the programme of State Agency rationalisation that commenced in 2008 will continue with a particular emphasis on:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />reducing the number and range of agencies;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />redeploying staff to areas of greatest need;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />improving governance and performance arrangements; and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />sharing services.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The reduction in expenditure allocations over the period of the <i>National Recovery Plan 2011-2014</i>   in conjunction with revised employment ceilings will, accordingly, require continued progress across Departments and Offices in the rationalisation of Agencies as appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The correspondence which the Deputy refers to proposes that mortgage holders should be able to access moneys invested in their pension funds before the date of maturity in order to meet mortgage repayments on their homes or investment properties.   Responsibility for occupational pensions&rsquo; policy rests with my colleague the Minister for Social Protection. However, as the Deputy will be aware his issue was commented on briefly in the Final Report by the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group (Group) set up by me to make recommendations for improving supports for homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments. While the Group did not consider in any great detail the issue of accessing pension funds, it did recognize that this is a complex matter with long term implications. Any such measure for example would have tax implications for the individual concerned.</P>
        <P>The rationale for giving various tax reliefs to statutory and Revenue-approved pension savings schemes is to encourage and promote savings over the long term in order that individuals will have an adequate replacement income in old age. Any proposal, however well intentioned, that would allow pre-retirement access by individuals to retirement savings could significantly reduce the quantum of pension savings available to those individuals in retirement.</P>
        <P>Emerging demographic indicators point to increasing numbers of people living longer and healthier lives with more of their lives spent in retirement than previously. In those circumstances, I think it is important to protect pension savings to ensure an adequate post-retirement income.</P>
        <P>Revenue approval of occupational pension schemes is given on the basis, essentially, that benefits may generally only be paid at the point of retirement (usually from age 60) or death, whichever is the earlier. Similar rules apply in the case of personal pensions such as retirement annuity contracts and PRSAs. I have no plans to amend these provisions.</P>
        <P>As has been stated on many occasions in this House, it is a priority of the Government to ensure that as far as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  I am confident that the support measures been taken by Government, including the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by MABS, are having a positive effect alongside the recommendations of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Group which I referred to earlier.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will clarify the situation regarding the increased taxation and the universal social change as announced in budget 2011 particularly for working widows; the reason widows have been treated more harshly than other workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that all income tax credits with the exception of the aged tax credits where reduced by approximately 10% in Budget 2011. In addition, the single standard rate band was reduced by approximately 10% and the relationship between the single standard rate band and the additional rate bands was maintained.  For example, the one-parent family rate band which is available to widowed parents is still &euro;4,000 greater than the single standard rate band.  As the income tax code has many favourable provisions relating to the tax treatment of widowed persons, particularly widowed parents with dependent children, the cumulative effect of the 10% reduction in income tax credits and tax bands in Budget 2011 has seen widowed persons losing more when compared to a single income earner on the same income.  However, I would point out that a widowed person is still far better off in terms of net income after deductions when compared to a single individual on the same income.   </P>
        <P>The Universal Social Charge (USC) was introduced in Budget 2011 and it replaced the Income Levy and Health Levy.  The USC is a more equitable charge that applies on a wider base at a low rate.  It removes the steps and poverty traps associated with the Income Levy and Health Levy.   It should be noted that payments from the Department of Social Protection such as the widowed person&rsquo;s contributory State pension are exempt from the USC. The Universal Social Charge (USC) is applied at the following rates:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2% on the first &euro;10,036 (&euro;193 per week)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />4% on the next &euro;5,980 (&euro;193.01 to &euro;308.00 per week) and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />7% on the balance.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, I should point out that I introduced a Committee Stage amendment during the Finance Bill 2011, which provides for medical card holders to be chargeable to the USC at the following rates:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2% on the first &euro;10,036 (&euro;193 per week)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />4% on the balance.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Widowed persons in receipt of a widowed person&rsquo;s State pension were previously exempt from the Health Levy and there are no such exemptions from the USC.  Therefore, widowed persons will see their net pay reduce as a consequence of the introduction of the USC.   However, I would point out again that a widowed person is still better off in terms of net income after deductions when compared to a single individual on the same income.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">Furthermore, it should be noted that payments from the Department of Social Protection such as the contributory and non-contributory State pension are exempt from the USC.   Also, where an individual&rsquo;s total income which is chargeable to the USC, is below &euro;4,004 in a year of assessment, the USC would not apply.</P>
        <P>Therefore, based on the question put forward by the Deputy, where a retired public servant is in receipt of a medical card and has a State pension from the Department of Social Protection and a public service pension they will only be chargeable to the USC on their public service pension at a rate of 2 per cent on the first &euro;10,036 per annum and 4 per cent on the balance, assuming it is above &euro;4,004 per annum.</P>

I understand that the Institute is now making alternative arrangements with the assistance of a university school of public health.</P>

Prior to the establishment of the Adoption Authority, I wrote to the Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federation to initiate discussions on putting in place a bilateral agreement with Russia. I am still awaiting a response to this letter. I will continue to engage with the Russian authorities on this matter.</P>
        <P>As with any bilateral agreement on intercountry adoption, a bilateral agreement with Russia would need to be explicit on the issues of consent and the financial costs of effecting an adoption.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 to 40, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The development of a National Positive Ageing Strategy arises from a commitment in the Programme for Government 2007-2012.  It is being developed within the constraints posed by the present fiscal situation. It is not the intention that it will propose new service developments; rather it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.  It is envisaged that the Strategy will set out a common framework for the development of operational plans by Government Departments clearly setting out their objectives relating to older people, as well as the development of ongoing mechanisms designed to monitor progress and identify challenges facing older people in the future.</P><Col N="883"/>
        <P>Development of the Strategy is being assisted by a Cross-Departmental Group (CDG), comprised of officials from 11 Government Departments, the Central Statistics Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and is chaired by the Director of the Office for Older People. An NGO Liaison Group comprising representatives of twelve national-level non-governmental organisations with an interest in older people&rsquo;s issues has been established under an independent chair.  An Expert Advisory Group, which is in the process of being established, will also inform the process.</P>
        <P>Research has been commissioned on national strategies for older people in other jurisdictions.  The Strategy will also take cognisance of other strategies and policy documents developed in Ireland over the past decade, and the strategy will be underpinned by the <i>UN Principles for Older Persons,</i> the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s <i>Active Ageing: A Policy Framework</i> (2002), and the <i>Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing</i> (2002).</P>
        <P>The development of the Strategy will also be informed by information gained through a public consultation process.  A call for written submissions was issued in June 2009 and 190 submissions were received from a broad range of stakeholders.  Following the written consultation process, a series of nine consultation meetings was held from March to May 2010.  These meetings, attended by approx 1200 people, were held in Cork, Sligo, Galway, Kildare, Wexford, Newcastle West, Dundalk, Dublin and Athlone. Meetings were also held in April 2010 with groups representing vulnerable and marginalised older people. A round-table meeting was also held with stakeholders involved in the Louth Age Friendly County Initiative with a view to learning more about the approaches taken in relation to older people&rsquo;s issues in County Louth.</P>
        <P>A report on the consultation process to highlight issues which older people and service providers raised was finalised and published on 22 November 2010.  The report also outlines other relevant background information.</P>
        <P>Work on the preparation of the Strategy and the development of monitoring and review structures and processes are on-going in consultation with the groups listed above.</P>

	<P>The age of consent is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform has provided me with the following information.  The Deputy will be aware that a majority of members of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children favoured a reduction in the age of consent from 17 to 16. In Northern Ireland, the age of consent has been reduced to 16 bringing it in line with the age threshold in the rest of the UK. </P>
        <P>A Draft General Scheme to implement the majority recommendation of the Joint Committee is close to finalisation. The proposed reduction will also make it easier to harmonise our laws protecting young persons against sexual abuse with those in Northern Ireland. It would reduce confusion about the age and remove anomalies, particularly in border areas where young people cross the border regularly to socialise.</P>

	<P>The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is drafting the Heads for the National Vetting Bureau Bill. Formal consultations have taken place with the Health Service Executive, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and colleagues in other Government Departments. Once complete the Heads and General Scheme will be submitted to Government for approval to proceed to the drafting of the legislation. </P>
        <P>This area has also been considered by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment for Children and the findings of the Committee are being considered in the preparation of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The National Vetting Bureau Bill will make provision for a statutory basis for the vetting of applicants for employment and employees.The vetting process will provide for the identification of both hard and &lsquo;soft/relevant information&rsquo;, in particular, information relating to the endangerment, sexual exploitation or sexual abuse, or risk thereof, to children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>A number of complex issues, including rights of citizens under the Constitution and human rights generally, require to be addressed in the preparation of the legislation The use of &lsquo;soft/relevant information&rsquo; for vetting purposes is inherently complex and great care must be taken in the drafting of the Heads and General Scheme to ensure that due account is taken of the complex constitutional, legal and ethical issues which arise.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a new National Vetting Bureau would give rise to a need for additional resources. The quantification of this resource will take place in the context of the legislative process, in particular as part of the required Regulatory Impact Analysis.</P>

        <Quest> if the figure published in section 7.5 key indicator 5 &mdash; operating costs per airport, table 7.4 for Galway Airport contained in the report Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme &mdash; Department of Transport June 2010 is incorrect based on the audited accounts as submitted to his Department (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme was completed during 2010 and published on 12 January 2011.  The figure referred to by the Deputy for operating costs at Galway Airport in 2009 is correctly stated as &euro;3,588,827 in Section 6.4.4. Galway Airport &mdash; Table 6.15 Revenues, Costs and OPEX subvention received since 2005.     However, due to a clerical error the figure for operating costs in 2009 was incorrectly stated in the further table and location in the Report mentioned by the Deputy.  I would like to apologise for this mistake and to assure the Deputy that the reference and any related commentary in the section of the Review will be rectified.</P>
        <P>Section 6.4.4. of the Review correctly noted that the trend towards steadily increasing OPEX subvention &ldquo;continued until last year [2009], when a major cost cutting scheme by the airport meant that losses sustained were minimised somewhat.&rdquo;  The Review also correctly commented that &ldquo;Despite having the benefit of a PSO route, Galway Airport was still not breaking even during the height of the economic boom.  Further losses along the lines of what were sustained in 2009 are to be expected in the short-term at least.  All things being equal, this means that OPEX funding in the region of &euro;1m will be required to make up the shortfall.&rdquo;  For 2010, a total of &euro;1,799,339 was provided to Galway under the OPEX scheme.</P>
        <P>I should point out that Key Indicator 5, was only one of the indicators used in the Review and the overall conclusions and recommendations of the Review are not affected.</P>
        <P>Proposals for revised schemes for the Core Airport Management Operational Expenditure Subvention (OPEX) scheme and the Capital Expenditure Grants (CAPEX) scheme will be submitted to Government in due course.</P>

	<P>Ireland and the United Kingdom operate a common travel area (CTA) which facilitates unrestricted travel within that zone for citizens of both jurisdictions. The maintenance of this arrangement requires co-operation on immigration matters between Ireland and the United Kingdom, especially as the Irish courts have held that it is a fundamental public policy of the State to safeguard the existence of the CTA.   It is, therefore, necessary for the immigration authorities in the UK and Ireland to exchange information regarding foreign nationals, on a regular basis.  To that end, arrangements are in place between the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) to facilitate the secure, efficient and effective exchange of immigration data to the mutual benefit of each jurisdiction in preserving the integrity of the Common Travel Area.</P><Col N="889"/>
        <P>The Immigration Act 2004 was enacted for the stated purpose of making provision, in the interest of the common good, for the control of entry into the State, the duration and condition of stay in the State and obligations while in the State of non-Irish nationals.  Provision is made at section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004 for an Immigration Officer to authorise a non-national to land in the State.  However sub-section (3) of section 4 enumerates, at (a) to (k),<b> </b>  eleven circumstances in which an immigration officer, may, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, refuse to give a person a permission to land in the State.  The said circumstances, any one of which, may give rise to a permission to land being refused, includes that enumerated at section 4(3)(h), where &ldquo;a non-national- (i) intends to travel (immediately or not) to Great Britain or Northern Ireland and (ii) would not qualify for admission to Great Britain or Northern Ireland if he or she arrived there from a place other than the State&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In circumstances where any law enforcement authority in the UK requires An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide evidence which it is intended is to be used in a criminal prosecution in the UK, it is necessary for a formal request for legal assistance to be made through the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance at the Department of Justice and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>In the event that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to offer evidence relating to any persons immigration status in this State, in court proceedings of a civil nature, in another jurisdiction, including the UK, the permission of the Commissioner will be sought for the member concerned to travel to the relevant jurisdiction for the purpose of offering the evidence required.</P>
        <P>No application was received from the UK immigration authorities in 2010, for any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attached to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to travel to the UK for the purpose of offering evidence in a UK court in civil proceedings undertaken in that jurisdiction.</P>

	<P>Directive 2009/52/EC provides for minimum standards on sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third country nationals.  The Directive is targeted at the illegal employment of third country nationals in order to counteract illegal immigration.  It provides minimum standards on sanctions and measures, including disqualification from public benefits and, in serious cases, criminal penalties against employers of illegally staying third country nationals.</P>
        <P>The Directive was adopted in the summer of 2009 and Member States are expected to have transposed the measure into national law by the second half of 2011.  The Commission will then report on the coming into operation of the measure in February 2012 after it has come into effect in all affected Member States.</P>
        <P>Neither Ireland nor the UK have opted into the Directive, to date, under the provisions of the protocol to the Treaties on the special position of Ireland and the UK.  My Department was aware, however, that the UK authorities have commenced a formal review, in line with commitments made to their national parliament, on the possibility of opting into the Directive under the post adoption procedure provided for in the Twenty First Protocol to the TFEU.</P><Col N="890"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the information is now to hand.  The number of prisoners in custody on the 17th December 2010 (when the survey required to answer this Question was initiated) was 4,397.  Details are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been major progress in recent years in terms of addressing and eliminating the problems presented by slopping out.  72% of our accommodation now has in-cell sanitation.  New spaces at Castlerea, Portlaoise and Wheatfield Prisons have been made available.  In addition, construction has commenced on the extension to the Midlands Prison which is due to open in 2012.  With these developments, the proportion of prisoners with access to full sanitation facilities will rise to in excess of 80% of the total prisoner population.  The final elimination of the remaining outdated accommodation, mainly at Mountjoy and Cork Prisons, and to a lesser degree at Portlaoise and Limerick is dependent on the progress of the Thornton Hall and Kilworth Projects.</P><Col N="891"/>
        <P>I might also add that a new camping style toilet/commode has been tested recently on a trial basis, in Mountjoy, Limerick and Cork Prisons.  I understand the initial feedback from prisoners was positive and the Irish Prison Service is now rolling out this initiative to all areas where prisoners currently slop out.   The Irish Prison Service also has toilet patrols in operation until late evening in Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick Prisons with staff rostered to provide this function after final lock in the evenings.  Prisoners requesting to use toilet<b> </b>  facilities after these times are accommodated where possible.  The possibility of extending toilet patrols is being further examined by the Irish Prison Service.</P>
        <P>Finally, in assembling the information for this reply, the Deputy may wish to note the following interpretations placed on the Question:</P>
        <P>1. Where the Question refers to &ldquo;in private&rdquo;, this is taken to mean that modesty screens are available when prisoners wish to use toilets / chamber pots.  The term &ldquo;private&rdquo; is taken to refer to the availability of a modesty screen because, for operational and prisoner safety reasons, no prisoner is allowed to be entirely out of the view of prison staff at any time.</P>
        <P>2. The term &ldquo;prisoners required to use normal toilet facilities but in the presence of others&rdquo; is taken to refer to prisoners occupying cells with a normal flush toilet installed but where the cells are occupied by more than one prisoner.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table and relates to the situation as it pertained on the  26 January, 2010. </P>
        <P>The primary role of the Irish Prison Service is the provision of safe and secure custody for prisoners. The majority of prisoners on lock up are those who would be considered to be under threat or &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; in the general population due, for example, to gangland feuding, drug debts, because they gave evidence in a court case or because of the nature of their offences, e.g. those of a sexual nature.</P>
        <P>The requirement for prisoners who request protection to be accommodated in separate areas from other identified persons from whom they may be at risk is of primary importance. In that regard a number of our prisons have significant numbers of what would be regarded as protection prisoners accommodated on separate landings. These prisoners have access to a wide regime of activities including school, workshops, gym facilities, probation and chaplaincy services.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, there is a cohort of protection prisoners who are subject to a more restricted regime.  The majority of these prisoners are located in our older prisons. These prisons are not in a position to offer enhanced regimes because of constraints on space, resources, staffing levels and the number of factions which have to be kept separate from each other. Nonetheless, efforts are made on a continuous basis to reduce the numbers of protection prisoners who fall into this category and regular transfers take place to other institutions where a prisoner will not require protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>A person born outside of Ireland with a parent who was born in Ireland is automatically an Irish citizen by descent.</P>
        <P>A person born outside of Ireland with a parent who was also born outside Ireland and a grandparent who was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registration in the Foreign Births Register, which is maintained by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>If a person wishes to apply for Irish citizenship through a great grandparent born in Ireland, the position is more complex. Eligibility depends on one of the applicant&rsquo;s parents, i.e. the grandchild of the person born in Ireland, being already entered in the Foreign Births Register, the date of that registration and the applicants date of birth.</P>
        <P>If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation.  Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements including requirements in relation to residency.  However I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances &mdash; for example where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to made an application for Family Reunification in January 2009.</P>
        <P>I understand that a letter issued  to the person&rsquo;s legal representative in July 2010 informing them that the INIS is waiting on an interdepartmental report.  A further letter issued  on the 5th January 2011 advising the person concerned that they should contact their legal representative.</P>
        <P>In recent years significant progress had been made in reducing the waiting period to 15-16 months. However, some cases may take considerably longer than this. Family Reunification cases, of their nature, can give rise to longer than average processing times because of the necessary checks to establish the family relationships and, where appropriate, dependancy on the applicant. This work includes the examination and verification of relevant documentation and other background investigations. In some cases, depending on the country of origin of the applicant,  it can prove very difficult to produce the kind of documentation requested. When such documents are lacking this naturally can lead to considerable further delay.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, legal proceedings taken in these cases, including cases pending a decision of the Courts, may also affect the processing of applications for family reunification.</P>
        <P>I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

In line with the required procedures as set down in the Civil Service Superannuation Scheme for Established Civil Servants, her pension, lump sum gratuity and death benefits were preserved.  The pension and lump sum will be paid as from the time she reaches 60 years of age.   If before attaining 60 years the person&rsquo;s state of health deteriorates to such an extent that immediate payment of preserved benefits is justified, the pension and lump sum will become payable.  Otherwise, it is not possible to bring forward payment of preserved benefits.

This application was examined by officials in my Department and a letter of refusal was issued on 22 November 2010. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Nationals of the U.S.A. are not visa required and may seek to enter and reside in the State on visitor&rsquo;s conditions for up to 90 days. A visitor stamp should be read as indicating that the immigration Officer at the port of entry was told by the Non-EEA national that he/she was coming for a visit of a duration of not more than 90 days and should leave at the end of the permitted period.</P>

It is the policy of my Department not to extend a permission to remain to persons who are admitted for a period of 90 days or less on a short stay visit, save in very exceptional and unforeseen circumstances.</P>
        <P>If the person in question feels that there is additional information which has not been submitted with his initial application and which would add further weight to his initial request for an extension, it is open to that person to contact General Immigration Division requesting that his case be considered in light of this additional information.</P><Col N="899"/>

	<P>For 2011, the Government has provided an overall allocation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) of &euro;669 million.  Of this total, &euro;534 million will be administered by the Department of Foreign <Col N="900"/>Affairs and a further estimated &euro;135 million will come from other Government Departments, including Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  </P>
        <P>The 2011 allocation ensures our ODA effort is stabilised at approximately 0.52% of GNP which remains ahead of the EU average.  In the context of our very difficult economic circumstances, I believe this is a significant achievement, and clear evidence of our commitment to the fight against global poverty and hunger. As I have stated many times the stabilisation of our public finances and the return of economic growth are the best foundations for restoring growth to the development aid programme.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme is the Irish people&rsquo;s aid programme.  We are proud of its strong international reputation for quality and effectiveness and in particular for its sharp focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.  I am determined to maintain the high quality of our aid programme and ensure that we continue to deliver a programme that has maximum impact and is rigorously focused on achieving clear results for the lives of the poor, the marginalised and the hungry.</P>

	<P>The administration of the Civil Registration Service is statutorily a matter for the Registrar General. I have made enquiries with the Registrar General and he has informed me that the general review of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 is expected to be completed by the middle of this year.  The review will include the provisions relating to the registration of deaths.</P>
        <P>The provisions and procedures governing the registration of deaths in Ireland are contained in Part 5 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004.</P>
        <P>Where the death of an Irish citizen domiciled in the State occurs abroad, the death may be registered here if there was not at the time of the death a system of registration of deaths in the place where the death occurred, or it is not possible to obtain copies of or extracts from civil records of the death.</P>
        <P>Where an Irish citizen dies abroad and the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, a certified copy of the death registration, translated, if necessary, is sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and there is no necessity for the event to be entered in the register of deaths in the State. However, it is appreciated that registration here of the deaths abroad of Irish citizens would be  significant to the relatives of the deceased and it is in this context that a commitment has been made to review the existing provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, in relation to this issue.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the average waiting for an appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision is 27.4 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing is 45.6 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and <Col N="902"/>include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been taken in recent years to deal with backlogs in the Social Welfare Appeals process which have occurred as a result of the increases in numbers of cases received in that Office.  The annual intake of appeals has increased from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 in 2010, an increase of 18,362 (130.5%).</P>
        <P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010 facilitated the use of experienced retired former Appeals Officers, on a strictly temporary basis to assist in reducing the backlog of Social Welfare Appeals cases.</P>
        <P>In conjunction with the provision of extra staff, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.  As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 59% in 2009 to 31.5% in 2010.</P>
        <P>A project to improve the business processes in the office was also undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

        <P>For example, if you do not have enough contributions paid or credited to qualify for an Irish pension, based on your Irish record alone, then periods of social insurance and/or residence in Canada may be counted to help you qualify for an Irish pension.</P>

	<P>Self-employed people, including taxi drivers, can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  If a taxi driver has ceased operating in the taxi business completely, the Department requires a letter from the Taxi Regulator confirming that the customer has surrendered his or her PSV licence.  This is required, along with other evidence, so that the Department is satisfied that the customer is no longer receiving an income from self-employment in the taxi business.</P>
        <P>If a self-employed customer is still trading as a taxi driver he or she does not have to surrender the  PSV licence in order to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Means from self-employment will be assessed to determine the level of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance paid to the person.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.</P>
        <P>If a self-employed person&rsquo;s situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the person can apply to have his or her means reviewed in the light of these changed circumstances.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was received in that office on 21 December 2010.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Social Welfare Services on the grounds of appeal be sought. When received, the appeal in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer for consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The average waiting time in carer's allowance cases decided by way of a summary decision is 26.9 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing in carer's allowance cases is 47.3 weeks. These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical  Assessors that is deemed necessary. A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission.  The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirmed this commitment and identifies a range of responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An independent Electoral Commission will require new legislation for purposes of its establishment and to transfer to it a range of roles and responsibilities including those assigned to the Standards in Public Office Commission in electoral law, the roles and responsibilities of the Constituency Commission and roles and responsibilities currently assigned to me as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will involve changes to over 20 primary acts and to the associated regulations. Towards implementing the Programme for Government commitments, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, my predecessor as Minister commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.  The report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, was published for consultation in February 2009. The UCD study recommends that an Electoral Commission should be established through the enactment of an Electoral Commission Act. This Act would amend and consolidate the law in this area, bringing together in one Act the law relating to referendums and elections to local authorities, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, the European Parliament, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the office of President of Ireland.  This would be a major task.</P>
        <P>Many of the electoral reform issues that will come within the remit of an Electoral Commission were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which published its report on the electoral system in July 2010.  This report states that the Committee strongly supports the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission.  The report represents a valuable input and is being taken into account in progressing work in this area.</P>
        <P>A good deal of groundwork has been done to date in considering and identifying the approaches that may be taken and this should act as an important foundation in progressing the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply by Minister of State John Moloney, T.D., in response to a Seanad Adjournment Motion on 12 January 2011 which sets out comprehensively the actions already in place and currently being undertaken in order to address the threat of carbon monoxide poisoning.</P>
        <P>As indicated in that response, the Department is committed to a review of Part J of the Building Regulations, which deals with Heat Producing Appliances, later this year.  As an integral part of the review, consideration will be given to whether, and in what circumstances, mandatory provision for carbon monoxide alarms might appropriately be included in the Building Regulations.  The review of Part J will be the subject of a full public consultation process, as well as a Regulatory Impact Assessment, before any final decisions in the matter are made.</P>
        <P>A research paper published in the Irish Medical Journal (volume 96, March 2003) found that 40 deaths per year in Ireland were attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning.  The research was based on statistical sources relevant to the years 1992 to 1997.  The deaths occurred as a con<Col N="908"/>sequence of carbon monoxide poisoning from a range of sources including house fires, the incomplete combustion of fuels from heating systems and vehicle exhausts.</P>
        <P>The paper advocated a multi-dimensional approach to the prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning which would include the promotion of the use of CO detectors in a domestic setting, the proper installation and maintenance of combustion appliances and flues/chimneys in buildings, and education of the public and health professionals of the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning.  All of these measures have been addressed as set out in the above mentioned reply to the adjournment.</P>
        <P>The Department will continue to work closely with all other relevant Departments and agencies with a view to taking whatever further action is necessary and appropriate.</P>

	<P>The Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  Record Exchequer allocations totalling almost &euro;80m were notified to local authorities under the schemes on 5 March 2010, giving a combined allocation of almost &euro;100m.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes.</P>
        <P>Details of the Exchequer allocations and recoupments to Galway County Council and Galway City Council for 2010 are set out in the following table:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 121 together. </P>
        <P>Following the Government decision not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland, an Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by the Department, was established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.  While proposals have not at this stage been invited in respect of the equipment, some expressions of interest have been received. In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  One-off costs associated with the movement of these machines were &euro;328,363.21.<b>  </b>  There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  Costs of &euro;552.83 were incurred in 2009 in respect of equipment to monitor the environmental storage conditions at the Gormanston premises.    A further 14 machines are held in the Custom House.</P><Col N="910"/>
        <P>The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose.  It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.</P>
        <P>The table, which is based on information received in the Department from Returning Officers, provides details of the annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment for 2009, and the lease arrangements for each property.  Details of the number of electronic voting machines stored at each location are also included.</P>
        <P>Figures for costs incurred by Returning Officers for the local storage of the electronic voting equipment in 2010 are currently being gathered and are therefore not yet available.  Apart from these costs incurred by Returning Officers, a further &euro;5,566 was expended in 2010 in relation to work undertaken on behalf of the Department by DTZ Sherry Fitzgerald in respect of the negotiation of local lease arrangements.</P>

	<P>In the case of standard accommodation provided under the CLSS, tenants are drawn from the local authority housing waiting list and rents are largely based on the local authority Differential Rents Schemes. Under the CLSS, the application of the rent formula as set out in the scheme may be modified, at the discretion of the approved housing body, in particular respects where they consider this appropriate. Rent payable under the scheme to an approved housing body, by a tenant, is based on household income in the previous tax year. Where this would result in hardship arising from a fall in income due to loss of employment, disability etc, the rent may be adjusted accordingly.</P>
        <P>In the case of accommodation provided under the CAS, rents are charged at a reasonable rate having regard to tenants&rsquo; income. In a case where the approved housing body contributes a minimum of 5% of the capital cost of a CAS funded project, the approved body may retain nomination rights for up to 25% of the units. In these circumstances, the normal landlord/tenant arrangements, including in relation to rent, apply.</P>
        <P>The local authority has an overall responsibility to ensure that approved housing bodies comply with the requirements in relation to letting policy, as set out under the funding schemes, including the requirement for prior consultation and agreement on letting policies for each new project.</P>

The primary objective of this latest review is to enable a quick identification of lessons which should be learned &mdash; what worked successfully and what needs improvement, so that organizations/ agencies are facilitated to consolidate and further enhance preparedness and the response process. This latest report is intended to build on, and incorporate issues from, reviews of previous severe weather emergencies, including the flooding of November 2009 and severe cold weather of January 2010. Many learning points and changes were implemented from those earlier experiences, and were used to good effect in the latest severe weather response. Among the areas I refer to are the enhanced integration of public transport with the response effort, new salt supply/ management arrangements operated by the NRA and local authorities, more developed arrangements for community involvement in the response and an enhanced approach to the provision of public information.</P>
        <P>The two-stage review of the latest severe weather response takes account of the lessons learned and changes implemented from the November 2009 and January 2010 experience. Headline conclusions will be available for consideration by the relevant agencies involved in the response effort before the end of January 2011, while a more detailed review report will be completed by mid-March 2011.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
        <P>The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive. This Directive was transposed into Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999. Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />carbon monoxide and benzene (2002);</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ozone (2004); and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of Irish air quality. The EPA continually monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of air quality monitoring stations located around the country.</P>
        <P>The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants on its website at: <i>http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/</i>. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.</P>
        <P>The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being Air Quality in Ireland 2009 &mdash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality   (November 2010). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2009 based on data from 28 monitoring stations. Of these, 25 were fixed continuous-monitoring stations with a further 3 sites being visited by mobile monitoring units. Newbridge, Co Kildare, was among the locations visited by the mobile monitoring units and no exceedance of statutory limit values was recorded for any pollutant.  In addition to the monitoring stations above, there were a further 15 monitoring stations operated by local authorities measuring black smoke. The report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The report found that levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM10  ) remain a concern in larger cities owing to traffic levels. Elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide were recorded at the monitoring station at Winetavern Street in Dublin City Centre in April 2009. The EPA has advised that this was most likely due to meteorological factors rather than any significant increase in emissions. The Department has met with the EPA, Dublin City Council and the Health Service Executive to discuss this issue, and the four Dublin local authorities are now preparing an Air Quality Management Plan under Section 16 of the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 to address this. This plan is expected to be completed by December 2011. Provisional data indicate that levels of nitrogen dioxide in Dublin measured during the first 9 months of 2010 are below the statutory limit value.</P><Col N="914"/>
        <P>In addition to these structured arrangements for air monitoring, the EPA may also from time to time engage in additional air quality monitoring in specific locations where this is considered necessary.  In the context of its role as the licensing authority for the landfill facility at Kerdiffstown, Naas, the Agency has installed a continuous monitoring station at Kerdiffstown House providing hourly feeds of data. I understand that the results to date from such sampling, which are also shared with the Health Service Executive, are within the relevant thresholds.</P>

	<P>It is the role of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Government collectively to set the national waste management policy framework.  This process is informed by domestic policy goals, EU and wider international policy and practice, and EU legislation and commitments, particularly the revised Waste Framework Directive and the associated waste hierarchy set out in Article 4 of the Directive.</P>
        <P>Building on engagement with key stakeholders, the goal is to ensure that waste management policy represents a balanced approach to the delivery of optimum environmental and economic performance, and protects health and minimises the risk of environmental pollution.  In that context, the Government is determined to pursue a sustainable, resource-based approach to waste management.  This involves a shift in focus from traditional residual waste management options, such as landfill, to technologies which can maximise the energy or material value to be extracted from what should be viewed as a resource rather than as a waste.  This is the direction outlined in the draft statement of waste policy published for consultation in July 2010 and in respect of which submissions received are currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is responsible for issuing oyster fishing licences, in accordance with the Section 278 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, as amended.</P>
        <P>By way of background, I am advised that Lough Swilly is a Natura 2000 site. It also contains a wild oyster fishery. The assessment of the fishery and its compliance with the Habitats Directive as transposed by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997) is, I understand, to be undertaken this year by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Therefore as of now, no appropriate assessment of the potential impact of the oyster fishery on the protected habitat has taken place.</P>
        <P>Licences are issued annually upon receipt of applications.  There is no question, therefore, of withdrawing licences.  Pending the outcome of the assessment and in view of the need to ensure than no intensification of the wild oyster fishery takes place in the meantime in Lough Swilly, the number of licences that will be issued by Inland Fisheries Ireland for the first part of 2011 will be limited to no more than the average number of licences issued for the past five years.</P>
        <P>Penalties for non-compliance with the conservation measures of the Fisheries Act are set out in Section 277 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959 as amended in this regard.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  Service providers&rsquo; decisions to provide broadband services in areas are taken on the basis of commercial viability.  Such decisions are matters for the service providers concerned.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.</P>
        <P>EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>The mapping exercise undertaken by my Department at the time of designing the NBS found that a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the areas referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question and consequently the localities were excluded from the scheme.  In order to <Col N="917"/>comply with EU Commission State Aid rules, any market interventions by Government must be technology neutral and cannot specify a particular form of technology.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend, subject to Government approval, to formally announce the launch of a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of the year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>

	<P>An application under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on the 17 May 2010. This application was selected for and was the subject of a Ground Eligibility and Animal Identification inspection.    </P>
        <P>The inspection process is complete and the application has now been fully processed. Advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme issued on 18 October 2010 and balancing payment issued on 1 December 2010</P>
        <P>In relation to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Terms and Conditions governing the Scheme require, inter alia, that applicants maintain a minimum stocking density on their holding of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare declared, for at least three consecutive months, during the calendar year of application.  However, where the holding of an applicant is iden<Col N="921"/>tified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level.  My Department records currently do not show the person named as having yet achieved the minimum stocking density.  On satisfaction of this requirement, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.</P>

	<P>The person named has thirteen suckler cows for the 2008 Suckler Welfare Scheme. To date, payment has issued in respect of five of these animals. However, during the validation process, errors were identified in case of the remaining animals i.e. seven calves were not meal-fed for the minimum requirement of four weeks prior to the weaning date, while no weaning data has been provided in respect of the eight calf. While the person named has responded to my Department&rsquo;s correspondence regarding this matter, as the specific issues i.e. meal feeding and weaning, have not been addressed, further payments cannot issue. However, the remaining eight animals may be reconsidered for payment if the person named satisfactorily addresses the outstanding issues.</P>

One of the eligibility conditions for the AEOS is that applicants who have land designated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service as a Special Protection Area or a Special Area of Conservation must submit a sustainable management plan prepared by a planner with their application. As the person named has designated land on his holding but did not submit the required sustainable management plan he is ineligible for the scheme.

	<P>I can confirm to the Deputy that Ireland has a reciprocal arrangement in place with Canada under the Working Holiday Programme.  The Working Holiday Programme provides young people with a once off opportunity to holiday for an extended period, not exceeding one year, and to engage in employment as an incidental aspect of their holiday in order to supplement their income while travelling.  Participants under the Programme are not allowed to extend their stay for longer than 12 months and may not avail of a working holiday a second time.</P>
        <P>Working Holiday Programmes are administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs so that applicants in Canada wishing to apply under the Working Holiday Programme should <Col N="923"/>apply through their local Embassy or Consulate.  Irish-based applicants should apply to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
        <P>Outside of this arrangement, the normal employment permit requirements currently applicable to non-EEA nationals wishing to work in Ireland apply.

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />highly skilled, highly paid positions or;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;</P>

	<P>My Department does not provide direct funding or grants to businesses but provides funding to a number of State Agencies, including the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) and Enterprise Ireland, through whom assistance is delivered directly to businesses. The CEB&rsquo;s unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. The promoter should in the first instance contact their relevant local CEB to discuss what options may be available <Col N="924"/>to them and their proposed business venture. Contact details for each individual Board can be obtained through the CEBs&rsquo; national website address at <i>www.enterpriseboards.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>To be eligible for CEB grant support an enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance, which are available, subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</P>
