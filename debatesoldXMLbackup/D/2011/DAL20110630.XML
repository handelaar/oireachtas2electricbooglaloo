      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with two notices under Standing Order 32.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom an D&aacute;il a chur ar athl&oacute; faoi Bhun Ord&uacute; 32 chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le gn&eacute; r&iacute;-th&aacute;bhachtach, namely, the failure of the Government to consider amending the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 to give recognition to the children who suffered from unnecessary illness, neglect and death due to indifference, incompetence, sectarianism and complicity of the State; and the need to investigate the fact that at least 219 children died between 1922 and 1949 in Bethany Home, Dublin, and to further acknowledge the State&rsquo;s failure to save the children, especially the remaining survivors, from the cruelty perpetrated against them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of major public importance, namely, the imminent threat of compulsory statutory redundancies among a significant number of workers at Cavtat Taverns Limited, which runs Signature Bars at Dublin Airport and which is owned by Mr. Donie Cassidy Jr., and the threatened imposition of pay cuts of up to 40% for those workers remaining, many of whom have served for decades in the bars at the airport, and the devastating consequences for their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 32.</P>

	<P>It is proposed to take No. 12, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2010, back from committee; No. 12<i>a</i>, motion re appointment of ordinary Members to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission; No. <i>a</i>2, Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011, amendments from the Seanad; No. 2, Biological Weapons Bill 2010, amendments from the Seanad; and No. 6, Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 12 and 12<i>a</i> be decided without debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12 and 12<i>a</i> agreed to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the proposal concern the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2011?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It concerns the motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2010 and the motion re appointment of ordinary Members to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with No. 12, which concerns the approval of the report, but I would prefer if it were dealt with in the House as a whole.  It was dealt with by a committee.</P>
        <P>With regard to No. 12<i>a</i>, the motion re appointment of ordinary Members to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, it is proposed to nominate four Members of the D&aacute;il, including three Fine Gael Members and one Fianna F&aacute;il Member.  A similar motion in the Seanad, if accepted, would result in the nomination of two Fine Gael Members and one Fianna F&aacute;il Member.  The sole Labour Party Member will be the Minister&rsquo;s nominee.  This is totally against the spirit of the Houses of the Oireachtas and contrary to precedent based on proportional representation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised this with the Whip over a month ago and put forward a proposal, which was endorsed in a report by the committee secretariat.  The proposal, based on proportional representation, is that all parties be represented on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  This would still allow a Government majority, a substantial one.  The commission deals with the funding and running of this House.  Every party has its own view and should have its own input into the running of the Houses and into how to save money, particularly in this era.  The standards, practices and working conditions of the substantial number of staff in the Houses should also be reflected.  If the voices of parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in and all the Independents, not just those in the Technical Group, are not represented on the commission, it will be difficult to ensure their points of views are represented.  The positive role we can play should be borne in mind.</P>
        <P>In the previous D&aacute;il we were excluded and did not receive a report from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which meant a substantial number of Members were in the dark regarding its decisions and the subjects it discussed.  We believe that in this era of openness, this should not occur in the current D&aacute;il, especially given the increased size of my party and the increased number of Independents.  The practice of proportional representation should have been reflected in the motion and we oppose it because it is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Murphy, I have a difficulty in that, in accordance with Standing Orders on this issue &mdash; not this issue in particular but where there is a disagreement &mdash; only a representative of the parties in the House may speak.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="251"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To be helpful to both the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy<Insert> Catherine</Insert> Murphy, during my first five years as a Member I had occasion to study thoroughly the relevant chapter of Standing Orders.  I noted the Ceann Comhairle is not precluded from calling other Members, although preference is given to parties.  It is at the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s discretion, which he may exercise occasionally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The practice is that one representative from each party is called.  I have a difficulty, therefore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle can make an exception.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can understand why Deputy Catherine Murphy wishes to contribute.  If any member of a party wishes to raise an objection, he or she may do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I regret that because Deputy Catherine Murphy could have been allowed to contribute by the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy not to question.  I am not trying to preclude anybody.  I am just pointing out what is the position.  If Deputy Higgins wishes to make a point on behalf of the Socialist Party he may do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I do wish to make a point in support, which is essentially the same point made by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, that it is incredible the Government which came in promising all kinds of D&aacute;il reform and new ways of doing business is now trying to ram through the management structures of the Houses of the Oireachtas and exclude 57% of the Opposition.  It is wrong and disproportionate and it does not recognise the changed composition of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who is taking the Order of Business in place of the Taoiseach not to press this issue but to engage in further discussion.</P>
        <P>Opposition Deputies, apart from those in Fianna F&aacute;il, who have been in discussions on this matter with the Government Whip have made it clear it is a question of fair representation and that there is no question of finance involved.  There may be an allowance for participation in this but they have no interest whatsoever in it.  With regard to basic fairness, all we are asking is that this is not pressed today and the Government engages in further discussions and returns with a new proposal.</P>
        <P>In view of controversies in recent days, the commission should be extended to include a genuine representative of the taxpayers of the country who would have, I suggest, good advice for Members of the Oireachtas considering the way in which funds have been frittered away in recent times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this matter has been discussed at length at Whips&rsquo; meetings and that the proposal is in accord with the guidelines of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The proposal stands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I beg the indulgence of the Ceann Comhairle to raise a matter affecting citizens up and down the country, namely, the rapid deterioration in the service provided by the Passport Office in the past two months and the difficulties citizens are experiencing in exercising their constitutional right to travel as a result of delays in the office.  I hear stories of passports which are ready for dispatch being left for days on end.  Will the Minister make a statement outlining what immediate steps he will take to ensure people who need passports obtain them without delay?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation proposed in this area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  If, however, the matter were raised at the Whips&rsquo; meeting, the Whips would try to accommodate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will arrange for the matter to be raised through the Whips.</P>

<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; programme last night, will he confirm that the legislation to undermine the joint labour committees will end Sunday premiums and, in his own words, significantly reduce the take home pay of new entrants in the relevant sectors?  Will he indicate what legislation is promised to protect existing workers from being fired and rehired under the new, lower Sunday premium rates?  Will he indicate when the relevant legislation will be published given the recent arguments he has had with the Labour Parliamentary Party?  Is he in a position to state whether the legislation will reflect Burton&rsquo;s way or Bruton&rsquo;s way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to reply to the questions which are in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation is promised in this area and will be introduced as soon as possible.  Given the D&aacute;il schedule, it is likely to be after the summer recess.  Government policy is to retain the joint labour committee, JLC, system while reforming it as has been recommended.  The enforcement of the JLCs, which protect vulnerable workers, will continue.</P>
      
        <P>It is also important to point out many of the misunderstandings about this.  In the case of proposals relating to Sunday working, for example, people are already protected and Sunday working is recognised for all workers.  Any change will continue that.  That is the current position.</P>
        <P>It is important to point out that where reforms such as this have been undertaken elsewhere there has been a significant employment bonus.  That happened in the UK.  Existing workers are protected by their existing contracts.  This legislation was flagged in the programme for Government.  It is part of a suite of measures that restores the minimum wage and reforms but retains the JLC system.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to achieve a balanced solution to this problem that will promote employment for many thousands of young and lower skilled people who, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, are locked out of the jobs market.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should not mislead the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>This morning the Government published the Electoral (Amendment) Bill which contains a provision that allows the total number of Members of the D&aacute;il to be reduced to 152.

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the legislation now be withdrawn in light of the preliminary census results, which might mean that the Bill will become unconstitutional?  It comes very close to the maximum ratio of people to Deputies that is provided for in the Constitution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill has been published today and will be debated next week, when such issues can be raised.  The Bill provides for a range, not a specific proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>In light of the disclosure of salary and bonus arrangements at the NTMA and the Minister, Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s comments last week about the element of secrecy in that area, does the Government have plans to bring forward proposals to ensure greater transparency and accountability with regard to paying bonuses at the agency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not intended to deal with this matter by legislation.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister for public expenditure and reform has been pressing for transparency and to reform a system the Government inherited, where bonuses paid were not related to genuine performance.  There is now greater transparency.  For the first time, details have been published of earnings in the NTMA and NAMA.  That is a significant step forward.  The Government is keen to curb bonuses and to introduce a scheme where bonuses would only be paid for genuine performance.</P>

	<P>I ask for your assistance, a Cheann Comhairle, with regard to Standing Orders.  Last week on the Order of Business, you ruled me out of order when I raised a matter.  I pointed out that legislation promised outside the House was within Standing Orders, specifically Standing Order 26(3).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>To what legislation do you refer, Deputy?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="259"/>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking about any legislation promised outside the House.  You said legislation could be raised on the Order of Business only if it had been promised within the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>You did.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation may be promised in or outside the House.  Last week, I said matters contained in the programme for Government may not be raised on the Order of Business.  If legislation is required&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the programme for Government is promised outside the House.  Any issue in the programme for Government is promised legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If something is in the programme for Government, it does not necessarily mean legislation is required.  With regard to matters in the programme for Government, Deputies should submit a parliamentary question.  If he or she is told legislation is required, the matter can be pursued on the Order of Business.</P>

	<P>In that case, the legislation may be raised on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not promised legislation but the Minister for public expenditure and reform has already taken steps to reduce salaries.  Within the public service that has been done on a voluntary basis for all senior appointments.  That is part of the Government&rsquo;s programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to raise two items of promised legislation and one in respect of which you might be able to offer assistance.  The first is the criminal law (sexual offences) Bill.  What steps have been taken to bring it before the House?  Have the heads of the Bill been discussed or is it prepared and ready for publication?  Second, the legal services Bill is to provide for the regulation of the legal professions and give effect to the reports of the Competition Authority and the legal costs working group.  This is an issue that affects the entire economy.  To what extent has the preparation of this Bill been pro<Col N="260"/>gressed?  Can the Minister give the House some indication of its progress and the date of its introduction in the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of the first Bill, the heads have not yet come to Government.  The second matter is a priority of Government and there is a commitment in the memorandum of understanding to publish that legislation at an early date.  Intense work is ongoing on it.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important issue that is fundamental to the way we do business in the House.  If you let me finish, I will sit down.</P>
        <P>The Data Protection Act is now preventing access to information to which Members of the House have an entitlement.  Will we repeal, review or amend the Data Protection Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no promised legislation on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy Durkan, I suggest you put down a parliamentary question.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>We had an interesting exchange this morning on the payment of party leaders&rsquo; allowances.  Is there promised legislation to require Independent Members to account for their party leaders&rsquo; allowances?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no promised legislation on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EricJByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Eric Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the serious financial implication for various local authorities, can the Minister tell us the stage of planned legislation to reform local government and appoint, by plebiscite or referendum, directly elected mayors for certain cities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is work in the office of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on this issue but it has not yet come to Government.  As there are no heads of Bills, I cannot give the Deputy an accurate date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised to support the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a commission on taxation and welfare to adjudicate on the issue of welfare rates?  If so, how does that sit with the Taoiseach saying outside the House that there would be no increase or decrease in rates?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is legislation promised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a commission and it does not require legislation.  That commission is working.</P>

	<P>I have asked a few times about promised legislation on the strategic investment bank but I am finding it hard to get a clear answer.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="262"/>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to introduce this?  The main banks are unlikely to lend to business this year and the strategic investment bank has been promised.  When will the legislation be introduced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Legislation will be needed and the Minister for Finance is working on this issue.  The priority was the restructuring of the existing banks and the creation of two pillar banks.  There is a greatly strengthened unit within the Department of Finance which is riding shotgun on those pillar banks to see that they meet the criteria set.  Work is ongoing on the strategic investment bank in the Minister&rsquo;s Department but I cannot at this stage give a  precise date for the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DessieEllis"><NameTxt>Deputy Dessie Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the promised legislation on noise pollution be published?  Will it cover issues such as dogs barking and noisy neighbours?  Nothing is in place to address these issues, which are becoming a major problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I cannot shed light on the content of the legislation but no date has been set for its publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My question relates to the sittings of the House, not promised legislation.  The ministerial rota has been circulated and it is clear that the Minister for public expenditure and reform will not be accountable to Members until at least September.  With regard to the sittings of the House, when is it intended that the House will rise for the summer recess?  When is it intended that Deputies will be back in the Chamber doing their business following the recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will rise on 21 July and it will return on 14 September.  The rota for parliamentary questions will be amended as soon as the House approves the legislation currently before it.  There will be an opportunity for parliamentary questions to the Minister for public expenditure and reform.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Deputy Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>What about oral questions?</P>

	<P Just="Left">As we are discussing amendment No. 11 as part of the grouping schedule, will the Minister flesh it out a little more?  Is he essentially substituting the new ministerial title and the name of the Minister in place of the Minister for Finance in legal action pending prior to this legislation?  Will he provide more detail on this?  Is this the normal legal practice to be able to change the Minister&rsquo;s name?  Is it possible that it may be a requirement to name both the Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in legal proceedings rather than a direct substitution of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Fleming wishes me to comment on amendment No. 7.  This is a technical amendment that allows for the substitution of &ldquo;have such reference&rdquo; for &ldquo;so relate&rdquo; in relation to the name of the Minister in any legal proceeding.  I understand the Deputy is discussing the substance of the section as opposed to the Seanad amendment which is the technical matter to be discussed.</P>
        <P>The amended section states:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;11.&mdash;Where, immediately before the appointed day, any legal proceedings are pending to which the Minister for Finance is a party and the proceedings have reference to functions transferred by this Act, the name of the Minister shall, to the extent that they have such reference, be substituted for the Minister for Finance in those proceedings and the proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In essence it is simply that where legal proceedings are under way, the legal documents are amended to refer to this Minister, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as opposed to the Minister for Finance, where appropriate where those functions are now being taken over by my Department.</P>

	<P>My specific question is whether it might be a requirement to have more than one Minister&rsquo;s name to be part of legal proceedings.  People can regularly sue the Attorney General and various Ministers.  Could there be a case where both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would be required?  The Minister has allowed for a straight substitution of one for the other.  Will this also allow both Ministers to be named?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I understand the point now.  This section simply deals with proceedings which are currently under way.  Where the proceedings relate up to now to the Minister for Finance, the name "Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform" will be substituted where that is clear.  If there are proceedings, now or in the future, that relate to the functions of both Ministers, of course, it is perfectly in order for both Ministers to be recited.</P>

        <P>I am pleased to bring the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2010 before the D&aacute;il and look forward to an informed and constructive debate during the passage of the Bill through this House.  The greyhound racing industry is a very important industry in this country responsible for sustaining 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, mainly in rural communities.  It provides an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies around the tracks which are spread throughout the country.  The greyhound breeding industry is also successful, with many greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.  Greyhound racing attracts a significant number of continental European visitors to Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Members are aware, the Bill arises from the debates last year concerning the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 which sought to ensure proper standards of animal welfare in dog breeding establishments.  During those debates the point was made that it was more appropriate to introduce separate legislation to regulate welfare in the greyhound industry.  It was acknowledged that the greyhound industry already had a system of self-regulation in place which included certain provisions on welfare.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 it was agreed to introduce separate legislation to regulate the greyhound industry in order to provide a regime for greyhound welfare.  The policy objective is to optimise the level of animal welfare in the greyhound industry.  While the objective is similar to that of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, the approach taken differs due to the distinct nature of, and controls applying to, the keeping of greyhounds.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club agreed with the need for legalisation to regulate all aspects of welfare throughout the greyhound industry and thus protect this country&rsquo;s reputation in respect of care of greyhounds.  Preparation of the Bill has involved wide-ranging consultation with a variety of interested parties, including Departments, Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, voluntary bodies and animal welfare groups, especially those concerned with dogs.  I thank all of those who participated in the consultation process and for their constructive input.  I am confident that we have struck an adequate balance accommodating various points of view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Coursing Club identifies and registers greyhounds individually in the stud book so as to ensure the integrity of the racing system.  Furthermore, the industry already has a system of self-regulation in place which can be readily adapted for welfare purposes, which the Bill uses as a starting point.  For the purposes of the Bill, greyhounds are defined as all greyhounds entered in the Irish greyhound stud book and they will be covered by the welfare provisions of this Bill.  The welfare requirements specified in the Bill on animal keepers to safeguard animals in their care are in addition to the general provisions relating to cruelty in the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.  Greyhounds that are not registered in the stud book <Col N="273"/>cannot be covered by the scope of the Bill but will continue to be covered by general animal welfare legislation as well as the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 where relevant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the provisions in the Bill apply to all greyhounds in the stud book I nevertheless see merit in establishing a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  Those are premises at which not less than four greyhound bitches are kept, each of which is more than 15 months old and has been or is being used for breeding.  I should make clear however that the scope of the Bill extends to all greyhounds in the racing and coursing industry and not only those found on a premises that is registered as a greyhound breeding establishment under the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 on the other hand provides for a hitherto unregulated industry &mdash; for puppy farming &mdash; with no existing system either for the registration of individual dogs for stud book purposes or the registration of premises on which they are kept.  The welfare provisions of the Act apply to dogs on premises registered under the Act.</P>
        <P>Deputies will be aware that there is a variety of opinion on any issue involving animal welfare and, in particular, on the welfare of dogs.  However in the case of greyhounds there are fewer problems involved than in the business known as puppy farming.  While puppy farmers and greyhound breeders are both engaged in breeding activity as a commercial activity, greyhound breeders strive to breed high quality greyhounds to win races and therefore in greyhound breeding, quality is of paramount importance rather than quantity.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In today&rsquo;s debate, I intend to summarise the provisions of the Bill, my overall approach and the details of how the system will work.  I will also outline the points of both similarity and difference with the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  While my Department has responsibility for animal welfare, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is responsible for dog control and the dog control service is operated through the local authorities.  I am confident that the provisions for the welfare of greyhounds in the Bill and the extensive powers given to welfare officers will result in a very high standard of welfare for greyhounds.  Stewards of the Irish Coursing Club already visit all greyhound breeding premises to register and identify all new litters to ensure the integrity of racing.  This Bill provides a legislative basis whereby they can become authorised as welfare officers within the terms of the Bill which will give them powers to inspect all aspects of welfare on such visits and to issue welfare notices where improvements are required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Local authorities may appoint welfare officers.  Therefore I envisage close liaison between personnel from the Irish Coursing Club and local authorities.  The Bill will form the basis of a co-operative relationship between local authorities, Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.  The legislation requires that reports of inspections or details of welfare notices be notified to the Irish Coursing Club, Bord na gCon and to the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill grants a wide range of powers to welfare officers and allows them to specify various items in welfare notices.  However the provisions will not present any difficulty to individuals who take due cognisance of welfare requirements and who have proper premises and operate their businesses in co-operation with their local veterinary practices.  A crucial aspect of this Bill is that a greyhound bitch will not be allowed to breed until she is 15 months of age, compared to a stipulation of six months in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, and also a limit will be placed on the number of litters that a bitch can produce.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that a period of up to three months will be provided from the commencement of the Act for greyhound breeding establishments to be registered.  It will be lawful for an existing dog breeding establishment to continue to operate for this period.  That will enable a smooth transition to full registration of greyhound breeding establishments.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>In line with best practice in any regulatory regime, there is an appropriate scale of regulatory actions which can be taken to ensure compliance.  I have provided for some offences for which fines and custodial sentences are possible upon summary conviction and other lesser offences, mainly concerning records or registration, for which only fines or, in some less important cases, fixed payment notices apply.</P>
       <P Just="Left">A provision is necessary to require owners of establishments to co-operate, within reason.  There is a general need for such a provision and it is particularly important in cases where an establishment operates from the private home of the owner.  The draft Bill makes provision, in circumstances where consent of the occupier to enter a dwelling is not forthcoming, for the authorised person to apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1, preliminary and general, sections 1 to 5, contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as the Short Title and commencement, definitions, service of notifications, notices and documents, expenses of the Minister and the making of regulations.  The key definition is that of a &ldquo;greyhound breeding establishment&rdquo; which means a premises used, in whole or in part, for breeding greyhounds at which not less than four greyhound bitches are kept, each of which in the first instance is more than 15 months old and, in the second instance, has been or is being used for breeding purposes, but does not include a premises at which no fewer than six bitches, other than greyhound bitches, each of which is more than six months old and is capable of being used for breeding purposes, are also kept.</P>
        <P>Under the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, a registered breeding establishment is defined as a premises with no fewer than six breeding females.  In the Bill however a lower number, four, is used.  As greyhounds are more specialist animals than dogs in general it was felt that a lower number of bitches was appropriate to require registration as a breeding establishment under the Bill.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the age limit of 15 months specified in this Bill for a greyhound bitch to be bred is much higher than the six months stipulated in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  That is dealt with later in the legislation.  The provisions have been the subject of intensive, constructive debate and have the support of the Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.</P>
        <P>Part 2, sections 6 to 10, deal with welfare generally.  Section 6 requires the publication of codes of practice for welfare with the consent of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I have also required that such codes be published in draft format on the Internet to allow for feedback prior to finalisation and publication on the Internet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 7 provides for the welfare standards of greyhounds in terms of accommodation, food and drink, exercise, health and safety.  It is important to note that this section applies to all greyhounds irrespective of whether they are on the premises of a registered breeding establishment.  This is an important difference between this Bill and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2010, which applies to dogs on registered premises only.  As I have mentioned previously, this Bill is building on an existing and effective regulatory system and will underpin the welfare of all registered greyhounds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 8 provides for regulations regarding welfare and related matters.  These build upon the general duty of care and codes of practice and will allow greater detail to be specified.  Section 9 provides for the identification of greyhounds.  I have allowed for both the traditional tattooing method and for microchipping.  Greyhounds are individually identified by tattooing for registration in the stud book maintained by the ICC, as this is vital for the integrity of the industry.  As tattooing has a long-standing tradition, it is not necessary to require breeders to change their methodology at this stage.  The important thing is that every greyhound pup is uniquely identified.  The method is of less importance.  In contrast, the Dog Breeding Establish<Col N="275"/>ments Bill 2010 deals with a sector in which individual pups in the dog breeding establishments concerned have hitherto not been required to be identified by any method.  In that situation, microchipping was considered an appropriate method of identification.</P>
         <P>Section 10 contains a requirement to notify the sale or transfer of greyhounds, which is important to allow for traceability and responsibility by owners.  Both the person selling the greyhound and the new owner are required to notify the ICC of the change of ownership.  The owner is also required to notify the ICC of the death of a greyhound.  The registered owner is at all times responsible for the greyhound&rsquo;s welfare.</P>
        <P>Section 11 prescribes that a greyhound bitch cannot be mated under 15 months of age.  This is considerably higher than the minimum breeding age of six months specified in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  This section also restricts the number of litters that a greyhound bitch can produce to six, as there are welfare concerns with greyhounds carrying excessive numbers of litters.  However, a further two litters may be permitted under veterinary certification.  The ICC will not be permitted to register litters born to greyhounds in contravention of these requirements and consequently such greyhounds will not be permitted to race or be used in coursing events.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  These are premises with four or more greyhound bitches over 15 months of age that have been or are being used for breeding.  This is lower than the number of breeding bitches specified in the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, which stipulates that premises with six or more breeding bitches must be registered.  The ICC may refuse to register a premises for a variety of reasons: if the application is not in order, the applicant is in breach of the Act or the club is of the opinion that the premises is not suitable for operation as a greyhound breeding establishment.  Each registered greyhound breeding establishment will receive a registration certificate which must be prominently displayed.  There will be a grace period of three months following commencement of the Bill to allow existing establishments to register.</P>
        <P>As I pointed out earlier, the existence of the ICC&rsquo;s stud book means that there is already a record of all greyhounds in the industry.  This legislation applies to all greyhounds registered in the studbook, irrespective of whether they are kept in registered greyhound breeding establishments.  The maintenance of a register of greyhound breeding establishments facilitates greater control and allows resources to be directed at larger premises or in a manner the enforcement authorities see as most appropriate.</P>
        <P>Section 13 states that if the ICC intends to refuse registration of a premises or make the registration subject to conditions, the applicant must be informed in writing by the ICC.  The applicant has 14 days to make representations to the ICC on the matter.  Section 14 further provides for procedures whereby a decision of the ICC to refuse registration of a breeding establishment or to attach special conditions to the registration of a breeding establishment may be appealed to the District Court.  The District Court can order that the establishment be registered, set conditions for registration or affirm the refusal.</P>
        <P>Section 15 provides for removal of greyhound breeding establishments from the register.  This can be done by applying for an order of the District Court.  The section sets out conditions which the District Court may impose.  Reasons for removing an establishment from the register include conviction of the operator of on offence involving cruelty to animals, or an offence under this Act, the Control of Dogs Act 1986 or the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965; or the breaching of a welfare notice.  A person who contravenes an order under this section shall be guilty of an offence.  Section 16 makes it an offence to operate an unregistered greyhound breeding establishment except during the lead-in period of three months or where an application for registration as a registered breeding establishment is being considered by the ICC.</P><Col N="276"/>
        <P>Section 17 provides for the appointment of welfare officers by local authorities, Bord na gCon and the ICC.  This section also provides for reappointment and termination of the appointment of such officers.  It also allows that, in certain instances, only some of the powers of the officer may be exercised.</P>
        <P>Section 18 sets out the functions of welfare officers, including the power at reasonable times to enter and inspect premises where the officer has reasonable grounds for believing that greyhounds are kept.  A welfare officer cannot enter a dwelling without the consent of the occupier or, failing consent, without a warrant issued by the District Court.  The welfare officer can inspect and take copies of records kept on the premises and can require the owner, operator or employees to answer relevant questions.  Owners must allow welfare officers to inspect greyhounds and provide information about the greyhounds&rsquo; identities.  The welfare officer can also take samples of feed or drink, search a vehicle or container and remove equipment or documents.  This section also provides that the welfare officer may be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Section 19 deals with the issuing of search warrants.  A welfare officer or member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for a warrant to carry out an inspection on a premises in which the welfare officer has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed under the Act or where entry has been refused.</P>
        <P>Section 20 deals with the issuing of welfare notices.  A welfare notice can be issued where a welfare officer is of the opinion that there is a contravention of the Act or where a premises or vehicle poses or is likely to pose a threat to a greyhound&rsquo;s health or welfare.  Welfare notices must state the grounds on which the officer forms the opinion.  The notice may be served on persons in charge of greyhounds themselves, persons in charge of establishments or premises where greyhounds are being traded, bred, trained raced or coursed, or persons in charge of vehicles transporting greyhounds.  Such notices may require a wide range of actions in the interests of the welfare of greyhounds.  Examples include requiring veterinary advice or treatment or the provision of food or drink of specified quantity and at specified intervals.  The notice can specify the numbers of greyhounds that may be kept in a particular accommodation.  It can also require, upon the advice of a veterinarian, the cessation of breeding or that a greyhound be disposed of or destroyed in a specified manner.  A person who does not comply within a reasonable time has committed an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 21 deals with appeals against welfare notices.  A person on whom a welfare notice has been served may appeal within seven days to the District Court.  The judge may affirm the notice, revoke the notice or revoke the notice and order the person concerned to comply with certain directions.  Section 22 provides that where a welfare officer has inspected a premises or served a welfare notice, he or she must within seven days send a report of the inspection or a copy of the welfare notice to Bord na gCon, the ICC and the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>Section 23 provides, following veterinary examination, for immediate veterinary treatment or humane destruction of a greyhound which is in pain, distress or an acute state of neglect.  Obviously it is regrettable but necessary to provide for this, but I hope it is a power that most welfare officers will never be called upon to implement.  The cost of doing so can be recovered from the owner of the greyhound as a simple contract debt in court.</P>
        <P>Section 24 makes it an offence to forge registration documentation or knowingly provide forged documentation or altered registration material with intent to defraud or deceive.  Section 25, which concerns obstruction, makes it an offence to obstruct a garda or welfare officer or fail or refuse to comply with a requirement under section 18, which deals with the functions of a welfare officer, or section 19, which refers to the issuing of a search warrant.</P><Col N="277"/>
        <P>Section 26 concerns penalties and proceedings.  Class A fines, currently defined as not exceeding &euro;5,000, can be applied on summary conviction for offences concerning notification of transfer of ownership under section 10(6), providing false or misleading information in an application for registration under section 12(17), failure to display registration under section 12(18) or failure to surrender a registration certificate when required to do so under section 15(7).  This section also provides for class A fines and up to six months&rsquo; imprisonment on summary conviction for more major offences, including offences relating to welfare, breaching restrictions on breeding, operating an unregistered premises, failure to comply with a welfare notice, forgery or obstruction of welfare officers.  Cases can be taken by Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the local authority or the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Fines shall be paid to the relevant body taking the case.</P>
        <P>I had representations from those involved in enforcement, some of whom felt that all fines should belong to their organisation even where the case was taken by another organisation.  However, I felt this was inappropriate.  This section, as drafted, will be the best way to ensure an active and robust approach to regulation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 27 provides that a fixed payment notice fine can be issued for between &euro;250 and &euro;1,000, which falls due within 28 days.  This can be issued where a welfare officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has reasonable grounds for believing there has been an offence concerning notification of transfer of ownership, provision of false or misleading information in an application for registration, a failure to display a registration certificate or failure to surrender a registration certificate where required to do so.  There will be no prosecution if payment is made within the 28 days.</P>
        <P>Section 28 states the functions of the Irish Coursing Club may be performed by the secretary of the club.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 29 states the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 does not apply to premises registered as a greyhound breeding establishment under this Act.</P>
        <P>I look forward to engaging on these provisions.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Barry Cowen.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this legislation and commend the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for his work in preparing it.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party also did much work on it with particular contributions from former Deputies John Cregan and Bobby Aylward.  Various meetings were held with the former environment Minister, John Gormley, who was spearheading legislation in this area of animal welfare.  To be honest, he neither had an interest in nor a clue of what was proposed.  The nonsense surrounding his legislation beggared belief.</P>
        <P>This legislation, however, has been drafted after consultations with all sectors involved in the greyhound industry.  The industry&rsquo;s importance cannot be overstated, as it is vital to the rural economy providing employment which certainly cannot be scoffed at these days.  Increasingly, policymakers in Ireland and in other jurisdictions scoff at rural-based industries as being somewhat backward.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is important to acknowledge the contribution these industries, particularly the greyhound industry, make to the rural economy.</P>
        <P>Everyone involved in the greyhound industry is good at maintaining high standards of animal welfare.  Generations of families involved in the industry would not have survived in it unless they had the best interests of the greyhound&rsquo;s welfare at heart.  The notion some of them do not needs to be rebutted at every opportunity.  Those involved in the industry and coursing <Col N="278"/>clubs are genuine, decent and honourable people, providing employment and entertainment and maintaining animal welfare standards second to none.  Those involved in greyhound breeding take pride in the animals&rsquo; rearing, training and racing.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry has provided much employment in rural areas.  The State has always acknowledged this and encouraged the industry.  In May, for example, there were discussions about the possibility of exporting greyhound racing to China.  Across the world, Ireland is seen as one of the great providers and having high animal welfare standards in its greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Sometimes this is not acknowledged at home, however.  Last year, there was a huge debate in rural areas concerning the introduction of puppy farming legislation.  The nonsense coming from certain quarters &mdash; what rural communities would call the Dublin 4 mindset &mdash; beggared belief.  I hope this does not happen with this legislation.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that each greyhound track provides up to &euro;500,000 to its local area each year, a huge amount of money for many small rural locations with tracks.  These tracks also provide entertainment in rural areas.  While attendance at the tracks has dropped a little because of the drop in disposable income, we must continue to encourage the industry.</P>
        <P>Under this legislation the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will take control of greyhound welfare.  The Minister of State outlined the powers conferred on animal welfare officers by the legislation but stated it was unlikely they would be used because of the high welfare standards already adhered to in the industry.  We must acknowledge the industry&rsquo;s great strengths in this regard which have been in place over generations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 is a follow-on to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  Prior to this, the industry was governed by the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  We must acknowledge the voluntary contributions people made in Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club.  Many of them have been attacked from certain quarters.  It is up to those who acknowledge these people&rsquo;s contribution to stand up for them and point out that their sports are completely legitimate.  For far too long certain negative sides of the industry have been highlighted in the media.  During the Celtic tiger era, the media scoffed at the traditional structures and systems in rural areas, seeing them more as backwoods.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, outlined the provisions in the Bill.  He also outlined the consultation that took place in order to ensure there was buy-in from all sectors in respect of the legislation.  As a result of this process, it has not merely been a case of the Department stipulating what should happen but rather those in the various sectors have been involved and had an input.  In the context of ensuring the Bill is passed by the House, we must consider the aspects of the industry which have proven to be of major benefit to rural communities.  The Minister of State has been to the fore in arguing against those who would have scoffed at this industry and also at certain of the sports which are pursued in rural communities.</P>
        <P>I had a discussion with a number of individuals last evening in respect of both the greyhound and tourism industries.  Rural communities, in particular, have issued brochures which highlight the attractions on offer in their localities for people coming here from abroad or for citizens of this country who wish &mdash; perhaps for the first time in a long period &mdash; to holiday at home.</P>
        <P>Some great benefit nights have been held around greyhound race meetings and huge amounts of money have been raised for voluntary and community organisations.  When people attend such events they acknowledge the charity or whatever they are supporting, in the first instance.  However, they also acknowledge that what is occurring is both a sport and a source of entertainment.  Those who are not so well informed tend to focus on the less than 1% of negative aspects relating to the industry and to the traditions that have been built around it.  We must ensure we at all times portray the 99.9% of positive aspects relating to the industry.  We should not <Col N="279"/>shrink from our responsibility in this regard.  People should not be afraid to proclaim that this is a wonderful industry in which some excellent individuals are involved.</P>
         <P>Generations of people have given their services to the greyhound industry.  There are those who will state that certain families have made money out of the industry.  I do not believe anyone has become a multimillionaire as a result of his or her involvement with it.  However, successive generations have given a commitment to the industry and certain individuals may have struck it lucky with one or two dogs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of tourism, we should be trying to sell not only this industry but also many of the other rural pursuits in which people engage.  Many of these pursuits have been neglected but they can give rise to huge added value for farms, etc.  Indeed, the greyhound industry has brought about massive added value for successive generations.  We must focus on the positive aspects relating to rural communities.  These aspects have been neglected as a result of the country enjoying too much prosperity.  We must return to fundamental principles and promote those traditional industries which have stood the test of time.  These industries do not relate to information technology, nor do they involve bringing in huge multinational companies, etc.  However, as the Minister of State indicated, they are responsible for sustaining 11,000 jobs.  That is something at which people should not scoff.</P>
        <P>Last year the House passed the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, which relates to puppy farming.  When we were in the process of debating that legislation, I visited the puppy farms in my locality and discovered that they are operating to the highest standards.  These facilities would not be able to survive if they did not operate in such a way, particularly as they export the animals they raise to the UK and elsewhere.  Those who run them are aware that animal welfare must be at the top of their list of priorities.  They would not be able to survive if the position were otherwise.  It is important that, in this debate and in the context of any public pronouncements which may be made, we acknowledge that the owners and operators of puppy farms are experts at what they do.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to refer to the aspect of this debate which relates to farmers being the custodians of the land, the environment, etc. and criticisms regarding practices that have been lost over time.  By and large, those in agriculture have acted as custodians and have passed on a great deal.  We must move away from the negative and acknowledge what has been achieved.  The coursing clubs, Bord na gCon and others have brought about massive developments in their industry since the first Act relating to it was introduced in the 1950s.</P>
        <P>Last year, people were concerned that the greyhound industry would be lumped in with dog breeding establishments and that aspersions would be cast upon it, and on the excellent work that has been done within it, as a result.  I am glad that, as a result of the great work done by various Members of the Houses, this legislation has been brought forward and that the greyhound industry is being dealt with on a separate basis.  It is extremely important to acknowledge the strengths of the industry.</P>
        <P>It is vital that we should reassess our values and reconsider the position with regard to many of the things that have been lost or neglected.  The industries to which I have been referring are indigenous and the jobs relating to them will not go elsewhere as a result of changes in corporation tax or whatever.  These industries are located in the heart of rural communities and they provide employment for families and a wide variety of other individuals.  It is important, therefore, that we should reassess and, indeed, champion them.  There are exciting possibilities for the greyhound industry, particularly, as I stated earlier, in the context of discussions regarding the exporting of animals to China and elsewhere.  We should research the possibilities that exist for this and other industries.</P><Col N="280"/>
        <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and the provisions it contains.  I commend the previous Minister and the current Minister of State on the work they have done.  I am delighted the legislation has come this far.  It is extremely important that every opportunity be taken to highlight both the strengths of the greyhound industry and the fact that almost everyone involved therein operates to the highest standards in respect of the welfare of animals.  We should not accept arguments to the effect that the latter is not the case.  People involved in the greyhound industry would not be able to continue to operate if the welfare of the animals they rear, train and race was not their first priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Deputy Moynihan, I welcome the Bill.  I pay tribute to and commend those in my party and others on the manner in which they sought to separate this Bill from the Dog Breeding Establishments Act sponsored by the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley.  As a result of their actions, the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the current Minister of State were able to draft and bring forward this Bill to regulate the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to cast aspersions on the Dog Breeding Establishments Act, the purpose of which is to regulate an industry that had come under much public scrutiny.  It is only right and proper that the necessary measures relating to animal welfare and other issues were given statutory effect in that Act.  Those who, in the context of the Act, portrayed themselves to be maintaining the right sort of standards have been proven to be correct.  This is despite the fact that everything has been delayed until the introduction of the Bill before the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill underpins the significant welfare programmes that exist within the industry and that are maintained by Bord na gCon &mdash; the Irish Greyhound Board &mdash; and the Irish Coursing Club.  Greyhound welfare is the business of everybody involved in the industry, whether it is the guy who rears a couple of pups or those who regulate or work in the industry.  If we do not have welfare at the heart of everything that is done in the industry, nobody will come to watch the racing and participate in the industry and no tourists will come to the venues.  This will have an impact on betting and a significant impact on the public purse as a result.  The new legal standards contained in the Bill will ensure that our leading role in this industry worldwide will be maintained and protected and that we have the legal structure in place to pursue those who do not adhere to the standards we aspire to maintain.  While there are few of these, it is necessary to have the legal standing in place to ensure those who do not maintain the required standards are weeded out and held to account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As mentioned by the Minister of State and by my colleague, the Government support of &euro;5.5 million and the bookmakers&rsquo; fund provide the funding and the basis from which the industry operates.  For this level of support, some 10,000 jobs are delivered, mainly in rural areas.  If these jobs are lost, they will be lost forever and those workers will never be able to transfer to other industries as they do not have the capacity to surpass the significant skill gap.  The former Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, published this Bill in 2010 with the purpose of regulating the level of welfare in the greyhound industry and to complement the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  The approach taken differs in some areas to that Act and has regard to the distinctive nature and controls applying to the keeping of registered greyhounds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The greyhound industry already has a system of self-regulation in place whereas the Dog Breeding Establishments Act provided for a whole new system of regulation around puppy farming, which had been unregulated until then.  While it was agreed that the greyhound industry had a higher level of welfare overall, it was agreed the voluntary system within the industry needed to be put on a legislative basis.  Last year, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in voted against the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009, as they wanted to have the greyhound industry <Col N="281"/>removed entirely from the Bill.  Following the passage of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, it was agreed between the then Taoiseach and the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to introduce separate legislation to regulate greyhounds within the context of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Today, Fine Gael is bringing in the very measures it opposed only a few months ago.  The Minister of State referred to the extensive consultations that took place with all interested parties during the period of the previous Government, such as the IGB, ICC and representatives from the welfare sector.  However, before the election Fine Gael constantly criticised what it said was a complete lack of consultation.  I am prepared to forgive and forget.  Fine Gael is welcome to the masses.</P>
        <P>Some key areas of the Bill will enhance the welfare of greyhounds through the regulation of breeding establishments.  The Bill in all its parts looks at the welfare of greyhounds, the establishment of breeding establishments and the provision of welfare officers appointed from local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Irish Coursing Club identifies and registers greyhounds individually in the stud book so as to ensure the integrity of the racing system.  The industry already has a system of self-regulation in place which can be readily adapted for welfare purposes, which this Bill uses as a starting point.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill applying to greyhounds in the stud book, there is merit in the establishment of a register of greyhound breeding establishments.  These are premises at which not fewer than four greyhound bitches are kept, each of which is more than 15 months old.  The scope of the Bill extends to all greyhounds in the racing and coursing industry, not only those found on a premises that is registered as a greyhound breeding establishment under the Bill.  We are confident the provisions for the welfare of greyhounds in this Bill and the extensive powers given to welfare officers will result in a high standard of welfare for greyhounds.  The Bill provides a period of up to three months from the commencement of the Act for greyhound breeding establishments to be registered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We welcome the Bill, the methodology behind it and the manner in which it cements a self-regulating industry which was under the jurisdiction of the ICC and IGB heretofore.  Extensive extra legal powers are now given to ensure we can root out those who do not apply the accepted standards to which we have grown accustomed.</P>
        <P>I would like to move on to the whole area of the greyhound history.  Deputy Moynihan pointed out the fantastic input the industry has, not only in rural life by way of being a hobby or augmenting the incomes of small farms but as an industry with a huge impact in the area of employment.  There are approximately 10,000 people employed directly and indirectly in the industry.  The wage bill generated is estimated to be &euro;207 million and the tax contribution from this employment is estimated at &euro;21 million.  Employment in the industry is spread across the country.  The regional dispersion is reflected in the spread of 17 tracks in the country and the ownership of greyhounds in every county.  The race meetings generate significant levels of expenditure and economic activity every week in rural towns, while greyhound owners make a significant contribution to economic activity through the purchase of various goods and services to maintain ownership.  The industry generates activity and employment in rural areas which would not happen in the absence of this important and indigenous industry.  Between 2002 and 2010, some 18,200 race meetings were held in the Republic, attended by 10.25 million people.</P>
        <P>Funding of the industry has suffered during the downturn.  The contribution from the horse and greyhound fund has declined significantly over the past three years.  The contribution peaked at &euro;15.3 million in 2008, but in 2010 had fallen by 22% to just under &euro;12 million.  Despite the significant decline of &euro;1.7 million in funding, prize money grant structures were maintained in 2009.  It was only in 2010 that the prize money grant structure reflected the <Col N="282"/>decline in funding which commenced in 2009.  There was a further decline of &euro;1.7 million in funding from the horse and greyhound fund in 2010.  The prize money grant per race represents very good value given the economic contribution of the sector and the level of economic activity involved in getting greyhounds born, reared, trained and ready to race.  In 2009, 21,300 greyhound races were held in Ireland.  The average prize money grant was just &euro;355 per race.  This small level of contribution per race represents good value for money, given the economic and financial contribution that owners competing in that race provide to the economy in getting their greyhound ready for the race.  The total cost to greyhound owners each year of keeping the greyhound pipeline in operation is approximately &euro;244 million.  This is a significant amount of expenditure and much of it is injected into local economies, supporting thousands of jobs.</P>
        <P>The Irish Greyhound Board delivered a comprehensive and impressive financial performance in recent years, despite the changed economic climate.  Costs have been cut and greater efficiencies achieved and the industry has been strongly supported.  It has managed to deliver higher profits, more capital development and higher prize money between 2007 and 2010 than in the preceding four-year period, despite the difficult economic environment.  In order to sustain and grow the industry in future, proper, sustainable funding mechanisms must be put in place.  Some of this funding will come from betting channels.  Without adequate and sustainable funding, the industry will struggle to sustain itself, its current contribution to the economy will suffer and its enormous potential will not be realised.  The industry makes a significant, economic impact across Ireland and the potential is considerable.</P>
        <P>Ireland is regarded as a world class player in dog breeding and there must be significant potential to exploit this further.  Greyhounds can become an even more significant export industry than has been the case, although already quite significant, and the Irish industry model can be transferred to other countries.  That aspect is being investigated and developed.  It is something I support.  The domestic tourism potential is also greater than envisaged at present.</P>
        <P>With regard to the exportation of our outstanding model, which is sought and admired by many others worldwide, the greyhound welfare aspect of the industry is its lifeblood.  Without the right welfare system in place and adherence thereto, the industry would not be the thriving one that it is and can be.  This being the case, who is to say we cannot seek to have our mechanisms, standards and procedures in place in countries to which we seek to export our model?  It is only with these in place that we would export the model and that the industry would become self-sustaining and generate greater profits than have been generated heretofore, even against the current economic backdrop.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to support all the efforts being made to seek to export our model, which is the envy of many others.  Were our model sold to the right countries and interested parties, it would represent a huge net gain to this country&rsquo;s coffers and economic viability.  The potential is considerable and I hope we do not hide behind scaremongering correspondence such as the e-mails I have received.  I know the industry and grew up with it and realise its potential.  I grew up realising its impact on rural communities and its great social benefit.  It has the potential to be exported and nobody should stand in the way of the Department, the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board in exploring this to the utmost.  It would be a shame if the Minister of State were blocked by someone casting groundless aspersions.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State not to let us down in this regard.  I ask him to return to the House to outline progress in this area.  I commend him on bringing forward the Bill as devised by the previous Government.  I ask all Members to support it and to take note of what is said in the House.</P>

	<P>It is a truism that a society can be judged on how badly or well it protects and supports its weakest and most vulnerable.  This applies to the welfare of animals as much as to the welfare of citizens.  I am sorry the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is not a Minister for humanities because we need a welfare Bill for humans in addition to one for a greyhounds and other animals.</P>
        <P>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes this Bill and will support the Government in ensuring it is passed.  While I was not a member of the previous Administration, I believe the discussion today shows Sinn F&eacute;in was wise and correct when it called for a separation of the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill from the general dog breeding establishments and animal welfare legislation.  This course of action has been proven to be wise.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cowen referred to the very good work being done in the greyhound racing and coursing industry.  It is a good industry and I have no doubt that 90% of the people involved treat their animals well and have animal welfare high on their list of priorities.  Equally, however, I have no doubt that a percentage of those involved are treating their animals very poorly.  Humans being human, a percentage certainly regard the industry as an opportunity to make money, at whatever cost.  This legislation gets the balance right between making it easy for those involved in the industry to do the right thing and making it costly if they are caught doing the wrong thing.  It is good legislation and Sinn F&eacute;in will support it.</P>
        <P>This week a dog breeder in Lisburn was found guilty of putting dead puppies through a mincer to feed his ferrets.  Given that the establishment in question was an illegal breeding establishment, this legislation on its own would not have prevented the incident, but the story shows the lengths to which some will go and the extent to which they disregard animal welfare if their only motivation is profit.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a poor record on greyhound welfare.  I am not referring solely to the greyhounds used in the sports industry.  At the peak of the industry, approximately 25,000 greyhounds were born in Ireland every year.  This is a huge number by comparison with the number of births in other countries.  Typically, only 80 greyhounds were adopted into Irish homes per year and between 430 and 450 were adopted into European homes at the end of their racing lives.  The worrying point is that 14,000 greyhounds disappear annually from the Irish radar.  This is and should be a cause of serious concern.  Not all the greyhounds to which I refer were used for racing; many were bred outside the industry, allegedly as pets, and were often used for illegal racing.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The greyhound racing industry is often regarded as difficult to regulate because it is a tough, competitive business in which it is hard to make a profit.  Greyhound bitches are often made breed time and again in the chase to find a champion.  One can understand why breeders would do this but not every greyhound born will be a champion and not every pup born will make its breeder, trainer or owner a lot of money.  I welcome the clause in the Bill that will ensure greyhounds can only produce six litters or, in exceptional circumstances, two in addition where a veterinary inspector certifies that the pregnancy and birth do not present a risk to the health or welfare of the bitch.  Such controls are needed.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that under this legislation, greyhounds cannot be bred until the age of 15 months.  This is a necessary provision.  The success, or otherwise, of the legislation will depend on the extent to which adherence is monitored.   The suitability of accommodation, food, drink, exercise and bedding materials in greyhound breeding establishments will have to be monitored.  Monitoring should be done in a way that encourages people to do the right thing and that strictly penalises those who are not doing the right thing by the greyhounds.</P>
      
      </Speaker><Col N="284"/>
        <P>This is important legislation and Sinn F&eacute;in is happy with it.  However, it has shortcomings.  It does not deal with the difficulties surrounding retired greyhounds.  Perhaps the Minister of State can correct me on this matter, or perhaps it will be covered in measures on general animal welfare.  The average greyhound reaches its top speeds between the ages of two and four years.  However, they can live for 14 or 15 years.</P>
        <P>In some cases, greyhounds are deemed to be useless once they have passed their top speed and many owners and breeders are not keen to hold on to them.  In Ireland, they are not seen as pets, which is evidenced by the fact that only 80 greyhounds per annum are adopted into Irish homes.  It is of concern that in Ireland 14,000 greyhounds disappear completely off the radar.  I must stress, however, that these are not all registered racing greyhounds.</P>
        <P>We need to look more closely at how to ensure greyhounds are looked after once their glory days of racing and coursing are behind them.  There are some retired greyhound refuges in Ireland but more needs to be done to ensure they are looked after.  Society cannot always depend on the voluntary effort and contribution of good people to absolve the Government of responsibility to ensure things are done.</P>
        <P>It is important the Bill is passed to ensure the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 is implemented and the animal health and welfare Bill 2011 is introduced.  Yesterday, I expressed criticism of, and I remain critical of, the completely inadequate legislation governing the welfare of Irish racing and show horses.  Will the Minister of State consider introducing something along the lines of the Bill tailored for the Irish horse racing and show industries?  It might be equally as beneficial as this Bill.  We can no longer pretend that abuse is not happening; we know it is.  If legislation is required to sort it out, let us get on with it.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SandraMcLellan"><NameTxt>Deputy Sandra McLellan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill.  I acknowledge the contribution made by the vast majority of those involved in greyhound racing and coursing to the sporting and cultural landscape in Ireland, and in rural Ireland in particular, and to the welfare of dogs.  They provide employment, sport and recreation for thousands of people and they have great dedication to their sport.  The vast majority have fantastic commitment to the welfare of their animals.  The familiar scene of local greyhound trainers out with their dogs in the very early hours of the morning is one repeated in villages, towns and cities throughout the island.</P>
        <P>With my arts spokesperson hat on, I recall feature films such as &ldquo;Man About Dog&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mighty Celt&rdquo; portraying the unique relationship between Irish greyhound enthusiasts and their dogs.  We have, without doubt, a strong and proud tradition of breeding and training greyhounds for competition in Ireland.  However, internationally we have seen cases taken against those who have committed immense cruelty to greyhounds.  In one instance in 2007, a builder&rsquo;s merchant was charged at Durham Magistrates&rsquo; Court in England with killing thousands of healthy greyhounds that were too slow to race.</P>
        <P>Animal rights campaigners claim Spanish hunters hang, drown and poison 50,000 greyhounds every year.  I am not aware of any comparable cases in Ireland, but there is no doubt that because of the competitive nature of the greyhound business some greyhounds, predominantly slower and older dogs, are particularly vulnerable to maltreatment and neglect.</P>
        <P>I welcome many of the provisions contained in the Bill, including the requirement for the formal registration of breeding establishments, the increase in the minimum breeding age, and, in particular, the restrictions on the number of times a female greyhound can be bred.</P>
        <P>We must not forget that the greyhound industry is just that, an industry.  It is aimed at producing pedigree dogs in a very competitive environment where the working life of a top-<Col N="285"/>class greyhound is very short.  As legislators, we have a responsibility to protect the welfare of these animals.  The Bill provides for this, but only if it is implemented and enforced.  I welcome the extension of powers for welfare officers from Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club and local authorities which will enable them to issue welfare notices and, where necessary, to seize greyhounds.</P>
        <P>An important issue concerning the welfare of greyhounds which I feel is missed, and perhaps it is beyond the scope of this Bill, is that of the welfare of retired greyhounds.  While I understand the certain degree of protection provided for under the general provisions relating to cruelty in the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965, it is important to stress that greyhound handlers must accept responsibility for the welfare of animals after their days of competition are over.  We must acknowledge and commend the work of the Retired Greyhound Trust which focuses on the adoption and re-homing of greyhounds when they finish racing.  In 2011, it launched a campaign, which is ongoing, to promote greyhounds as pets.  I know quite a few people who have greyhounds as pets and they are a lovely animal to have as a pet, particularly for those with children.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current financial constraints, the Government must support projects and initiatives like this if the welfare of greyhounds is to be really protected.  Likewise, the Government must ensure that the spirit and detail of the Bill are implemented.  This is something that will not necessarily cost in monetary terms but it will require a step-change in the relationship of the relevant authorities with greyhound breeders and handlers.  A thorough education campaign will be necessary to ensure that breeders, handlers and the authorities themselves are aware of the latest standards and regulations.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill.  If there is follow-through on its provisions it has the potential to be successful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the Bill, as does my party.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes it is unacceptable that animals may be kept in poor conditions not conducive to their welfare, and it is unfortunate that due to the actions of a very small minority Ireland has a poor reputation with regard to the welfare of greyhounds.</P>
        <P>In recent months, I have received multiple representations from constituents in Laois-Offaly regarding the issue of exporting greyhounds to China.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food refused to sign off on this proposal and the Minister stated Bord na gCon has dropped it.  However, there is still a lack of clarity on whether greyhounds will be able to be exported to China via a third state.  Regardless, it is unfortunate that the Bill will have no impact on this particular issue.</P>
        <P>While the public has quite rightly been vocal about the possible export of greyhounds to China, we must be aware that some in Ireland are no strangers to inflicting cruelty on these creatures.  As has been stated, most owners look after their dogs extremely well.  I recall a BBC report from a few years ago which detailed the prosecution of several people after animal welfare officers found dozens of greyhounds being transported in terrible conditions between this State and Spain.  In this case, 36 animals were discovered in cramped conditions without sufficient food or water for their 38 hour journey to Barcelona.  According to the report, the 36 dogs were placed in 20 cages and travelled for 18 hours by ferry and then 20 by road, stopping for a water break only once.  Four of the dogs were taken out on a stop in France to be exercised while the rest remained caged for the 750 mile journey in 40&deg; heat.  The cage sizes meant the majority of dogs could not stand at their natural height and as they shared a cage they could not sit or lie at the same time.  It is beyond me that anyone would consider it acceptable to treat an animal in this manner.  I hope the legislation will go some way towards addressing this type of appalling treatment of animals.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>I commend the valuable work of the greyhound rescue associations operating nationwide.  These organisations work on a voluntary basis to provide shelter for dogs that have been discarded by some owners like yesterday&rsquo;s rubbish.  I applaud their recent initiative to promote greyhounds as pets.  It will capture the public imagination and it signals that greyhounds are not different from other dogs such as labradors and spaniels and do not deserve to be treated cruelly.</P>
        <P>The Bill makes provision to ensure dog breeding establishments which do not meet minimum requirements will be forced to close, with the result that new and remaining establishments will provide a better environment for dogs.  I hope there will not be a delay in ending the practice of allowing people engaged in cruelty to continue their business.  Furthermore, I hope local authorities will not be inhibited from carrying out their duties as a result of the cost of enforcement and reductions in their budgets.  I ask the Minister of State to pay sufficient attention to the work done by local authorities in policing cruelty to animals and monitoring stray dogs.  Local authority staff, including housing staff such as tenant liaison officers, have prevented cruelty to dogs, horses and other animals.  I ask the Minister to work with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on this matter.  I urge him to issue the commencement order and ensure the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2010 is signed as soon as this legislation has completed all Stages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ClareDaly"><NameTxt>Deputy Clare Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>My Technical Group colleague, Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan, has asked me to apologise on her behalf as she is unfortunately unable to contribute to the debate.  Like me, she welcomes all initiatives that promote animal welfare and looks forward to the day when coursing, fur farming, fox hunting and all such activities are banned.  All these so-called sports have, at their core, deliberate and wilful cruelty to animals, including death.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan also makes the point that while she would welcome the Bill if it genuinely tackled the issue of greyhound welfare, she is slightly concerned that Bord na gCon has expressed support for the legislation.  This is especially the case given, as Deputy Stanley noted, the role Bord na gCon played in the proposal to export greyhounds to China.  It is appalling that Ireland could be involved in such an activity.  I hope the plans to export greyhounds to China will be stalled indefinitely.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that attention must be paid to the welfare of greyhounds.  While it would also make economic sense for the greyhound industry to give priority to welfare issues, sadly the reality suggests otherwise.  When the lobby was under way to exclude greyhounds from the dog breeding establishments legislation, it was argued that the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 was sufficient to protect, regulate and monitor the welfare of greyhounds.  We must examine this argument more closely.  Since the 1958 Act was introduced, a large number of greyhounds have suffered appalling treatment in this country.  The argument that the legislation in question protects greyhounds belies the reality.</P>
        <P>I propose to cite some examples of cases involving cruelty.  There is not a county which has not come to the fore as a result of a scandal involving the mistreatment of greyhounds.  In many cases, greyhounds are kept in poor conditions, confined to sheds or barns without light and proper heating and do not receive proper care and attention.  Many have been found lying malnourished on concrete, having been denied adequate care.  The welfare of animals, specifically greyhounds which do not make the grade, is secondary to the commercial side of the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Statistics showing that 10,000 dogs were put down last year are an indictment of society.  A large number of the 27 dogs put down daily are greyhounds which breeders do not want because they do not make the grade.  It is indicative of the inadequacy of regulation that so <Col N="287"/>many of the greyhounds in Britain are bred in Ireland.  The media regularly reports on cases of mistreatment of animals and the misuse of greyhounds.  In 2010, for instance, the media highlighted a case in which greyhounds, being a relatively tame breed of dog, were used as bait in County Tipperary during the training phase for fighting dogs to give them a taste for blood and practice in fighting.  We have also learned of instances in virtually every county of mutilated and abandoned dogs being found wandering the streets with weights tied around their necks, having had their ears cut off to avoid identification.</P>
        <P>While wanton cruelty is one aspect of the multi-million euro greyhound industry, another aspect of the business is the use of drugs.  A significant number of greyhounds have tested positive for ecstasy, cocaine and viagra, which causes deep trauma for the dogs in question.  Abandoned dogs and the use of drugs are aspects of the greyhound business which provide a different picture of the glowing accounts one hears from spokespersons of the industry.</P>
        <P>The number of greyhounds being bred in Ireland gives an idea of what the business involves.  On average, 35,000 greyhound pups are born in 4,500 litters every year.  Of the 35,000 greyhounds born in 2007, only 23,000 were earmarked and tattooed 16 weeks later and only 20,000 of these were given identity cards, making them, if one likes, eligible for racing.  What happened to the greyhounds which did not appear on any books or in a race?  Clearly, a large number of the 20,000 dogs with identity cards did not make the grade and were discarded on the basis that they did not have commercial value.  There have been shocking and repeated cases of vicious mutilations being carried out, the most popular method being the removal of dogs&rsquo; ears to avoid identification before being abandoned.  This practice has been carried out using battery acid, blow torches and other means as people try to avoid the identification of the dog.  In other cases, dogs have had their throats cut or have been dumped in rivers having had weights tied to them.  These activities have taken place in every county, albeit in some counties more than others, despite the protection of the 1958 Act.  That such cases have occurred serves as a warning and demonstrates a clear deficit in the legislation.  It also vindicates the position that legislation alone is insufficient to deal with animal welfare and shows that enforcement needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>The Bill states that greyhound keepers and those involved in handling greyhounds shall not cause or permit unnecessary suffering or injury to a greyhound.  This is a welcome provision, on which all Deputies should be able to agree.   The shortcoming in the legislation is that it relies largely on self-regulation, with the greyhound industry responsible for registering and monitoring the new register for breeding establishments and so forth.  It is also under the supervision of the Irish Coursing Club and the local authorities.  A huge number of organisations have a role so there is potential for a lack of clarity about who really has the overall responsibility.  It is unclear in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the local authorities have a role in this, but that must be weighed against the massive reduction in resources with which local authorities are operating.  There is a contradiction in piling more responsibility onto the authorities at the same time as their resources are being cut.  Given that the recruitment ban does not allow them to replace the staff they have lost, how are they expected to take on this responsibility in the serious way that is necessary?  I do not see how they can.  My experience with how local authorities deal with stray dogs and so forth is that they are already stretched to the limit and can just about maintain the <i>status quo</i>, not to mention take on another serious function in terms of regulating the greyhound industry or playing a more serious role in that regard.  That is something the Minister must examine.  I do not support the embargo on recruitment in the public sector.  It is costly and does not work.  It has to be reconsidered.  If the Minister is serious about giving the local authorities a role in this area, that must be resourced and that will impact on the recruitment embargo.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>Much of the cruelty greyhounds experience does not occur in the kennels.  The problem mainly arises from over-breeding, which is linked to racing, and the inevitable disposal of the unwanted greyhounds.  There are also problems with the tracks, such as the drugs, the injuries and collisions in the racing and what happens to those animals, the unsafe running surfaces and so forth.  Bord na gCon is a semi-State company and it has been charged with carrying out inspections for the past 50 years or so.  It already has the legal power to deal with many of the issues that cause welfare to be jeopardised but it has not used it.  That is a real problem.</P>
        <P>I come from the semi-State sector and usually I would defend it.  However, it has been in the limelight recently as a result of the disgraceful amounts being paid to its top executives.  It is just not good enough that Bord na gCon should be in existence for 50 years and have these responsibilities, yet the litany of abuses I have outlined and which are well documented have taken place on its watch.  This is a crucial issue the Minister must address.  The legislation is fine, although there is a lack of clarity about who will take overall responsibility, but nobody believes it will be a panacea.  If the objectives of improving the animals&rsquo; welfare are to be achieved, it must be backed up with resources, particularly at local authority level.  A good example of where that took place was when the limelight was focused on the Smithfield horse market.  Since that occurred there has been far tighter enforcement at that market.  We have seen the results with fewer horses being traded and more proactive responses.</P>
        <P>Overall, measures such as restricting the litters, trying to professionalise the registration and so forth are welcome but there must be more in the context of animal welfare issues in general.  There is a view among many in society who care deeply about these issues that perhaps this Government is trying to row back on some commitments given previously on improving our standards with regard to fur farming, the threat to reverse the ban on stag hunting and so forth.  As other Deputies have said, this is an issue many people feel strongly about; they want animal welfare to be addressed in a serious way.</P>
        <P>It is often said, understandably, that the country is in tatters.  Internationally, Ireland is like Greece, despite what the Government says.  We are in a precarious situation where many of our citizens are suffering horrendous problems.  Some might ask why people are even wasting their time talking about animal welfare issues when such vast problems are affecting humans.  The reality is that the two are not contradictory.  All those issues should be addressed, and dealing with animal welfare issues is long overdue.  In some ways they are legacy issues which should have been addressed previously.  Whether we are economically successful or going through a recession or depression, it is no justification for tolerating cruelty and wilful neglect of animals or anybody else.</P>
        <P>A civilised society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable citizens.  I believe there is a correlation between the way this Government is targeting the most vulnerable citizens and how there is a certain rowing back on some animal welfare issues.  This side of the House will not allow that to happen.</P>

	<P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on taking a reasonable and sensible approach.  I also thank him for visiting my constituency some time ago to see the greyhound track and the facilities provided there.</P>
        <P>Lest we get carried away with condemnation and so forth, it is a very valuable industry as well as an important way of life, certainly in south Tipperary, west Waterford and east Cork.  It was mainly families who were involved in the breeding and training of greyhounds and bringing them to race at tracks.  There is also a social aspect to that.  It is a huge industry that provides more than 11,000 jobs.  We cannot take that lightly as 11,000 is no mean figure.  In <Col N="289"/>addition, &euro;500 million has been invested in stadia throughout the country.  Hopefully, the Minister will be able to find &euro;1 million or so for the track in Clonmel.  It is very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>Say that again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether the Minister is laughing in jest or in support but the south east is entitled to have a representation made.  At least the Minister travelled there and saw it.</P>
        <P>Under the previous Administration I was very involved in many animated discussions about the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill and the welfare of greyhounds.  I was born and reared on a farm and the welfare of animals was intrinsic to all of us.  That applied to the welfare of every animal from the cat, to the cow, sheep and lambs.  This Bill provides for 15 months before breeding but I have always maintained that an animal, be it a cow, sheep or horse, breeds when their natural life cycle allows them to do so, after which it becomes a breeding animal.  Some animals might never breed and might not be kept for breeding.</P>
        <P>A great deal of hysteria crept into this issue on the last occasion.  Fundamentally, the former Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, did not understand what he was dealing with.  Worse than that, when he attended the meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party, of which I was a member, he pretended to be listening to rural Deputies and to understand.  I would not expect a city Minister to understand everything but he pretended to have an understanding.  However, when he left the meeting he tore up what had been said.  I am not saying he made any commitments because he did not, but he listened intently and pretended to be understanding.</P>
        <P>The then Taoiseach chaired many of those meetings and has a huge understanding of and involvement with dog breeding &mdash; his brother Deputy Barry Cowen has spoken in this debate &mdash; and I was aghast at the folly of what he allowed to be said by the Green Party.  I had to take a great deal of heat from it at times.  One would think its members were the only people interested in animal welfare.  This is anathema to the vast majority of dog breeders in South Tipperary and elsewhere.  These activists do not want horse racing or live cattle exports.  I do not condone fur farming.  I was driven to despair and to resign the whip of my own party.</P>
        <P>There is a huge industry around all these dog sports, created by ordinary men and women who are citizens of the country.  The Department gave funding to Bord na gCon for a greyhound stadium but for the most part the industry is created by people working in their own spare time and with their own investment.  Greyhounds need decent housing and must be carried in proper vehicles.  There is an industry around the provision of those.  There are veterinary and breeding costs.  I believe stud fees are in the region of &euro;3,000 per stud.  The industry is going through a traumatic time and I compliment all those involved on keeping the show on the road in such difficult times.</P>
        <P>I do not condone the neglect of any animal.  I accept that there were difficulties with exports to places such as China.  That trade was stopped, and rightly so.  However, breeders need an export market for dogs, whether for breeding or otherwise.  At the end of life dogs must be looked after and properly cared for.  This time last year, in the middle of an economic crisis, we tore ourselves apart for weeks on end.  I know we were approaching the silly season but we seemed to be in it for 12 months.</P>
        <P>The policy objective of the Bill is to improve the level of welfare in the greyhound industry.  While the objective is similar to that of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, the approach taken differs due to the distinct nature of and controls applying to the keeping of greyhounds.  The greyhound industry already has a system of self-regulation, which this Bill uses as a starting point.  I welcome that.  The greyhound industry already registers and identifies all animals so as to ensure the integrity of the racing system.  However, this can be readily <Col N="290"/>adapted for welfare purposes.  Therefore, the scope of the Bill extends to all greyhounds in the racing and coursing industry and not only to those found on the premises of an establishment registered under the Bill.  Greyhounds are defined as all animals entered in the Irish Greyhound Stud Book.  The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, on the other hand, provides for the unregulated industry of puppy farming, which we totally condemn as any right-minded person would.  Puppy farming has no existing system, so that Act started with the registration of premises and applied welfare standards to animals on such premises only.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and urge him to continue consultations.  The previous Minister spoke about consultation but did not consult.  He engaged in tokenism and made a joke of consultation.  The industry was furious because he did not consult the people he should have consulted.  He consulted his own Green Party activists, who tried to claim they were the only people with an interest in animal welfare.  That could not be further from the truth.  They think they are the guardians of everything connected with the environment and with this issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill contains codes of practice for the industry as well as setting out specific welfare standards and the powers to make regulations regarding welfare.  It also provides for regulations for the identification of greyhounds and requirements to notify sale or transfer of greyhounds, which is important to allow for traceability and responsibility to attach to owners.  There must be traceability and implants or some similar system to ensure it.  I thank local authority dog wardens and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work they have done.  Previous Deputies spoke about the number of dogs found in horrible conditions and the deaths of so many animals.  Very few of these were greyhounds.  Farmers&rsquo; first nurture after their families is of their stock.  Sometimes they treat their stock better than their families.  I do not mean that in a bad way, but their stock is a priority.</P>
        <P>Part 3 of the Bill is concerned with breeding.  This restricts the number of times a female greyhound can be bred as there are welfare concerns with greyhounds carrying excessive numbers of litters.  This is standard practice and anyone involved in breeding would understand and obey such a restriction.  The minimum breeding age will be 15 months.  This is considerably higher than the minimum breeding age of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  I have concerns about this measure.  The age of 15 months is quite old.  I accept that there must be regulation, but I ask the Minister to examine this minimum.  The Irish Coursing Club will not be permitted to register litters born to greyhounds under 15 months of age, who will as a consequence not be permitted to race or be used in coursing events.  This might be too strict.  We have had arguments as to whether the minimum breeding age should be three or six months but 15 months seems high.</P>
        <P>Part 3 also provides that establishments with four or more bitches over 15 months of age that have been or are being used for breeding will be registered as a greyhound breeding establishment.  I have no problem with that.  It is very important.  There will be a grace period following the commencement of the Act to allow existing establishments to register.  This is a welcome measure.  We cannot take a shotgun approach.  People need a lead-in time.  This Part further provides for procedures where the ICC may refuse or withdraw the registration of a breeding establishment and allows for such decisions to be appealed to the District Court.  This is fair.  There must be powers, rules and guidelines and they must be enforced.  There must also be a right of appeal under any judicial system where people feel regulations are being enforced too vehemently.</P>
        <P>Part 4 concerns enforcement and allows for the appointment of welfare officers by local authorities.  Dog wardens and animal welfare and veterinary officers are stretched.  A similar issue arose in Dublin when an institution in Meath was providing, at a nominal charge, for the removal of horses that were killed or injured.  When a veterinary officer was called the garda&iacute; <Col N="291"/>had numbers in their phones to call a certain hunting establishment which removed the dead animal as fast as possible.  With the stroke of a pen, the Minister decided to ban this service and it is now undertaken by the local authority, at considerable cost to the local authority.  Sometimes we use a sledgehammer to crack a chestnut.  We get carried away in trying to enforce laws.  Local authorities and the vets associated with them have done a good jobs with dogs, horses and all animals.</P>
        <P>Horses have become a huge issue.  The market has dried up and there are problems with horses in many areas.  I come from a proud horse breeding county.  Queen Elizabeth came to Coolmore Stud.  We are recognised all over the world for our state-of-the-art industry.  We are also recognised throughout Europe for the annual coursing meeting in Clonmel.  Coursing is a huge industry and is worth &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million to South Tipperary.  The Clonmel event is known throughout Europe.  I have been there many times.  There is none of the savagery that is often spoken about.  Last year, some animal rights activists, who think they are the only people concerned with animal welfare, released the hares from where they were being well looked after and had plenty of space in fenced-in fields.  They released them onto the motorway to be trudged over by vehicles and cause accidents.  I heard an animal welfare activist being interviewed on the radio and saying this was okay.  They felt it better to release the hares to be slaughtered on the motorway than be taken humanely, coursed by muzzled dogs, protected and brought back to their homes.  We need balance.</P>
        <P>I receive continual e-mails, which I no longer open, from these people who think they have a monopoly of concern for animal welfare.  I was born and raised on a farm where there were sheep, cattle and every kind of animal.  I am still involved with animals and animal welfare is a priority for me, as for most landowners and stock owners.</P>
        <P>I compliment the breeders and owners in Clonmel for sticking with coursing, for giving so much of their time and energy to the industry and for providing an outlet.  A large number of voluntary clubs and associations hold dog-racing evenings as fundraisers.  Schools, hospices and other causes can no longer get money from the Government.  They do valuable fund-raising with nights at the dogs and they sponsor cars and so on.</P>
        <P>I also compliment the owners and the voluntary board of Clonmel greyhound track on the effort they are making.  They have a state-of-the-art track following significant investment.  The track used to suffer from flooding but it was raised using OPW money.  However, the owners badly need a decent building for the race nights, for the spectators who travel from a wide area and for themselves.  Many jobs will also be created.  The owners are a little embarrassed by the stadium because it is out of date, cold and it is not a properly functioning building.  They have worked hard but they have had many disappointments and setbacks over the years.  I am fully supportive of their application for Government funding because they have raised a great deal of money themselves voluntarily.  I am hopeful they will get their due support.  They are looking for their own small share from Bord na gCon, similar to other dog tracks and they are not looking for a handout.</P>
        <P>Local officers can issue welfare notices.  Such notices may require a wide range of actions in the interests of the welfare of greyhounds.  These powers are circumscribed by the right of appeal and the need for a search warrant in certain instances.  I compliment the dog wardens, the veterinary people and the Garda because when action needs to be taken, it is taken and prosecutions follow.  The powers allowed include those for the destruction of greyhounds that are in pain, distress or an acute state of neglect.  We all support that 100%.  There are related enforcement matters concerning forgery and obstruction.  This section also specifies proceedings, penalties and the possibility of fixed payment notices.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>I look forward to working with the Minister on this and to the enactment of the legislation.  I hope he maintains consultation and shares with the people in the industry who are committed and want to put their time, energy and money where there mouths are.  They are also committed to animal welfare.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  This Bill became necessary because of the enactment of the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010.  This legislation was rushed through the House on 8 July 2010 by the previous Government.  All Stages of the Bill were taken in one afternoon having spent four months in the Seanad.  It was bulldozed through the D&aacute;il prior to the summer recess to keep the Green Party and, in particular, its former leader, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley, happy.  He left for his summer break with little thought for the damaging impact that Bill would have on the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>The Act&rsquo;s provisions cater for the proper regulation of puppy farming in this country.  However, if applied to the breeding of greyhounds, these measures bordered on the ridiculous and they would cause damage to the greyhound industry. Unprecedented concern was expressed to me and to many other Members by people involved in greyhound racing and breeding and throughout the greyhound industry.  I am a greyhound owner and breeder and I could not understand what the former Minister was trying to do.  Following the enactment of the Dog Breeding Establishment Bill, it became necessary to prioritise this Bill, otherwise the 2010 Act would be applied to greyhound breeding establishments.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge and welcome the involvement of greyhound industry interests, including the IGB, ICC and the main welfare bodies, in the drafting of this legislation.  The industry is of critical importance to this country.  It employs 11,000 people through direct and indirect jobs and it is estimated that it is worth &euro;500 million to the economy each year.  Over the past two decades the IGB has overseen a complete transformation in the standard of greyhound stadia throughout the country.  This transformation has resulted in Ireland becoming a Mecca for greyhound racing enthusiasts.</P>
        <P>Greyhound tracks offer a complete night out with high quality sport and entertainment in comfortable, clean surroundings and they are noted, in particular, for first class dining facilities.  There are 17 tracks in the State licensed by Bord na gCon, with meetings held nightly.  The industry is big business and is run in a highly professional way.  There is a system of self-regulation, which registers and identifies all greyhounds in the Irish greyhound stud book to ensure the integrity of the sport.  There is broad agreement on the Bill because extensive discussions were held with all stakeholders, including the Dog&rsquo;s Trust, IGB, ICC, Veterinary Ireland, City and County Managers&rsquo; Association and representatives of the animal welfare sector.  I welcome that level of consultation and, like Deputy Mattie McGrath, I encourage the Minister of State to maintain consultation because if everyone is included, consensus can be achieved.  This is not a contentious Bill because of the involvement of all the parties to which I referred.</P>
        <P>The principal purpose of this Bill is to enhance the welfare of greyhounds, particularly through the regulation of greyhound breeding establishments.  It introduces a provision whereby the ICC will be required to establish a register of greyhound establishments in each county.  The breeding of greyhounds will be restricted to bitches aged over 15 months with a maximum of six to eight litters per bitch.</P>
        <P>This legislation will make it necessary to register breeding establishments with the ICC under the supervision of local authorities, with minimum standards in such establishments and it will require adequate tracking mechanisms and record keeping.  Part 1 deals with preliminary issues <Col N="293"/>and contains the Short Title and commencement as well as the definitions and provides for the service of notification, notices and documents, expenses and the making of regulations.  Part 2 deals with welfare generally.  This Part also provides for regulations for the identification of greyhound and the requirement to notify sale or transfer of greyhounds, which is important to allow for traceability and responsibility to attach to owners.</P>
        <P>Part 3 deals with regulations on breeding.  The sections set out the number of times a female greyhound can be bred.  The minimum breeding age will be 15 months.  This is welcome because it is considerably higher than the minimum breeding age provided for in the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010.  Part 4 concerns enforcement and allows for the appointment of welfare officers by local authorities, the IGB and the ICC and gives these officers powers to inspect and to issue welfare notices.  Part 5 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to the exercise of functions by the secretary of the ICC.  It also specifies the non-application of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, which is very much welcome.</P>
        <P>The total cost to greyhound owners each year to keep greyhounds is approximately &euro;244 million.  This is significant expenditure and much of it is injected into the local economies and supports thousands of local jobs.  The IGB has delivered an impressive financial performance in recent years, despite the changed economic climate.  Costs have been cut and greater efficiencies achieved, and the industry has been strongly supported.  It has managed to deliver higher profits, more capital development and higher prize money between 2007 and 2010 than in the preceding four-year period, despite the difficult economic environment.</P>
        <P>To grow the greyhound industry into the future, proper sustainable funding mechanisms will have to be put in place.  Some of this will have to come from all betting channels.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do all in his powers to bring that situation about.  Without adequate and sustainable funding, the industry will struggle to sustain itself, its current contribution to the economy will suffer and its enormous potential will not be realized.  If we could put the greyhound industry on a sustainable footing by funding it through betting, it will be able to maintain itself into the future.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry makes a very significant economic impact across Ireland and the potential is considerable.  Ireland is regarded as a world class player in dog breeding and there has been significant potential to exploit this much further.  More than 8,000 Irish greyhounds are exported to the UK each year.   An Irish bred greyhound, Taylor Sky, won the English Greyhound Derby recently.  He broke three records in winning that title, which shows that Ireland is a world leader in the greyhound industry, and we need to build on that.  The greyhound industry has an exciting future and can make an even more important contribution to national and regional economic activity and employment, provided proper support and structures are put in place.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State and the Government in improving the industry.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ar dt&uacute;s b&aacute;ire, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it agus d&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis.  In congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment, I would also like to congratulate him and his officials on bringing this Bill before the House, for their extensive consultation and for the approach they took  to dealing with it.  I have known the Minister of State for a number of years.  He is a common sense, practical man and has demonstrated his ability in bringing the Bill through the House.  The Bill recognises the level of regulation and integrity of control in the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon and the Irish Greyhound Board are committed to the highest standards of animal welfare.  The Greyhound industry in not just an industry.  It is a compendium of many parts.  The greyhound racing bodies have made changes through the presence of veterinary surgeons at race meetings and sales, the employment of personnel to oversee greyhound wel<Col N="294"/>fare, the appointment of a welfare manager in addition to a welfare committee and the retired greyhound trust.  All of this has been done in consultation rather than a &ldquo;gun to the head&rdquo; approach.  The coursing club stud book records all greyhounds.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Government and the Minister of State are committed to animal welfare as reflected in the Bill&rsquo;s Title, the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011.  Those of us who support this Bill are supporting an industry and the welfare of animals.  It cannot be all about one side of the equation.  There must be a balanced approach.  If one was to listen to the commentary of those opposed to this Bill, one would wonder what world one was living in.  As someone who has had a family involvement in greyhounds over the years, I think it is important that we understand the massive economic activity that the greyhound industry generates in Ireland.  A Department of Finance report in 2009 revealed that &euro;13.9 million in income was received from the Exchequer, &euro;4.45 million of which was paid out in VAT, PRSI and PAYE.  That means &euro;9.5 million was paid by an industry which employs 11,000 people and which contributes over &euro;500 million to the economy.</P>
        <P>We must examine the issue of making greyhound racing and horse racing sustainable in this country.  We must look at the betting industry here.  Perhaps there are sacred cows and vested interests who we are afraid to take on, but maybe it is time we took a different approach to that.</P>
        <P>I would like to plug my own area in Cork.  I hope that the Minister of State will engage with the greyhound owners and breeders in  Cork, under the chairmanship of Mort Cronin and Kathleen Lynch, who are looking for new traps at the greyhound track there.  We are in difficult economic times, but they are great people who do great work.  I would like to pay tribute to Noel Holland, who retired as the manager of the greyhound track in Cork.  He is a gentleman, a great advocate of greyhound racing, and a man who was very central to the industry but who also had animal welfare at heart.</P>
        <P>This Bill is important.  It aims to enhance the welfare of greyhounds, but it must allow the greyhound industry to expand and develop, and to be done in partnership with the Government and the other stakeholders.  In his remarks, Deputy Cowen skirted over the controversy of last year.  I believe we had a Minister back then who was not aware and who did not understand the significance of the greyhound industry to our country.  I welcome, as a consequence of that, the fact that we have a separate welfare Bill before us today.  Those who criticise should look at what the Irish Greyhound Board and Bord na gCon have done in the area of self regulation.  It is well regulated and the people involved are second to none.  I welcome the provision for the creation of a new register of greyhound breeding establishments.  I do not oppose it all.  I welcome the fact that we will restrict the amount of times a dog can be bred, as well as the introduction of a minimum breeding age.  The Minister of State has consulted widely.  There has been broad consensus in some approaches and negotiation in others, but it is about welfare and an industry that can assist us in our economic challenge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The industry must face its own challenges.  The level of sponsorship, the cost of training, the running of tracks and the economic life of some of the tracks are very much under siege.  As Deputy McGrath pointed out, when there are sporting groups, voluntary charitable organisations and local schools in need of a fund-raising event, the first thing they do is go for a night at the dogs.  Bord na gCon has risen to that challenge.  The track in Cork is located down the road from where I live.  It has become the place to go on a Friday or Saturday night, where people can eat, drink, bet, enjoy corporate entertainment, family entertainment and so on.  It is an industry that supports so many.  It has impeccable people.  Deputy Cowen mentioned that there are 18,000 meetings in the year, with 10.25 million people attending.  If we took a straw poll of those people, what would they tell us about the greyhound industry?</P><Col N="295"/>
        <P>We had great success last month at the English Greyhound Derby and at the Irish Greyhound Laurels in Cork, and the summer derby in Shelbourne Park.  These are spectacles in the Irish sporting calendar.  It is an industry which is world class, which produces 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs, benefiting the local economies and the Exchequer to the tune of &euro;500 million.  The Farrell Grant Sparks 2009 report referred to the industry as a key driver of economic activity.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">We have 17 greyhound tracks in the country.  Let us consider the trainers, owners and breeders involved, and their impact on the local economy.  That is the reason I think the Bill is important and the Irish Greyhound Board and Bord na gCon are to be complimented on the way in which they have allowed the industry to be professionalised and modernised.  The industry has made changes to make it world class and fit for purpose.  I am glad that an element in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party stood up against the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, albeit that they came to that point late in the debate.  When I was a Member of the Seanad, a number of the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators were on their own, yet it was the Members on the Fine Gael benches who led the charge.  In saying that, it is important that there is consensus on the importance of the greyhound industry.  There is a need to recognise the importance of this Bill.  The industry is well regulated and deserves to be supported.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us needs to be debated properly.  Those who oppose it have every right to do so because of concerns which in their eyes are legitimate.  Some of the comments, expressing hysteria, sent to Members in e-mails are misguided and presented in some quarters as being gospel, when they are not.</P>
        <P>I am very happy that the Minister has brought forward this Bill and I am happy to support it.  It is good that the Bill has cross-party support.  We need to have an informed debate on the protection and enhancement of a valuable industry that operated in urban as well as rural areas.  This Bill goes a long way in addressing the fears of those who have legitimate, informed concerns.  It is time to legislate.  The Bill, with its checks and balances, will ensure that safeguards are put in place in the industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnPhelan"><NameTxt>Deputy Ann Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011.  As a person who understands that both animals and humans must co-exist, I welcomed the enactment of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010.  The Minister has been quick out of the traps with this Bill.</P>
        <P>Gandhi once said &ldquo;the greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated&rdquo;; that is akin to the saying that a society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable.  We, as a developed society, recognise the sentient qualities of animals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The objectives of the Bill are designed to improve the level of welfare to a specific animal species.  The Treaty of Amsterdam which came into force in May 1999, included a protocol on animal welfare designed &ldquo;to ensure improved protection and respect for the welfare of animals as sentient beings&rdquo;.  Animals like humans have the capacity to experience pleasure and pain, happiness or suffering.  A species that demonstrates that capacity has an unwavering right to have their welfare protected.  Rather than take an overly sentimental view of the Bill, recognising that the greyhound holds an economic value, it is therefore incumbent on us to maintain their welfare.</P>
        <P>The greyhound industry contributes an estimated &euro;500 million to the local economy.  This makes it very valuable indeed.  The industry is based on the manipulation of a canine species for monetary gain.  This would not happen in the natural world, therefore based on this manipu<Col N="296"/>lation by us comes the responsibility to protect the species involved, just as we would protect any worker in an industry.  It will ensure a level of stability in the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Apart from the United Kingdom, animal welfare is not a high priority in pan-European legislation, this Bill should therefore ensure a level of stability in the greyhound industry.  The welfare of the dogs will be ahead of the European norm.  However, I have a number of concerns which I hope the Minister will take on board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I think one aspect that is missing is a penalty for those who abuse greyhounds and in turn abuse the industry.  A recurring theme in legislation is a reference to what the local authorities may do, for example &ldquo;local authorities may appoint welfare officers&rdquo;.  As we know, however, local authorities are not being funded from the Government to appoint anybody since the introduction of the ban on recruitment five or six years ago.</P>
        <P>The penalty regime outlined in the Bill fails to sanction the offender.  I believe that offenders should be removed from the industry.  The vast majority of personnel in the industry would also probably choose to do this as well.  Abusers must be eradicated from the industry and endure a penalty.  I would like the Minister to consider this addenda to that section of the Bill, and to introduce a graduated penalty regime based on repeated offences and according to the seriousness of their conviction.  It is disturbing to see those who repeatedly flout the law continue to get away with it.  We have a significant problem with the welfare of horses.  That places an added burden on the local authority.</P>
        <P>I welcome the incentives in the Bill to copperfasten regulation on keeping greyhounds.  I commend the Minister of State on bringing on this legislation so promptly.  I hope he will consider some of my suggestions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Deputy Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>The greyhound racing and breeding industry sustains 11,000 full-time and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many in rural communities.  It contributes an estimated &euro;500 million into local economies around the tracks, which are spread throughout the country.  An independent review completed by Farrell Grant Sparks, FGS, in 2009 states that there is adequate direct and indirect evidence to support a strong argument that the greyhound industry constitutes a major source of employment, gives rise to considerable domestic and export earnings and is a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 17 greyhound tracks licensed by Bord na gCon.  Of these, Bord na gCon owns Shelbourne Park, Harold&rsquo;s Cross, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway and also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track, which is my local track.  I know the track well and going to the dog races is a great night out.</P>
        <P>The greyhound breeding industry is very successful with over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred.  Bord na gCon is a commercial State body established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for Bord na gCon transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in May 2010.  Bord na gCon is responsible for leading and directing the activities of the company.  Bord na gCon has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to the highest standards of animal welfare in the greyhound industry.  Deputies will be pleased to note that Bord na gCon has demonstrated its commitment to greyhound welfare and in this regard a number of initiatives have been put in place to ensure consistent and appropriate welfare standards are met.    These include the attendance of veterinary surgeons at racing and at sales trials, employment of personnel to oversee greyhound welfare and the employment of a welfare manager.  Bord na gCon is also an active member of the International Greyhound Forum, an international <Col N="297"/>group involved in the establishment of welfare standards and education.  A guide to best practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds is available from the Bord na gCon website.</P>
        <P>Bord na gCon established a welfare committee in July 2009 which seeks to identify ways in which the welfare of greyhounds can be improved.  In addition, Bord na gCon also operates the retired greyhound trust which focuses on the adoption and re-homing of greyhounds when they finish racing.  In 2011 it launched a campaign, which is ongoing, to promote greyhounds as pets.  My father used to race greyhounds and they were always retired to homes and they are the best pets; I agree with Deputy McLellan on that point.  Officials of Bord na gCon investigate any complaints received regarding greyhound welfare and follow up on any issues of concern that arise through their everyday interaction with trainers or owners either on the racetrack or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>Any proposal involving Bord na gCon engaging with the greyhound industry in China would have to give due consideration to animal welfare matters.  Ireland attaches a high priority to animal welfare and, alongside our EU partners, is working to promote better animal welfare internationally so I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s introduction of this legislation.  It is well tailored to enhance the welfare of Irish greyhounds.</P>

	<P>Before I address the points raised, I am pleased to bring the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 before the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to an informed and constructive debate during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the House.  Contributions on Second Stage were very useful and I thank those Deputies who took the time to examine this issue in advance.  The greyhound racing industry is important and makes a significant contribution to the economy and employment, particularly in rural areas where, in some cases, alternative employment may not be readily available.</P>
        <P>Greyhound racing and coursing are popular across the country and bring together rural and urban enthusiasts.  The greyhound breeding industry is also successful as an export industry, with many Irish-bred greyhounds now running in Britain.  Racing also attracts overseas visitors to Ireland.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone who took part in the debate.  Deputy Clare Daly asked if this is an important Bill in current circumstances but there are 11,000 people depending on the industry.  I am responsible for the industry and it is my job to ensure those jobs are protected and increased and this Bill will achieve that.  Deputy McLellan pointed out that we all love our dogs and this is a matter close to our hearts.  Deputy Daly mentioned other sports but we will not be doing anything to ban hunting, coursing or other pursuits.  Through Bills like this one we will ensure this activity is done in a professional way and that the industry will grow.  If less time had been spent in the last D&aacute;il trying to do away with these jobs, we might be at a different point today.</P>
        <P>Deputy Colreavy will see in section 10 that we are dealing with greyhounds that are registered through the coursing club.  Areas outside of that will be dealt with afterwards but the fines are in place for the person who is the last owner of a greyhound.  It is up to that person to deal with that dog in a proper fashion.  Other Bills to deal with other animals are being examined by the Department to ensure people treat their animals well.  Any ideas that Deputies can put forward will be considered.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned Clonmel dog track and I will keep him up to date about what is happening.  There was some controversy when I entered the Department surrounding the export of dogs to other countries.  As long as I am Minister for State, that will not happen unless the same treatment regime for animals is in place in those countries.  That is why our dairy and beef industries are so successful, because we are sure about what we are doing.  I will <Col N="298"/>not bow to any pressure on that score.  If the last Government had listened to the questions I was asking, we would not have had this controversy; it would have been dealt with earlier.  This was a black and white issue and that is how I will treat it.</P>
        <P>Inspections and local authority funding were mentioned.  Provision is made for local authorities to be refunded and inspections can be carried out by different bodies, and the garda&iacute; and the courts can be involved.</P>
        <P>This Bill deals with the greyhound industry, an industry that will be protected and grown.  We all agree the industry has upped its standards but there will be special scrutiny under the Bill for those who own four or more greyhounds, where the bitch must be 15 months or older when in other cases it is six months.  All those will help the industry.  The Chinese Ministers who came on a visit to see our food industry were very impressed and I want the same for the greyhound industry.  We must be clear what we are doing.</P>
        <P>We have put pressure on people in the greyhound industry but they want that regulation in place because they know their industry offers much employment and enjoyment.  The dog tracks offer a great night out for very little money.  It is a few years ago but I went to Thurles and it was a very cheap night out with great facilities.  Fianna F&aacute;il made sure the facilities were good; not everything about the boom was bad, the roads and sporting facilities were improved.  I intend to secure as much funding as possible to ensure the likes of Clonmel, Kilkenny and other dog tracks are upgraded to a uniform standard.  It might take longer than originally anticipated but it is through the support of Members that it will happen.  Sometimes it is hard to beat a bit of lobbying, even from members of one&rsquo;s own party, to ensure we get the best.  The greyhound industry is good for the country and for jobs.  I will be straight with anyone who tries to stand in my way.  Issues will be either black or white.  There will be more lobbying as aspects of the industry are examined and reversed.  We will meet that head on, regardless of from where it comes.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone who made a contribution.  The penalties are considerable and that aspect of the Bill is well covered.  As Deputy Ann Phelan rightly said, people may reoffend.  The penalties are in place and it is up to the Irish Coursing Club and those in the business to ensure that people who are not compliant are not allowed to remain in business.  That is the right way to do it.</P>
        <P>I hope the Bill will go through speedily.  I thank all who made a contribution.  Furthermore, I hope the success we had in progressing the matter to date can be kept up when we return shortly to Committee Stage.  I look forward to further discussion on the issue at that time.</P>

        <asker> Deputy Billy Kelleher</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  if he has read the recommendations of the Health Information Quality Authority update on the implementation of the recommendations of the Ennis report received from the Health Service Executive in February 2011; and his views on the implementation of the recommendations relating to small hospitals.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[18079/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully aware of the recommendations of HIQA with regard to Ennis hospital and its subsequent report on Mallow General Hospital.  Both reports deal with the types of service that can safely be provided in smaller hospitals and with the structures required for good governance and accountability within our hospitals.  The report on Mallow reiterates the implications of the Ennis report for all hospitals of a similar size.  I have said on many occasions that local hospitals can and should be a vibrant element of local health services, providing treatment and care at an appropriate level of complexity to patients in their areas.  I have also said I will not stand over unsafe care that puts patients at risk.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in these HIQA reports need to be implemented in order to ensure the standards of care delivered in smaller hospitals are as high as possible and that the type of care provided is appropriate to the clinical setting and to the needs of patients.  I have had a number of meetings with clinicians and officials in my Department and the HSE about the progress being made in implementing the HIQA recommendations both generally and in specific hospitals.  I intend to keep myself fully briefed about ongoing developments.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland so they play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Patients should need to travel to the larger hospitals only for more complex services.  HIQA&rsquo;s reports on Ennis and Mallow are entirely in keeping with this approach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has stated that he accepts and agrees with the HIQA reports on Ennis and Mallow hospitals and the recommendations with regard to the other hospitals named in the Ennis report.  Obviously, nobody can stand over unsafe provision of care in any hospital, particularly in smaller hospitals.  However, there are two ways of addressing this issue.  We must either accept the report in full, agree with its findings and close the smaller hospitals, or address the deficiencies in the smaller hospitals and make sure acute services and accident and emergency services, for example, are provided safely.  For many of the hospitals named in the report, the Minister intends to use these reports to downgrade smaller hospitals.  This is clear and evident from the actions of the Minister today and over recent days with regard to Roscommon County Hospital, for example, which was to have a 24-hour accident and emergency service and is now to have none at all.  This report should not be used as a mechanism by the Minister to retract promises made prior to the election and subsequently.  Rather than withdrawing services entirely, he should address the deficiencies in the services.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="300"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.  I do not believe HIQA reports should be used to close smaller hospitals.  If they highlight problems, these should be addressed as far as possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned Roscommon County Hospital, which will be discussed later in another question.  Roscommon hospital is faced with a number of difficulties at the moment.  One is a shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors, and another is HIQA patient safety concerns, which arise because of the low volume of patients going through the emergency department &mdash; 30 people a day.  There is also a difficulty in providing supervised training for doctors, which means these posts are unpopular.  We are seeking to address this; I will cover it in a later question.  However, the biggest problem facing the hospital is safety.</P>
        <P>Let us be absolutely honest about what is currently available in Roscommon hospital.  We have an unsafe service.  The obvious question is why it is unsafe.  I say it is unsafe because it deals with undifferentiated multiple trauma cases, undifferentiated medical cases, including heart attacks and strokes, and undifferentiated surgical problems.  If people are brought there by ambulance, they have a right to expect that the skills are available to deal with their problems.  However, if a person is suffering from multiple trauma, broken bones and blood vessel damage, there is no orthopaedic surgeon and no vascular surgeon.  If a person has had a heart attack, there are excellent physicians, but there is no facility to insert a stent, if that is what is required.</P>
        <P>I am happy to come back to the issue of Roscommon hospital in another question.  However, I say this to the Deputy.  The HIQA reports, particularly the Mallow report, are clear.  The Deputy&rsquo;s question is a bit confused, if I might point that out.  He refers to a report received in February 2011, but no such report was received.  The Mallow report, which I have in front of me, is from April 2011.</P>

I will return to this in the later question on Roscommon hospital, with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s permission.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  the action he has taken to avert a crisis situation in our public hospitals as and from 11 July 2011 in view of the hundreds of non-consultant hospital doctor posts which are vacant; his plans to reduce the excessive working hours of junior doctors and the programme he will put in place to end the over-reliance of our hospital system on junior doctors.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[18076/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am working with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure the filling of as many as possible of some 475 non-consultant hospital doctor posts which are due to be filled from 11 July.  I can confirm that as of 27 June, 221 of these posts have been filled, which leaves 254 vacancies.  The HSE conducted an extensive recruitment drive in India and Pakistan in recent months and succeeded in identifying 439 potential candidates for NCHD positions in Ireland.  I have held meetings involving my Department, the Medical Council, medical training bodies and the HSE with a view to identifying measures to facilitate the appointment of suitably qualified doctors from abroad.  The drafting of a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to enable the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period is at an advanced stage.</P><Col N="301"/>
        <P>Notwithstanding this and other initiatives, it is unlikely that all NCHD vacancies can be filled by 11 July.  Hospital managements are working with clinical directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented if required to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimised and that the safe delivery of hospital services is assured.</P>
        <P>I recognise and support the need to reduce the hours worked by NCHDs.  If further progress is to be made it is essential that, over time, reliance on NCHDs to deliver services is reduced.  An expanded role for nurses and a better skill mix generally in hospitals is one crucial way of achieving this.  An increase in the number of consultants and greater team-working, with a consequential reduction in the number of NCHDs, is also required.  The 2008 consultant contract and the 2010 NCHD contract allow for more flexible work patterns and the further development of consultant-delivered services in hospitals.  The inclusion of a better skill mix in rostering arrangements has been identified as a priority in implementing the public service agreement in the health sector this year.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as teacht isteach chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt.</P>
        <P>On &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; on 20 June 2011, the Minister stated we may end up with some accident and emergency departments that cannot be safely manned.  He continued the difficulty would not be with any of the major ones but small, rural hospitals.  While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement this afternoon that 221 of the 475 posts have been filled, he must fill the remaining posts by 11 July which is the week after next.  Will he inform us as to where the fault lines will present in hospital services?  As of 11 July, what hospitals will not have the required number of non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHDs, to guarantee safe delivery of services?  Will some accident and emergency departments have a diminished presence such as closing at night and weekends?</P>
        <P>What will happen to services at Roscommon?  I note some of the Minister&rsquo;s party colleagues who have a keen interest in that hospital are present behind him in the Chamber.  What will happen to accident and emergency services at Navan, Portlaoise, Mallow, Bantry and Loughlinstown?  Will the departments in Letterkenny and the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick be closed at night?  Will the Minister outline the measures he will take to ensure the required number of doctors will be recruited to avoid such a scenario?  How does he propose to ensure the problem will not re-occur, as has happened historically, in six months time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The last part of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question is the easiest to answer.  Whether we have the full complement by 11 July, we will still continue to recruit over the course of the next six months to ensure we do not face this problem again.  It should be borne in mind that legislation will be introduced which will allow for temporary registration for two years.  This will mean these doctors will have security of tenure for two years; likewise, we will have the security of knowing they will be here for two years.</P>
        <P>Up to 254 places are unfilled.  As the recruitment process is ongoing, it is difficult for me to tell the Deputy precisely which hospitals are going to suffer.  On &ldquo;The Frontline&rdquo; I said it will more than likely be the smaller hospitals for several reasons, chief of which is that the regional centres serve the bulk of patients, including those from smaller hospitals with more serious injuries.  Doctors who have already applied to the hospitals that will be affected will not be pulled away from them.  Doctors recruited will be sent to the areas of highest need and according to their speciality.  There is little point in sending a paediatrician to an emergency department.</P>
        <P>I know today that 65 more doctors have chosen to sit the Medical Council&rsquo;s pre-registration examination, the PRES exam.  Also, 70 visas were granted to doctors already recruited who <Col N="302"/>have satisfied our requirements and are most unlikely to be unsuitable.  Accordingly, with the PRES and those recruited already, we will not have unsafe or poorer quality doctors.</P>
        <P>The number of recruited doctors is beginning to rise.  I will have much clearer idea of the figures tomorrow by 5 p.m.  Contingency plans are in train but are dependent on numbers we have recruited.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I know this is a great concern to many people who value highly their local and regional hospitals.  Bad and all as the health service became over the past several years, people know that when they can access it, they get excellent service and care.  I am doing everything in my power to ensure we have the required number of doctors and that we continue to recruit to ensure we do not face this problem again.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will arrange for a person from the Office of the Comtroller and Auditor General to investigate the way that the VHI negotiate prices for various medical procedures with medical consultants and likewise the daily cost of beds; if he benchmarks medical charges paid for procedures in the republic against those paid <Col N="303"/>by health insurers in Northern Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands; and the way it was possible that more than &euro;1 million was paid to one consultant in 2010 from the VHI.</Quest>
        <QRef>[18077/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to reviewing costs generally across all sectors, including the private health insurance market and scrutinising where savings can be made for the Exchequer and the consumer.  I am not satisfied that any consultant should be paid &euro;1 million in a single year.  This level of remuneration is grossly out of step with most ordinary people&rsquo;s expectations.  The individual, whom I do not know, is working hard in a system that over-rewards that.  There are only so many procedures one can carry out safely in a week.  If this level of remuneration is available to people who work hard and safely, the service provided is grossly overpriced.  I am also dissatisfied that several other consultants also earned enormous sums from the VHI, and to a lesser extent, from other insurers in recent years.</P>
        <P>I have overall responsibility for policy on health insurance and, in particular, governance issues relating to the VHI, including such matters as board appointments and the receipt of its annual report and accounts.  While owned by the State, VHI is a not-for-profit company operating in a competitive market and negotiates directly with service providers on pricing.  While it would be inappropriate for any Minister to intervene directly in matters relating to prices set, I have concerns about the claim levels and, in particular, the cost of services being provided to and paid for by the VHI.  It is after all a not-for-profit company which acts on behalf of consumers.  The company could and should have done more to control costs.</P>
        <P>I met with the chairman and chief executive officer of the VHI very shortly after my appointment in March 2011.  At that meeting, I expressed my concerns about the VHI&rsquo;s significant claims costs.  Due to its size and position in the market, it has a crucial impact on costs and I made it clear this issue needed to be addressed vigorously.  Many of the concerns about the company&rsquo;s approach to costs were outlined in a report commissioned by my Department and conducted by the Department&rsquo;s actuarial advisers, Milliman.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office has no audit powers regarding the VHI and is not the appropriate regulator.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>I also raised the important issue of the base cost of procedures with the company.  They responded to me with an outline of how their payments to consultants were calculated.  I am not satisfied that these costs represent best value for the consumer.  For this reason I met with the Health Insurance Authority on 10 June 2011, as the regulator of the private health insurance market, and requested them to examine the issue of provider costs in the market.  The authority will revert to me within one month on how this matter might be addressed.</P>
        <P>In April, I welcomed the VHI&rsquo;s announcement of its financial outturn for 2010, which shows a significant improvement over the 2009 outturn.  I acknowledged that, over the past two years, the company has taken steps to contain the rising costs of meeting customers&rsquo; health care needs, including a 15% reduction in consultants fees per procedure, a 6% reduction in private hospital fees per procedure and an annualised reduction in internal administration costs of &euro;14 million.  These actions have generated annualised savings of &euro;100 million.  VHI pays professional fee benefits to medical practitioners for services rendered on a fixed fee per service basis.  In 2011, VHI anticipates that the total remuneration paid to hospital consultants will be over &euro;50 million less than the total remuneration paid in 2009.</P>
        <P>However, I intend to ensure that clients and the taxpayers alike get much better value for money into the future and this will be a clear focus of the new board and CEO to be appointed next month.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a role in this matter.  The remuneration received by the consultant is mind-boggling and many people are incensed when they read about these exorbitant sums.  This is also just one case of the charges levelled by consultants.</P>
        <P>Consumers are being ripped off and are probably paying the highest premiums in Europe.  I ask the Minister to consider what is happening in other EU member states.  I welcome the fact that he is dealing directly with this matter.  It is about time someone took action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I request that the Minister develop a step-by-step plan and that he ensure that by the end of the year it should be affordable for people to pay for private insurance.  At present, many individuals have been ruled out of the market.  The statistics back me up on this and indicate that people cannot afford to pay for private insurance.  What is happening is not right.  I accept the Minister is trying to establish a single-tier health system and dealing with the matter to which I refer is probably one of the most important aspects of achieving this goal.  I request that he pursue this issue with all possible vigour in order that there be a level playing field and that ordinary people will be in a position to afford to pay for private insurance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Tom Fleming for raising this important matter.  I am deeply concerned about the current position and I am extremely unhappy that it has been accepted, as a matter of course, that the rate of medical inflation is 9%.  Why is that the case?  We need to examine the position.  Has anyone carried out a unit-based cost analysis in respect of what is paid for each procedure?  The answer is that this has not been done.  However, I have requested that such an analysis be carried out.  We are seeking information from abroad in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>I must acknowledge that, in fairness, the VHI has made attempts to save money during the past year.  There has been a 15% reduction in consultants&rsquo; fees per procedure and a 6% reduction in private hospital fees per procedure.  In addition, there has been an annualised reduction in internal administration costs of &euro;14 million.  These actions have generated annualised savings of &euro;100 million but in my view they do not go far enough.  Even though the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have any power in this area, I will, on behalf of the people, endeavour, by means of appointments to the board and through the appointment of a new CEO, to ensure that driving down costs will become the focal point of the VHI&rsquo;s activities.  The costs that are charged through insurance are passed on privately to people who do not have insurance.  This has implications across the health service and the entire tax base.  The Deputy may rest assured that this matter will be aggressively and vigorously pursued.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  when the special delivery unit will be established and operational; the process by which it will begin receiving referrals of patients; the timeline for this process; the date on which the National Treatment Purchase Fund will no longer receive referrals; the functions the NTPF will have following the establishment of the SDU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[18080/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I announced the establishment of the special delivery unit, SDU, on 1 June.  This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister for Health because I am determined to tackle the delays in access to hospital services whether that is for emergency or <Col N="305"/>elective care.  The SDU is also a critical building block in the Government&rsquo;s plans to reform radically the health system in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of introducing a system of hospital trusts and access to services based on universal health insurance.  Access to such a system will be determined by need rather than what someone can afford to pay.  As part of this, free general practitioner, GP, care at the point of delivery will be put in place. </P>
        <P>I have appointed Dr. Martin Connor as head of the SDU and to the interim board of the HSE.  Dr. Connor is an international expert, with a proven track record in health service transformation.  He has extensive experience in the NHS and led a similar initiative in Northern Ireland with considerable success.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.</P>
        <P>Dr. Connor has already begun to work with the hospital system in order to put in place new arrangements to reduce waiting times in emergency departments and to improve access to elective inpatient and day-case services.  This work includes a detailed baseline analysis of the emergency and elective access system.  Part of Dr. Connor&rsquo;s remit is to advise me on the governance arrangements which will best ensure there is real accountability and responsibility for performance across all public hospitals.</P>
        <P>For now, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, will continue to operate as normal, accepting applications from persons who have been waiting for over three months for treatment.  However, the establishment of the SDU will require a change in the current role of the NTPF.  This is an issue I will be considering over the coming months.</P>
        <P>An immediate priority for the SDU will be to ensure waiting lists for inpatient services are managed properly and that hospitals take responsibility for managing patient flows.  I cannot accept a position where some hospitals allow small numbers of patients to wait more than a year for their procedures.  I will expect this matter to be tackled quickly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Most people accept that the National Treatment Purchase Fund has proven to be a very effective mechanism in the context of dealing with delays and reducing waiting lists.  Some &euro;30 million has now been taken out of its budget.  Will the Minister confirm that this money will be spent by the special delivery unit on ensuring the capacity the National Treatment Purchase Fund would otherwise have had if there had been no reduction in its budget will be used to reduce the waiting lists relating to elective and emergency surgeries, MRI scans etc.?  I am concerned the National Treatment Purchase Fund should continue to be in a position to refer people on to private hospitals in respect of having procedures carried out.  The major issue that arises here is that the special delivery unit might use up most of the &euro;30 million to which I refer in covering administration costs rather than in disbursing it in the form of direct funding to patients.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the position relating to hospital trusts, particularly in the context of Roscommon County Hospital.  Prior to the general election the Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We will establish Roscommon County Hospital as a stand alone hospital.  It will continue to be owned by the State, but will be governed and managed by a Local Hospital Board...</P>
        <P FLI="0">If that is the case, will legislation be required to establish the hospital as a stand-alone facility?  Will the hospital be used by the special delivery unit in the context of the provision of elective surgery or will it be in a position to operate independently of the unit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>People know my view on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  I must seriously contest the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that it provides value for money and works very well.  The fund has delivered a certain level of relief to the system.  However, we must <Col N="306"/>consider the fact that &euro;300 million was spent by the National Treatment Purchase Fund over three years.  Last year it spent a total of &euro;90 million and 28,000 patients were seen.  If I recall correctly, inpatient procedures were required in respect of 20,000 of these individuals.  Let us compare that with the position in Northern Ireland, where the special delivery unit approach is used.  In 18 months, and at a cost of &pound;36 million &mdash; as opposed to &euro;300 million &mdash; 57,000 people were treated.</P>
<TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are ways of doing things a great deal better.  I cannot suddenly turn off the tap in respect of the hospitals and patients that continue to use the fund.  However, we are reducing the number of people in respect of whom the fund will purchase operations.  We want to use the funding that will be saved as a result of this in more innovative ways.  I refer, for example, to circumstances where the addition of a theatre nurse could double the output of a surgical unit.  There are a host of other examples which could be offered in this regard in respect of accident and emergency departments, medical departments and various other procedural areas.  The addition of staff &mdash; even half-time whole equivalents, etc. &mdash; can make a huge difference in the context of output in these areas.  The prime example I might offer relates to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, where the addition of 0.4 of a whole-time equivalent of a nurse could double the number of scoliosis patients treated.</P>
        <P>We are concerned with doing things in a different way.  The special delivery unit will also be the agent of change, which is extremely important.  I am not just referring to changes in clinical programmes and the way in which services are delivered, I am also referring to the unit being the agent of change in the context of how information and communications technology is used.</P>
        <P>It is deeply disturbing that there is a major training hospital in this country to which no non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, wants to go as a result of the way in which they are treated.  Protocols will be put in place to inform people how they should deal with their peers, with junior staff and with patients.  Those who stand outside of this will be brought to book.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  if his attention has been drawn to the fact that paediatric services in Dublin have become inundated with referrals; his views that children with diabetes should be seen four or more times each year in order to properly manage their condition and minimise problems in adulthood; if he has considered the re-organisation proposal from Diabetes Action who are seeking a re-organisation of the service into eight networks in order that there is an equality of distribution/access to services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[18078/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE&rsquo;s national clinical programme for diabetes, which includes the care of children and adolescents with diabetes, has estimated that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 children and young adults with diabetes in this country.  It was established by the HSE in 2010 with the express aim of defining the way diabetic clinical services should be delivered, resourced and measured.  One of the key priorities is to facilitate future organised care and screening for diabetes related complications.</P>
        <P>Type 1 diabetes is a particularly complex condition in children and young adults and so it is recommended that their care be delivered in a multidisciplinary setting, with access to a consultant paediatric endocrinologist and other diabetes health care specialists and psychological support.  For young people this diagnosis presents great difficulties and life changes, particularly in the teen years.</P>
        <P>One proposed national model of diabetes care is based on eight to ten regional networks, with the three existing Dublin centres acting as a tertiary hub of excellence and continuing to <Col N="307"/>see one third of the national paediatric and adolescent diabetic population.  This model has been proposed by the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.  The second model came from the expert advisory group, chaired by Dr. Colm Costigan, paediatric endocrinologist in Crumlin Hospital.  This proposes that care be centralised for each region in a dedicated paediatric and adolescent diabetes centre, looking after at least 150 children and adolescents.  Ideally the centre should be in a regional hospital that has an adult diabetes centre to facilitate transition to care in adulthood.</P>
        <P>The national clinical leads for diabetes and paediatrics are to meet in the next couple of weeks to assess current services across the country, to agree a model of care and to standardise these across the country.  They will also develop criteria for use of CSII therapy &mdash; insulin infusion &mdash; in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and work on policy to prevent and aid the early detection of diabetes in young children and adolescents.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, the function of the HSE national programme for diabetes, among others, is to consider which model is most appropriate and the executive is working to this end.  In parallel, my Department and the HSE will be meeting the Diabetes Federation of Ireland with a view to progressing the issues around the appropriate model of care for children and adolescents with diabetes.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note the following important developments in this area.  The national diabetes programme is continuing the development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.   While retinopathy screening is continuing in the north west region, the intention is that services be rolled out nationally, probably during 2012.  This programme is significant because diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness and serious visual impairment in Ireland.  Some 90% of people with diabetes will develop retinopathy, while 10% will be sight threatened if undetected and untreated.  I met community ophthalmologists on this issue and discussed their plans for rolling this out.  I will also meet optometrists who may also have a role.  A national footcare model has also been agreed.  The aim for 2011 is to establish 16 specialist multidisciplinary foot care teams across the country in line with indicative national hospital reconfiguration which will have different levels of care for patients, depending on their risk of diabetic foot disease.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I rely on people who contact me to tell me about the level of care they feel they and their children, in particular, receive.  I am sure most of us, including those on the other side of the House, have had significant communication on the issue of the structure of the diabetic services.  I hear that the Dublin hospitals are inundated with people looking for services.  People are making contact because they are concerned by the queues and the fact that children are not seen as often as desirable to minimise damage that might occur later.  I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s response that he will agree some changes to the system.  Does he have a timeframe for when he expects these changes to be fully rolled out?  The change is about doing things smarter and will not necessarily cost more.  However, if the system is done differently, it may well save unnecessary damage and bring about better outcomes in the long term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and I hear her concerns loud and clear.  Many people have the same concern.  In my response I indicated that in the next couple of weeks a meeting will be held between the clinical leads for diabetes and paediatrics to assess the current services across the country and, most importantly, to agree a standard model of care.  Without going into too much detail, I imagine we are talking about a matter of months and that something concrete will arise from that meeting.  I will certainly push them to come to an early conclusion.  Much work has been done in the area and while I know there are varying views on how best to achieve the end, I have no doubt that all parties concerned are <Col N="308"/>interested in and committed to the well-being of children with diabetes and that they will expedite a plan that we can implement.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  his views regarding the Health Service Executive paying a substantial amount of rent for a premises in County Carlow, intended to provide facilities that are already available in the nearby Sacred Heart, District, and St. Dymphna&rsquo;s Hospitals, in view of the fact that the rented premises are not currently in use; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[17860/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the premises referred to is located at Shamrock Plaza, Carlow.  If so, then there appears to be considerable confusion with regard to the use of the premises and the services to be provided.  The facilities at the nearby Sacred Heart District Hospital and St Dympna&rsquo;s Hospital are not suitable for the provision of primary care services. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The new primary care centre for Carlow town is to be accommodated at Shamrock Plaza.  The development of primary care teams and primary care centres is a priority under the programme for Government.  The first floor is already occupied by three GP practices and HSE staff will occupy the second floor.  Both floors have lift access.  Together, these floors will accommodate the Carlow town primary care centre and when the HSE staff move in, the primary care team will be located there.  Other businesses, including a bank, a software company and pharmacy are accommodated in the building.  There is residential accommodation on the upper floors.  There is underground car parking beneath the building and an estimated 1,000 car parking spaces in the vicinity, including a multi-storey car-park.  Up to 43 HSE staff will provide a range of health services, including public health nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy services, speech and language therapy, psychology services, dietary and nutrition advice, home help services and general support staff facilities.  There are additional rooms to accommodate outreach hospital consultant clinics and other visiting specialists.  At maximum capacity, up to 40 clients can receive services at a single point in time.  The fit-out has been completed and equipping is virtually completed.  The accommodation will be ready for occupation by HSE staff shortly.</P>
        <P>The rent paid for any HSE occupied primary care centre accommodation cannot exceed that approved by the HSE board for that specific location.  The annual rent for this centre is &euro;320,000 a year, for an area of just less than 20,000 square feet.  This rent is less than the rent approved by the HSE board for a premises of this size.  Rent payments, which are payable in advance, have just commenced.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatrickDeering"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Deering</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response, although I would dispute some of the facts in it.  Over the past 18 months, the two words &ldquo;Shamrock Plaza&rdquo; have become dirty words in Carlow town.  This building is seen as a pay-off for developers who built it in the so-called Celtic tiger years.  The building is totally inaccessible.  There are a number of car parking spaces, but as far as I understand these are limited to the staff working in the building and are being paid for by the HSE.  Once again this is an example of a totally unaccountable HSE, a monster created by the former Fianna F&aacute;il Government of which Deputy Kelleher was a member.  At a rent of &euro;1,000 per day, I question the value for money.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P>Can the Minister confirm the length of the contract entered into for this building?  The rumour is that it is for 20 years.  At &euro;1,000 per day or &euro;320,000 per year, the cost works out at &euro;7 million over a 20-year period.  That is a significant amount of money.  We could do a lot more work with it.  We could build a facility.  What contracts are in place and will they be reviewed over the next period of time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise because I do not have an answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  I hear his concerns, particularly with regard to accessibility to the site.  I will not comment on the other contention at this time, but I will check out the duration of the contract.  I will also ask for a report on accessibility to the site and its appropriateness and will check what other sites might be available in the town.  It is not the intention of the Government to preside over waste or excessive costs for accommodation, particularly when, as I know, the HSE has many sites rented which are now surplus to requirement.  In fairness to the lead man in the HSE in this area, he is seeking to rationalise the situation.  For example, now that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been set up, the Department of Health will have extra space in Hawkins House which we hope to make available to other agencies so they can give up their leases around the city.  We are seeking value for money.  If this is a case of waste, I will revert to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The real issue at the heart of this matter has not been referred to.  I refer to the requirement for a public private partnership contract.  The HSE in Carlow has adequate accommodation for its needs.  As the Deputy said, &euro;1,000 per day is being flushed away through the arrangement in question.  I have raised this directly in the House and was the first to do so through a parliamentary question last December.  The response received from the then Minister made it very clear she was not in a position to roll away from the public private partnership requirement.  I welcome the fact that the current Minister is willing to recognise the madness of the circumstances that obtain and to consider reconfiguring the use of existing HSE accommodation.  He should take the required steps to address the real problem at the kernel of this issue.</P>
        <P>Carlow Town Council has asked that the Comptroller and Auditor General take a direct interest in this matter.  Could the Minister check whether the Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out an investigation into this matter both in Carlow and elsewhere around the country?</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 26 together.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health, I will not stand over unsafe practice in any setting nor will I allow patients lives to be put at risk.  However, it is not my policy to close small hospitals or to diminish them in any way.  My priority is to ensure safe, high-quality care for patients, provided in the most appropriate location.</P>
        <P>The circumstances in Roscommon Hospital are a cause for serious concern.  It is clear that the acceptance of acutely ill patients in Roscommon as at present cannot continue and we need to find a safe solution for patients without delay.  The hospital has had significant problems recruiting NCHDs, to which I referred, and relies heavily on agency staff.</P>
        <P>Last week, I met a group from Roscommon which is concerned about the future of the hospital.  I asked senior clinicians from the HSE to attend that meeting.  I also asked the CEO of the Health Information and Quality Authority, Dr. Tracey Cooper, to attend to outline the authority&rsquo;s concerns about the hospital.</P>
        <P>The HSE has been working with local clinicians to finalise a plan to provide a satisfactory and safe level of service in the hospital.  I have asked the HSE to submit the plan to me by the end of this week.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland, including Roscommon Hospital, so that they will play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Local hospitals can and should be a vibrant element of local services, providing treatment and care at the appropriate level of complexity.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that services will continue to be provided at Roscommon Hospital, as part of the Galway University Hospital group.  The nature of the services will change but the hospital will always have a key role.  In particular, I expect to see an increased level of less-complex activity at the hospital for the benefit of the whole local community.</P>
        <P>With regard to Sligo General Hospital, I have confirmed it will continue to provide vital services.  I am monitoring closely the NCHD vacancies around the country.  As of now, the HSE has not expressed specific concerns regarding the NCHD situation in Sligo.</P>
        <P>We must be honest and straight.  What is currently available at Roscommon hospital is not safe.  I referred to fractures and orthopaedic surgeons.  There is no surgeon or cardiac staff to insert a stent.  There is no vascular surgeon or team to deal with multiple trauma.</P>
        <P>I want to see a vibrant 24-hour service available, through an urgent care centre, to the people who attend Roscommon hospital.  This centre should be staffed and the care should be delivered by doctors.  Hospital doctors should deliver the care from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  We are in talks with the local general practitioners to provide coverage from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  If one sprained one&rsquo;s ankle, one would go to the care centre to have an X-ray.  However, if one&rsquo;s ankle were broken in two places, one would need to go to Galway.  If one caught one&rsquo;s hand in the lawnmower and cut one&rsquo;s finger, one would go to the centre to get sutured but if one&rsquo;s hand were mangled one would clearly go to Galway.  The service was to be supplemented by an additional ambulance so there would be four ambulances covering Roscommon during the day and three at night.  I can guarantee that.  There will be extra paramedics available with a car to provide cover if all the ambulances are out of Roscommon at any given time.</P>
        <P>These are services that I can control and which I will deliver.  I do not control the NCHDs at present because I do not know the numbers, but when they become available I commit to their inclusion.  People will have an urgent care centre and a safe service.  The abiding message <Col N="311"/>I want to send from this House today is that I want to replace that which is not safe with something that is safe.</P>

	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is only getting used to his role and should not be distracted from what we have just heard.  I have just heard the Minister state Roscommon hospital is to become the home of an out-of-hours GP service from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  There is no other way to describe this; it is simply unacceptable.  The Minister and his party colleagues gave firm commitments to the people of Roscommon prior to the general election which have been restated line after line&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this week in one of the two local newspapers, the <i>Roscommon People</i>.  We are all familiar with the commitments that have been made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Question Time.  Could the Deputy ask a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question to ask.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask it.  A minute has elapsed and the Deputy&rsquo;s time is nearly up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is simple &mdash; will the Minister accept that what he is proposing for Roscommon General Hospital represents a significant downgrading of the services the people of Roscommon have treasured over many years and rightly expected to be reaffirmed, protected and guaranteed on the election of the new Government?  Does he accept that what he now proposes represents a significant diminution of those services that will have serious consequences?  May I say, as a representative&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is way over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of the people of Cavan and Monaghan that it most certainly reflects the same template that was introduced at the hospital in Monaghan, which template will ultimately lead to a further domino effect bringing about a loss of critical services?  The people of Roscommon should not tolerate it under any circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Members to respect the Chair.  The Deputy exceeded the time allowed.  A minute is allowed per supplementary question.  There are other Deputies in the Chamber.  The Minister has a minute to reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s supplementary question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="312"/>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that there is a diminution of services.  I have just explained to him that what is currently available is not safe.  It is not safe as adjudicated by the clinicians in the hospital, who will no longer stand over the circumstances that obtain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>They should make the service better rather than do away with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the Minister to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I can come to that in a moment.  I refer to the position on safety as adjudicated by HIQA and clinicians in my Department.  I am seeking to make the location safe and to ensure there is a 24-hour service.  It will be an enhanced service from a general practitioner&rsquo;s point of view because one will now be able to have X-rays at night, which was not the case heretofore.  The service will be enhanced because people will now know exactly what they are getting.  People will not turn up at the hospital having heart attacks in the false belief that they will be looked after in a comprehensive fashion.</P>
        <P>Let me quote some statistics for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has exceeded his time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Thirty patients per day pass through the accident and emergency department.  Fewer than one per day is transferred to Galway.  Some 25%&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>If one has a heart attack after 8 p.m. in Roscommon, one should not go to the local hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is over time.  I call Deputy Luke Flanagan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I first heard the Minister was getting into politics, I was overjoyed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please ask a question.  The Deputy is using up his time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LukeMingFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Luke &lsquo;Ming&rsquo; Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough.  Did the Minister know this place was not safe when he made a promise in a letter and confirmed that Fine Gael undertook in accordance with its policy on local hospitals to retain the emergency, surgical, medical and other health services at Roscommon hospital which were present on the formation of the 31st D&aacute;il and upgrade such services where feasible?  Did he know at the time the accident and emergency services at the hospital were not safe, as he claims they are now?  If he did, why did he make that promise?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The first paragraph of the letter which Deputy Flanagan quoted is correct.  The second paragraph states in the event of the accident and emergency unit being downgraded we are committed to reinstating a 24-7 service where feasible.  Let us have accuracy on the record of the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>You always throw in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is a straight one.  Was I aware?  No, I was not.  The Mallow report had not been published.  The Ennis report suggested a review needed to be done but no such review was done, so I was not aware.  I must preside over what is safe.  Apart from being a Minister, I am a doctor, and I will not preside over what is not safe.  I will not ignore expert <Col N="313"/>advice from colleagues in the hospital and in HIQA; I cannot do so and it would be absolutely irresponsible of me to do so.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a solution and I am saying to the people of Roscommon today that the solution I see is the one I have outlined, but it is contingent on me getting NCHDs which I may not be able to do.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make one important point.  People have spoken about the golden hour.  This is a concept from the 1970s and 1980s which has been superseded by much information, many reports and peer review journals which show one is better off, even if one is more than an hour away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;going to a high-volume centre.  One&rsquo;s chances of survival increase by 25% &mdash; one in four.  Let us do what is safe.  Let us be honest.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of what the Minister has just said on the golden hour, will he have an independent evaluation done on this?  Contrary evidence exists on the golden hour.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister ensure the HIQA terms of reference are amended to deal with the issue of travel times?  The single biggest issue for the people of County Roscommon is the fact that Galway University Hospital is in excess of an hour and a half away from them.  This is the specific concern they have which is not being addressed.</P>

	<P>Do the best you can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will certainly ask HIQA to look at its terms of reference with regard to travel time.  This is perfectly reasonable.  I have no issue whatsoever with getting independent verification on the golden hour because plenty of information exists and it has been superseded. <Col N="315"/> The figures are quite clear, with 25% better survival rates through going to a high-volume centre even if one must travel an hour and a half.</P>
        <P>Deputy Feighan asked me to elaborate on the letter.  I do not have the letter so I cannot do so.  However, with regard to control over HIQA, I wish to make an important point and I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to do so.  HIQA is the regulator of our health service.  It would be inappropriate, improper and very unwise of me to interfere with it.  Everyone in this House knows, and to the cost of the country, what happened when &mdash; I believe &mdash; a regulator was last interfered with, and this was the Financial Regulator.</P>

        <QRef>[17862/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>There is already a structured pathway in place for persons who have been awarded a basic medical qualification following completion of a course of study in one of the medical schools.</P>
        <P>The first year of postgraduate medical training, the intern year, is undertaken in a teaching university hospital following which doctors can apply to commence training in the area of medicine in which they hope to specialise.  They do this by either entering a basic specialist training programme and then a higher specialist training programme in the clinical specialties, public health, occupational health, microbiology, radiology and pathology or by entering a general practice training programme.</P>
        <P>Basic specialist training, which generally takes two years to complete, involves working in a series of senior house officer posts in supervised clinical settings, which include structured training opportunities.  Upon successful completion of their basic specialist training, doctors are eligible to apply for higher specialist training.  However, as these posts are very competitive many doctors work as registrars, under the supervision of a consultant, for a year or two before progressing to higher specialist training.</P>
        <P>Higher specialist training, at specialist registrar level, takes four to seven years and is overseen by the relevant postgraduate training body.  It involves rotating through a number of <Col N="316"/>supervised training posts across the breadth of the relevant specialty, undertaking in-house and external training activities and sitting a number of postgraduate training body membership examinations in that specialty.</P>
        <P>Doctors who have successfully completed their higher specialist training are entitled to registration in the specialist division of the register of medical practitioners and are eligible to apply for a consultant post in their specialty.</P>
        <P>Doctors who wish to become general practitioners must complete a GP training programme following completion of the intern year.  This consists of two years at senior house officer level in supervised clinical posts, followed by two years at GP registrar level in a GP training practice.  Formal training opportunities are provided throughout and trainees must sit the general practice membership examination.</P>
        <P>I have asked my Department to consider the scope for the creation of a new hospital specialist grade which would make for a more appropriate and sustainable model of service provision.  While consideration is at an early stage, it is envisaged that this would be a non-training post filled by doctors who have completed specialist training.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</i></P>
        <P>In addition, I am setting up a group to carry out an immediate review of career structures and paths for non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, posts.  This group, which will include the Department, the training colleges and other key stakeholders, will examine issues such as designation of training posts, career structures for NCHD service posts and working hours and conditions and is aiming to complete its work by the autumn.  We will endeavour to match undergraduate numbers to consultants and GP numbers required and provide a clear career path.</P>

	<P>I am leaving the Chamber in disgust at Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s comment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled the question because this topic will continue to crop up until an adequate structure is put in place.  The inadequacy of the structure is clear from the continuing shortages we hear about in particular disciplines.  Does the Minister believe the number of consultants is sufficient and the career path for medics is adequate to enable them to reach a point at which they are appointed consultants?</P>
        <P>The Minister highlighted a number of issues related to Roscommon hospital.  This week, I spoke to a person who is seeking admission to one of the large teaching hospitals.  When I spoke to someone in the hospital in question I was informed that admissions, including serious cases, are being repeatedly rescheduled.  When a resource is inadequate nationwide it has a knock-on effect.  It is not a question of how quickly one can travel from one hospital to another.  If the career path is not adequate and there are too few consultants, a logjam develops in the large hospitals and no one passes through the system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has one minute to reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept everything the Deputy said.  I did not reach the end of my reply owing to time restrictions.  I will not bother with the script and instead tell the Deputy what is the position.  I am pleased that as a result of the terrible dark cloud of the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors, the Medical Council and colleges have come forward and co-operated in an effort to have the issue resolved.  Arising out of this, I have spoken to their representatives about creating a forum.  I want to report by the autumn on how we will address manpower issues from the day a person starts as a medical student to the day he or she retires as a specialist or general practitioner.  We need to create clear career paths and treat people with dignity.  We should create a specialist position.  At present, one in four of those who complete their specialist registrar training become consultants because jobs are available for them, while three out of four become deskilled and start to go backwards or leave the country because jobs are not available for them.</P>
        <P>People have referred to indenture.  It costs nearly &euro;1 million to get someone to specialist registrar level at the end of training.  For this reason, I want to create a new post of specialist who will be clinically autonomous, will only report to the clinical director and will ultimately become a full consultant.  We should acknowledge that he or she has the clinical acumen, training and experience to work as an autonomous clinician.  This will provide a clear career path and address much of the shortage being experienced in our hospitals.</P>

I must deal with Question Time as provided for in Standing Orders.  The Minister has two minutes to answer a question and four minutes are available for supplementary questions.  That is the position as laid out before me.  The replies supplied to Ministers are much too long and are over-running the two minutes available.  As a result, I am required to interrupt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 31, 40, 49, 50, 52 and 60 together.</P>
        <P>It is not my wish to reduce the level of any service, including patient transport.  However the country is facing an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.  This is an inescapable reality.  The HSE must live within its budget and must prioritise its services accordingly.  We must examine the way services are being delivered, make sure they are safe, prioritise services that will meet clear clinical needs and reallocate resources accordingly.</P>
        <P>The national ambulance service provides pre-hospital emergency care and emergency and some non-emergency patient transport.  Clearly the priority is emergency care, including transporting sick patients between hospitals.  The HSE also provides non-urgent care using either ambulances or taxis.  Non-emergency transport comprises inter-hospital transfers, patient transport from home to health facility and from health facility to home.  It includes both HSE and private transport providers.  There must be a clear national approach to non-emergency transport.  This is a key point.</P>
        <P>This type of expenditure from public moneys must be able to stand up to scrutiny in the new economic reality.  There must be a consistent approach across the country instead of the differing practices in place now.  Scarce resources for emergency transport cannot continue to be expended on non-emergency transport without clear criteria in place based on clinical need.  Supported by my Department and HIQA, the national ambulance service is working to improve the management and integration of its services.  This includes the development of standard national criteria on non-emergency patient transport which will be announced shortly.  There are a number of systems of support in place for cancer patients who have to travel for treatment and these arrangements will continue on the same basis as previously.</P>
        <P>The national ambulance service has undergone significant change to ensure quality, safety and value for money.  In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop. These developments are in the best interests of patients and are a key part of the Government&rsquo;s work to ensure high quality emergency care.</P>

	<P>I am certain Deputy Martin will be pleased that I was present to take the opportunity to speak.</P>
        <P>This threatened cut was first revealed by me, interestingly, when we obtained a copy of a letter sent by the Health Service Executive ambulance management to hospitals in the west region stating that from 1 July transport services for people requiring dialysis and cancer care supports and services would be stopped.  This concerned the whole west region, from the Cork-Kerry border all the way to Inishowen in County Donegal.  This threat has caused serious concern.  We were told subsequently that it would not be implemented and we are now told there is a review.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on what review is in train.  Will he have the final say in the matter?</P><Col N="321"/>
        <P>The Minister has indicated his disposition towards HIQA, which must operate with certain terms and conditions applying to its remit.  It is important to remind him of his public statement that he will take back responsibility for the health service and is not abrogating his responsibility, as the previous Minister did, in relation to the Health Service Executive.  I welcome that statement and encourage him in that respect.  If that is the case, does he agree with the view expressed by the director of operations for HSE west, Mr. John Hennessy, when he referred to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>With respect, I am not quoting.  Mr. Hennessy referred to the indiscriminate transport arrangements which applied heretofore.  Does the Minister agree with him?

      <Speaker pid="ThomasPringle"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas Pringle</NameTxt>
	<P>Donegal South-West is also in the north west.  It is my information that this issue arose from the separation of the ambulance and hospital services that took place within the HSE.  It is an indication of the dysfunctional way the HSE works.  The separation of budgets between community care and hospital care causes all this friction and huge distress for patients throughout the country.  It is vital that these issues do not arise again and I ask the Minister to ensure they do not.  The distress it causes for very ill dialysis and cancer patients is unacceptable.  Patients are entitled to transport and it should be provided regardless of empire building or empire protection within the ambulance service and the hospital service.</P>

	<P>The transport has not stopped.  People who need transport for dialysis and cancer services get it.</P>

	<P>The intent was there.  I will send the Minister a copy of the letter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to point out, notwithstanding the interruptions, that there has been huge inconsistency in the transport arrangements across this island.  I must concur with Deputy Pringle&rsquo;s comments.  There is a lack of uniformity, although the HSE was supposed to result in uniformity of approach and of care for 4.4 million people, or 4.2 million as it was at the time.  There are totally different criteria in the west of Ireland from those on the east coast.  While people are entitled in the west, they are not entitled in the east.</P>
        <P>We must make a decision on the basis of having so little money.  We can argue why that is the case but that is the reality we face.  Are we going to meet expectation or are we going to meet need?  My view is that we will do damned well to meet need and need is what we should focus on &mdash; the needs of those who require this transport and who do not have their own transport because they do not have the income or means.  It is a fact that there are many people in the west who currently have their own transport and drive to get dialysis.  Furthermore, we are not just discussing dialysis and cancer patients in this context but a range of services that are used to bring people to health facilities.  We need clear guidelines and criteria that are fair and transparent.  I do not believe that has been the case in HSE west and there is an acknowledgement of that on its part.  That is what this review is about.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 32 to 34, inclusive, 37, 39, 43, 59 and 62 together.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner.  In particular I wish to ensure that as many services as possible can be provided safely in smaller, local hospitals.  I have also made it clear that patient safety must be the overriding priority.  I want patients to be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.</P><Col N="324"/>
         <P>The configuration of services is constantly reviewed and from time to time rearranged to improve access and quality of service and minimise risk to patients.  This programme of realignment of services has received recent impetus from HIQA on the need to implement the recommendations from the Ennis and Mallow reports.  The reports deal in particular with the type of services that can safely be provided in smaller hospitals and the structures required for good governance and accountability.  The HSE must ensure that this happens and I will be monitoring the situation closely in conjunction with HIQA.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>The HSE has now put an implementation team in place to ensure that the recommendations of both the Ennis and Mallow reports are implemented in a speedy, systematic and consistent manner and I have asked for regular progress reports on this important initiative.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland so that they play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Patients should only have to travel to the larger hospitals for more complex services.  The HIQA reports are entirely in keeping with this approach.  I can assure the public that no hospitals will close, regardless of the difficult economic situation we find ourselves in.  However, ongoing reform of the system will require some changes in how care is delivered in some locations across our health system.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of concerns about some hospitals in advance of the next rotation of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs.  The shortage of suitable NCHDs is an issue worldwide.  In this context I am working with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure the filling of as many as possible of some 475 NCHD posts which are due to be filled from 11 July 2011.  The HSE conducted an extensive recruitment drive in India and Pakistan in recent months and succeeded in identifying 439 potential candidates for NCHD positions in Ireland.  I have held meetings involving my Department, the Medical Council, medical training bodies and the HSE with a view to identifying measures to facilitate the appointment of suitably qualified doctors from abroad.  Drafting of a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, to enable the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period, is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputies that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure the ongoing safe delivery of service in hospitals and in emergency departments in particular.  I am advised that while significant staffing problems remain at both SHO and registrar level in emergency medicine, it is anticipated that increasing the number of staff available to general surgery and general medicine will assist in the delivery and support of emergency department services.  In this context, the HSE is focusing on addressing particular emergency department staffing issues in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, the Midlands Regional Hospitals at Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise and Naas General Hospital.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this and other initiatives, it is unlikely that all NCHD vacancies can be filled by 11 July.  Hospital management is working with clinical directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented, if required, to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimised and that safe delivery of hospital services is assured.  Whatever happens I will not stand over unsafe care.  Guarding against unsafe care must be the overriding principle driving all the actions taken in terms of clinical service provision and any changes required in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianStanley"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Stanley</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the downgrading of hospitals, there is huge anxiety about small and large rural hospitals.  What defines a small rural hospital?  My local hospital in Port<Col N="325"/>laoise treated 41,000 emergency cases, so I ask the Minister not to count it as one.  Will the Minister contact the HSE today and ask it not to pull acute surgery services in such hospitals throughout the country until the recruitment process has been completed?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraigMacLochlainn"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is at your discretion, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.  Deputy Cowen should proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryCowen"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said the first demand would be in the busier hospitals and that he is allocating them to the most pressing need.  The Minister therefore has a list of those that are most pressing with regard to the 221 that have been filled and the 60 that are coming.  Can the Minister tell us what is at the bottom of the list?  What hospitals will not get their quota if they are not there before 11 July?  The Minister also said contingency plans would be put in place.  What contingency plan will there be for them?  Can the Minister place on the public record or on a website or can he inform the relevant authorities what contingency systems will be in place?  What can the public expect on 11 July?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to both questions is that there are a number of contingency plans contingent on the amount of NCHDs we have.  I cannot say what they are until I know what that figure is.  I am reliably informed that I will have a better idea at 4 p.m. tomorrow but I will have an even better one towards the end of next week.  I realise people like to know what is happening in advance but I do not know and nobody can know because we do not know how many people will land here.  We can only judge by the success we have had to date and see how many more people will apply for visas next week and book an aircraft to come here.  I believe the vast majority of the 424 who have been identified as suitable and who arrive will remain here and will be found to be suitable.  I am not as convinced about the 65 people who have applied to sit the old examination because they have not been screened and I have no idea what the pass rate will be.</P>
        <P>I accept that this causes anxiety for people, particularly in the smaller hospitals.  The rationale behind the need of bigger regional hospitals having to be addressed is that hospitals such as <Col N="326"/>those in Limerick and Letterkenny must serve huge populations and other hospitals.  They must be a priority.</P>

      <sTitle>Passport Applications</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter.  This is the third year in a row that there are thousands of people waiting for passports at this time of the year.  They are unsure whether they will be able to travel.  These are people who applied in time and were thorough and organised in making their application but they either get their passports at the last minute or cannot contact the Passport Office.  If they try to contact the Passport Office by telephone they are left hanging on for hours or, in some cases, cut off.  They have no method of following up their applications.</P>
        <P>I do not speak on behalf of people who are disorganised or apply for a passport a few hours before they are due to travel.  Until three years ago, Members of the Oireachtas could make applications on behalf of their constituents and have their passports in a few days.  I am not asking to have that facility restored.  It would not be needed if the service was as efficient as it should be.  This is not the case.</P>
        <P>Citizens travel for business and family reasons, for holidays and, all too often, for work.  They travel at all times of the year but particularly at this time.  In the last few hours two queries came to my office.  Two young people have got jobs abroad and applied for their passports at the beginning of June.  One expects to fly to Singapore this weekend to take up a job there.  Although he applied for his passport at the beginning of June he is unable to get in contact <Col N="327"/>with the Passport Office or to find out if his passport will be available in time.  They are both in trepidation.  They fear they may have to cancel their flights and lose their job opportunities.</P>
        <P>There are two passport offices in the country, one in Dublin and one in Cork.  The people of the western seaboard are especially disadvantaged in this regard.  They apply in plenty of time but then do not hear from the Passport Office, cannot contact anyone and are left wondering if they will have their passport in time.  They have to come to Dublin, join a queue in the Passport Office and often even wait overnight because they are told to collect the passport the following day.  This is not good enough.  Could there not be a facility somewhere in the west?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste on this issue a number of weeks ago.  He replied that the current demand for passports is unprecedented and that the commentary on some of the delays is inaccurate or overstated.  Like every Deputy in the House, I know the accounts of delays are neither overstated nor inaccurate.  I plead with the Minister to address this issue urgently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony for raising this important issue.  I know he has a sustained interest in the issue.  He has raised it a number of times.  The matter is of interest to many rural Deputies.</P>
        <P>There are currently 52,712 passport applications in the system being processed across the passport offices in Molesworth Street, Balbriggan, Cork and London. This figure has been reduced by approximately 4,000 over the past week.  The number of applications received so far this year shows an increase in demand of 10% in comparison to this time in 2009.  The figures for 2010 are not a reliable comparison due to the impact of last year&rsquo;s industrial action.  Whereas the exact reason for this increase in demand is unclear, it is noticeable that passport applications for children and passports for the over 65s are running at higher than the same period in the last few years.  Discussions with customers have also suggested that much of the demand relates to last minute travel plans made for holiday reasons.</P>
        <P>The Passport Service received an average of 3,600 explications per day last week which is down from the recent previous average of over 4,000 applications per day.  This reduction provides some evidence that passport demand is beginning to level off, in which case it is expected that the number of applications in the system will decrease over the coming weeks.  However, this reduction is still not reflected in the unprecedented demand for passports at short notice.</P>
        <P>The Passport Service is currently receiving 350 people per day on average coming to the public office seeking passports within a period of less than ten days.  On 27 June, over 400 people submitted applications for a short notice service at the public office in Molesworth Street alone.  In the context of these very large numbers of customers using the public counter service, it is not always possible, despite the best efforts of the Passport Office staff to be of assistance and to accommodate all requests for a short notice service.  Citizens are advised that the public counter services should only be used in cases of genuine emergency.  Priority at the public counters will be given to those who have a necessity to travel for reasons of family emergency, that is, necessitated by the death, illness or welfare of a family member.</P>
        <P>It should also be stressed that to protect the integrity of the system and the quality of the passport, the Passport Service cannot provide standard passports within a single day.  The shortest turnaround time available is three working days for applications received over the public counter, accompanied by proof of travel, other than in cases of genuine emergency.</P>
        <P>There has been some media commentary on the scale of the delays and some of this has been inaccurate, notwithstanding what Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony says.  Whereas it is very much regretted that it is currently taking up to 15 working days to process applications submitted through <Col N="328"/>Passport Express, this represents a delay of five working days and not the many weeks suggested by some media commentators.  Equally, over 70% of applications submitted on the island come through the express services and, accordingly, the number of citizens experiencing weeks of delay has also been overstated in places.  On the basis of current processing I am confident that this turnaround time will be reduced over the coming weeks and will return to normal levels.</P>
        <P>Priority will continue to be given to applications made through the Passport Express service and Irish-based customers are strongly encouraged to use that service.  It is regrettable that, due to the overwhelming number of applications, those submitted through other channels, that is, through the ordinary post system or from Ireland&rsquo;s overseas missions, etc., are currently taking over six weeks to be processed.  During the peak summer period, application processing times for these services can lengthen.</P>
        <P>Notice of the current extended turnaround time and its likely duration has been published on the Passport Service website, <i>www.passport.ie</i>.  The Passport Office has also informed An Post so that customers can be advised of the situation at the point of application.</P>
        <P>In January, a series of changes to passport application procedures for first time adult applicants and those reporting passports lost or stolen was introduced.  The changes, which were introduced to combat increasing number of fraudulently obtained passports, required that applicants in these categories submit additional documentary evidence to establish identity and entitlement to an Irish passport.  The additional documents sought include forms of photo-identification, proof of use of the name of the applicant and proof of residence at the applicant&rsquo;s address.  Particularly in the light of recent high profile international incidents relating to passport fraud, the measures were introduced to protect the integrity and international reputation of the Irish passport.  Whereas these new measures have had some impact on the time to process applications, the impact primarily relates to only a small subset of the overall application demand.  Additionally, I should stress that they have been implemented with a degree of common sense balanced with the overall need to protect against identity theft and passport fraud.</P>
        <P>From the beginning of April the Department took on additional temporary staff to work in the Passport Service. There are now 85 additional temporary staff in place, and they have been trained in passport processing.  In conjunction with seasonal overtime, I expect the Passport Service to be in a position to bring return times back to normal levels over the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>I again express my regret at the delays being experienced by customers of the Passport Service and would strongly appeal to the public to assist the Passport Service by checking the validity of their passports before making bookings to travel abroad.  A valid passport should be the first item on any check-list when considering foreign travel</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding that, I will bring the points raised and suggestions made by Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not present to clarify the situation, which I raised this morning on the Order of Business.  I pointed out that the figures he had outlined in the Bill published this morning were unconstitutional.  The figure of 152 Deputies, which the legislation would allow, would be unconstitutional in light of the preliminary census figures published by the Central Statistics Office.  The Minister has since admitted his error and is now talking about a minimum number of 153 Deputies.  I am surprised the <Col N="329"/>Minister did not wait and publish the Bill when the CSO figures had been published.  He would then have got his figures right.</P>
      
        <P>According to the preliminary census figures, the current ratio of TDs to population is 1:27,598.  The Constitution provides for a ratio of between 1:20,000 and 1:30,000.  The ratio for the 2007 election following the 2006 census was 1:25,541.  We are representing more people than we did following the 2007 election.  The total number of Members has been 166 since the 1981 election when 1,213,052 fewer people lived in the State.  Following that election there was one TD for every 20,290 people in the country.  Our representative duties have increased significantly.</P>

        <P>The Electoral Acts 2007 and 2009 provided that the constituency commission would set the number of TDs within a range of 164 to 168.  This time the Minister proposes in his Bill to give the new commission a range of 152 to 160.  That gives the commission massive leeway.  The limit on the number of TDs is supposed to be set by law, not by an external body to whom the function is delegated.  I have my doubts about that aspect of the legislation.  We do not know that the commission will opt for the upper end of the range.  The Minister is giving the commission a great deal of leeway and he is coming close to the line because if the number of Members is set at 153, he will come close to breaching the constitutional ratio of 1:30,000.  The census website highlights that between 2009 and 2010 the population increased by 20,000.  Our population is increasing annually and if the Minister presses ahead with this legislation and the number of TDs is set at 153 for the next election, it could quickly become unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>He needs to think this through because he is doing this for the wrong reasons.  He is talking about political reform but reducing the number of TDs will mean fewer Members to hold the Government accountable or to represent the people, which will diminish our democracy.  At the same time, he proposes to get rid of the Seanad, the safety net we have under our bicameral system.  He will cut the Seanad and the number of TDs, which will mean less accountability and less democracy.  That is not political reform.  He has not thought this through and he is diminishing our democracy.  He needs to go back to the drawing board.  What is the updated position?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government for raising the issue.  She has an interest in this and she has expertise in the area, on which I compliment her.</P>
        <P>The Minister published the Electoral (Amendment) Bill earlier and it contains three important electoral reforms.  It amends the terms of reference of a constituency commission in section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 by providing that the number of members of the D&aacute;il, subject to the relevant provisions of the Constitution, shall be not less than 152 and not more than 160.  It provides for an amendment to be made to section 39(2) of the Electoral Act 1992 to provide that the writ for a D&aacute;il by-election shall be issued within six months of the vacancy occurring and it provides for amendments to the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for a reduction in the spending limit at a presidential election from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;750,000 and for a reduction in the maximum amount that can be reimbursed to a candidate at a presidential election from &euro;260,000 to &euro;200,000.</P>
        <P>While the provisions in the Bill will alter the terms of reference of a constituency commission, the overriding constitutional provisions relating to the number of Members of the D&aacute;il and equality of representation will remain unchanged.  Article 16.2.2&deg; of the Constitution provides that D&aacute;il representation &ldquo;shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.&rdquo;  Article 16.2.3&deg; of the Constitution provides that, &ldquo;The ratio between the number of members <Col N="330"/>to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The CSO published preliminary results from the 2011 census earlier and the results show an increase in the population to more than 4.5 million.  In applying the constitutional provisions to this new population figure, the minimum number of TDs that can be recommended by a constituency commission, subject to enactment of the Bill by the Oireachtas, will be 153, while the maximum number will be 160.</P>
        <P>A number of commitments are made in the programme for Government in the electoral reform area.  These include significantly reducing the size of the Oireachtas and reducing the number of TDs following the publication of the 2011 census of population.  The proposals in the Bill regarding the terms of reference of a constituency commission respond to this commitment.  The Minister is required by law to establish a constituency commission to review D&aacute;il and European Parliament constituencies upon the publication of preliminary census results by the CSO.  This legal obligation on the Minister presents an opportunity to ensure the reduction in the number of Members of the D&aacute;il can have effect as early as possible.  The Minister indicated earlier that he will set in train the establishment of a constituency commission, which will report within three months of publication of the final census results, due in March 2012.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny.</P>
        <P>Priory Hall is a residential complex of 187 units on the new main street linking Clongriffin and Belmayne in Dublin 13 in the vast new north fringe residential district in Dublin North-East.  The estate originally had a mixture of private purchasers, private tenants, city council tenants and residents who moved in through the city council&rsquo;s rental accommodation and affordable housing schemes.</P>
        <P>I have raised the critical fire safety and building standard problems and disasters of Priory Hall at least a dozen times in this and the previous D&aacute;il in various ways, including on the Order of Business.  Our fire chief, Hugh O&rsquo;Neill, served a fire safety notice under the Fire Safety Acts on Coalport Ltd., which built Priory Hall, on 4 September 2009.  In this notice, the north and south blocks of Priory Hall, which comprises the entire estate, were described as a &ldquo;potentially dangerous building&rdquo; and the fire chief ordered an urgent programme of fire safety remedial measures for the estate to make it safe to live in.  In December 2009, Dublin City Council moved its own tenants out for their own safety.</P>
        <P>In April last at the Dublin District Court, a director of Coalport Ltd., Mr. Tom McFeely, received a six-month suspended sentence and a maximum &euro;3,000 fine and his former partner, Mr. Laurence O&rsquo;Mahoney, received a one-month suspended sentence and a &euro;1,000 fine for fire safety notice offences at Priory Hall.  However, we do not know what conditions, if any, were attached to these suspended sentences or whether Dublin City Council and, in turn, the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department have monitored compliance.  Coalport Ltd. and Mr. McFeely, the developer, have also been referred to the courts regarding breaches of the planning law at Priory Hall.  The latest such referral occurred on 14 June.  Given the serious breaches concerned, can the Minister of State provide residents with a full update on current and future planning enforcement proceedings?</P>
        <P>Many outstanding questions relating to Priory Hall need to be addressed by the city council and the Minister of State.  The excellent residents&rsquo; committee led by Ms Sin&eacute;ad Power and others have still not been told what works have been completed and certified on the building <Col N="331"/>to ensure that it finally complies with all fire safety regulations and building standards and they still do not know if they are safe at night and living in a safe building.  Concerns have also been expressed by many residents about the quality of the works being carried out.</P>
        <P>I understand that Dublin City Council has undertaken an investigation into the alleged breaches of the Building Control Acts at Priory Hall through a company called Hayes Higgins Partnership but we still do not have a report from it.  The residents of Priory Hall want to know why Dublin City Council did not insist that the developers in question put a bond in place which could now be used for all remediation and completion works at the complex.  They are deeply frustrated and I hope the Minister of State will ensure Dublin City Council will get to grips with this.  He knows the area well and he is welcome to visit us in Dublin North-East.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what my colleague said.  The city council recently commissioned Hayes Higgins Partnership, consulting engineers, to carry out an investigation into defects in the construction of Priory Hall.  This investigation is complete and I call on the council to publish the report by Hayes Higgins Partnership in the public interest.  The case against Mr. McFeely and Mr. O&rsquo;Mahoney for breaches of fire regulations was heard in the District Court on 4 April.  Mr. McFeely received a &euro;3,000 fine and a six-month suspended sentence and Mr. O&rsquo;Mahoney received a &euro;1,000 fine and a one-month suspended sentence.  Since then there has been a spate of fires in the dumping area used by the building company, which is an unsecured area situated behind hoarding at the back of the development.  I am advised by constituents that there were three fires in total, two of which Dublin Fire Brigade and the Garda attended and one which residents put out themselves.  Two members of the residents&rsquo; committee advised me that they reported the last fire incident to Coolock Garda station.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council&rsquo;s chief fire officer directed that both underground car parks in the development be taken out of use in December 2009 due to flooding.  The car parks remain closed to date, with the result that there is a high volume of vehicles on the road outside the apartment blocks, many of which are parked in front of the hoarding that fronts the builder&rsquo;s dumping area, thus compounding the risk of any fire spreading and of explosions from the vehicles&rsquo; petrol tanks.  My grave concern is that if the hoarding was to catch fire again, the fire could spread to the north and south blocks of the development and the petrol could ignite the fire further.  We would be faced with casualties that could be avoided.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I asked Dublin City Council whether the three fires in April constituted a breach of the developers&rsquo; suspended sentences and I was advised by the council&rsquo;s law agent that any complaints on possible breaches should be communicated to the superintendent of the local Garda station.  On 16 June, I wrote to the Garda superintendent in Coolock, asking him to investigate the position in Priory Hall with a view to bringing the matter back before the court if the fires constitute breaches of the suspended sentences, as I believe they do.  It would seem to me that if the position remains the same in this development, it is only a matter of time before there is a serious incident.  I ask the Minister to intervene with Dublin City Council to have this absolute nightmare for residents, which has been going on for years, brought to a conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would like to thank Deputy Broughan and Deputy Kenny for raising this important matter.  I know they have long-standing interests in this ongoing issue.</P>
        <P>The Government is acutely aware of the difficult and distressing situations faced by many homeowners and tenants today, who through no fault of their own, are dealing with the consequences of unfinished estates, pyrite problems and other building defects.  Specific responsi<Col N="332"/>bility for the planning and delivery of the north fringe development rests with the local authorities involved, namely, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The north fringe framework development plan, which was prepared by Dublin City Council in 2000, sets out the objectives for the area, the site context and the urban design framework.  The plan emphasises the need for a quality bus service and the provision of community facilities, including schools, a library, sports facilities and public spaces, which will serve the anticipated 30,000 people who will ultimately live in the area.</P>
        <P>Planning permissions in the north fringe have been granted in line with the framework plan.  Under planning legislation, the decision on whether to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority in the first instance, in this case Dublin City Council, and for An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the case of an appeal.  I understand that planning permission for mixed use development was granted by the Council on 19 November 2003, subject to a number of conditions.  It is clearly the responsibility of the developer to implement planning permission and to comply with any conditions attaching to that permission.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of planning control is a matter for the council which can take action, <i>inter alia, </i>where the terms of a permission have not been met.  I understand that there are ongoing legal proceedings being taken by Dublin City Council regarding compliance with this permission.  I have no role in the matter.</P>
        <P>In addition, the national building regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of new buildings, including houses, extensions and material alterations and certain changes of use of existing buildings.  The related technical guidance documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with the regulations.  Compliance with the regulations is the responsibility of the owner or builder of a building.  Enforcement of the regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities, which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.  Where building defects occur, their remediation is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder&rsquo;s insurers, in line with any contractual arrangements agreed between the parties.  The general position regarding the use of pyrite in house construction has been set out comprehensively in replies to previous parliamentary questions, most recently on 26 May 2011.</P>
        <P>The remediation of homes affected by pyrite is also a matter for the parties concerned, and enforcement is essentially a civil matter.  I understand that following civil proceedings regarding homes affected by pyrite in north Dublin, a final settlement was reached and a trust fund established by the developer concerned.  In the case of James Elliott Construction Limited <i>v</i>  Irish Asphalt Limited, the judgment issued on 25 May 2011 found Irish Asphalt Limited liable for the supply of defective filler material which was not fit for purpose.</P>
        <P>Since taking up office, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has clearly signalled that consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings is a priority matter.  In this regard, the Minister is currently considering proposals to reform the building control system.  These proposals include the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings demonstrating that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met; more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity; standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions; and measures for the support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>The Minister is determined to strengthen the building control system in order to ensure that problems currently being experienced are not repeated.  The Deputies raised a number of important issues this evening, and I will request the Minister to raise them with Dublin City Council and ascertain the current position.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterMathews"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Mathews</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be delighted to extend the time available, because we are running ahead of schedule.  I will allocate ten minutes between the three Deputies.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That is excellent, thank you.  We will be as brief as possible.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Drug Treatment Court is a very interesting project.  It was established in my constituency of Dublin Central in 2001 as a pilot project.  The purpose of the project was to look at people who were abusing drugs, ending up in court and receiving a conviction, and to put in place an alternative mechanism for dealing with them rather than sending them to prison.  It was a restorative justice mechanism and it came under the auspices of the Courts Service.  A specific judge was appointed to deal with it.  It was an excellent idea and it has operated over the last ten years in one local electoral area in the north inner city.</P>
        <P>The project has had varying degrees of effectiveness, but once the flurry of activity, enthusiasm and publicity died down following its establishment, it was left to its own devices.  I do not think it achieved as much as it could.  A review has been carried out over the last year and some structural proposals have been made, namely, that it would be transferred from the Courts Service directly to the clerk and deputy clerk of the District Court and Circuit Court.  Instead of the Courts Service having responsibility, it would chair an advisory committee that would consist of all the relevant stakeholders, including the Garda, the HSE, the City of Dublin VEC, the Probation Service and the Courts Service itself.</P>
        <P>While the proposals are welcome, the issue goes much further.  There is a need for much greater awareness of the court in the communities affected by the drugs scourge.  I believe that the local drugs task force should be involved, which has not occurred to date, even though the force was involved in the court&rsquo;s establishment in the first instance.  Likewise, the Judiciary seems to be ignorant of the sanction and greater awareness is required here.  The legal profession needs to be more aware as well, so that this can be part of the way lawyers handle cases with their clients.  It seems that the north inner city is far too restrictive an area for the court to operate efficiently, and we need to extend it to a broader catchment area.</P>
        <P>With a new Government, we should be looking at as many alternative sanctions to imprisonment as possible.  The prison population has doubled since the drugs court was established.  We should be going in the opposite direction, but we have been regressing.  We should be examining restorative justice, community service orders and the alternative approach.  The Minster should consult widely with all the relevant stakeholders, especially the public representatives who are deeply involved in their communities and are concerned with these problems.  The Minister should be doing so with a view to mainstreaming the project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RobertDowds"><NameTxt>Deputy Robert Dowds</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be arguing for an extension of the area of the operation of the Drug Treatment Court to Dublin 10, Ballyfermot and Dublin 22, Clondalkin.  As Deputy Costello said, the Drug Treatment Court operates only in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city.  I wish to quote the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the then Deputy Dermot Ahern who in a review published by him in 2010 stated:</P><Col N="334"/>
        <P LI="1">Participants who engage with the drug treatment programme have reduced rates of recidivism and improved health, education and social skills, which impact positively on the participants and the community.  However, the review also confirmed that the DTC, as currently operating, is not dealing with sufficient numbers of participants and programme completion rates are low.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am therefore asking the Minister for Justice and Equality to extend the operation of the Drug Treatment Court to Dublin 10 and Dublin 22, two areas of the city close to each other and which unfortunately have serious drugs problems.  From talking to both the Garda and staff of the Drug Treatment Court it is clear that the crime level of those involved in the court drops steeply.</P>
        <P>I spoke to staff in the Drug Treatment Court a few weeks ago, I was surprised to hear that even though the programme has the capacity to take on 100 candidates, it only had 35 at that point and could easily deal with more people.  Extending the operation to Dublin 10 and Dublin 22, and perhaps other areas would provide more suitable candidates because not everybody who comes before the courts on drug charges is a suitable candidate for rehabilitation.  For the many who are suitable it is a much better way of dealing with them.  By expanding the operation of the Drug Treatment Court to these districts the Minister would be helping to tackle a growing problem in this city.</P>
        <P>It is very clear that resources are not currently being used efficiently due to the geographical restrictions on the Drug Treatment Court.  It costs the State approximately &euro;77,200 per prisoner per year to detain a person in prison.  If one compares that cost with the cost of placing someone in the Drug Treatment Court programme at less than a fifth of that figure, there is the potential to make considerable savings to the Exchequer &mdash; which we are all being asked to do at present &mdash; while placing drug addicts in a programme that gives them the opportunity to escape the cycle of drugs and crime into which they have fallen, and which imprisonment will almost certainly not solve due to the power of the addiction they are under.  This is a no-brainer.</P>
        <P>We must move to tackle the inefficient use of resources currently occurring due to the geographical restrictions on the work of the Drug Treatment Court programme.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue thoroughly and to give me a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer on whether he will expand the geographical area of the court, to include the areas we have suggested or indeed elsewhere.  Should the Minister intend to proceed with this, will he give me a timeframe for when this will occur?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelConaghan"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Conaghan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Deputies Costello and Dowds for sharing their time.  The recent UN report on drug related deaths is a very stark warning based on evidence of the number of drug related deaths.  Ireland is at twice the EU average for drug related deaths.  These shocking statistics must prompt us to look again at strategies and ways of tackling the situation, to which the UN report draws attention.</P>
        <P>I too believe, like my colleagues and many other Members, that the Drug Treatment Court programme can be a key part of such a strategy.  There are short and straightforward explanations as to how the strategy works but its simplicity should not belie its vast potential.  The Drug Treatment Court programme is currently under-used and under-valued.  We believe that the strategy and the scheme offers real opportunities to avoid the cycle of drug addiction, crime and imprisonment and in its place, those who are selected to participate learn new strategies and new skills and are offered opportunities, perhaps leading to job opportunities and breaking the cycle and living clean.  It has a great deal to commend it.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>We are appealing to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to look at the geography of where the scheme operates and to extend the scheme and work towards including a broader geographic part of the city in it.  We ask him to use the scheme, with all its potential, because like the other Deputies, I believe that the proper rolling out of the scheme can save the lives of young people and help to break the cycle of drug related deaths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Joe Costello, Robert Dowds and Michael Conaghan for raising this important issue.  I understand the replies are in transit.  I offer my apologies for any delay.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and, Equality, I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter, in which they all have a long-term interest.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under our National Drugs Strategy (interim) 2009-2016.  Responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the NDS is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.</P>
        <P>The strategy seeks to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs in a comprehensive and integrated way through a pillar-based approach of drug supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research measures.  Drug treatment courts can have a role to play in both the treatment and rehabilitation of offenders and by extension can impact positively in the fight against crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government believes that the actions set out in the strategy continue to facilitate a planned and monitored approach to achieving the overall strategic objective and aims of our drug policy.  The current drugs strategy is an interim one as work, which is being overseen under the remit of the Department of Health, is well under way in the development of a new combined policy framework which will address both the issues of alcohol and illicit drugs in a new combined policy framework.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Drug Treatment Court, which originally operated on a pilot basis in the north inner city of Dublin, operates in Dublin 1, 7 and parts of Dublin 3.  The court uses a multidisciplinary approach involving staff from a range of agencies charged with dealing with various aspects of the problem of drug misuse.  The court&rsquo;s mission is to provide supervised treatment, education and rehabilitation for offenders with drug problems, as an alternative to prison.</P>
        <P>The programme lasts for a minimum of 12 months.  It is aimed at people with drug addiction problems who come before the District Court on minor criminal charges linked to their drug addiction and who plead guilty or have been convicted of the charges.  To be successful the participant needs to demonstrate a willingness to become free of non-prescribed drugs and to make a permanent change in lifestyle.  Assessments carried out to establish suitability for inclusion on the programme take an average of 10 weeks.  The main incentive for participants is the knowledge that outstanding charges will be struck out if the participant successfully completes the programme and does not re-offend in the 12 months following graduation.</P>
        <P>The programme operates on a points system designed to encourage the participants towards successful completion of the programme.  Follow-up support includes 12 months post-graduation supervision.  There is no formal procedure in place to monitor offences beyond that period, however, indications are that participation in the programme is linked to a decrease in criminal activity.  The court operates with the assistance of an inter-agency team which includes the judge, a probation officer, an addiction nurse, a Garda liaison officer and education-training representative and counsellors.</P>
        <P>The Department of Justice and Equality completed a review of the operation of the Drug Treatment Court in 2010 which provided evidence that the court can have encouraging out<Col N="336"/>comes.  Participants who engaged with the programme had reduced rates of recidivism and improved health, education and social skills which impacted positively on themselves, their families and the community.</P>
        <P>However, the review also expressed serious concerns relating to the throughput and graduation levels from the court which have not come close to achieving the volume originally expected.  It should be noted that on the establishment of the court in 2001, the planning committee had envisaged a potential enrolment of 100 participants in the first year.  From establishment to date, 236 persons have participated in the programme with only 36 graduates.  A further 209 persons were referred but found to be unsuitable to participate in the programme.</P>
        <P>The Drug Treatment Court programme is a restorative justice initiative and the success of such programmes should not and cannot be assessed simply in terms of throughput.  Nonetheless, it was clear from the review and the data that some adjustment of its operations was essential.  The review identified particular issues to be addressed in terms of the management and operation of the court to fulfil its potential by both increasing the numbers participating in the programme and the numbers who successfully complete it.</P>
        <P>Since the report was published a good deal of work has been done to implement its recommendations.  An advisory committee chaired by the Courts Service and comprising senior staff members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, the Probation Service and the City of Dublin VEC was established to monitor and report on implementation.  Significant effort has gone into promoting the court and to developing the programme itself to achieve improved outcomes within the existing catchment area.  The committee is exploring the further expansion of the court.  However, this can only be done in line with the availability of the necessary services, particularly the essential drug treatment services to be agreed and provided by the HSE.</P>
        <P>The Drug Treatment Court programme has also been redesigned.  The new programme contains a set timeframe and deadline for participants progressing through the four steps.  The participants should complete the programme in a maximum of three years with a view to remaining drug free.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Deputies realise the value the court can bring to the clients who come before it.  The supervision is intensive and successive district judges and the court team have done an excellent, painstaking job in helping these people along the road to recovery.  The team&rsquo;s commitment is very genuine and wholehearted.  The positive outcomes that can be achieved must be taken into account.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that all of these factors will be borne in mind in determining what happens in relation to the court.  The Department of Justice and Equality report completed last year recommended that the programme continue for a further two years subject to implementation of the recommendations.  The Minister informs me that this will be subject to review in 2012 to ensure that the necessary adjustments are delivering results.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s decision to centralise the processing of medical card applications and renewals at the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Finglas, Dublin is aimed at providing a more efficient and consistent quality of service to members of the general public.  The PCRS started processing medical card applications in January 2009 and has gradually expanded its role since then.  In addition, its on-line medical card service is increasingly being used for processing of applications.  Under the new arrangements, staff in local health offices will continue to provide information and assistance to individuals in relation to applications and renewals of medical cards.  Almost 90 staff have moved to the PCRS to cope with the increasing workload and the HSE is now using redeployment, under the parameters of the Public Service Agreement, to increase the number to 150.  The previous system of locally based processing required some 400 staff and the balance will be freed up for redeployment to key frontline services around the country. </P>
        <P>I have expressed concern to the HSE that the full complement of staff should be in place before full centralisation takes place.</P>

	<P>A number of Performance Related Award schemes were introduced in the health service following a decision by the then Government <Col N="338"/>on the implementation of recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in a report published in September 2000.</P>
        <P>These schemes covered a number of senior management grades in the Health Service Executive, the Chief Executives of the Voluntary Hospitals, the CEOs and Deputy CEOs of the five Dublin Academic Teaching Hospitals and the CEOs of some non-commercial health agencies.</P>
        <P>In May 2009, in the context of the serious deterioration in the public finances and in view of the cessation of such awards in the civil service, my Department wrote to the Chairpersons of the Boards of the agencies and hospitals concerned stating that bonus payments should be suspended pending the issue of further guidelines.</P>
        <P>Following a subsequent Review Body recommendation my Department instructed the HSE, hospitals and agencies that the schemes should be suspended on an indefinite basis.  The schemes remain suspended.</P>
        <P>In relation to bonus payments other than those comprehended by the PRA schemes, my Department has instructed the HSE that such payments should not be made by any bodies in receipt of funding under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004. The HSE has been asked to confirm that no such payments are currently being made and that no such payments will be made in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced.</P>
        <P><i>National Quality Standards: Residential Services for People with Disabilities</i>   were published by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in 2009. The standards will provide a national framework for quality, safe services for people with disabilities in residential settings.</P>
        <P>The current Programme for Government includes a commitment to put these standards on a statutory footing and ensure that the services are inspected by HIQA.  I am pleased to confirm, as I announced on 16th   June last, that discussions have begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the HIQA standards is already included in the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and service providers in the disability sector. Service providers are required to have systems in place to assess quality and standards and to specify the actions being taken to maintain and monitor quality and service standards. Examples of such monitoring actions could include audit tools appropriate to the service, service user evaluations and satisfaction surveys, and carer and service evaluations. I understand that some service providers have also commenced a review of their services in the context of the HIQA standards.</P>
        <P>It is now generally accepted that large residential institutions are no longer appropriate for the provision of accommodation for people with disabilities.  In this context, a report on &lsquo;Congregated Settings&rsquo; was published on Tuesday 28th June 2011 by the HSE. &lsquo;Congregated <Col N="339"/>Settings&rsquo; are defined as living arrangements (whose primary purpose is the provision of services to people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities) where ten or more people share a single living unit or where the living arrangements are campus-based.  The report recommends a move away from congregated/institutional type settings for the 4,000 people who resided in such settings in 2008, to community based settings over a seven year time frame. Since 2008 the numbers residing in such settings have been reduced to approximately 3,600 and there are plans in place to move a further 50 people to community based settings in 2011.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that it will engage with the relevant stakeholders to ensure that an action plan to address the recommendations of the report is developed and implemented. The Department of Health is also engaging with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the development of a housing strategy for people with disabilities, which will take account of the findings of the Congregated Settings report.</P>

	<P>The HSE National Service Plan 2011 which was approved in December 2010 requires the HSE to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation of &euro;13.456 billion.  This represents a net reduction of &euro;683m on the 2010 provision.  The HSE National Service Plan also commits the HSE to delivering service levels for 2011 which are broadly in line with 2010 levels. </P>
        <P>Activity in acute hospitals has been increasing year on year.  The most important priority is to drive out costs by relentlessly challenging practices which affect efficiency.  I have made it clear to hospitals that they must increase the proportion of day case work, reduce the average length of stay and perform surgery on the patient&rsquo;s day of admission to the greatest extent possible. There is clear evidence of major variations in performance under these headings across the system. This means we are not getting the best value for patients and the taxpayer from the beds we have.   I want to shift the debate away from beds to focus on the actual number of patients treated and on achieving equitable access to services based on need.  The services should be provided in the most appropriate place, be that a big or small hospital, the community or a GP&rsquo;s surgery.  I want to see a health system that is providing a service quickly, efficiently and safely.</P>
        <P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 29 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health system.  The aim of this reform is to deliver a single-tier health service that will deliver equal access to care based on need, not income.</P>
        <P>While universal health insurance is the ultimate destination of this Government&rsquo;s reform programme, there are a number of important stepping stones along the way and each of these will play a critical role in improving our health service in advance of the introduction of universal health insurance.</P>
        <P>A key immediate priority is the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) which I announced on the 1st of June.  The purpose of the SDU is to tackle hospital system inefficiencies and unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system and by streamlining waiting lists.  The SDU&rsquo;s priorities will encompass reducing the waiting times for admission to Emergency Departments, reduction in in-patient and out-patient waiting times and improved access to diagnostics.</P>
        <P>I have appointed  Dr Martin Connor, an international expert, to head up the SDU.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals on how best it can be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.  The resources of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) will be refocused to align with the work of the SDU, and crucially, will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation&rsquo;s hospitals.</P>
        <P>A further fundamental element in the reform process involves significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This commitment will be achieved on a phased basis to allow for the recruitment of additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals.  The specific cost of free GP care will be contingent upon a number of factors including a new GP contract.  My Department, in consultation with the HSE, is progressing proposals for this new contract.</P>
        <P>Reform of the funding system for hospital care is also necessary.  This will involve the introduction of a more transparent and efficient &ldquo;Money Follows the Patient&rdquo; funding mechanism and the introduction of  a purchaser / provider split, whereby hospitals will be established as independent, not for profit trusts.</P>
        <P>Other important initiatives which will prepare the system for universal health insurance include the establishment of a new risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market, and the financial restructuring and authorisation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I commissioned a report in April on the opportunities for rebalancing risk in the private health insurance market.  This report will be submitted to me by the end of July 2011.  In addition, I have asked the Health Insurance Authority, as the regulator of the private health insurance market, to examine the issue of provider costs in the market and to revert to me within one month on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the publication of a <i>White Paper on Financing Universal Health Insurance </i>  which will outline the estimated costs associated with the introduction of <Col N="341"/>universal health insurance.  However, it must be emphasised that the precise cost of universal health insurance will significantly depend on the success of reform measures, such as those outlined above, over the next 3-4 years.</P>
        <P>Finally, I can confirm that the Government has given approval for an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance.  I am currently finalising details of the Implementation Group and I will announce these in due course.</P>

	<P>I welcome this Report from the Health Information and Quality Authority which sets out a number of recommendations to improve the quality and safety of the referral system for patients to outpatient and radiology services.  The HIQA Report also includes a recommendation for a new national standard for the provision and communication of information between General Practitioners and hospitals. A pilot project is underway in hospitals in Cork, Kerry and in AMNCH Tallaght on an electronic generic referral system for public outpatient appointments. Following feedback on the experience with the pilot project I will consider mandating the proposed national standard for patient referral information. I have also asked the newly appointed head of the Special Delivery Unit, (Dr Martin Connor), for his views on how to ensure that the excellent work done by HIQA on this issue can best be integrated into the plans and priorities of the SDU to tackle patient access to emergency, elective, outpatient and diagnostic services.</P>

	<P>The current situation in relation to the waiting lists for orthopaedic services in Cork University Hospital is totally unacceptable.  Patients need a service that is timely and effective.</P>
        <P>There are a number of initiatives underway in HSE South to alleviate this problem.</P>
        <P><i>Additional Consultant Posts.</i></P>
        <P>In the HSE South, there are 5 permanent consultant orthopaedic surgeons in post in the trauma and elective service, with 2 additional locum consultants.</P>
        <P>The HSE South has approval to recruit 3 (1 replacement and 2 new posts) consultant orthopaedic surgeon posts at Cork University Hospital/South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital.  These are:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />2 orthopaedic surgeons with a special interest in paediatric orthopaedic surgery &mdash; new posts</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />1 orthopaedic general surgeon &mdash; a replacement post</P><Col N="342"/>
        <P FLI="0">Recruitment has been completed and it is anticipated that formal letters of appointment will be issued soon.</P>
        <P><i>Physiotherapy Initiative</i></P>
        <P>Physiotherapist-led clinics were introduced HSE South in 2010, to address the waiting list for OPD appointments.  The physiotherapists triage patients based on the longest waiters, primarily from the hip and knee lists.  35% of the patients seen at these clinics were referred to an orthopaedic consultant for surgical review.  A review of this initiative has been completed, in order to continue to improve patient flows.</P>
        <P>Approval for 3 additional physiotherapists under the Outpatient Programme for Rheumatology and Orthopaedics has been sanctioned, and the recruitment process has begun. These posts will allow for more musculo-skeletal physiotherapy led clinics.</P>
        <P><i>HSE National OPD Project:</i></P>
        <P>At national level, an Outpatients Department (OPD) Performance Improvement Group has been established to improve OPD services throughout the country.  The project aims to address the significant numbers on waiting lists for some specialties.  It will standardise all aspects of OPD, including waiting lists validation, management of DNAs, improvement in new to return ratios and improved triaging.</P>
        <P>Cork University Hospital and South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital have been selected to participate in the initial phase of this project.</P>
        <P>Cork University Hospital is undertaking a validation exercise on its OPD waiting lists.  This exercise will link in with the National OPD Programme on the validation protocol, particularly for the clinical governance process for removing patients from waiting lists and for GP involvement in the process.  It is expected that this exercise will reduce the numbers on the waiting list.</P>
        <P><i>GP Referral Project</i></P>
        <P>Under the reorganisation of acute hospital services in Cork and Kerry, electronic GP referral to acute hospitals is being piloted.  This will enable more efficient processing of referrals and allow patients and GPs to see waiting times for individual consultants.</P>
        <P>I believe that the implementation of these initiatives will greatly improve waiting list numbers and I will be closely monitoring the situation to ensure that these statistics become a thing of the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chief Medical Officer of my Department has commissioned an independent research report into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland.  The aim of the report will be to provide an accurate picture of the extent of use of symphysiotomy in Ireland, and an examination of the Irish practice relative to other countries. It will include an assessment of the circumstances in which the procedure was carried out, what protocols or guidance existed at the time to guide professional practice, and details of when the practice changed and why.</P><Col N="343"/>
        <P>The academic researcher was formally appointed on 1 June 2011. It is my intention that this researcher will carry out this work on an objective and independent basis. Following receipt of this report, which I understand is due to be received in September 2011, my Department will further engage with patient representative groups and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. I will then quickly decide on the next steps required to address this situation.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the report be published, subject of course to the usual legal and related considerations, which are as of now not expected to create any significant barriers to publication.</P>
        <P>I am very conscious of the distress that this procedure has caused to a number of women in the past and recognise the pain that this issue has caused to those affected by it.  The Government is committed to dealing with it sensitively, so that if at all possible, closure can be brought to those affected by it. In the first instance, it is important to make sure that the health needs of those who have had a Symphysiotomy are met quickly and effectively.</P>
        <P>With this in mind I am committed to ensuring that the greatest possible supports and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure. The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place including:</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the provision of medical cards to all who requested them,</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the nomination of a Liaison Officer for a patients&rsquo; group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure,</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients by Liaison Officers who assist in co-ordinating the provision of services to those patients,</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up, including Medical Assessment, Gynaecology Assessment, Orthopaedic Assessment, Counselling, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Home Help, Acupuncture, Osteopathy and fast tracked hospital appointments,</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication/private treatments and</P>
         <P><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a triple assessment service for patients at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin in January 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The HSE has assured my Department that it will continue to monitor and oversee the provision of necessary support services for women.  In doing so the HSE is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who had symphysiotomies and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.</P>
        <P>I am committed to bringing this matter to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible. I believe that the women who have had this procedure deserve nothing less.</P>

        <P>I am working with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure the filling of as many as possible of some 475 NCHD posts which are due to be filled from 11th July 2011. The HSE conducted an extensive recruitment drive in India and Pakistan in recent months and succeeded in identifying 439 potential candidates for NCHD positions in Ireland.  I have held meetings involving my Department, the Medical Council, medical training bodies and the HSE with a view to identifying measures to facilitate the appointment of suitably-qualified doctors from abroad.  Drafting of a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007, to enable the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period, is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this and other initiatives, it is unlikely that all NCHD vacancies can be filled by 11th July. Hospital management are working with Clinical Directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented if required, to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimised and that safe delivery of hospital services is assured. In the medium-term, ongoing reform of the system will result in changes in how care is delivered in certain locations. This will be done on a basis that takes account of the need to reduce the current reliance on NCHDs.</P>
        <P>While there is no plan to cease any current services, the configuration of services is constantly reviewed and from time to time re-arranged to improve access and quality of service and minimise risk to patients. This programme of realignment of services has received recent impetus from HIQA in relation to the need to implement the recommendations from the Ennis and Mallow reports. The reports deal in particular with the type of services that can safely be provided in smaller hospitals and the structures required for good governance and accountability. The HSE must ensure that this happens and I will be monitoring the situation closely in conjunction with HIQA.  I can assure the public that no hospitals will close, regardless of the difficult economic situation we find ourselves in. However, ongoing reform of the system will result in some changes in how care is delivered in particular locations across our health system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 38 together.</P>
        <P>I announced the establishment of the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) on 1 June. This has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister for Health. The SDU is a key part of the Government&rsquo;s plans to radically reform the health system in Ireland, with the ultimate goal of introducing a system of Universal Health Insurance (UHI).</P>
        <P>I have appointed Dr Martin Connor as the head of the SDU.  Dr Connor is an international expert, with a proven track record in health service transformation.  He has extensive experience in the NHS and led a similar initiative in Northern Ireland with considerable success.  His principal task will be to build up the SDU and to prepare proposals for me on how best it can <Col N="346"/>be placed on a permanent footing within the next six months.  I will be meeting Dr Connor this week to review his progress to date.</P>
        <P>The SDU will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU will work closely with the HSE, building on initiatives already underway including the clinical programmes.</P>
        <P>The SDU&rsquo;s priorities will encompass:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Emergency Departments &mdash; waiting times for admission have been unacceptably high in a number of hospitals, often breaching the current 6-hour maximum waiting time target</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />In-patient waiting times &mdash; the trend has been upwards recently, despite the work of the NTPF</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Out-patient waiting times &mdash; the time from GP referral to an appointment with a consultant is unacceptably long in many specialties</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Access to diagnostics &mdash; this forms an essential part of the patient journey for all of the areas of access above</P>
        <P FLI="0">Its success will allow for an alteration in the current role of the NTPF.  Its resources will be re-focused to align closely with the work of the SDU, and crucially will allow for a progressive improvement in the performance of the nation&rsquo;s hospitals.</P>
        <P>For the moment the NTPF will continue to operate as normal, accepting applications from persons who have been waiting for over three months for treatment.</P>
        <P>An immediate priority for the SDU will be to ensure that waiting lists for inpatient services are managed properly and that hospitals take responsibility for managing patient flows.  I have already stated that in the transition period, while the SDU is being established, there may be some increase in waiting lists but this will be avoided if at all feasible.  However I cannot accept a position where some hospitals allow small numbers of patients to wait more than a year for their procedures and expect this to be tackled quickly.  The NTPF has welcomed the new initiative and has confirmed it will work proactively with the Unit to achieve the best possible result for patients.</P>

	<P>It is important that we have effective mechanisms in place to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality services.  Residents, their families and the public need to be assured that an independent regulator is monitoring the care people receive.  The Health Act 2007 provides this, with a regime designed to protect through an independent inspection and registration system for residential services. </P>
        <P>On 1 July 2009 statutory responsibility was given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) for inspecting and registering nursing homes.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations and the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i></P><Col N="347"/>
        <P>HIQA registers and inspects nursing homes to make sure they are safe and that residents are being cared for properly.  The inspections aim to ensure that poor services are not allowed to operate and to support nursing homes to provide quality, person-centred care.</P>
        <P>As of 26 June 2011 there are 590 designated centres (nursing homes) &mdash; this includes all active designated centres and new builds.  Inspection frequency in terms of an actual site inspection varies on a centre by centre basis. While all centres receive a registration inspection every three years, inspections are carried out on an on-going basis with their frequency determined by the case holding inspector.  The inspections are a mixture of both announced and unannounced visits, which could happen by day, at weekends and at night.</P>
        <P>In 2010 HIQA carried out 815 inspections.  This year 368 inspections were completed between 1 January and 24 June.  An inspection report is produced by the Authority after each inspection.  These are published and any necessary actions required on the part of the provider will be clearly indicated in the report.</P>
        <P>Recent events have highlighted that the independent regulator is getting on with the job it was established to do.  I am satisfied that the Authority continues to play a key role in maintaining public confidence in residential care and there are no plans to change the current regulatory framework.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that the Department is carrying out a review of the Care and Welfare Regulations which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28 and 56 together.</P>
        <P>In response, the Minister asked for a full examination of the funding situation, to be conducted jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE.</P>
        <P>A report on the examination was submitted to the Minister on the 3rd June. It identified a number of factors that are putting pressure on the overall Fair Deal budget for 2011. These included:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an unexpected and so far unexplained increase in the average length of stay for nursing home patients,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />a resultant higher net demand for nursing home places, and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />an increase in nursing home costs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Following this examination, the Minister is considering a range of increased governance and monitoring arrangements and it is hoped to convey these to the HSE within the next few days.  These will include issues already signalled by the Minister such as a clinical audit of the Common Summary Assessment Report (CSAR) process to establish the levels of dependency for those accessing care and to attempt to explain the unforeseen increase in average length of stay.</P><Col N="348"/>
        <P>The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme re-commenced the week beginning the 13th June. Approvals are being issued to those applicants processed to final stage in the chronological order in which they were received in the Central Office in Tullamore. Approvals are currently being issued to the first 400 of these applicants. Funding is being assigned on a daily basis. There are approximately 700 further applications processed to final stage and now awaiting approval and these will be dealt with as a priority.</P>
        <P>The key focus of the Minister for Health is to ensure that those who require nursing home care will be able to access it and, to this end, the Department estimates that almost 24,000 people will be in long-term nursing home care by year end. This would mean a net increase of around 1,700 people between now and the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In order to fund this increase, and to offset other pressures on the subhead such as increases in average length of stay, cost increases, etc., the Minister identified a range of savings and income sources, one of which is a potential saving of up to &euro;30 million in non-service related spending. This funding will come primarily from ICT capital spending which is running significantly behind budget so far this year.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in the D&aacute;il that a lack of historical data, combined with a multiplicity of different accounting systems, made it difficult to drill down into the scheme in the way he wanted. As a result, the report&rsquo;s conclusions were not as definitive as he would have wished. The matter, therefore, will continue to be examined until he is satisfied. The main findings and outcomes so far have already been set out by the Minster in the D&aacute;il and by myself in the Seanad. Officials from the Department of Health will monitor developments closely between now and the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits us to review the system of financing nursing home care with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long term care. This commitment will be carried through.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is due for formal review commencing in 2012.  The Scheme will be three years in operation at that stage.  The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that established and validated trends and statistics will be available in order to inform this work. It is still intended to proceed with this review and it will look at the ongoing sustainability of the Scheme, the relative costs of public versus private provision and the balance of funding between residential and community care.</P>

	<P>The Office of Clinical Strategy and Programmes in the HSE has established three key national programmes in relation to neurological care which shows the HSE&rsquo;s commitment to improving access to neurological services and gives these services a major focus in the HSE.</P>
        <P>The first programme deals with neurology out patient departments and aims to provide standardised care for neurology patients and to increase access so that patients will not wait more than 30 days for an appointment.  The programme is due to establish referral guidelines and encourage the increased use of neurolink. The second programme deals with epilepsy services and aims to introduce rapid access clinics to assist with admission avoidance and reduce the number of attendances to emergency departments.  The third programme deals with stroke services and aims to establish robust clinical governance systems for stroke care, including local stroke teams and regional stroke networks.</P>
        <P>The HSE has emphasised to my Department that all national programmes, including those concentrating on neurology, will have a focus on patient advocacy. These inter-related programmes aim to improve service quality, effectiveness and patient access and to ensure that patient care is provided in the service setting most appropriate to individuals&rsquo; needs.  I believe that the clinical programmes being developed by the HSE are vital to ensuring the most appropriate organisation of acute services.</P>

	<P>The use of medication in residential institutions operated by or on behalf of the HSE is governed by medication management policy and procedures that comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and best practice guidelines.  It should not generally be used as a restraint or to subdue patients, or administered for reasons other than medical necessity and as prescribed by a medical prac<Col N="350"/>titioner legally authorised to do so.  Under the Service Level Arrangements agreed by HSE with all disability service providers, governance arrangements require that care is service user centred and appropriate clinical governance and audit arrangements are in place.</P>
        <P>The HSE is committed to providing safe and quality care, and it has put in place a range of standards, guidelines and procedures to protect all service users, with a particular focus on children and vulnerable adults, from potential abuse or harm.  The most recent development in ensuring best practice in this area is the Standards and Guidelines for Health Service Providers for the Prevention of Harm to Health Service Users: CARE SAFE, which recommends that restraint may be used as a therapeutic intervention in a variety of care settings, including older persons&rsquo; services, mental health services, disability services and children&rsquo;s services.  The Care Safe Standards and Guidelines were developed to address the risk of abuse or harm to all health service users but particularly for defined vulnerable persons while in receipt of health care services from HSE service providers. The standards and guidelines cover the following areas:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Protection of Service Users</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Human Resources and Service providers Conduct</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Consent</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Providing Services, clinical interventions and treatments</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Medication, Restraint and Managing Challenging Situations</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Wills and associated financial management issues</P>
        <P FLI="0">Care Safe is currently being piloted in nominated areas in the country involving all of the care groups, including Disability. The outcome of this process will further inform full implementation.</P>
        <P>The requirement for the use of restraint can arise in a number of different circumstances and is only used in exceptional circumstances as an intervention of last resort.  In this context, restraint can be defined as any physical, chemical or environmental intervention used specifically to restrict the freedom of movement of a person.  It is a requirement that all managers within the health service ensure that service providers are aware of the Care Safe Standards and Guidelines.  Managers within the HSE, and of all organisations which provide services on behalf of the HSE, are required to ensure that service providers (including all front line staff and support staff) have an appropriate written policy on the use of restraint in place in that setting, and that their agents are aware of the standards and guidelines outlined above.</P>

        <Quest>  if he has received the report of Amnesty International, Healthcare Guaranteed? The Right to Health in Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a copy of the Amnesty International Report, <i>Healthcare Guaranteed? The Right to Health in Ireland, </i>earlier this month and it is currently being reviewed by officials in my Department.  </P>
        <P>The Report provides a brief overview of the current health system in Ireland.  It analyses access to healthcare in Ireland, in particular, economic access, and reviews current monitoring and accountability mechanisms relating to health.</P>
        <P>The Report acknowledges the need for substantial reform of the health system.  I understand that a key message emanating from the Report is the proposal that Government should commit to a legal guarantee to the right to health.  This guarantee would require equity of access and ensure that cost is not a barrier to care.</P>
        <P>The Government shares many of the concerns regarding the health system which are raised in the report; that is why we have committed to a major reform programme.  The fundamental aim of our reform programme is to deliver a single-tier health service, supported by universal health insurance, which will deliver care based on need, not on income.  The universal health insurance system will give patients a choice of insurer and will guarantee that every citizen has equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services, including both primary and hospital care.</P>
        <P>Finally, it is important to acknowledge that all countries &mdash; no matter how prosperous &mdash; must make choices in meeting healthcare demands with finite resources.  This involves legitimate policy choices to be debated and resolved as part of the democratic process.</P>

	<P>It is not a matter of Government policy that hospitals or other health services contract clerical work outside of Ireland, as suggested by the Deputy.  However, all bodies in receipt of public funding, not just in the health sector, must manage their resources in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible.   </P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Government is also carrying out a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Under this review, it is committed to examining all aspects of public expenditure, with a view to ensuring that all resources are used in the optimum manner to deliver services to citizens.</P>

	<P>The processing of approvals for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme re-commenced the week beginning the 13th June. Approvals are being issued to those applicants processed to final stage in the chronological order in which they were received in the Central Office in Tullamore. Approvals are currently being issued to the first 400 of these applicants. Funding is being assigned on a daily basis. There are approximately 700 further applications processed to final stage and now awaiting approval and these will be dealt with as a priority.</P>
        <P>The key focus of the Minister for Health is to ensure that those who require nursing home care will be able to access it and, to this end, the Department estimates that almost 24,000 people will be in long-term nursing home care by year end. This would mean a net increase of around 1,700 people between now and the end of the year.</P>
        <P>In order to fund this increase, and to offset other pressures on the subhead such as increases in average length of stay, cost increases etc., the Minister identified a range of savings and income sources, one of which is a potential saving of up to &euro;30 million in non-service related spending. This funding will come primarily from capital spending which is running significantly behind budget so far this year. Funding for the scheme in future years will be determined in the context of the estimates process.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits us to review the system of financing nursing home care with a view to developing a secure and equitable system of financing for community and long term care. This commitment will be carried through.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is due for formal review commencing in 2012.  The Scheme will be three years in operation at that stage.  The reason for allowing this period to elapse is to ensure that established and validated trends and statistics will be available in order to inform this work. It is still intended to proceed with this review and it will look at the ongoing sustainability of the Scheme, the relative costs of public versus private provision and the balance of funding between residential and community care.</P>

	<P>The Health Sector Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 gives effect to Government priorities on employment policy in the public sector and provides that there will be a net reduction in employment of approximately 6,000 WTEs to 2014.  The Framework is designed to maintain tight control on the cost of providing public services while protecting front line services as far as possible.  There are no plans to relax the terms of the moratorium.  However, the Framework also allows for the targeted growth of certain grades which are exempt from the moratorium on recruitment, including Medical Consultants, Physiotherapists and Social Workers, to deliver on key priority services.  It also provides for the filling of non-exempt posts on exceptional grounds to maintain essential services and meet priority service change and reorganisation requirements.  The HSE is in the process of centralising the administration of the medical card system, as an efficiency measure and to ensure a nationally consistent approach.  In order to put the necessary staffing resources in place, staff are being redeployed to Finglas in line with the procedures set out in the Health Service Redeployment Protocol (Chapter 6) contained in the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.  It is recognised in this Protocol that there will be greater need to use redeployment, having regard to the Government moratorium on recruitment in the Public Service.  It should also be noted that this Protocol has been agreed between the HSE, health service employers funded by the HSE and trade unions representing staff employed throughout the health services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully aware of the recommendations of the Health Information and Quality Authority in relation to Ennis Hospital and its subsequent report on Mallow Hospital.  Both reports deal with the type of services that can safely be <Col N="355"/>provided in smaller hospitals and with the structures required for good governance and accountability within our hospitals.  The report on Mallow reiterates the implications of the Ennis report for all hospitals of a similar size.  </P>
        <P>I have said on many occasions that I believe local hospitals can and should be a vibrant element of local health services, providing treatment and care at the appropriate level of complexity to the patients in their area.  I have also said that I will not stand over unsafe care which puts patients at risk.</P>
        <P>The recommendations in these HIQA Reports need to be implemented in order to ensure that the standards of care delivered in smaller hospitals are as high as possible and that the type of care provided is appropriate to the clinical setting and to the needs of patients.</P>
        <P>I have had a number of meetings with clinicians and officials in my Department and the HSE about the progress being made in implementing the HIQA recommendations both generally and in relation to specific hospitals.  I intend to keep myself fully briefed about ongoing developments.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals in Ireland so that they play a key part in the services provided to local communities.  Patients should only have to travel to the larger hospitals for more complex services.  HIQA&rsquo;s reports on Ennis and Mallow are entirely in keeping with this approach.</P>

	<P>Since the signing of the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Accord, which signalled the end of the civil war, Nepal has undergone political, economic and social transformation as part of its continuing peace-building process.  Although there have been difficulties in drafting a new national Constitution, I remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached which guarantees the long term peace and stability of Nepal.  With regard to human rights, Nepal underwent its Universal Periodic Review at the Tenth Session of the UN Human Rights Council in January 2011.  Ireland actively participated in the process.  In response to questions posed, Nepal expressed its intention to address issues related to human rights, including the independent and impartial investigations of allegations of human rights abuses during the war, combating domestic violence and violence against women, the rehabilitation of child soldiers and the continued strengthening of human rights through government policies and programmes. </P>
        <P>Ireland also supports the work of the UN human rights mission in Kathmandu which independently monitors and reports on human rights developments in Nepal.</P>
        <P>Under the 2007 Interim Constitution of Nepal, the National Human Rights Commission was established as an independent constitutional body with responsibility for protecting and promoting the human rights of the Nepalese people.  It supports the development of Nepalese society based on respect for human rights, freedom, equality and social justice with no tolerance for impunity.</P>
        <P>Although many challenges remain in Nepal, particularly with respect to human rights, the Nepalese people have unequivocally voiced their desire for peace, security and democracy.  Ireland and the international community will continue to support the peace building process in Nepal and its development into an inclusive, democratic society.  A society based on these fundamental principles provides the best environment for lasting human rights in Nepal.  While <Col N="356"/>European Union Foreign Ministers have not specifically discussed Nepal recently, senior officials regularly discuss and review developments there, including human rights.</P>

	<P>I&rsquo;m aware of reports that a number of rural activists have been killed in the Amazon region since May which represents a worrying escalation of intimidation and violence in the region.  Our Embassy in Brasilia is closely monitoring the situation and has already been in contact with the Department of Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with the Special Secretariat for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders at the Office of the President in this connection. </P>
        <P>Both offices have assured us that they will do all they can to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, and have informed us that, in addition to the activities of the National Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, an inter-ministerial working group has been established to consider a list of people considered to be at-risk.  It has also been announced that Federal Police and Army personnel will be deployed into Amazonas, Par&aacute; and Rond&oacute;nia to assist in the investigation of the murders and to prevent further attacks.</P>
        <P>A session of the EU-Brazil human rights dialogue took place in Brasilia on 26 May, at which Ireland was represented.  The recent deaths of environmental activists were raised by the EU side as a matter of serious concern.  The EU has also been active in promoting the adoption of human rights defender legislation, which is currently before the Brazilian Congress.  Proposed amendments to Brazilian forest protection laws, which would effectively relax long-standing legislation designed to protect the Amazon and curb deforestation, are a matter of concern.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports the sustainable management of forests both in developed and developing countries and condemns the activities of those involved in illegal logging activities. In response to illegal logging and the trade in illegally logged timber, Ireland supports the EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), and also the introduction in 2013 of the EU Timber Trader Regulation (995/2010), which places obligations on timber importers to source only legal timber products.  Ireland also ratified the International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006, in December 2009 along with many other countries.</P>

	<P>I am highly conscious of the centre to which the Deputy refers and of its track record in relation to peace-building on the island of Ireland and beyond.  My Department has worked closely with the centre on its programming activities in the peace-building area. Most recently, the centre received an award of &euro;112,500 from my <Col N="357"/>Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund towards its work in three key aspects &mdash; political dialogue and training, reconciliation dialogue and a training programme for women from disadvantaged backgrounds who are involved in local peace-building.  This award followed on from close to &euro;3 million which the centre has received in support from the Reconciliation Fund since the early 1980s and in addition to almost &euro;400,000 through my Department&rsquo;s Conflict Resolution Unit since 2009.</P>
        <P>Several meetings have taken place over recent months between officials from my Department and representatives of the centre with a view to assisting it to adapt to the current very difficult economic climate by reviewing its programmes and overall budgetary position, thereby permitting it to focus upon its core competences and considerable experience in the area of peace-building, and these are ongoing.  Last week my Department was notified that for budgetary reasons and of its own accord, the centre had decided it was appropriate to cease offering accommodation and conference facilities at their current location with effect from 10 July.</P>
        <P>Arrangements have been negotiated by the centre to permit it to use accommodation and conference facilities at another nearby location as these are required.  The centre&rsquo;s operations will continue to function in full from another building at their current site and a caf&eacute; at the centre will also remain open.  I welcome the constructive way in which the centre has approached these difficult decisions in the face of resource constraints and pressures upon Government finances.</P>

	<P>Under section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 health insurance providers are required to pay a levy, in the form of a stamp duty, in respect of each insured person on their books.  The levy is payable by health insurance providers in respect of each insured person for whom the provider has renewed an existing contract or with whom the provider has entered into a new contract of health insurance during an accounting period.  The current accounting period runs from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011.</P>
        <P>The legislation ensures that, where an individual changes insurance providers during an accounting period, only the provider with whom the individual took out or renewed the initial contract of insurance is required to pay the levy in respect of those insured under that contract for that accounting period.  In such cases, where the individual concerned shows to the satisfaction of the second provider that the levy for that accounting period has been accounted for by the original provider, the second provider is not required to pay any levy for those insured under the contract for the unexpired part of the accounting period.</P>

	<P>It is understood that the question relates to the Air Travel Tax (ATT).  The ATT is currently applied at the rate of &euro;3 to all passenger departures from Irish airports whose passenger departure numbers are greater than 50,000 in the preceding year.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provides for the suspension of the ATT to all departures.  The ATT rate will now be reduced to zero on or after such a day as the Minister for Finance may appoint by Commencement Order.</P>
        <P>This measure is subject to an agreement being reached with the airlines to bring in additional passenger numbers.  The Minister for Transport is holding discussions with airlines in that regard.  Consequently, the measure would affect all passengers independent of the place of establishment of the tour operator that may have organised their travel.</P>

	<P>Bailieborough Garda Station is currently located in a building which is deemed inadequate by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for policing needs and has been prioritised for replacement. In light of the requirement for more modern facilities, OPW has advised An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the optimum solution in this case is the construction of new purpose-built facilities on a greenfied site.</P>
        <P>Bailieborough Garda Station is responsible for carrying out a range of different functions specific to a District Headquarters such as traffic control and management, investigation of serious crime, detention of prisoners, etc.  These functions require specific custom designed spaces which are not generally available in leased buildings and which are best provided in purpose-built Station premises.  Additionally, given current building standards in regard to requirements such as universal access, energy efficiency and sustainable design, it is clear that no suitable premises exists in Bailieborough currently which would meet the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or which could be adapted economically for its purposes.</P>

	<P>I am not aware of any proposals to use European Financial Stability Facility to establish a European Bank Restructuring Agency.  The Euro Area Member States agreed in May 2010 to create a European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) in order to financially support euro area Member States who are in difficulties caused by exceptional circumstances beyond their control.  The EFSF was incorporated on 7 June 2010 for the purpose of providing stability support to euro area Member States in the form of guaranteed loans of up to EUR 440 billion within a limited period of time.  There is currently no mechanism within the EFSF that could be used to establish such an agency.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has been working to develop a proposal for an EU Framework for Bank Recovery and Resolution and has issued a number of consultation documents and communications on their proposed framework, most recently in January 2011.  This consultation document set out three steps in the development of this framework.  The first step is the <Col N="359"/>development of a harmonised EU regime for crisis prevention and bank recovery and resolution &mdash; the Commission has indicated that it will publish a legislative proposal for such a regime in September 2011.  This will include a common set of resolution tools and reinforcement of cooperation between national authorities in order to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements for dealing with the failure of cross border banks.</P>
        <P>As a second step, the Commission has indicated it will examine the need for further harmonisation of bank insolvency regimes, with the aim of resolving and liquidating them under the same substantive and procedural rules, and will publish a report, accompanied if appropriate by a legislative proposal, by the end of 2012.  Finally, the Commission considers that a third step should include the creation of an integrated resolution regime, possibly based on a single European Resolution Authority, by 2014.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports the Commission&rsquo;s work to develop a proposal which gives national authorities a common resolution tool kit.  We look forward to the publication of this legislative proposal in the autumn.  From a domestic perspective the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 provides for a special resolution regime to allow the Central Bank to deal in an effective way with credit institutions that are failing or likely to fail in the future.</P>

	<P>Ireland is meeting its targets under the EU/IMF Programme and the troika teams have concluded that we have made a strong start.  Nevertheless, yields on Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign bonds are remaining at elevated levels and it is clear that this position is being exacerbated by the ongoing uncertainties due to the wider situation in Europe. Clearly, the current market view of Ireland as illustrated by our sovereign bond spreads is not what we would wish it to be. </P>
        <P>However, based on conservative projections of our funding needs and taking account of funding possibilities, there is no urgency about a return to the markets and Ireland has not issued bonds at these elevated yields.  Indeed, the purpose of a programme such as the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place.  Based on current projections and without going back to the markets in the meantime, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.</P>
        <P>We are barely half a year into our Programme, so it is still very early in this process.  However, as I have already said, we are meeting our targets and, as long as we continue to do so, we expect that the Programme will achieve its objectives.  The steps necessary to enable such a return to the markets include resolution of the banking sector issues and continued progress in the reduction of the budget deficit in line with the targets agreed in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, together with the implementation of policies that will see us return to sustainable economic growth.</P>
        <P>The NTMA is in constant contact with market participants and will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets. This is an issue that is under constant and close review by all concerned.</P>

As part of the programme to correct the public finances, the Government is committed to reducing numbers in the Public Service in the period to 2015 and is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of expenditure to examine all areas where savings and numbers reductions might be identified.  Part of the overall policy on Public Service numbers may involve voluntary staff exit mechanisms, and the options in this regard will be considered by the Government in this overall context when the review is completed in the Autumn.

	<P>NAMA advises me that the most efficient way to deal with issues arising in connection with period buildings and protected structures controlled by NAMA debtors, is to consider circumstances on a case by case basis.  Should it be brought to NAMA&rsquo;s attention that one of its debtors is failing to comply with his or her obligations as regards protected buildings or structures, the Agency&rsquo;s first option is to put pressure on the debtor to resolve the issue. Should the debtor fail to take the appropriate action, NAMA can appoint a receiver to take control of the property concerned or under the provisions of section 141 of the NAMA Act, NAMA can apply to the District Court for an entry and maintenance order for which the overall costs can be charged back to the debtor. NAMA informs me that it has not been necessary to move beyond the first option in the very few cases relating to period buildings and protected structures which have arisen to date.</P>
        <P>NAMA&rsquo;s engagement with local authorities regarding protected buildings or structures has also taken place on a case-by-case basis.

	<P>The purpose of EU Regional/Cohesion policy is to reduce the significant economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist between Europe&rsquo;s regions.  The budget for the 2007-2013 round is &euro;347bn.   Most of this budget is allocated for those countries and regions whose gross domestic product per capita is less than 75% of EU average (81.5% for convergence objective). The remainder is for all other countries and regions (16.5% for regional competitiveness and employment objective) and for cooperation across borders (2.5% for territorial cooperation objective).  The overall budget and country allocation is agreed between the EU Commission and Member States in advance of the programming period. Ireland has been allocated in total &euro;901m in Structural Funding for the 2007-13 Programming period with &euro;750 million assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) Objective.  Ireland&rsquo;s NSRF sets out the strategic context within which the &euro;750m block of funding may be applied; the delivery is via three operational programmes, the National ESF Human Capital Investment OP and the Border Midland and Western and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF OPs.   The balance of  &euro;151m   is for smaller Territorial Cooperation programmes including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.  </P>
        <P>It should be noted that annual indicative financial allocations are agreed with the Commission, expenditure has to be incurred, certified, verified and audited in accordance with complex EU eligibility and audit criteria.  Therefore, there is a time lag between the allocation and drawdown of funding.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s performance in drawing down its EU Structural Fund 2007-13 allocation is among the best in Europe.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a statement by President Barroso of the European Commission following a meeting with Greek Prime Minister Papandreou on 20th June which was reported in the media in the following days.  President Barroso said that &ldquo;if Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the EU/IMF, we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth&rdquo;.  He went on to say that they discussed a more strategic use of the EU Structural Funds under Cohesion Policy to increase their rate of absorption and accelerate delivery.  However, this would be done within their existing structural funds allocation.  Therefore, there is no question of any additional structural funds allocation to Greece, just a potential acceleration of delivery of the funding.</P>
        <P>I should also say that we are successfully implementing our programme of assistance from the EU/IMF.  We have satisfied our programme commitments to date. The review of our programme in April found that we had met all our targets &mdash; on fiscal consolidation, financial sector reform, structural reform and structural fiscal reform.</P>
        <P>Ireland is funded until well into 2013.  Based on current projections and without going back to the market, in the meantime the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013. This access is through the EU, bilateral and IMF funds along with our own resources. Our continued adherence to programme targets will ensure access to this funding.</P>

	<P>The day-to-day regulation of banks and other regulated financial service providers is primarily a matter for the Central Bank. The Central Bank has a range of enforcement tools available to it to ensure the regulation of the financial services industry up to and including the bringing of summary prosecutions. The Central Bank is also implementing a fitness and probity regime for all persons working in senior or sensitive positions in the regulated financial services sector. Other agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Director of Public Prosecutions have their own role to play in enforcing financial services law. </P>
        <P>I will be publishing the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 by the end of July, which will provide for the further enhancement of the supervisory and enforcement powers of the Central Bank.</P>

	<P>The financial crisis has affected and continues to affect all sectors of the economy and the public service has not been insulated from those affects.  Public Servants have been required to make a significant contribution to the restoration of the public finances to a sustainable path.  Among the measures introduced and impacting on the public service are:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The general round pay increases under the terms of the Review and Transitional Agreement due in 2009 were not paid;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />A general moratorium on recruitment and promotion was applied to most of the Public Service, and incentivised early retirement and career break schemes introduced;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />A pension related deduction of an average of nearly 7% was applied to all the earnings of all public servants;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />A reduction in rates of pay and allowances took effect on 1 January, 2010;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />The Public Service Agreement provides for an effective pay freeze up to 2014; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />More recently the Government has put in place pay ceilings for Senior Public Servants and CEOs of Commercial State Companies.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition to the specific measures applied to public servants, they are also subject to the general tax increases and expenditure cuts which have been the dominant feature of Government fiscal policy in recent years.  While I understand the financial pressures which businesses are currently working under, similar pressures apply throughout the economy and no sector remains untouched by the economic crisis.  However, the Government is determined that all sectors will make a fair contribution to the difficult measures necessary to effect our economic recovery.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Communities (Licensing and Supervision) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 395 of 1992), which  give effect to EU legislation relating to the licensing and supervision of credit institutions, were amended in 2006 and 2007 to transpose relevant provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive (2006/48(EC).  Regulation 16 sets out requirements for credit institutions in relation to governance arrangements, including the requirement to have: a clear organisational structure; effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report risk; adequate internal control mechanisms; sound administrative and accounting procedures; and remuneration policies and practices that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management.  These provisions have been supplemented by the Corporate Governance Code for Credit Institutions and Insurance Undertakings, published by the Central Bank in 2010. </P>
        <P>Regulation 33 of S.I. 395 of 1992 provides that failure to comply with a provision of the Regulations is a summary offence attracting a fine of &euro;1000 or six months in prison or both.  The limitations in respect of the size of the penalties prescribed by Regulation 33, reflect the then existing provisions of the European Communities Acts as enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>The Deputy might also wish to note that the European Communities Act 2007 subsequently introduced provisions for offences committed in breach of Regulations made under the European Communities Acts to be prosecuted on indictment with a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and a maximum term of imprisonment of 3 years.  These provisions may be applied to regulations made by any Minister of the Government under the European Communities Acts.  In the context of any future amendments to S.I. 395 of 1992 which may be required to implement forthcoming provisions of EU law giving effect to the Basel III agreement, I will consider further the level of sanctions and penalties that will apply to breaches of these Regulations.</P>
        <P>In addition to these provisions, Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides the Central Bank with the power to administer sanctions in respect of prescribed contraventions by regulated entities and persons concerned in the management of regulated entities.  Breaches of provisions of   S.I. 395 of 1992 may be subject to proceedings under Part IIIC of the 1942 Act.  The following types of sanctions may be imposed by the Central Bank:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />caution or reprimand;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />direction to refund or withhold all or part of an amount of money charged or paid, or to be charged or paid, for the provision of a financial service;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />monetary penalty (not exceeding &euro;5,000,000 in the case of a corporate and unincorporated body, not exceeding &euro;500,000 in the case of a person);</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />direction disqualifying a person from being concerned in the management of a regulated financial service provider;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />direction to cease the contravention if it is found the contravention is continuing; or</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />direction to pay all or part of the costs of the investigation and inquiry.</P><Col N="366"/>
        <P FLI="0">In December 2010 the Central Bank published its Enforcement Strategy for 2011 - 2012 which sets out the Central Bank&rsquo;s approach to improving effective compliance by the application of its enforcement powers.  Both the Enforcement Strategy and the Corporate Governance Code can be accessed at <i>www.centralbank.ie.  </i>I will also be publishing the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement Bill) 2011 by the end of July.  The bill will provide an opportunity to consider further the sanctions and penalties that apply to contraventions of Irish financial services law and the related supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information in relation to cumulative tax losses being carried forward by financial institutions is derived from corporation tax returns filed for the year 2009, the first year for which this information is available.  Data for the year 2010 is not yet available.  The available information is the amounts of unused losses and capital allowances that are available for carryover to years following 2009 by financial institutions participating in the National Asset Management Agency and is estimated to be in the region of &euro;17,877 million.</P>
        <P>The figures are based on the amounts of unused losses and capital allowances as derived from the 2009 tax returns as being available for carryover to years following 2009 <i>before</i>  deduction of any losses and capital allowances that are used in the compilation of group relief.  For technical reasons, it is not possible to provide a breakdown at company level of unused losses and capital allowances that are surrendered to other companies within a group structure and then claimed as group relief.</P>
        <P>Special arrangements apply in the case of financial institutions, in the context of dealing with impaired loan assets.  In this regard, provisions were included in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 to limit the amount of relief that can be claimed by participating institutions for losses carried forward from earlier years.  This measure, which is provided for in section 396C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, has the effect of restricting the amount of a participating institution&rsquo;s group trading income which can be reduced by losses brought forward from earlier periods to 50 per cent of such income.  The measure will ensure that, when the institutions return to profitability, a minimum of 50% of their trading income will remain chargeable to tax in an accounting period notwithstanding claims for relief for losses carried forward into that period.</P>
        <P>I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the tax affairs of individual taxpayers and companies precludes them from providing the information requested by the Deputy on a company by company basis.</P>

	<P>Under the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland, stress tests on credit unions have been completed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Credit unions were subjected to a detailed stress testing exercise to make an assessment of the likely impact of given stress scenarios on the capital buffers of credit unions.  The purpose of this work is to provide the Central Bank of Ireland with the necessary regulatory information to concentrate its supervisory focus and, where necessary, to take pre-emptive remedial action to maintain member confidence and protect the financial stability of the credit union sector.  These stress test results also inform Government policy in relation to the credit union sector and, in this regard, I have prepared a strategy to underpin the solvency and viability of any undercapitalised credit unions.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present to publish the results of these stress tests.  The Commission on Credit Unions will, however, review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations to Government in respect of a strengthened regulatory framework for the sector.

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Euro Area Heads of State and Government agreed in principle to a reduction in the interest margin charged to programme countries.  This has been applied in respect of Greece and Portugal.  However, a decision to apply it to Ireland&rsquo;s loans has not yet been taken.  This is because another Member State is asking for Ireland to deliver a quid pro quo in return for an interest rate reduction in the form of a change in our Corporation Tax. However, we have made it clear that we will not agree to this.  Contacts on interest rates are continuing at official level. I have raised it at EU Finance Ministers meetings, and in bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts, most recently at the Luxembourg meetings of the eurogroup/ECOFIN Council. Furthermore, this issue was raised in the recent contacts that the Taoiseach had with President Sarkozy on the margins of last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting. </P>
        <P>We must recognise that the European focus is on the difficulties currently facing Greece. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to avail of every suitable opportunity to press our case for an interest rate reduction in respect of future interest payments both on funds already drawn down and those to be drawn down in future from the EFSF and EFSM. In this context, I would refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 152 of 15 June last.</P>

	<P>My Department has been advised by the bank that no discretionary bonus payments were paid to the Chief Executive or any of his management team, at the bank in respect of the 2010 calendar year.  The bank has advised that it does not operate any performance-related bonus scheme.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that the information just supplied to my Department by Anglo Irish Bank in answer to this question does not accord with material provided to my predecessor for previous Parliamentary Questions, most recently on 16th December last.  I am making further enquiries so I am in a position to provide the fullest possible information to the House.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have asked the NTMA to conduct on my behalf a review of remuneration policies and practices by the covered institutions.  This review is intended to encompass all aspects of compensation and is not limited to salary. This would include non-salary items such as annual discretionary bonus, guaranteed bonus, contractual bonus, cash long term incentives, deferred bonus and retention payments. This review exercise is ongoing.</P>
        <P>In light of the discrepancy in the information that my Department has just received, I have requested an urgent report from the bank, which will provide full and accurate information and an explanation of why this was not forthcoming in December 2010.  I will advise the Deputy further when this report is received and assessed by my Department.</P>

        <P>No additional funding was made available in Budget 2011 for a further expansion of the 2010 Activation Fund.

	<P>It appears from the details supplied by the Deputy that the student in question is availing of  the graduate entry option to pursue a primary degree in medicine.  To avail of this entry route, a primary degree in another discipline is necessary.</P>
        <P>In general, under the student grant schemes, students cannot qualify for grant assistance or free tuition fees for a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously.  The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study.</P>
        <P>However, institutions participating in the graduate medical programme have been requested to provide accompanying services and supports to facilitate the participation of disadvantaged students in the programme.  Details of these services and supports are available from the relevant institution.</P>
        <P>In addition, Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses in approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U.

	<P>The overall finding of the Report of the Review of Employment Regulations Orders and Registered Employment Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms was that the basic framework of the current ERO/REA regulatory system requires radical overhaul so as to make it fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances and labour market conditions.</P>
        <P>The Report does not recommend, nor have I proposed, specific adjustments in wage rates and other conditions of employment for employees covered by EROs/REAs, including in the catering sector.</P>
        <P>Workers are protected by contracts of employment and proposed reform of the wage setting mechanisms would not if implemented, change the terms of those individual contracts. What is proposed would have the effect of changing how pay and conditions are set in order to make the operation of the machinery more flexible and prevent businesses being left behind by changing economic circumstances. Existing employees would not have their current entitlement affected by future changes to EROs unless (a) it is already stipulated in their contract of employment that they be paid at the prevailing rate of pay and conditions set by the relevant ERO or (b) the application of alternative provisions to those specified in the ERO is agreed between the employer and the employee or the employee&rsquo;s representatives.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to proceed with urgency to a substantial reform of the current JLC / REA regulatory system in order to protect existing jobs in these vulnerable sectors of the economy and to increase the likelihood of employment in these sectors being increased. This will restore competitiveness in key sectors of the economy, including the hospitality sector which is crucial to our tourism product offering, and complement the restoration of the recent cut to the National Minimum Wage thereby providing an adequate floor for lower paid workers.</P>
        <P>The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for enforcing minimum statutory employment rights entitlements in the State. In undertaking its role, NERA carries out a range of functions, including inspections of places of employment and employment related records. NERA plays a central role in ensuring, on the one hand, that individual employees get their minimum employment rights entitlements, which are provided for in legislation and, on the other hand, in ensuring that there is a level playing for all employers in relation to compliance with statutory employment rights provision. The primary objective of NERA is to work with employers to seek compliance with the legislation and rectification of breaches where these are identified, including redress for employees concerned and payment of any wages underpaid to employees.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <P>In 2010, the last full year for which figures are available, NERA carried out 415 inspections on employers covered by one of the two EROs applicable in the catering sector. Breaches were detected in 255 instances. Unpaid wages secured as a result of NERA&rsquo;s intervention amounted to &euro;176,600.</P>
        <P>The figures for inspections carried out in this sector during 2011 up until the end of May show 183 inspections undertaken, with breaches detected in 137 instances and unpaid wages secured of &euro;139,858.</P>

	<P>I am very concerned about the job losses that have been announced and of the impact that they have had on the workers concerned and their families as well as the communities affected.</P>
        <P>I understand that Vodafone Ireland, which is not an IDA or EI client, has announced this as a part of a review of its European operations and which will also impact on its operations in other EU Member States.  I am advised, as part of this process, that the company has been in discussions with unions and its Irish Call Centre contract partner, Rigney Dolphin.  I am aware that Vodafone has decided that a portion of the existing contracted call centre operations in Dundalk and Dublin will be moved to other locations &mdash; Egypt and India &mdash; within the Vodafone Group and to other specialist contractors in Ireland.</P>
        <P>This decision will impact 45 Vodafone roles and 139 in Rigney Dolphin &mdash; the 139 staff are employed by Rigney Dolphin but are in-sourced to Vodafone and are based at its sites in Dublin and Dundalk.  I have been assured that Rigney Dolphin will work through the implications of the redundancies with their employees.</P>
        <P>I also understand that all impacted Vodafone employees will be offered the opportunity to transfer to alternative roles within Vodafone Ireland, and voluntary redundancy packages will be offered.  A consultation process is now underway with all Vodafone employees affected by the decision to finalise the alternatives available. The changes to Vodafone Call Centre operations will take place in late 2011 and early 2012.</P>
        <P>My officials and Minister of State Sean Sherlock recently met with Vodafone.  The company explained that in the current market environment, cost efficiencies are a prerequisite so as to ensure their continued ability to compete in the Irish market where they employ over 1,000 people.  In particular, this includes being in a position to make major funding investments in Ireland that will be required in the future to compete in the market. I have indicated that I am available to meet with the Communications Workers Union to discuss their concerns.</P>
        <P>Job creation is central to economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.

	<P>Job creation is central to our economic recovery and the Programme for Government has job creation at its core.  The role of my Department is to ensure that we have the right policies in place that will support and grow our enterprise base in order to facilitate both job creation and job retention.  The Jobs Initiative announced on 10 May focuses our limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.  </P>
        <P>The Initiative has a significant focus on tourism and the reduction in the VAT Rate and the abolition of the travel tax will provide an important stimulus to tourism businesses in Co. Longford and around the country.</P>
        <P>The programmes supported by my Department and its agencies will be critical in achieving economic growth through promoting the export potential of enterprise in Ireland and driving our Smart Economy.  The allocation of &euro;508 million in funding for 2011 will ensure that the core programmes of the enterprise agencies are sustained and targeted as well as driving investment in research and development.  This investment in the Enterprise Development agencies will drive recovery in the economy by facilitating the winning of foreign direct investments, the growth of indigenous exports and the creation of sustainable jobs.</P>
        <P>Two Industrial Development agencies under the aegis of my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together with Longford County Enterprise Board (CEB) support enterprise development in the County.</P>
        <P>The primary role of IDA Ireland is the attraction of high quality Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Ireland.  An integral and fundamental element of this role is the agency&rsquo;s mandate to promote sustainable and balanced regional development. Longford is traditionally a centre of manufacturing for foreign direct investment, and has been comprehensively marketed by IDA Ireland  as part of an integrated Midlands Region.  This marketing programme has already yielded significant results for the area and there are six IDA supported companies in Longford employing more than 600 people.  In addition to marketing Longford as a location for new inward investment, IDA continues to work with its existing client base in the County encouraging them to expand their presence in the County.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has 58 clients in Co. Longford employing over 1,700 people.  Since 2008, the agency has made payments of approximately &euro;6.4m to clients in the county.  This funding has helped companies to create and retain employment, to explore new markets for products and services and to build innovative capacity.  Some 21 innovation vouchers to the value of &euro;105,000 have been awarded to companies in Co. Longford.  The vouchers are designed to assist small Irish firms access innovative solutions available in the higher education sector and give them financial support to get on the first rung of the innovation ladder.</P>
        <P>The fifth Midlands and West Enterprise Programme is due to commence in July 2011.  This programme supports high growth entrepreneurs to incubate their business ideas. The programme is a one-year programme, run jointly between Athlone Institute of Technology and the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and in partnership with Enterprise Ireland.  Ten new high potential entrepreneurs from the Midlands have participated on the programme for each of the last four years.  These entrepreneurs spend the year incubating their businesses with the <Col N="378"/>assistance of a range of customised supports aimed at developing sustainable export oriented businesses.</P>
        <P>In 2011, Longford County Enterprise Board has continued to assist micro-enterprises throughout the County by both direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters and through, where appropriate through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice designed to help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation and to boost employment creation and retention.  At present there are 680 enterprises supported by Longford CEB, employing almost 1,000 people.  Since its inception in 1993, the Board has paid out almost &euro;5m in support to local enterprises in Co. Longford.</P>

        <Quest>  the action being taken by him to improve the low levels of expenditure on research and development in the Longford and Westmeath region, in view of the fact that this low level of expenditure inhibits innovation and job creation in the region, particularly in County Longford; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

	<P>The drive to encourage Irish companies to use science, technology and innovation to increase competitiveness and value added is a significant pillar of government policy. As the government agency responsible for the development and promotion of the indigenous business sector, Enterprise Ireland provides support to maximise the R&amp;D and innovative potential of Irish firms in order to increase their capability to create new products, services and exports, which result in additional employment opportunities within these firms and in the wider community with which they interact.</P>
        <P>Cognisant of the difficulties and the investment requirements in starting an R&amp;D activity for the first time, the programme of company R&amp;D supports are designed to provide support for research, development and technological innovation relevant at all stages of company development and supports companies in their progress from an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities.</P>
        <P>The Innovation Voucher initiative in particular is playing an important role in opening up access for small companies to a wide source of innovative acumen available in Irish Institutes of Technology, Universities and other public research bodies. The Initiative aims to drive an innovation cultural shift within small enterprise by promoting and encouraging a transfer of knowledge between Ireland&rsquo;s public knowledge providers and the small business community and in the process creating on-going and lasting synergies between the two.  The programme provides vouchers worth &euro;5,000 that can be used by the average small Irish company to bring in knowledge that is new to the company. Since 2008, &euro;380,000 worth of Innovation Vouchers has been awarded to companies in Westmeath and &euro;30,000 worth of Vouchers has been awarded to Longford based companies. These Vouchers have been strongly promoted and feedback from companies has been positive, confirming that the application procedures, level of funding, the low level of bureaucracy and the frequency of calls are welcome features of this initiative.</P><Col N="379"/>
        <P>Direct R&amp;D funding for larger projects is also available under the R&amp;D Fund, which will enable companies to progress from undertaking an initial research project to higher level innovation and R&amp;D activities. Since 2008 &euro;567,000 worth of funding has been awarded to Longford based companies and &euro;1.4m awarded to Westmeath companies.</P>
        <P>Increased innovation and start-ups particularly in the high technology sectors are vital to the future growth of the Midlands.  In this context, a grant of &euro;2.54m was approved in order to establish the Midlands Innovation &amp; Research Centre (MIRC), which offers a range of supports to entrepreneurs who wish to start a new, export focused, technology based business. The 800m<sup>2</sup>  facility at Athlone Institute of Technology has, as of December 2010, seven companies occupying units, employing 24 people, as well as 13 emerging entrepreneurs making use of the hot-desk facilities at the centre.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also funds applied research and supports the industry engagement capabilities of Universities and Institutes of Technology.  Since 2009,  Athlone Institute of Technology has been awarded over &euro;4.6m in order to bolster their industry relevant research capabilities. This includes ongoing support for the Applied Research Enhancement Centre &mdash; SUNAT (Seamless Use through Network Abstraction Technologies), which is a translational research centre in the area of seamless communications and specialises in adaptive networking technologies.</P>
        <P>Through the vote of my Department, funds will continue to be provided to support and encourage enterprises, in particular small enterprises, to engage in R &amp; D through a mix of funding, advice and expertise in order to help businesses transform in terms of improved productivity, greater efficiencies and achieving necessary product and service innovation to support growth and jobs.</P>

        <P>In order to achieve this objective, Science Foundation Ireland operates a range of funding programmes with funding determined on the basis of world-class research excellence and utilising a competitive process of international peer review. Funding of research proposals is dependent on the availability of funding at any given time and notifications of funding calls including eligibility criteria are publicised on the Foundation&rsquo;s website from time to time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The health insurance levy is first and foremost a matter for the Minister for Finance while the Minister for Health has overall responsibility for health insurance.  I have no direct role in this area.  I understand however that the levy, which is a replacement for the risk equalisation scheme deemed by the Supreme Court as an illegal state aid, was introduced to uphold the principle of community rating in the health insurance market.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Section 29(3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.

        <askee>Minister for Social Protection</askee>
        <Quest>  if, in respect of Government plans to increase the retirement age to 66 in 2014, there is a provision for those who are contractually obliged to retire at age 65 and will retire in 2014 and will therefore not be entitled to receive their contributory pensions until one year after they finish work.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[18035/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The effective date for standardisation of State pension age is 1 January 2014.  Therefore, anyone who retires in 2014 will not receive State pension (transition).  Should an individual not be able to remain in employment past the age of 65, he or she would be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment for the period between the cessation of employment and the State pension age of 66.</P>
        <P>The background to the changes in State pension age is that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  Life expectancy is increasing.  The population share of those aged 65 and over is expected to more than double between now and 2051, from 11% to approximately 22-26% around 2050 - 2060.  In contrast, the share of the working age population is projected to decline gradually from 68% to 58%.</P>
        <P>There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by mid-century.  Spending on public pensions, that is, social welfare pensions and public service occupational pensions, is projected to increase from approximately 5&frac12; % of GDP in 2008, to almost 15% in 2050.</P>
        <P>Therefore, as provided for in the National Pensions Framework, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardisation of State pension age at 66.  State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  The legislative changes being included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011 also fulfil one of the commitments in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.</P>

There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 when the intake rose to 32,432.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  In the context of dealing with the considerable number of appeals now on hand, the Department has made a further 9 additional appointments to the office in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person&rsquo;s oral hearing will be <Col N="384"/>heard, but she/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</P>

	<P>Under Section 40 of the Wildlife Acts, the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction by other means of vegetation growing on uncultivated land or in hedges or ditches is prohibited during the nesting and breeding season for birds and wildlife, from 1 March to 31 August. This is subject to certain specific exceptions. In most instances, it is required by law that work to hedgerows is undertaken outside this period. However, it is accepted that in some cases, trimming may be necessary, during the prohibited period, on grounds of public health and safety, notably when new road hazards are detected that require hedge trimming or vegetation clearance. Local authorities and relevant public bodies are reminded annually of their responsibilities in this regard.  I have no proposals at this time to change the prohibition period.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary responsibility for the promotion of angling rests with Inland Fisheries Ireland who are committed to ensuring that angling continues to be recognised as a valuable national asset and to achieve the maximum benefit to the Exchequer by promoting angling as a leisure pursuit and by developing the tourism potential of the resource.</P>
        <P>As with all our national parks, a key objective of Killarney National Park is to ensure the conservation of the flora and fauna species within the area, including the conservation of certain fish species.  However, in tandem with this principle, the park does provide for recreational activity which will not damage the protective status of the park and in this regard, provision is made for sustainable angling.</P>
        <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department has taken a range of measures to promote angling in the park while at the same time ensuring the conservation of the freshwater ecosystems and fish populations there.  NPWS continuously maintain slipways &amp; mooring points which are used by anglers and a purpose built weighing room &amp; shelter for anglers was recently constructed.  NPWS liaises with a number of angling organisations on an ongoing basis &mdash; such as Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the Laune Anglers Association, Lough Lein Anglers and Munster anglers &mdash; in relation to angling and conservation issues and has also worked with them to ensure that no invasive species are introduced into Killarney lakes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the summer months angling competitions are regularly held on the lakes &mdash;  nearly on a weekly basis &mdash; and anglers come from all over Munster and further afield to compete in these. Recently, the European Ladies Freshwater angling championship was hosted there. Apart from organised competitions, anglers can independently fish using one of the many licensed boats on the lakes.</P>

	<P>As in previous years the Muckross Gardens continue to be managed and maintained to the highest possible standards, as evidenced by the many positive comments from visitors to the gardens and also the very favourable mention of the gardens in a magazine, <i>The Irish Garden</i>, last year.  As with all gardens, climatic conditions can have a marked bearing on the appearance of the Muckcross Gardens.  In this regard, it should be noted that the past two winters have been the coldest since records began at the weather station in Muckross.  Unfortunately, due to these exceptionally cold winters many of the Southern Hemisphere and tender plants in the Gardens were damaged or lost.  However the dedicated staff at Killarney National Park are continuing their work on the rehabilitation or removal and replacement of damaged shrubs and plants with a view to restoring Muckross Gardens to pristine condition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised since 1999 and, since then, has seen the steady growth and development of vibrant well-regulated competition in the provision of the full range of telecommunications products and services. </P>
        <P>The Government is not a player in this market and can only intervene in cases of market failure.  Such interventions, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme, are subject to State Aid clearance by the EU Commission.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</P>
        <P>The mapping exercise carried out to determine which areas could be included in the NBS found that there was at least one commercial operator active in the Leitrim village area and consequently it was excluded from the scheme.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that are not currently capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I have recently launched a Rural Broadband Scheme.  This scheme aims to identify the remaining individual premises in rural Ireland, outside of the NBS areas that are unable to obtain a broadband service and to provide a basic broadband service to those premises, where requested.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (<i>www.dcenr.ie</i>) or through contacting my Department on lo-call 1850 678100.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband to every home and business in the State.</P><Col N="387"/>
        <P>Earlier this month, I convened a meeting of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), which I chair.  The Taskforce comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  Its purpose is to discuss how best to deliver the optimal policy environment and to identify a roadmap for the speedy delivery of high speed broadband across Ireland.  The Taskforce will consider issues such as appropriate targets, investment plans, and the role of Government policy and actions in driving and facilitating investment.</P>
        <P>I expect that the NGBT will be helpful in terms of identifying the optimal policy position to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2002 National Spatial Strategy is a 20 year planning framework designed to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions.  It provides the spatial vision and principles for statutory regional planning across the eight regions and for development plans at a local level.</P>
        <P>The NSS identified nine gateway cities/towns and nine hub towns, including the linked midlands gateway of Athlone, Mullingar and Tullamore.  The gateway in this region was identified as having the capacity to support the stronger urban-rural structure needed to drive development of the midlands region.  In support of this gateway role, as the NSS notes, other county and large towns, such as Portlaoise and Longford, which are strategically placed on national road and rail links, can be enhanced in competitive terms to drive development at the county level.  In addition, the NSS notes that Portlaoise has strong national development potential as a transport hub and distribution centre or inland &lsquo;port&rsquo;, given its location on several national road and rail routes.</P>
        <P>A comprehensive review of the implementation of the NSS was undertaken during 2010, culminating in the publication in October 2010 of the NSS Update and Outlook Report  (available at <i>www.environ.ie</i>).  This report reaffirms the commitment to implementing long-term planning frameworks such as the NSS and identifies new priorities and objectives to deliver more consistent implementation at all levels, taking account of experience since 2002 and the new environmental, budgetary and economic challenges that we are currently facing.  In particular, the 2010 Report identifies a series of actions in respect of:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />better alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructure investment;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />improved governance at national, regional and local levels; and</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, both in rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies,</P>
        <P FLI="0">with the aim of maximising the role of NSS implementation in supporting overall economic recovery.</P>
        <P>In addition, the adoption of updated Regional Planning Guidelines in 2010 for the 12 year period to 2022 and the new legislative provisions to include core strategies in development plans, taking account of regional policies, targets and priorities, are further embedding the NSS principles into the forward-planning process and should help to deliver more co-ordinated, coherent and sustainable planning outcomes.</P>

As such it is a matter for Kildare County Council to develop its social housing programme and decide on appropriate modes for its delivery, including through the CAS scheme, while taking into account existing funding commitments, available funding resources and specific social housing needs in its area. It is incumbent on the Council and my Department to focus the limited resources available towards meeting identified need as soon as possible through the most cost effective solutions.</P>

	<P>A new tenant purchase scheme under the provisions of section 90 of the Housing Act, 1966 - the 2011 Tenant Purchase Scheme &mdash; was introduced in February to allow local authority tenants to avail of a discount of up to 45% on the market price of a house they are eligible to purchase under the scheme.  This scheme applies only to tenants of 10 years standing or longer, and will be open for applications only until the end of 2011. </P>
        <P>The purchaser and/or his/her family must live in the house for 20 years, unless the local authority gives consent to relax this condition.  If the purchaser wishes to sell the house within 20 years, the consent of the local authority must be obtained. This consent may be refused in certain circumstances. These conditions are similar to those applied in the 1995 scheme.</P>
        <P>The new scheme does not replace the existing 1995 Tenant Purchase Scheme, which remains in place for tenants with up to 10 years tenancy and provides for a maximum discount of 30%.  However, as announced in June 2010, it remains the intention that the tenant purchase arrangements be wound down in 2012 to be replaced by a new scheme based on the incremental purchase model.

	<P>Peace Commissioners are appointed by the Minister pursuant to section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The Office of Peace Commissioner is an honorary appointment for which there is no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services.</P>
        <P>An application for appointment may be submitted by a person on their own behalf or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment.  Appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in their <Col N="395"/>local communities.   Persons, who are members of professions engaged in legal work and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation.  Civil servants are usually only appointed where it is a requirement for the performance of their official duties i.e. on an ex-officio basis.  Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.</P>
        <P>The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment as these are made at the discretion of the Minister and with regard to the needs of particular areas.</P>

	<P>Since the mid 1990s the Department of Defence has been engaged in a programme of disposing of surplus properties and using the proceeds for reinvestment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces. The former Connolly Barracks is one such property.   I wish to advise the Deputy that I have received no proposal in relation to Connolly Barracks.  The Midland Regional Authority undertook a feasibility study into the possible use of the former barracks for a range of activities.  The acceptance and implementation of the recommendations of the Connolly Barracks Feasibility Study is a matter for the two Local Authorities who commissioned the study. The Department has no role in this regard.  I understand that the Local Authorities are still considering the report and the challenges in providing funding for the acquisition of the barracks.  In that context Longford County Council has expressed some interest in acquiring the Barracks and discussions with the Council are at a preliminary stage. In the event of these discussions not reaching a satisfactory outcome Connolly Barracks will be disposed of taking account of the market conditions so as to maximise the return to the Defence Forces. </P>
        <P>In the meantime the Departmental officials concerned have been in contact with the County Council to see if a basis exists to bring the discussions to a mutually satisfactory conclusion.  These discussions will be advanced once the Authorities have completed its consideration of the report.</P>

        <P>With regard to the EU-wide Review, which is currently ongoing, this was undertaken in response to the strong criticism expressed by the Court of Auditors of the procedures for the designation of intermediate Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) in the European Union. These criticisms were based on the number and variety of criteria used to designate intermediate LFAs (Member States have used more than 100 criteria) and the lack of transparency.</P>
        <P>Member States were asked to map areas of natural handicap against new biophysical criteria and send their simulations to the Commission, after which a reformed scheme can be drawn up. Member States, including Ireland, have submitted the requested simulations.  It is intended that any new LFA proposals proposed by the EU Commission will form part of the wider proposals on CAP post 2013, which should be published later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 104 of the Finance Act 2007 amended the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to grant stamp duty relief where a farmer sells qualifying land and purchases qualifying land in order to consolidate his or her holding. To be eligible to claim the stamp duty relief, the sale and purchase of qualifying land(s) must occur within 18 months of each other and before 30 June 2011. Land sold and purchased as part of a Farm Consolidation must comply with the following conditions: the land must be in the State; the land must be agricultural land or afforested land &mdash; it cannot include bog land; and the land must not contain residential buildings.</P><Col N="398"/>
        <P>Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, issues Farm Consolidation Certificates to qualifying farmers in respect of applications that comply with the conditions of farm consolidation. I understand that the application in respect of the individual concerned was refused in 2008 on the basis that one folio contains a residential dwelling and that the land sold contains an area of bog land which is also ineligible. Administration of the Farm Consolidation Certificate is an operational matter for Teagasc and accordingly the Minister has no role in resolving the issues referred to.</P>

	<P>I have responsibility for the implementation of the National Child Care Investment Programme (NCIP) under which capital funding was made available to community and commercial child care providers for the development and refurbishment of child care facilities. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The person referred to by the Deputy was approved under the programme for capital funding amounting to &euro;100,000 in 2006.  In order to protect this investment of public funding, applicants are contractually obliged to provide the child care service for which funding was granted for a set period from the date the final instalment was made, in this case for seven years which will end in August 2015.</P>
        <P>As the service closed in August 2009, my Department is obliged to ensure that decommital and recovery procedures are instigated.  I understand that Pobal, who assist my Department with the administration of the NCIP, are taking the necessary steps in this regard.  I regret to <Col N="400"/>advise the Deputy that as these are legal obligations, my Department is not in a position to exempt individuals from their contractual commitments under the programme.</P>

        <P>The Implementation Plan which was prepared arising from the findings of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse committed to the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers to this service.</P>
        <P>An additional 200 social workers were recruited by the HSE in 2010.  The HSE has made provision in its 2011 National Service Plan for the recruitment of a further 60 posts this year.  The filling of social work vacancies and the recruitment of additional social workers was exempted from the current public sector recruitment moratorium.  The recruitment of these additional staff is designed to assist the HSE in meeting its statutory obligations such that every child in care has an allocated social worker and a care plan.</P>

        <Quest>  his plans to review the issue of senior staff increments for nurses; the senior staff nurse position having been included under the Government moratorium on public sector recruitment of March 2009 in view of the fact that such positions would only be open to a small group who actually fit the criteria.  </Quest>

	<P>The inclusion of the senior staff nurse position under the moratorium was considered by the Labour Court last Autumn. In its recommendation (LCR19935) dated 1 November 2010, the Court stated that it would not for industrial relations purposes normally consider this a promotion post but rather an additional recognition of long service.  However it also stated that interpretation of the moratorium and what comes within its scope was not a matter for the Court. It stated that the moratorium was a Government decision and that Government alone could clarify its intentions as to its scope and application.  The Labour Court Recommendation is being considered at present by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</P>

	<P>I am working with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure the filling of as many as possible of some 475 NCHD posts which are due to be filled from 11 July 2011. The HSE conducted an extensive recruitment drive in India and Pakistan in recent months and succeeded in identifying 439 potential candidates for NCHD positions in Ireland.  I have held meetings involving my Department, the Medical Council, medical training bodies and the HSE with a view to identifying measures to facilitate the <Col N="401"/>appointment of suitably qualified doctors from abroad.  Drafting of a Bill to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 2007, to enable the Medical Council to register doctors in supervised posts for a defined period, is at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that the necessary steps are being taken to ensure the ongoing safe delivery of service in hospitals and in emergency departments in particular. I am advised that while significant staffing problems remain at both SHO and registrar level in emergency medicine, it is anticipated that increasing the number of staff available to general surgery and general medicine will assist in the delivery and support of emergency department services.  In this context, the HSE is focusing on addressing particular emergency department staffing issues in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, the Midlands Regional Hospital at Mullingar, Tullamore and Portlaoise and Naas General Hospital.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this and other initiatives, it is unlikely that all NCHD vacancies can be filled by 11 July. Hospital managements are working with clinical directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented if required, to ensure that any resulting impact on services is minimised and that safe delivery of hospital services is assured. In the medium-term, ongoing reform of the system will result in changes in how care is delivered in certain locations. This will be done on a basis that takes account of the need to reduce the current reliance on NCHDs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s National Recruitment Service implemented a centralised recruitment system for staff grade physiotherapists in 2008. Since this time 237 permanent posts have been filled from the panel established in February 2008 and a further 110 temporary appointments made. These appointments were to fill many of the service developments for both Primary Care Teams and Disability services, together with replacements for existing physiotherapists who were promoted or were on maternity leave. This panel is still live with 246 candidates currently on this panel and available for employment.</P>
        <P>The HSE keeps the operation of panels under review and bases decisions on further recruitment campaigns on a number of factors including potential vacancies and whether the current panel is able to satisfy recruitment needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding the requirement in the Employment Control Framework for the health sector for a net reduction employment levels, the Framework permits the filling of replacement posts of physiotherapist, speech and language therapist and occupational therapists and also for the filling of up to 380 posts in aggregate for these occupations in addition to the end 2009 levels.  The Health Service Personnel Census indicates that between December 2009 and May 2011 (latest available data), the combined number of additional physiotherapist, speech and language therapist and occupational therapists is 258 WTE since December 2009. Of this, the number of physiotherapists employed in the public health service increased by approximately 80 WTE.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Blood Transfusion  Service (IBTS) has a public duty to ensure a sufficient supply of safe blood to meet the needs of patients in Ireland. This includes a clear responsibility to minimise the risk of a blood transfusion transmitting an infection to patients. Decisions related to deferral policies are made on the basis of  the best current scientific and medical research available and are constantly under review. The exclusion of men who have/or had sex with other men (MSM) from donation is based not only on risk factors for HIV but on other blood borne agents known to be associated with MSM behaviour. MSM continue to be over-represented in donors who test positive for blood borne infections.  While there  has been a reduction in the number of new cases of HIV, there is a continued  rise in the number of new HIV cases among MSM, who are now the majority of new  cases of HIV infection in Ireland (HIV Infection in Ireland 2010 &mdash; Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) Report). New cases of HIV infection among MSM have doubled since  2005.</P>
        <P>The IBTS would require clear and compelling evidence that there would be no increase in risk to recipients from accepting  MSM as donors. If  any country changes its acceptance criteria to allow  MSM to donate, the IBTS would consider the evidence on  which the change was made, and observe the impact of such a change on the  blood donation test results over a period of  time. </P>
        <P>The European Commission is undertaking a study project on &lsquo;Risk behaviour having an impact on blood  donor management&rsquo;.  The IBTS looks forward to considering the outcome of this project which will influence opinion across the EU. </P>

	<P>Section 67 of the Health Act 1970 places an obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to make dental services and appliances available for persons with full eligibility without charge. In addition, section 7 of  Health Act 2004 requires that the HSE have regard to the resources available to it and the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of those resources. </P>
        <P>Oral healthcare is provided to children and those with special care requirements by the Public Dental Service. Dental services for other eligible patients are provided through the Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS).  Given the current difficult position of the public finances, the budget for the DTSS has been capped at the 2008 level of &euro;63 million. The HSE is working to ensure that patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs are prioritised for treatment. In addition, free emergency dental treatment and a free oral examination every 12 months are available to all eligible patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Health, I have overall responsibility for policy in relation to health insurance.  In particular I have responsibility for governance issues relating to the VHI, including such matters as Board appointments and the receipt of its annual report and accounts.  While owned by the State, VHI is a not-for-profit company operating in a competitive market and within those constraints, like its competitors, it is free to impose certain terms and conditions.  I am on the record as opposed to this administration charge and I intend to discuss the matter further with the company.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the VHI that there are a limited number of special circumstances where they do allow a customer to breach their contract mid-year without penalty, including redundancy and emigration.  It is important to note that customers are free to cancel and change their policy at their renewal date without difficulty.</P>
        <P>VHI is required by law under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to provide contracts of insurance that are 12 months in duration. While insurers provide a facility to consumers to pay premiums over the policy year, rather than at the start of the policy, this does not change the twelve month nature of contracts.  I understand that the &euro;50 administration charge imposed by VHI is to cover the cost of the administration involved in the cancellation of a policy post-breach of the contract (it should be noted this is per policy rather than per person &mdash; the average VHI policy  involves two people).  The administration charge only arises in a breach of contract occurs.</P>
        <P>In respect of policies renewing or commencing in 2011, the current Scheme of Age-Related Tax Credits and Community Rating Levy provides for the payment by insurers of a levy of &euro;205 per adult.  It should be noted that, where customers leave before the twelve month insurance period expires, the insurer incurs a loss in relation to the levy paid as the levy may only be collected once.  If a policy is cancelled mid policy year, insurers cannot reclaim a proportion of the levy. Where a policy holder switches to an alternative insurer, the second insurer does not have to pay the levy in respect of the replacement policy, if the two policies commence in the same accounting period. In this regard, accounting periods are normally the twelve month period starting on 1 August and finishing on 31 July.</P>

	<P>According to the Performance Management Report for April, which is the latest set of figures available to me, the overall deficit in the hospital system is &euro;99m.  The overall deficit for the HSE is &euro;184m.  This poses a serious budget challenge to public hospitals and the wider health system.  It is clear that if existing spending trends remain unchecked there would be a significant overrun at the end of this year.  I have made it clear that such an overrun is not acceptable given the state of the public finances and this country&rsquo;s obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF and EU.  I am on record as saying that every individual agency must take responsibility and do everything possible to stay within budget while delivering their planned level of service.  Under its reform programme the Government has committed to achieving greater efficiencies in patient care and service delivery.  These efficiencies will not be easy to achieve but I am certain that over time they will help to ensure that more people get access to services within a given quantum of funding.  </P>

        <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors are doctors in training who, on satisfactory completion of specialist training by one of the postgraduate training bodies approved by the Medical Council, can apply for registration in the Specialist Division of the Register of Medical Practitioners and are eligible to apply for a consultant post in their specialty.  Under the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 the Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for promoting and developing specialist medical education and training and for co-ordinating such devel<Col N="411"/>opments in co-operation with the Medical Council and the relevant training bodies.  It is a matter for the HSE to undertake appropriate workforce planning for the purpose of meeting specialist medical staffing and training needs of the health service on an ongoing basis and to assess on an annual basis the number and type of specialist medical training posts required by the health service.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
        <Quest>  the number of reported incidents of MRSA or similarly transmittable infections that have been reported throughout public and private hospitals in each of the past five years to date; the degree to which action has been taken to tackle the problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs, including MRSA, continues to be a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).</P>
        <P>A National Infection Control Action Plan, launched by the HSE in 2007, aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.  The number of MRSA bloodstream infections across the public and private hospital sector for the past five years have decreased from 588 cases in 2006 to 355 cases in 2009 (a decrease of 40%) and to 304* cases in 2010.  This shows a decrease in such infections of 48% between 2006 and 2010 * (note that % figures for 2010 are provisional).</P>
        <P>Data on alcohol hand gel usage which is an important part of the hygiene effort shows a twofold increase from 2006 to 2009.  The<i> Guidelines for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Hospital in Ireland </i>  aim to promote the sensible prescribing of antibiotics.</P>
        <P>Since May 4th, 2008, C.difficile is a notifiable disease: all cases have to be reported to the relevant Department of Public Health.  The number of cases in 2008 (04/05/2008 to 31/12/2008) was 1,615, 1,895 cases in 2009 (full year), 1,698 in 2010 (full year) and 903 in 2011 to date.  The full year comparisons between 2009 and 2010 indicate a 10% decrease in the number of cases.  Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C.difficile associated Disease were published in May, 2008.  In December, 2008 the HSE published new Environmental Building Guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments.</P>
        <P>In May 2009, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) published National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of  HCAIs and the Health Service Executive (HSE) is working to ensure that its healthcare facilities meet the requirements set down in the National  Standards.</P>
        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that carbapenem resistant enterbacteriaceae (CRE) has been reported from 20 patients in four hospitals in Ireland since January 2011.  Interim national guidelines for patient screening, laboratory detection and infection prevention have been circulated pending the publication of formal national guidelines, currently in preparation.  Cases of CRE are now notifiable to the relevant Department of Public Health and it is proposed to add invasive CRE infection to the list of notifiable diseases.</P>
        <P>The recent WHO Hand Hygiene Day on 5th May last built on the successful WHO Clean Care is Safer Care campaign to galvanise hand hygiene at the point of patient care, thus helping to reduce the spread of HCAIs.  As part of the day&rsquo;s actions, healthcare facilities worldwide demonstrated their continued commitment by signing up to the global movement and undertaking and sharing locally driven activities on hand hygiene improvements at the point of patient care.  I am pleased to state that some 85 HSE healthcare facilities signed up to the <Col N="412"/>initiative which demonstrates Irish healthcare personnel&rsquo;s commitment to the control and eradication of HCAIs.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of Healthcare Associated Infections and to treat them promptly when they occur.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The upkeep and maintenance of rail bridges is funded under the Railway Safety Programme from my Department's capital budget for transport.</P>
        <P>The 3rd Railway Safety Programme, 2009 to 2013, estimated a funding requirement of &euro;513 million of which &euro;443 million was for infrastructure investment and &euro;70 million for the enhancement of safety management systems, including human performance. The allocation for the Programme for 2011 is &euro;108 million.</P>
        <P>A full report into the Malahide viaduct incident was completed in 2010, and a series of recommendations were made in areas such as future inspection standards and their implementation, training of key personnel, risk assessment of railway structures and the provision of physical and flood protection for structures at high risk.</P>
        <P>Significant changes have now taken place within Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann and within the Railway Safety Programme to address the issues identified in the report. There has been a substantial reorganisation of the IE Civil Engineering department including the appointment of a new Chief Civil Engineer and a Technical Manager for civil engineering. The Technical Manager is accountable for the safety of track and infrastructure. A thorough review of technical standards is being conducted, as well as compliance verification in areas such as inspection standards and a new competency management process is being implemented to ensure enhanced training of civil engineering staff.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport my responsibility is for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.  While the Railway Safety Programme and its funding level will be reviewed in the context of the Capital Review, which is currently underway, the first priority for use of scarce funds will be to protect and maintain existing investments and to maintain high safety standards.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann has made a submission to the Department regarding their priorities for funding under the transport capital programme and final decisions will be made in the context of the new National Development Plan to be published in the Autumn.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department, in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann, is committed to carrying out this year a Mid-Term Review of the 3rd Railway Safety Programme.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</askee>
        <Quest>  if the receiver of wreck has to put out notice in accordance with the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 Section 45 even if the owner is known.  </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together. </P>
        <P>The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 governs salvage and wreck issues. The day to day operation and implementation of the provisions in the Act is the responsibility of the relevant Receiver of Wreck, who is an official of the Revenue Commissioners (Customs).</P>
        <P>Under Section 34 of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, the salvor may request that any person liable for payment for salvage operations carried out shall provide satisfactory security to the salvor. The salved vessel shall not be removed, without the consent of the salvor, from the place where it is first kept after completion of salvage operations, until the satisfactory security is provided for the salvor&rsquo;s claim. If the requested security is not provided, and the salved vessel is in a harbour but not in the possession or control of the salvor, the salvor may request the Receiver of Wreck to detain the vessel or other property salved until either payment is made for the salvage operations, or a warrant for arrest is issued by the High Court.</P>
        <P>If the Receiver of Wreck has possession of any wreck the ownership of which was not initially known, and the Receiver has subsequently established the ownership, provision of security for salvage operations will not apply. However, the Receiver has power under Section 46 of the same Act, to require that the owner pay salvage costs to the salvor before releasing the wreck to the owner.</P>
        <P>The notice referred to in Section 45 of the Act only applies when the Receiver of Wreck, rather than a salvor or finder, is in possession of any particular wreck, and the Receiver takes possession of any wreck only when ownership is not known. Whatever knowledge a Receiver of Wreck may have concerning ownership of any particular wreck in his or her possession may not be a reason to forego implementation of the notice procedure provided in Section 45.</P>
        <P>My Department does not keep details of individual cases.  I would ask the Deputy to contact the relevant Receiver of Wreck for any clarification required in relation to any specific case that is of interest to him.</P>
