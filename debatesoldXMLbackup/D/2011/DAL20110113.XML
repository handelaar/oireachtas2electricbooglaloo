    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32</Title>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss the proposed closure in June 2012 of the three private agricultural colleges at Mountbellew in County Galway, Gurteen in County Tipperary and Pallaskenry in County Limerick, particularly given that more than one third of all agriculture students now attend private colleges; to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food whether he is aware of the huge increase in the numbers attending agricultural colleges; to ask if it is acknowledged that the ambitious targets set out for the agriculture industry by 2020 cannot be achieved without a conveyer belt of trained young farmers coming on stream every year; and to state in the House that if the Mountbellew college is closed, there will be no agricultural college in the west of Ireland, which is a matter of grave concern to everybody in the region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national and local importance, namely, the danger of fatalities across the country due to the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of the health sector and the unacceptable number of patients on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, with yesterday&rsquo;s countrywide figure of 492 patients rising towards last week&rsquo;s high of 569 and, locally, a total of 21 patients waiting on trolleys at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, which is heading towards last week&rsquo;s figure of 29.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the Department of Transport&rsquo;s value for money report on regional airports which issued yesterday.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, immediately acted on the report by announcing cutbacks to public service obligation routes to Ireland West Airport Knock, Sligo Airport and Galway Airport.  The report also recommended investment in regional airports, particularly Ireland West Airport Knock, but the Minister has ignored that section and is instead using the report as a blunt instrument to cut without consultation or balance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 32 to discuss the statement by the Minister for Finance that the privatisation of State assets has been discussed with the IMF and the European Commission as part of the measures required to be implemented for the State to comply with the conditions attached to the programme of financial assistance; and to consider the serious implications this would have for existing State companies and the services they provide to the public.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business</Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 1, Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage.  Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 84, motion re water utilities (resumed), to be taken after the Order of Business, and shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to put to the House today.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To raise a brief point, while there are no proposals the T&aacute;naiste has nevertheless indicated the ordering of business for today in respect of the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies object to the facilitation of this proposal.  This legislation will spell the unravelling of our postal services and An Post, threaten the existing service to rural Ireland and put jobs at risk.  We strongly object to the proposition, even if I cannot&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is the prerogative of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;call a vote on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of the communications legislation on today&rsquo;s Order Paper, I assume the Taoiseach has communicated to the T&aacute;naiste the position arising from the question Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked yesterday about attendance at a function in Druid&rsquo;s Glen.  I ask her whether the Taoiseach gave her a full account of the matter and if she is happy to accept what he has said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We spent a considerable amount of time on this matter yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps we will return to it next week as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to what the Deputy had to say on yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach dealt with all these issues in the House yesterday, I fully support his version of what happened and, moreover, others outside of politics have indicated what discussions took place on that occasion.  If the Deputy does not believe the truth, that is a sad reflection on a man who purports to be the next Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her comments.  We now know that she, at least, accepts what she heard in this Chamber.  However, the position appears to be that Mr. Gray, who was referred to as attending that function, was invited for another reason, about which he was very clear.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="513"/>
        <P>He was invited formally to discuss opportunities and potential for small business, job creation and other aspects of the economy.  The Taoiseach said he was there to have a chat with friends.</P>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Kenny wishes to pursue this matter, we will have to find a recognised procedure for doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time I stand up, the Ceann Comhairle is off his mark within ten seconds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It is a matter of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday he allowed the Taoiseach to respond for 11 minutes without interruption&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;after he read out the rules.</P>
        <P>My point is that Mr. Alan Gray has a very different view from what was said in this House yesterday.  The Taoiseach said he was shooting the breeze, having a chat with people and that it was purely a social evening.  Mr. Gray was invited to what appeared to be a formal meeting to give his views on job creation, small business, the economy and incentives for employment, which would be a very worthwhile discussion in its own right.  However, Mr. FitzPatrick said publicly on a number of occasions that his favourite source of investment advice was the <i>Financial Times </i>website and <i>The Economist </i>but that for the real McCoy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Kenny is going to pursue this matter, we will have to find another way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is entirely inappropriate for the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the T&aacute;naiste satisfied there is now a direct contradiction between what the Taoiseach said yesterday and what Mr. Gray said last night?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>As a woman, does she feel she should take up golf?  It is clearly where the power is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not allow a discussion to develop on this matter on the Order of Business.  I call the T&aacute;naiste for a brief reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach dealt with this matter yesterday and I will not add to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fine.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a number of issues relating to the Order of Business.  The Order of Business before us is pathetic.  What is going on in this Chamber this morning is frankly surreal.  People in this country are struggling to survive, want to get back to work and have been hit with a big whack of an increase in Vhi premiums on top of the damage done to their pay packets and incomes this month.  More than anything else people want to get things moving again and to see some recovery and hope.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>Before Christmas the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, said:</P>
        <P FLI="0" LI="1" el="5">. .  . . .we have now reached a point where the Irish people needed political certainty to take them beyond the coming two months.  So, we believe it is time to fix a date for a general election in the second half of January 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We were told we were coming back yesterday to deal with the Finance Bill but when we came back we were told it was not only the Finance Bill but that there were four Bills.  There are now 21 Bills.  Even this morning the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has found another straw at which to clutch to try to prolong the life of the Government.  He wants to send the leaders of the Opposition away somewhere on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day &mdash; any excuse to delay the recovery this country needs.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach does not have credibility.  He was at a dinner with people from Anglo Irish Bank and they did not discuss the bank.  He played golf with the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank and they did not discuss the bank and they had dinner afterwards and discussed lending to small business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is inappropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It reminds me of what Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh said about hurling in Fermanagh and the Fiji Islands.  Anglo Irish Bank was hardly noted for lending to small business.  We have a Taoiseach who lacks credibility, a Government, many of whose members are not standing for re-election&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Gilmore is going to pursue this vein of contribution, we will have find a way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to know from the T&aacute;naiste the Government&rsquo;s timetable for the legislation we were told would be taken.  We need to have some certainty and clarity about the timetable for the completion of the legislation that arises from the budget.  We also need an assurance from the Government that it will not find one excuse after the other to delay the inevitable, that is, the fresh start, people getting back to work and getting the country working again which can happen only with the election of a new Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter was outlined by the Taoiseach yesterday.  He indicated that once the Finance Bill was completed in the spring of this year, the dissolution of the House would occur.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to the EUROSTAT figures this morning which show Irish growth is the fastest among eurozone members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not growth in jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Stabilising Exchequer returns, strong export performance, high levels of foreign direct investment and improving competitiveness are all helping Ireland to create high quality jobs and return to sustainable growth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="515"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with huge increases.  Therefore, it is important to reiterate to the people that, as a consequence of the decisions made by this Government, the domestic economy is showing strong signs of return to growth and the four year plan is a credible way in which we can move forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite everything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a question about the Order of Business.  Yesterday the Chief Whip published a list of legislation, some of which is legislation about which the Government has been distinctly unenthusiastic for the past three years.  Suddenly it is very important and must be enacted before the general election.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste answer the following question clearly?  Will she list the legislation the Government intends, or wishes, to enact before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and set out a timetable for the handling of that legislation?  It is not a difficult question and it is perfectly in order on the Order of Business.  It is particularly relevant given the commitment from Government before Christmas that there would be a dissolution of the D&aacute;il before the end of January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Four pieces of legislation are pertinent to the budget, namely, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) Bill, the Betting (Amendment) Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  Those pieces of legislation will give legislative effect to the budgetary decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are they not in the Finance Bill like always?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Social Welfare Bill is introduced on its own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a miscellaneous Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Stagg, as a whip, wants to show disregard to the legislative process, that is a matter for him.  Those are the pieces of legislation pertinent to the budget.  Other pieces of legislation, which are important, will be considered by both Houses while these pieces of legislation are going through the normal process.  That legislation has been outlined by the Chief Whip.  It will depend on how long it takes the other pieces of legislation to be considered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just looking for clarity.  Am I to understand from that answer that the only legislation the Government intends to enact before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il are the four pieces the T&aacute;naiste outlined and that the other legislation referred to will be stuck in here, there or wherever to fill the order but that it is not necessarily the Government&rsquo;s intention to have them enacted before the dissolution of the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows well that is not the situation.  There is legislation before the House today which will be enacted before the budgetary legislation is completed.  Many other pieces of legislation are on Committee and Report Stages in this House and they will be dealt with as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just looking for clarity.  I will keep this simple.  We were told the House would come back after Christmas to deal with the legislation which arose from the budget.  We expected that to be one piece of legislation, namely, the Finance Bill.  The Govern<Col N="516"/>ment has now widened that.  We have been told four pieces of legislation must be enacted arising from the budget.</P>
        <P>In terms of the commitment made before Christmas by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and the Taoiseach that the recall of the D&aacute;il after Christmas would be to deal with the legislation arising from the budget, if those four pieces of legislation are enacted, is that it?  I understand what the T&aacute;naiste said, that the Government will shove in other legislation here and there, but are they the only four pieces of legislation the Government intends to enact?  Can we have a timetable for those four Bills?  Last week we were given a draft or indicative timetable for the Finance Bill, which showed that Bill, as I understood it, concluding in the Seanad at the end of February.  What is the timetable for the other Bills?  The game being played is that we are back dealing with the legislation arising from the budget.  Before Christmas it was due to be done by the end of January.  When we got the timetable the end of January became the end of February.  Then people were told that it would be the end of March and now I understand it is April, so this is being dragged out.  It is not just that the general election is being delayed by the Government; the recovery of the country is being delayed by this crowd staying in office well past its sell-by date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have indicated to the Deputy the facts of the situation.  It is a matter for and the prerogative of the Taoiseach to decide the date of a general election.  The dissolution of the House will take place on the completion of consideration by both Houses of the Oireachtas of the finance legislation that must be introduced to give legislative effect to budgetary matters.  It is completely disingenuous and disrespectful not only to Members on this side of the House but to Opposition Members who are very anxious that other legislation is not just slotted in as the Deputy says,&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>What we are dealing with are issues that were raised by the media.  There were media reports of which I am aware to the effect that the EU was considering the question of reduction in interest rates charged to Ireland, but this is based on speculation.  At the December Council, the Finance Ministers were asked to work on a proposal to come forward by March of this year to finalise work on the intergovernmental arrangement setting up the proposed European stability mechanism.  That work is ongoing, it is confidential and it would be inappropriate to speculate on it.</P>
        <P>It is also true to say that in the negotiations between the Government, the EU and the IMF, it is manageable to deal with the interest rates that are currently available to us.  However, at the same time, we would welcome any developments which would give effect to the lowering of rates to Ireland.</P>

        <P>It is also important to say that this matter was raised by the media at a press conference yesterday where Commissioner Rehn was asked the question about interest rates being charged to Ireland.  The Commissioner pointed out that the interest rates being charged to Ireland are in line with the Council decision last year on the euro area loan facility to Greece and following intensive discussions with member states.  There is nothing further that the Government wants to comment on those considerations.</P>

	<P>I just got a notice from the Department of Finance asking me if I agree to take the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill next week on 19 and 20 January.  I advise the Ceann Comhairle and the T&aacute;naiste that the Labour Party agrees.  However, we want whoever is coming in then to be ready to discuss the chink of light that has opened in the discussions in the European Union on renegotiating this deal.</P>

Often these parliamentary questions are not answered by the Minister but sent off down the line, and in my case usually to the HSE.  However, today we reach a new low in the democracy and the running of this Parliament which really makes one wonder if we are in the dying days of a banana republic.</P>
        <P>I submitted a question to the Minister for Health and Children for discussion and answer this afternoon and the General Office edited it.  I have no problem with editing in consultation.  However, the first line of my question relates to people waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments which reached an unprecedented high of 569 in January 2011.  In their wisdom, they have removed those figures, which changes the nature of the question and denies the right to put that on the public record.</P>

Can the T&aacute;naiste explain why neither the legal costs Bill, which would save this country money, nor the health (information) Bill, which might provide us some truth about the health service, has been included in the urgent business, yet the Climate Change Response Bill, which will cost this country a fortune, is included?</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Ceann Comhairle will be glad to know I am not going to ask about what went on at Druid&rsquo;s Glen.  I am somewhat confused about what went on, as are the T&aacute;naiste and other members of the Government.  What I am concerned about is what the Taoiseach told me in this House.  I note in the list of promised legislation for this session the urgently required Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010.  I do not know that it is urgent or needed at this time.  I note the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2010 is there as well.  The Taoiseach indicated to me before Christmas that the national vetting bureau Bill was an urgently required piece of legislation and I am surprised it has not found its way onto the Order Paper.  There are less demanding and compelling pieces of legislation on it.  Will the T&aacute;naiste intercede with the Taoiseach with a view to dropping one of the less-needed pieces of legislation now proposed, such as the Dublin lord mayor Bill or some other Bills?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

She indicated on a number of occasions that it would be published in the last session but it has still not been published.  There is a major concern in the new communities in Ireland as female genital mutilation is being practised here.  I understood it was a Government priority for the Bill to be published and rapidly enacted.  Where is the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="527"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in this and he is quite right in that it is an important issue.  This matter was discussed by the Cabinet, if I remember correctly, just before Christmas.  One or two minor issues are to be completed but it is our intention to publish the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two matters I want to ask about.  The first is the NAMA amendment Bill, which is to be prioritised by the Government.  This important Bill would allow for debts of developer loans under &euro;20 million to be transferred to NAMA.  Given that billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money is involved in this Bill, is it the intention of the Government to publish any kind of White Paper or Green Paper, or even an early copy of this Bill, in order for the Opposition to examine it from a legal perspective?</P>
        <P>In the context of this new NAMA Bill, which is for loans under &euro;20 million, before Christmas I asked several questions of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills about subcontractors.  This was in the context of the collapse of Pierse Construction, which was to build schools under public private partnerships for her Department.  I am sure the Minister and every Deputy in the House is aware of different firms, individuals and families who were subcontractors and have been left in a terrible state of financial ruin.  Is it proposed in the NAMA amendment Bill to deal with that issue?  It is really important that we get advance information on the Bill&rsquo;s content so that we can assess and consider it.  Its implications will run into billions of euro for taxpayers.</P>
        <P>The second issue concerns the Climate Change Response Bill, which I understand is under consideration in the Seanad.  This Bill is very important for agriculture, industry and small and medium businesses, as well as individual consumers.  Normally, a Bill like this, which is so important for agriculture and industry, would involve&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate this in such a fashion on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A brief inquiry about promised legislation is fine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That would give rise to a consultation period with agriculture, industry and consumer interests at the very least. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made her point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Fianna F&aacute;il propose to provide for a consultation period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate like this on the Bill on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should allow the T&aacute;naiste to respond to her inquiry about the two pieces of legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The heads of the NAMA legislation were agreed by the Cabinet at our last meeting and the legislation is being drafted.  I will advise the Minister that the Deputy is anxious to get a briefing on the matter as quickly as possible.  On the Pierce Construction issue, the buildings are going ahead because of a joint venture with Sisk.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s legislation in the Upper House has been accepted by the Government for consideration in this House.  The <Col N="528"/>climate change Bill has commenced consideration in the Seanad and the consultation period began in December.</P>

        <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Phil Hogan on Wednesday, 12 December 2011:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises the social and economic hardship caused by water restrictions and disruptions for families and local businesses;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises that an inefficient, outdated and fragmented water network has contributed to drinking water supply problems across the State;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that the State spends &euro;1 billion every year in current and capital expenditure for water treatment and supply;</P>
     <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the need for significant water capital investment for the next four years and recognises the difficulty for the State in financing such investment through Exchequer funding;</P>
     <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />condemns the vast amount of waste caused by 43% of water supplies lost through unidentified leaks; and</P>
     <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes that problems associated with water shortages were discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann in January 2010 with little action taken since then to avoid a repeat of similar problems;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">calls on Government to:</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />establish a single publicly owned water utility company to take over responsibility for water investment and mains management on a national basis while allowing local authorities to tender for the provision of services;</P>
      <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />establish a new utilities commission to merge existing regulators for utilities and to take responsibility for regulating a new water utility company;</P>
     <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />reallocate future water funding from the Exchequer to prioritise water conservation by investment in water mains weather proofing; and</P>
        <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />examine all engineering resources of the State to ensure a rapid remedy to widespread burst water mains.</P>
        <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0" el="5"><Miles com="is0p4" />&ldquo;&mdash;<Miles com="is0p2" /><Miles com="ix" />recognises the difficulties for families and businesses caused by the recent water supply disruptions;</P>
         <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />acknowledges the extensive efforts by county and city councils to prepare for potential water supply disruptions caused by recent extreme weather conditions, to minimise <Col N="529"/>disruptions for households and businesses and to make alternative supplies available where necessary, and to restore water supplies as quickly as possible;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />recognises the importance of the work already carried out by the councils, and funded by the Exchequer, to develop water management systems and active leakage controls in identifying and repairing leaks;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the comprehensive review of the Water Services Investment Programme 2010&ndash;2012 completed in 2010 which:</P>
     <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />provides for ongoing major investment in water services in the 2010&ndash;2012 period, with &euro;495 million spent in 2010 and &euro;435 million provided for 2011;</P>
        <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />accords the highest priority to investment in water conservation to address the unacceptably high levels of leakage in water supply systems; and</P>
        <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />includes contracts to the value of &euro;320 million to commence on water conservation projects, including mains rehabilitation, in that period, which is more than double the investment in water conservation compared to the preceding seven years;</P>
       <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the proposals in the National Recovery Plan 2011&ndash;2014, published in November 2010, to:</P>
        <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />commence a programme of domestic metering to be funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund; and</P>
         <P el="5" LI="3"><Miles com="mdash66" />establish an independent regulator for the water sector; and</P>
       <P el="5" LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />notes the Government&rsquo;s intention shortly to commence an assessment of the need for a national water authority, which will consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the role of such an authority, the costs and benefits of establishing it and its relationship with other actors in the sector including local authorities.&rdquo;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by commending Fine Gael for bringing what could be considered a timely motion before the House regarding the delivery and infrastructure of water services across the Irish Republic.  The motion reflects a similar motion brought before the House this time last year.  We could witness severe weather conditions as an annual occurrence, and dealing with them cannot be explained as a once off or something that happens once every 500 years.  It should now be planned for and strategically managed rather than explained as unexpected.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael brought the motion before the House yesterday evening and there are a number of matters I would like to bring to people&rsquo;s attention.  One of the most notable facets of the Fine Gael proposal from last year was an ambiguity about a national utility and I am glad to see that in the wording of today&rsquo;s motion, it has been firmly described as a private sector agency.  There is some merit to the concept of a national utility in that it can deliver quality and provision nationally while also laying out a strategic plan for the delivery of water nationally.</P>
        <P>There are 34 local authorities in the country and I would be interested to see how a national utility could incorporate these.  More important is the variance in the group water schemes across the country, which are separate from the local authorities that operate.  There is a strategic benefit from such an approach and as we have seen in recent weeks, the supply of water is critical not only to households, but to businesses and the daily operation of this country.  We need to revisit the area and see a new plan.</P><Col N="530"/>
        <P>Perhaps 90% or 100% of people in this House went for a day or two without water over the Christmas period.  The hotel in which I stayed last evening does not have water from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m.  Urban dwellers in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway can no longer take for granted the availability of tapped water.  While a supply of tapped water must be guaranteed to householders, I query whether this is possible under the existing structure.</P>
        <P>As the Minister is present, I propose to raise a specific issue with him.  Last July, my party colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, submitted a question to the European Commission on the delivery of water services in various Irish regions.  He asked the Commission to indicate which Irish local authorities had applied for and received funding for water conservation measures under European Regional Development Fund programmes.  The Commission&rsquo;s reply stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">[N]o expenditure has yet been incurred in relation to water conservation investment.  On the basis, however, of information provided by the managing authority of the programme concerned (the BMW Regional Assembly) it is possible that the bulk of the works will be undertaken in 2011 and 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Will the Minister confirm that, despite being able to access European Union assistance for the delivery of water services, especially in the area of water conservation, a number of Irish local authorities have not submitted applications for such funding?  If the local authorities in question have submitted applications for EU funding, when does the Minister expect them to draw it down?</P>
        <P>We have read recently that five or six local authorities have experienced difficulties with water supply as a result of conservation and delivery problems.  A minimum of 40% of supply nationally is lost through leakage and other forms of damage.  Is it the case that funding available from the European Union to address conservation problems has not been availed of by local authorities?  I can furnish the Minister, who is responsible for overseeing local government, with a list of the relevant authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problems experienced over the Christmas highlighted how we use our water resources.  The main difficulty encountered by households was not that they did not have access to potable water for drinking but that they did not have water for other household purposes.  This is because Ireland, to my knowledge, is the only country in the northern hemisphere where water of the same quality is used for drinking and other household activities such as flushing toilets, bathing and showering and for appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines.</P>
        <P>I am not sure how long the Minister will continue in office but a number of simple measures could be taken in the short term.  As he correctly noted, the production of water is not free but comes at a substantial cost.  Ireland produces drinkable water for every conceivable means of consumption and usage.  Surely another approach is possible.  For example, we could ensure that households have means of capturing rainwater.  This would be feasible and would make sense given the abundance of rainwater in this country.  I strongly recommend that all future residential and commercial developments should have integrated rainwater capture and storage systems to ensure they are self-sufficient and can store water.  Demand on existing reservoirs would reduce if such systems were standard in all new buildings.  For this reason, they should be required in the initial planning designs for housing estates or major commercial developments.  Such a measure would reduce consumption of high quality drinking water.</P><Col N="531"/>
        <P>Water services were the subject of debate in the House almost 12 months ago to the day.  By this time next year, the Government will have changed.  It has become obvious that severe weather conditions are here to stay.  The time to plan for further extreme weather is now because the excuse that these are one-off events is no longer valid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Margaret Conlon, Michael P. Kitt, Paul Gogarty, Mary White, Timmy Dooley and Charlie O&rsquo;Connor.</P>
        <P>The latest cold spell, which was unprecedented in recent times, caused disruption in water supplies in many households, at any rate to some degree.  South of the Border the problem was handled by local authorities whereas north of the Border it was handled by the Northern Ireland Water Authority, NIWA, a similar type of structure to that the Fine Gael Party wants to establish.  North of the Border there was a major crisis in confidence in the handling of the matter and the chief executive of the NIWA resigned.  South of the Border the local authorities worked flat out, as they always do in such emergencies.  In this regard, I compliment the officials of South Tipperary County Council for the manner in which they dealt with the crisis, as they dealt with the flooding crisis.  As the Minister pointed out, local authority staff worked flexibly, as they have done during flood emergencies, to repair leaks and restore supplies.  This is the type of flexible working that is the objective of the Croke Park agreement.</P>
        <P>I would be very slow, without due consideration, to remove responsibility from local authorities for water management and supply.  They are accessible, accountable and publicly trusted.  We have seen many instances of centralised authorities which are not perceived as accessible and accountable and have caused considerable controversy.  The Health Service Executive is one such example.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that while the Fine Gael Party boasts in its policy document about how many quangos it will abolish, the first thing it does in what is, I presume, the final session of the D&aacute;il is to propose the establishment of a new quango at arm&rsquo;s length from the public, Ministers and public representatives.</P>
        <P>The analogy of the National Roads Authority was put forward, which was established primarily to deal with national roads crossing several county boundaries.  The authority came into its own slowly at first but more rapidly when large projects were engaged in from the late 1990s on.  Water supply is mainly locally based.  That is not always entirely satisfactory.  Parts of the rural district around Emly, County Tipperary, are an enclave in County Limerick.  Nonetheless, they are supplied from County Tipperary and there is no cross-border connection with the surrounding areas on three sides in County Limerick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not particularly satisfactory and needs to be examined.  Focused investment is needed.  The disadvantage of water and wastewater treatment is that the product is largely unseen or taken for granted by the public except when difficulties arise.  Investment in these matters has always been regarded as relatively politically unrewarding.  Priority needs to be given to this matter and I compliment the Minister on having done so.  The NewERA document, from which this proposal comes, conjures up notions of additional resources for a range of purposes.  I suspect that is a mirage.</P>
        <P>There is no question that a system of water meters and water charges is needed in order to conserve water use.  Perhaps there will be a free amount through a credit system.  It is preferable <Col N="532"/>that this is applicable to the circumstances of each household.  There is no question but that the user rather than the taxpayer should pay and I see no merit in the left-wing arguments against user charges.  The Minister indicated a study is under way in his Department on the proposal put forward by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to make a brief contribution to this debate.  Like others, I pay tribute to the men and women employed by local authorities who worked tirelessly during the recent cold spell.  They did so not alone to ensure we had water in our homes but to ensure the roads were safe for travel.  They were looking forward to having time off and spending it with their families over Christmas but they put that to one side and went out to ensure we could enjoy Christmas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We do not appreciate and realise the importance of water as a resource until we face disruption to the service and the consequences of the disruption to businesses, the farming community and households.  The simplest of tasks become so difficult when the water supply is disrupted.  I also compliment people in local communities.  Great community spirit was shown during the harsh weather.  People went to great lengths to ensure their neighbours, particularly elderly neighbours, had water and were looked after.  In my county, hotels provided showering facilities to people and the leisure complex in Monaghan offered free showers.  That is the kind of community spirit we need to see in times like this.</P>
        <P>When the weather conditions changed and the rapid thaw took place, it brought major difficulties for many people as pipes burst.  Many businesses and houses continue to face major challenges and difficulties as a result.  It is unfortunate that local authorities had to restrict supply.  What other option did they have?  The sources of the leaks had to be identified and repaired and this was done quite quickly in the majority of cases.  One of the most notable difficulties was where properties were unattended as people went on holidays and businesses were closed for the Christmas period.  When people came back after the holidays they found the properties in a dreadful state.  Local authorities are to be commended for making every effort to ensure tankers were brought to places to ensure families had access to water.  When the reservoirs became dangerously low, supply had to be restricted until they were replenished.</P>
        <P>We will face weather conditions like this in the future and we learned valuable lessons from 2009.  Following the recent spell of bad weather there will be lessons to be learned and we need to review contingency plans that were in place.  Where there were deficiencies, work must be done to ensure they are not repeated.  I welcome the comments of the Minister in respect of this.</P>
        <P>There has been significant investment in our water infrastructure and we need to examine how we use water.  Leaks must be identified and addressed.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh stated, we must face the reality that water must be paid for.  How many of us waste water without realising it?  Do people leave the tap running while washing their teeth?  Do people fill the kettle when they want to have a cup of tea?  People must examine how they use water in their daily lives.  Installing water meters will encourage people to conserve water and to be mindful of how they use it.</P>
        <P>The Government has a duty to continue to invest in water services.  We must ensure our water quality is of a high standard, that we have capacity to ensure businesses and households can function and that we continue to conserve water and minimise losses.  There is no comparison between how we handled the situation and our northern counterparts.  We are streets ahead.  They had major difficulties and were forced to depend on water from other areas.  We did very well in difficult circumstances.  We suffered like other countries facing challenges. <Col N="533"/> People in Australia have too much water while we did not have enough.  God help them in their difficulties.  We are not alone.  Like other countries, we faced severe weather conditions and in preparing for next winter we will have learned valuable lessons from our experience.  We will be better prepared for what will face us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; debate.  I commend the efforts of the county and city councils on the water and road problems during the cold weather we had in December.  I commend the work of staff at all hours of the day and night.</P>
        <P>On the voluntary side, I refer to the group water scheme movement.  We sometimes forget about group water schemes.  With design, build and operate schemes they provide a first-class water supply through grants from the Department.  These bring water to many people in rural Ireland who would not otherwise have a water supply.  I have worked closely in the past with the federation of group schemes and it does excellent work in dealing with the issues that affect rural families.  When water charges were abolished for householders, the group water schemes were completely forgotten.  I am glad that when Deputy Noel Dempsey was Minister, we made some changes to allow a free supply for rural households.  It can cost up to &euro;3,000 to put in place a group water scheme for individuals.  Other issues arise from this in respect of maintenance of schemes, taking over schemes, appointing caretakers and getting a majority of members to agree to the local authority taking over the scheme.  If a water authority is to be established, the issues affecting group water schemes should be addressed.</P>
        <P>I am glad that extra funding has been made available for water services in the period 2010 to 2012, including &euro;495 million in 2010 and &euro;435 million in 2011.  I am honoured to have been a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in 2008 and 2009, during which time I had responsibility for group water schemes.  We operated pilot rain water harvesting schemes as part of the water conservation measures at a farm in County Meath and a school in County Mayo, and these were very successful.  Such schemes are part of the whole education process.  Conservation measures such as these are well worth supporting, and we need to have them in order to develop water management systems and identify and repair leaks.  During the cold spell in December, leaks in the water supply led to water shortages and water supplies were restricted.</P>
        <P>I wish to mention in particular the work done by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, and the investment they are making in water services.  There are many projects in which the two Ministers are involved.  The Minister knows well my interest in the water scheme for Kilreekil, a village with no water in County Galway.  In addition, the Milltown and Claregalway sewerage schemes are on his desk, and I hope he will be able to sanction them.  However, I would also like to commend the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his introduction of the warmer homes scheme, which not only increased energy efficiency but also, in the houses that participated in the scheme, resulted in insulation of piping and attics, draught-proofing and filling of cavity walls, which was very helpful during the cold weather in December.  It was unfortunate that we had so many burst pipes, but where lagging of pipes had been carried out it was clear that such problems did not occur to the same extent.</P>
        <P>There is a major issue with the pipe network, which I do not have time to go into now.  There is much to be done with regard to promoting schemes.  We must spend money on the network as well as on the treatment plants.  I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss this.  A cold <Col N="534"/>spell such as the one that occurred in December may happen every year; it has happened for the last two years.</P>
        <P>My final request to the Government is not to forget rural water schemes.  It must ensure a good water service is provided to people who are doing it for themselves by setting up voluntary groups, and it must work with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes to ensure that water supplies are available through group schemes to rural Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Mary White.</P>
        <P>I wanted to speak on this motion because it is an important issue and one that is often overlooked.  My constituency is part of the South Dublin County Council area, which has one of the lowest rates of water leakage in the country, but even so, there are curtailments of water services every second night.  During the freeze, people were cut off; in some cases, in areas close to the Dublin Mountains, they were cut off for even longer.  The staff of South Dublin County Council worked diligently to get the necessary works done as quickly as possible, and the council&rsquo;s website provided information on what was going on.  I cannot fault the council in any way.</P>
        <P>Neither can I fault the Minister, Deputy Gormley, or his colleague Deputy Finneran.  As others have said, water conservation investment for 2010-2012 is &euro;320 million, which compares well to the amount of &euro;130 million invested in 2003-2006.  Investment has increased exponentially, even allowing for inflation.  We have a varied and decrepit pipe system, some of which goes back to the Victorian era, and it will take a long time to repair.  However, we also know that the economics of the situation do not allow for total elimination of leaks.  Instead, we must try to make sure they are minimised to the extent that no cost is incurred in bringing water from elsewhere.  Everything that can being done, bearing in mind the current economic circumstances, is being done.</P>
        <P>The final solution is to introduce domestic water charges.  The Green Party has been consistent on this issue.  We said we wanted a system under which there would be a free allocation of water and all water use above this level would be charged.  This would encourage people to conserve water.  The situation is similar to that of local authority refuse collection.  When waivers were given to those below a certain income level in south Dublin and there was no limit to the amount of rubbish that could be put out for collection, the rates of recycling were atrocious.  I do not have the figures to hand but the rates of recycling increased dramatically when people were given free tags, because they knew there was a limit to the amount of rubbish they could put out, and they would pay above that amount.  People need an incentive; that is why water charges need to be introduced.  However, there must be a fair allocation of water that is not charged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryWhite"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gogarty for sharing his time.</P>
        <P>Water is everybody&rsquo;s issue.  It knows no boundaries.  The amount we have invested in water services during our time in office &mdash; more than &euro;500 million &mdash; has been outstanding.  Even the Deputies across the floor must allow that this has been a massive investment.</P>
        <P>The &euro;19.4 million we have obtained for the main drainage schemes and water services in Carlow has been a major boost to the second smallest county in Ireland, and I thank the Minister for that.  Carlow has been flooding for more than 100 years, and when this work is <Col N="535"/>done we will be able to say goodbye to flooding once and for all.  When I was a member of Carlow County Council and there was a problem with the Troyswood water treatment plant in Kilkenny, there was not a squeak out of the Fine Gael councillors.  It was I, a councillor from a neighbouring county, who took a petition to the European Parliament to make sure the citizens of Kilkenny would have clean water.</P>

	<P>I know the Fine Gael Members are earnest in tabling the motion, on which I compliment them.  However, they fluffed it in 1997 when they could have carried out major restructuring of the water services.  In addition, there is confusion in their party.  When Senator John Paul Phelan was on a radio show with me recently, he insisted the Green Party wanted flat-rate water charges.  He was wrong.  We are not bringing in flat-rate charges; we will have a generous household allowance.  Fine Gael ought to get its house in order.  As environment spokesperson for the party, Deputy Hogan has spoken several times about the need for investment in water infrastructure, and not only in his own constituency.  However, the facts are plain.  History will recall that in 1997, when Fine Gael was in power and had the money to invest in water infrastructure, if fluffed it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this motion, which was tabled by Fine Gael.  This is a suitable time to discuss the issue in view of the difficulties that have been encountered by many of our citizens over the Christmas period.  I am speaking from experience, having been without water for four or five days over Christmas, and I know the burden it places on families and the difficulties it creates for many.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that the weather conditions we went through last month were extreme.  Although they were reminiscent of last year&rsquo;s cold weather, there were longer periods of below-zero temperatures.  Met &Eacute;ireann will confirm that the cold spell we have seen broke all records in most areas.  This is similar to the floods of last year, which were considered to be a one-in-150-year event, or greater, in terms of severity.  However, it is not the case that we should merely accept that these were extreme conditions and move on.  We must learn lessons, as we did last year with regard to the gritting of roads.  Although, in conjunction with the water problems, there were severe difficulties on the roads again this year, local authorities had a much better programme for the distribution of grit.  Even though they ran low on salt at one stage, they distributed grit to the more isolated areas for use by local communities, which was a great help.</P>
        <P>The same lessons will be learned from the experiences with water shortages and the major disruption that took place.  It has identified a number of problems that existed.  In recent years, there was a poor level of compliance with building regulations which has been highlighted by the way in which new estates were affected.  I found it particularly difficult to see housing estates that were built in the last five, six or seven years being left completely without water because the contractor failed to submerge the piping or stopcocks at the required level.  Clearly, therefore, there was a poor follow-up by surveyors and engineers, which must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I suppose, however, that there is no point in looking back and blaming anyone.  We must look to the future and to investment in particular.  In fairness to him, the Minister has had a programme under way for some time.  I am thankful for the way he has provided grant aid to replace the old water pipe network in Ennis, which has been there for a century or more.  The network has got to the point where it springs leaks even without any extreme weather conditions.  That kind of grant aid programme is important and must continue to be rolled out.</P><Col N="536"/>
        <P>In addition, we will have to find some way of reviewing water networks that have been laid much more recently, particularly in housing estates that are about to be, or have been, taken over by local authorities.  We will have to incentivise households to address this problem in conjunction with providing treated water.  The cost of treating recycled water is outrageous, given its end use.  We will have to introduce incentivised programmes in this regard.  As we have done with installation aid, we will have to do the same for the collection of recycled water or rain water that can be used in housing estates as grey water for flushing toilets and using washing machines and dishwashers.  All of that will greatly reduce the ultimate cost of treating water, which is a scarce resource.  A significant investment programme is required for our entire water infrastructure.  Since entering Government, the Minister has been focused and has done a lot in this respect.</P>
        <P>To some extent, all parties in the House have shared the blame for the lack of investment in our water infrastructure over the decades.  Successive Governments failed to act because the problem was buried in the ground.  Once consumers had water and temperatures remained above freezing point, there was little political capital to be gained for rebuilding the water pipe network.  Potholes are visible but a leak in a water pipe three or four feet underground is of no consequence to most people until the water dries up.  I compliment the Minister on what he has succeeded in doing in that regard.</P>
        <P>It would be remiss of me not to recognise the tremendous efforts made by local authority staff.  Great efforts were made by staff of Clare County Council in putting emergency teams in place over the Christmas period.  They include office staff who manned the telephone lines, in addition to engineers and workers who dealt with the leaks.  Some people did not benefit to the extent that others did in getting their water reconnected quickly.  Some suffered a more elongated period without water, but that was not the fault of local council staff who during the Christmas holidays put their shoulders to the wheel.  They did their level best and the House should recognise the importance of public service in this respect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this topical and important discussion.  It has been the tradition on such occasions to compliment our Opposition colleagues for giving us an opportunity to contribute on these matters of concern, so I wish to compliment Deputy Phil Hogan in that regard.  I am not afraid to compliment the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, either.  I heard what he has done in Clare and he has certainly been helpful to me in Dublin south west, particularly in Tallaght.  If he has an opportunity to visit Tallaght again over the next 70 days before the election, I will be delighted to welcome him there.</P>
        <P>It is important to discuss the issue of water supplies, which concerns everyone.  Whenever I contacted the Minister&rsquo;s staff I have found them to be most helpful.  Other colleagues have also referred to the efficacy of local authority staff.  I can echo that view with regard to Dublin south west where local authority staff have been very helpful.  I have had to bring concerns to their attention, however, and I have also had words with local authority management concerning issues that were brought to my attention.  Water shortages must be dealt with effectively at community level.</P>
        <P>We have all seen the television images of floods in Australia, which highlights the fact that we have no control over extreme weather conditions.  The adverse weather conditions in December brought home the problems associated with meteorological extremes.  We need to learn from <Col N="537"/>mistakes that were made in previous years.  I am glad that there has been a lot of progress in that regard, although people were left without water in the recent freezing conditions.</P>
        <P>In common with other colleagues, I received many calls over the Christmas period arising from the adverse weather, particularly concerning water shortages.  People may have been somewhat surprised to see me entering my constituency office on Christmas day.  I am not saying this to sound virtuous, but I was dealing with calls from people in different parts of my constituency who had been left without water.</P>

People sometimes forget that there are rural communities in my constituency, even though it is a major urban area.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country, but there are isolated farms in the Bohernabreena hills.  People were upset that the gritting did not reach them in some areas, and also that they were left without water for several days.  We are entitled to be concerned about these issues.

	<P>My parish priest, Father Frank Herron, is from Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s community.  He would verify everything I say because I always tell the truth in here.  I am not afraid to make the point that people are still telling me they were left without water for several days.  I hope the county manager in Tallaght does not think I am saying anything different because there was a positive response from his staff who were on duty fairly quickly after the Christmas holidays.  As Deputy Gogarty said, they sent us informative data almost immediately telling us what the difficulties were.  In case people think the problems are over, however, myself, Deputy Gogarty and others in south Dublin received a memo only last evening telling us there will be more restrictions.  Following a review of the situation throughout the Dublin region, South Dublin County Council will be reducing water restrictions every second night for the next six nights.  For example, there will be serious restrictions tonight and major works will be carried out in Greenhills in my constituency tomorrow.  The problem has not gone away even though the weather has stabilised.</P>
        <P>Oireachtas Members are meeting with the South Dublin County Council county manager, Mr. Joe Horan, on Monday.  One of the things I will bring to his attention is the need to be better prepared for the next adverse weather event.  We do not know whether it will happen this spring or next winter, but we must be prepared.  This is about dealing with the concerns of communities whose inhabitants feel they should be able to access water at all times.  I agree that as far as possible we should conserve water.  We need to be clear and positive about that.  Is the Ceann Comhairle indicating that I must finish?</P>

	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan, for bringing this motion before the House.  It is an indictment of the lack of positive action on the part of the Government to deal with the repercussions of recent severe weather conditions.  It is a year since the last winter crisis but in the intervening 12 months, nothing has been done to prevent a recurrence of the mayhem it caused.  In Dublin alone not 1 km of mains has been replaced in that time.  The failure to replace substandard water mains has left the country once again at the mercy of severe weather conditions, with people forced to endure the misery of a Christmas period without essential water supplies. The country effectively has been brought to its knees as householders, businesses and schools experienced the ill-effects of that inaction by the Government.  It seems everybody but the Government knows that freezing conditions are eventually followed by a thaw and, once again, it was not prepared.</P>
        <P>In my own constituency of Longford-Westmeath, demand for water exceeded supply by as much as 50% in certain areas over the Christmas period, according to Longford County Council.  Water levels in the county&rsquo;s reservoirs decreased on account of frozen and burst pipes, with a subsequently enforced curtailment of supply to local businesses and homes.  One disgruntled home owner observed that it is a total disgrace in the 21st century that we have to queue for water when this was never the case during harsh winters in the past.</P>

        <P>The water shortage can in part be attributed to leaks in private properties, typically occurring in vacant houses and industrial and retail units.  These are the ghosts of the Celtic tiger.  That is the nub of the matter &mdash; it is another example of the burden imposed on us by the greed of speculators, developers and the Government, which saw residential and industrial estates thrown up without proper regulation and in a piecemeal fashion, for dubious tax returns.  Building regulations from the late 1970s supposedly required that all services be protected from weather conditions, with the pipes to all new properties to be laid to a minimum of 600 millimetres below ground.  In many cases these requirements were not met in the scramble to develop new estates, and householders have suffered the consequences.</P>
        <P>There has been huge anger at the hardships householders have had to endure.  The already struggling service industry has faced another serious drop in business.  Bars, restaurants, and hairdressers have been particularly hard hit, with business owners not receiving a reliable supply in return for their water rates.  It is scandalous that these problems have arisen not merely as a result of seasonal weather conditions.  At the best of times, nearly half the water supply from our reservoirs is leaked through pipes that are not fit for purpose and subsequently lost to users.</P>
        <P>Water supply will be the major planning issue of the 21st century.  While inward investment is the life blood of any locality and hard fought for by local authorities, a casual attitude to planning &mdash; on a build now, think later basis &mdash; will continue to be a recipe for disaster.   Water infrastructure must come first with the rest to follow, rather than the other way around.  Good <Col N="539"/>quality drinking water and the means to treat sewage effectively are essential to the commencement of any building development.  As we have seen in parts of the country, the pace of development escalated to the point where common sense and basic health and safety standards were left behind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2006 the Government announced the launch of a &euro;70 million water investment programme in County Roscommon.  The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, said at the time that the go ahead had been given for &ldquo;some of the biggest infrastructural packages ever undertaken in the county&rdquo;.  We are still waiting for even one glass of water to be produced from that investment programme.</P>
        <P>The north-east Roscommon regional water supply was shut down due to industrial contamination.  Users of the Arigna water scheme find that what is coming out of their taps can only be described as treacle.  There are ongoing problems in regard to quality and quantity at the Boyle-Ardcarn water scheme.  The Roscommon central water supply has had problems with cryptosporidium contamination in the past which are likely to recur.  When users of the south Roscommon regional water supply turn on their taps they find something that is more like strong tea than what should be produced by a public water supply.  There are serious ongoing water supply problems under that scheme.  In excess of 27,000 people throughout County Roscommon are without a reliable, high quality water supply, not even taking into account the west Roscommon regional water supply which is not even included in the investment programme and where there are significant problems of quality and quantity.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This lack of water capacity is having a direct impact on residential, commercial and tourism needs and will continue to do so into the future.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking in this regard.  A Forf&aacute;s report in September 2008 which assessed water and waste water services for enterprise in the gateway towns and hubs indicated that by 2013 Athlone would have a 39% deficit in water treatment and a 35% deficit in waste water treatment.  Forf&aacute;s did not look across the Shannon at County Roscommon, being of the view that the only source of water for Athlone was in County Westmeath.  If the report authors had bothered to look further afield they would have found two excellent water sources in Killeglin and Lisbrock.  If the investment were provided those facilities could meet the needs not only of south Roscommon but also of Athlone.  In regard to waste water, a small investment would allow the Monksland treatment centre to provide significant additional capacity.  That option was not considered because of the lack of joined-up thinking.</P>
        <P>When Roscommon County Council submitted applications for augmentation to supply the town of Athlone and to upgrade the north-eastern regional water supply to allow it to connect in with Longford, those applications were rejected by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In the south Roscommon regional water supply some of the pipe work has been installed and some of the reservoirs built, but they are lying idle.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, knows, having announced the investment in the Creagh sewerage scheme, those pipes have been laid.  Two young couples have connected to the scheme but cannot flush a toilet because the treatment plant has not been built.  I urge the Minister of State to deliver on his commitment in regard to that scheme and the other sewerage schemes and water supply schemes that were announced but not delivered.</P>

	<P>There is no public service utility more important than the provision of a dependable, high quality water supply.  It is a residential requirement, a commercial necessity and is vital for tourism.  There is substantial scope for improvement in the provision of the service throughout the State.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P>Treated water is a scarce and costly commodity.  There is an onus on those responsible for its delivery &mdash; local authorities and the Government &mdash; to ensure it is delivered in a safe, efficient and dependable manner.  There are large areas of my own county where the main water supply is still coming through cast iron pipes that were laid down 50 or 60 years ago.  Corrosion has reduced some of these 8 in. pipes by 2 in. or 3 in., which is completely inadequate to meet demand.  A great opportunity was missed in the Celtic tiger years to improve the delivery of water to communities and industry in every part of the country.  There has been much talk recently of investment in infrastructure.  We could certainly get people working if we upgraded the water delivery network in every part of the country, including Donegal.</P>
        <P>Although Donegal was not the worst-hit county during the recent spell of frost and snow, I recall that Emmet Park in Castlefinn in my constituency did not have water for weeks on end.  Water had to be transported from the hydrant to the houses so necessary facilities could be provided therein.  It is not often said that those working with the local authorities to address these problems worked very hard.  Men, and probably women, were out on Christmas Eve at midnight and on New Year&rsquo;s Eve up to midnight trying their best to ensure water was delivered to houses.</P>
        <P>The pipe infrastructure must be upgraded.  There are now polypipes available.  In the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, cast-iron pipes are things of the past.  Polypipes have a life expectancy of well over 100 years.  We must address the problem and replace the existing pipes.</P>
        <P>Another difficulty that arises is often overlooked.  There are parts of the country, including my county, in which water is still delivered through asbestos pipes.  I do not want to frighten anybody but, in this day and age, and with the history of asbestos and the danger it poses to health, I must state it is past time that asbestos and cast-iron pipes were replaced, for health reasons, with modern, safe polypipes.  This would ensure a constant supply of water.  There is a lot to be done.</P>
        <P>Group schemes throughout the country, including in my county, ensure that water is available to most communities.  Our aim is to provide high-quality water with a constant flow to every household in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House.</P>
        <P>If we look back over the past couple of years we will note there has been a good extension of services to rural areas through group water schemes.  Not only do they provide water to many peripheral rural communities and houses, they also ensure that the man with the digger and men who help lay the pipes have work.  There are ways of getting people back working and we should, therefore, consider possibilities in this area.  New reservoirs have been constructed, including in my own parish.  There are still challenges and real goals to be achieved in terms of taking water to towns such as Rathmullan, a big tourist town.  It has been waiting years for replacement pipes.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in that councils will be rewarded for leakages.  That is how the system operates.  The main trunk supply in Letterkenny &mdash; I am not talking about the pipes that burst near houses, disenfranchising many people &mdash; did not have many leaks this winter but the pipes still need to be replaced.  Deputy McGinley implied corrosion and rusting have halved the internal diameter of pipes.  These need to be replaced.  Councils, however, are in a catch-22 position in that if they do not record leakages they will not obtain funding.  This reward system is not good enough in that one is rewarded for leakages.  It puts the onus on councils to report to the <Col N="541"/>Department stating they have innumerable leakages in a certain system and that they are in need of funding.  The councils that do need to have pipes replaced adequately are not receiving funding.</P>
        <P>Insufficient emphasis has been placed on water conservation grants.  The group holding up the Soldiers of Destiny, the so-called saviours of the planet, the Green Party, plans to introduce climate change legislation in the coming weeks that will, if it gets away with it, possibly decommission cows from fields.  I am sure the offices of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, a rural man from Roscommon, will prevent that from happening.  There was a missed opportunity in terms of having conservation grants to save water.  Ten litres of water are used in every flush of a toilet and people do not think twice about flushing a toilet 20, 30 or 40 times per day.  We must consider a reward rather than punishment.</P>
        <P>My last point concerns the design-build-operate, DBO, system.  The DBO system, like many other systems, looked good on paper at the time in question but it is such that the private operators in schemes will ultimately cripple the local authorities.  Local authorities are in a very precarious position at present because they have bills to pay at the end of the year to private companies that participated in DBO deals.  It is a ransom in some instances.  Local authorities, especially in my county, do not have the same revenue stream they used to have.  They are not receiving the same revenue from rates that they used to receive given that businesses are closing down, nor do they have the revenue that they used to obtain through the planning system.  Everything should be on the table for review.  The system is not working in that it is not based on a reward model.  Pipes will obviously be provided where there is poorer infrastructure but counties that need replacement pipes will not be able to get them.  There is plenty of food for thought in my comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important issue.  The public water supply is one of the most important issues with which any Government must deal.  The recent frost, which was unusually severe, has proven beyond question that our completely outdated water system right across the country is not suitable or practical for the present generation.</P>
        <P>A new problem arises in that local authorities, which depended upon funding from developers to pay the local authority contribution towards replacing structures within local authority areas, no longer have that funding available because no developments are taking place.  Some years ago Fine Gael recognised the problem and came up with an independent solution under its NewERA strategy, which proposes to establish a new public water utility company to take over responsibility for water management and investment.  The new company will be responsible for investing in the water network through new fund-raising means and will help take the burden off the taxpayer.  It is impossible to believe that, after so many years of the Celtic tiger, so little has been done to replace the water infrastructure, other than by putting further pressure on an outdated system on foot of the massive amount of housing development.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government has stood over a system in which at least 43% of all drinking water is lost through leaks.  This occurs in normal circumstances, never mind the circumstances that obtained during the recent spell of cold weather.  Radical change is needed urgently.  The lack of proper water infrastructure is holding back the economy, costing a fortune and leading nowhere.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael NewERA programme, when implemented, will guarantee revolution within the system, create jobs for the many unemployed and, in the longer term, provide major savings.  The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government has committed the country to an EU framework <Col N="542"/>that will make us liable for serious fines if the required work is not carried out and a quality water supply is not produced by 2016.  The IMF has made it clear that this is an issue that must be acted upon.  It supports proposals of the type advocated by Fine Gael in its NewERA strategy.  This is the way forward.  Any new structure set up must be answerable to the D&aacute;il through the Minister.  It must not be an independent quango, such as the NRA or HSE.</P>
        <P>My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan has a proud record of providing water of good quality through group water schemes in rural areas.  Considerable funding was made available for the head works on those schemes.  That they are now mostly under contract to one company is a major mistake.  People have been bound into paying unjustifiably high prices.  This structure has been condemned by a County Monaghan group.  People were assured that, if they did not join the bundle, they would be allowed to get the normal grants.  However, that did not occur.  I am ashamed to have been a Member of the D&aacute;il when that assurance was not followed through.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, did not even answer the letters I wrote to him on this issue.  People did not get grants, yet they produce water for approximately &euro;1 per thousand gallons as opposed to the &euro;6 of other schemes.  Major questions must be asked about the cost of water.</P>
        <P>I will follow up on Deputy McHugh&rsquo;s comments.  There is much discussion about climate change and the need to sort it out, but we can save a great deal of water at factory, office and school levels by harvesting rainwater from roofs for use in toilet systems and so on.  Providing good, clean, quality water for such systems is a waste of time and money.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  The motion contains several good proposals that deserve cross-party support.  In some ways, the recent water shortages on both sides of the Border were beyond the control of the relevant authorities, but there is no doubt that the crisis initially brought about by the weather was exacerbated by the manner in which the water supply was managed.  Therefore, there is considerable merit in Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposals to establish a publicly owned company to take over responsibility for the water supply.  This would make sense from a number of perspectives.  For example, considerable economies of scale would take effect were such a body to be established.</P>
        <P>In establishing such a company, it would need to be clearly set down that it would never be considered as a candidate for privatisation.  I say this in view of the expected publication shortly of the McCarthy group report on State assets.  Going by the tenor of Professor McCarthy&rsquo;s bord snip nua report, many believe this new report may recommend that State companies be put up for sale to the private sector.</P>
        <P>The experience in other countries, including Britain, suggests that privatisation is not a good way to administer the water supply.  The need to ensure a safe and universal water supply is the reason the water supply in almost every state on the planet was established under public control.  This has nothing to do with states controlling areas to which neo-liberals claim they have no business.  Nor has the maintenance of water under public control anything to do with ideology.  I am pleased to say that my party north of the Border has been instrumental in ensuring that such a policy was not extended to the Six Counties, although the recent shortages there suggest that the current company is far from perfect.</P><Col N="543"/>
        <P>People do not need to pay for their water supply in this State, but that situation may yet change if the Green Party can think of any more excuses to drag out the term of this Government.  Even if the current Government does not introduce metering and water charges, a new Government comprising Fine Gael and Labour would do so, as both are committed to this policy.  Labour only recently signalled its willingness to do so as part of its acceptance of the austerity programme that will need to be imposed.  Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in is the only party in the House that remains opposed to water charges.  While this fact is not mentioned in the motion, I will be happy to support the motion on that basis.  However, we will strongly oppose any attempt to introduce metering and water charges by the current Government or its successor.</P>
        <P>One of the reasons most cited in favour of water charges is that it would encourage people to be less wasteful.  There is an element of waste but, as the motion points out, 43% of supply is lost through leaks within the infrastructure and not through overuse by consumers.  Given this fact, surely a major effort ought to be put into addressing inefficiencies in supply before charging domestic consumers.  This too would be more cost efficient, given that the estimated cost of installing meters is &euro;600 million.  Investing some of that in improving the efficiency of supply would ensure a major reduction in water wastage.</P>
        <P>There is also quite a large amount of waste in the commercial sector and many local authorities have failed to collect water charges due from that source.  The level of waste in the commercial sector is clearly on a large scale.  For example, it was claimed that Starbucks in Britain, due to its practice of continually running taps, wastes 1.63 million litres of water per day.  There is also the fact that the introduction of water charges at the present time would constitute nothing more than finding yet another means to eat into people&rsquo;s incomes to pay for the mess caused by the banks and speculators.  Supporters of metering claim that it could be implemented in a manner that would only penalise excessive use, but there is no guarantee about the level at which charges will be applied.  Unfortunately, the experience is that, once something along those lines is introduced, it is regarded as a lucrative source of revenue and the bar is lowered rather than raised.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important debate on the water crisis.  Before going into detail, it is important to state that the crisis has not been resolved in some areas of this city, particularly in Beaumont, the Malahide Road, Marino, Coolock, Drumcondra and Fairview.  These areas have been directly affected in the past 24 hours.  I demand immediate action in respect of these areas, which have been left behind.  Families and homes there need a proper water service.  This must be the priority in our debate.  We have had enough talk and waffle.  Given the city&rsquo;s recent water crisis, particularly in Dublin North-Central, my duty is to speak out on behalf of the people.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and the Government to do something about this urgent matter.</P>
        <P>Regarding the broader issue of a need for a proper water service, this and successive Governments must face up to the stark reality of leakages and a lack of investment in water services, particularly on Dublin&rsquo;s north side.  I recognise the social and economic hardships caused by water restrictions and disruptions for families and local businesses.  We all know that an inefficient, outdated and fragmented water network has contributed to drinking water supply problems across the State.  We also know that the State spends &euro;1 billion on water treatment in current and capital expenditure every year.  However, I deplore the vast amount of waste constituted by the 43% of supply lost through unidentified leaks.</P><Col N="544"/>
        <P>The issues raised in this debate are important and I urge action.  I commend Councillor Damian O&rsquo;Farrell, Independent, for pushing this agenda on Dublin City Council and for his great work in helping his constituents during the recent water crisis.  He used containers and his trailer to help people.  That offer remains in the case of future emergencies.  I urge the Minister of State to do something about the water issue.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have basic human rights, such as a right to life, to a roof over our heads, to live in peace and to exercise freedom of expression, but a fundamental basic human right is the right to clean drinking water.  In the recent past, water has posed a problem.  Being an island community surrounded by water with endless miles of rivers, lakes and streams, it is ironic that areas have been without water or have had water rationed and restricted.  We are also aware of the opposite occurring, that is, flooding which has caused considerable damage to houses and areas, the result of which has seen some people unable to acquire insurance.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the current update on Dublin City Council&rsquo;s website showed restrictions are still in place.  Parts of Dublin and elsewhere in the country are experiencing what it is like for people in Third World countries who must queue for water.  Dublin has tankers at a variety of locations and people have been told to bring their own containers.  There is no doubt that the water difficulties have caused considerable social and economic hardship, be there too much water, too little or none.</P>
        <P>Individual responsibility is another aspect.  I acknowledge how Dublin City Council has been proactive in assisting people in taking responsibility by making suggestions on how to carry out leak tests, water audits and toilet and cistern checks.  The council made particular suggestions about the use of rainwater and gardening.  Flood protection measures have also been undertaken.  However, our individual responsibility not to waste water will not be enough without significant investment in infrastructure.  With &euro;1 billion being spent every year on water treatment and supply, one would have thought there would be an efficient service, so how is the funding being managed?  Is it part of the culture of excessive salaries, bonuses and expenses?  There is also the serious subject of planning being granted for development on flood plains, which was most unsuitable.</P>
        <P>We are good at overspending on large construction projects, such as the Port Tunnel, the M50 widening and the Luas, which all overran by three times their original costs.  If metro north goes ahead we will be able to get to the airport by metro but it will cost at least &euro;6 billion while there will still be people without enough water and others who face the risk of flooding.</P>
        <P>I support the motion that covers the need for significant capital investment in water to ensure there is no wastage and an adequate supply but I also acknowledge the Government amendment that highlights ongoing major investment in water services and the commitment to invest in water conservation, which must be a priority.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate has covered many areas related to the water sector.  This demonstrates the complexity of delivering and maintaining such a vital public service.  It is important to emphasise that recent disruptions that were very difficult for families, businesses and the farming community are not the norm.  These arose from adverse and unprecedented severe weather conditions.  Met &Eacute;ireann has characterised December 2010 as the most extreme cold spell on record in terms of depth of cold.</P><Col N="545"/>

        <P>Lessons had been learned from the weather events of 2009 and early 2010 and these informed the response to the most recent weather event.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the rural water programme, I wish to be associated with the expressions of gratitude of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government yesterday for local authority staff and contractors who responded quickly and willingly and who worked long hours in difficult conditions to ensure a return to normal service as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The more than &euro;6 billion invested in water and waste water services since 2000 has made significant inroads into addressing the decades of underinvestment in the sector.  This investment has led to increased capacity in our water and waste water treatment plants, equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.1 million between 2000 and 2009; increased water storage equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.6 million people in the same period; improvements in drinking water quality; compliance with waste water standards, particularly in the Dublin area; and reduced water loss through leakage.</P>
        <P>Much of the water service investment is unseen, whether it is the repair or replacement of pipes in the 25,000 kilometre underground network, the provision of treatment plants, which are often located in simple structures or less visible locations, belying the complex and sophisticated treatment processes they contain, or the computerised water management systems such as telemetry assisting in the management of networks.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to continued high levels of investment in water services.  Its investment is informed by a clear strategy that prioritises water conservation, with some &euro;320 million earmarked for investment in new contracts for mains rehabilitation in the water service investment programme for 2010 to 2012.  That &euro;320 million is based on the requirements as presented by the local authorities; the Department did not pluck the figure from the sky.  Every county is included in that programme and it is matter for local authorities and the Department to prioritise.</P>
        <P>I have heard comment that money that was allocated was not spent, with Deputy Naughten mentioning &euro;70 million that was allocated to Roscommon County Council.  I suggest he should not make that complaint here; he should talk to the Fine Gael-led council in Roscommon and ask it why the money was not spent.  Fine Gael is in charge of that council and it should get on with the job because the money exists.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>

	<P>The programme published in 2010 reflects the priorities for main distribution by local authorities.  Over time this investment will further improve the general condition of Irish water services infrastructure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There must be a strong, strategic framework for the sector, not only to guide investment but to ensure services are delivered as effectively and efficiently as possible.  The passage of the Water Services Act 2007 improved regulation of the sector and the move to a river basin catchment approach, reflected in the priority accorded to each individual scheme in the water services investment programme for 2010 to 2012, both form part of the framework that has been put in place.  These will be further developed by the Government&rsquo;s proposals to commence a programme of domestic metering to be funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund and to establish an independent regulator for the water sector both to build upon the investment already made in the sector and to inform the water services sector over the coming decade.</P><Col N="546"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is important the House recognises the progress made in the water services sector as well as the elements in place to make further improvements in the coming years.  In recognising the difficulties the public has faced with water disruption over Christmas and new year, I acknowledge the positive response by the public to calls from local authorities to conserve water and to check for and report leaks.  This practice should continue, even when all planned restrictions are lifted, to ensure the value of the water resource is protected into the future.</P>

We should have learned the lessons of the previous cold spell but that was not the case.  There should be accountability in the water distribution sector.  In Northern Ireland when there were water shortages, the chairman of the Northern Ireland Water Authority resigned because of the hardship that families and businesses had to face during the cold snap; that is what is missing in this State.  Water shortages caused many problems for business, with some having to close in the run up to Christmas, causing particular hardship.  This was also the case for young families.  Those who had to queue for water from containers had to often endure a long wait.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is unacceptable that certain local authorities hit the same customers and businesses constantly whenever water supplies must be reduced or shut down.  The system should be fair and every area should experience reduced water pressure on a rotating basis.  Certain local authorities could not cope with the situation on the roads.  There was a lack of grit that should have been supplied centrally and allocated to residents' associations in suburbs and other areas.</P>
        <P>The water structure is dysfunctional, with 34 authorities responsible for investing and maintaining it.  Each of those authorities works in isolation, with no unity or economies of scale.  That is why Fine Gael tabled this motion; we want to create a new structure, Irish Water.  During the economic boom, proper investment was not put in place for water infrastructure and 34% of water now leaks away.  Drastic action is needed but this will provide job creation opportunities if the Government is willing to accept our proposals.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has consistently campaigned for more investment in water infrastructure and the establishment of a single water supply company.  The Government amendment reflects a willingness to accept what we propose and the sooner the better it puts its money where its mouth is.  This undue hardship should not continue indefinitely.</P>

	<P>The people of County Clare experienced extreme hardship throughout the Christmas period because of interruptions in the water supply. Extreme weather conditions exposed the shortcomings in the water infrastructure throughout the country.  County Clare was one of the counties worst affected.  I compliment the outdoor staff of Clare County Council on their work throughout the holiday period, in particular Se&aacute;n Heaney, the water caretaker in Ennis and his crew, for their work in restoring the water supply.  Their task was made so much more difficult due to the under-investment in critical water infrastructure over many years.</P>
        <P>In the limited time available to me now, I will concentrate on the issue of the Ennis water supply which has experienced many problems over the past number of years including the issue of boil-water notices, cryptosporidium and the quantity of water available to people.  The recent harsh weather exposed the limitations of the water supply.  On many occasions I have raised in <Col N="547"/>the House the need to prioritise and deliver in full the Ennis water augmentation scheme, but my requests have fallen on deaf ears.  Deputy Timmy Dooley issued a &ldquo;Dooley News&rdquo; over the Christmas period in which he stated that this scheme had been delivered in full but this is not the case.  The people of Ennis, Clarecastle, Bearfield, Doora and Crusheen did not have water for days because of the failure of Fianna F&aacute;il to deliver this scheme.  This is not acceptable.  A total of 30,000 people depend on this water supply and it is not good enough that they had no water because some aspects of the scheme are still outstanding.  A new reservoir at Edenvale, a new pumping station at Clare Abbey and improved extraction capacity at Castle Lake need to be delivered.</P>
        <P>I am demanding that funding be released to deliver this scheme in full.  I ask the Minister of State to do this today as a priority.  We have had enough fudge on this issue.  Water is a basic need and the town of Ennis depends on it.  I ask the Minister of State to pick up the telephone and make it happen today and that funding be released to deliver that scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and I congratulate Deputy Hogan on tabling this motion.  This issue has been coming down the tracks, so to speak, for a number of years.  Alarm bells should really have been ringing last year during the extreme difficulties in the post-Christmas period.  At that time Deputy Hogan introduced a debate in the House on the issue.  All sorts of promises were made yet again this year, but people are suffering severe hardship and economic loss at a time when we cannot afford economic losses.  Water restrictions applied in my own constituency, including in Newcastlewest where it created significant hardship and disruption.  At this stage of our development and post the Celtic tiger period, we are still regarded as a successful nation, regardless of our problems.  However, to have 43% of our water being lost into the ground is an absolute disgrace.  If there was that level of waste in any other service, it would not be tolerated.  Why is the waste of water tolerated?  Water is expensive to process and treat and a commodity that is absolutely necessary for survival.  The problems are not new.</P>
        <P>I am involved with several group water schemes.  Admittedly with the assistance of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, they have overcome the leaks and wastage, yet the national grid cannot do so.  I fully support the proposal to rationalise the 34 different bodies dealing with water supply and to have instead a single national body for water utility, with delegation to the various councils to implement a national plan.  I refer the House to the success of the Road Safety Authority in reducing road accidents and fatalities, even though the figures are still too high.  However, a concerted national effort resulted in a certain degree of success and it is hoped this will continue.  The same approach should be applied to ensure that a very important basic commodity, water, is properly supplied and properly managed in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank speakers on all sides of the House for contributing to this debate.  The number of speakers who have outlined their own constituency experiences with regard to water issues is a clear indication of the fact that this is a very serious problem for many public representatives.  It has been a problem for a considerable period of time.  People now realise that water is a finite resource which has often been taken for granted.  However, this will not happen any longer, particularly in light of the conditions experienced this winter and last winter when people were forced to buy bottled water in supermarkets at significant cost to family budgets and businesses.  The inconvenience of having to collect water from tankers in major urban areas brings home to people the importance of water as a resource in our daily and working lives.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>In the spirit of acknowledging those difficulties suffered by business and households, Fine Gael has brought forward a constructive motion that sets out a solution.  It is very rare to have such unanimity in the House about a problem and very rare to get a Government amendment to an Opposition motion that is quite similar to the motion.  However, for political reasons, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could not bring himself to accept the Fine Gael proposition.  It is time to agree a motion along the lines of our motion, to agree there is a problem with the provision of water under the existing structures, that the 34 local authorities are doing the best they can in order to paper over the cracks in the system.  However, there is a need for a new agency or a new structure to bring it all together under one roof by means of an Irish water holding company that will provide the necessary investment and can draw money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and also include private sector investment so that local authorities can be the agents for the rolling out of the essential water infrastructure that is now required.  We cannot put this off because otherwise we will be fined by the European Commission for not meeting our obligations under the EU framework directive.  We are better off investing in a better water system than to have council officials trying to cover themselves in glory on the file to ensure that when the court cases arise in 2015 or 2016, all they will say in court in their own defence is that they did not get the money from the Department and they did the best they could, within their own resources, to deal with these problems, as detailed in the files.</P>
        <P>It is soul-destroying for directors of services who are in charge of water services to have to give those excuses in a court.  We need to avoid this situation by investing in a four to five year programme which is concerted and organised and with one structure, a properly regulated authority.  The State needs to provide an essential infrastructural product called water which is of good quality and provided in an efficient manner without the loss of 43% of it from unidentified leaks.  Water is an important and expensive resource which is expensive to treat.  It should not be taken for granted and Fine Gael does not take it for granted.  I ask the Government and the Minister of State to agree to this motion and to allow us to go forward in a united way to solve this problem once and for all, namely, the provision of good quality water supply.</P>

    <Title>Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 [Seanad]: Second Stage</Title>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill has been discussed at some length in the Seanad where we had a useful debate and introduced several amendments that took into account some of the issues raised by the Senators.  I look forward to having a similar process here where we can consider the issue of how we develop our postal service for the interest of our people and the interest of those working, particularly in An Post and the other operators in the industry.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The legislation before us comes on the back of the third European postal directive and follows a long process of reviewing the market for postal services in the European Union which started in approximately 1988.  It led to the publication of a Green Paper on postal services by the Commission in 1992, the development of the first postal directive in 1997 and now this third postal directive, which came into effect on 1 January 2011.  The European legislation is already in effect and already provides access to the postal market for operators other than An Post down to the smallest letter or postcard.  Previously we had opened the market but just for larger parcels and heavier packages going through the postal system.  This legislation provides for a more open competitive market across all mail volumes.</P>
        <P>While I will go into the detail of the legislation later, I want to outline the broad framework first.  The Bill recognises that we need a universal service obligation.  Having mail delivered to every house and business every working day is a critical social and economic service.  Providing for the licensing of such a universal service for seven years after which it can be reconsidered is an important protection in any changes in the market arrangement.  There are social and economic interests in regard to the postal system that go beyond the interests of the companies involved; we have a wider public interest that we look to protect and do so with the provision of a universal service obligation.</P>
        <P>The experience of other countries ahead of us in this regard suggests that we can set such universal service obligation without necessarily at the start having a cost accruing to it.  There are real benefits in having a universal service capability and having a national distribution system.  That economic benefit means that it may not be necessary for us to provide back-up funding for that universal service provision.  I do not expect and we are not legislating for the Exchequer to provide such a support or response to the new market mechanisms we are introducing.  At the same time we are legislating for this market to be fair.  It will not allow someone to come in, cherry-pick the easier, more profitable routes, and see a very high and unfair <Col N="552"/>burden in the cost of providing that universal service in other areas.  If it can be shown that there is such unfair competition or unfair use of the universal service obligation, there is a mechanism for the regulatory bodies and parties responsible for managing our postal services to levy an income from the industry to cover that cost.  That is an important protection for which we are legislating and it is appropriately market-based, based on evidence of the economic effect as the market evolves and develops.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill provides other protection for consumers, particularly those doing low volumes of business, including businesses that do not have great economic influence because the nature of their postal business is small.  We need price caps to ensure they are protected and the legislation is being designed to benefit the consumers.  To do that we are using our existing regulatory structures by assigning the powers to ComReg to assess the performance of the operators, the development and delivery of the USO and the necessary regulatory amendments that are needed in that regard.  ComReg is very well placed to do that job.  It is now a very experienced regulatory office having done considerable work in the postal area.  It has also done similar work in the communications area where we have opened the markets to competition and seen real benefits in price reduction and quality of service improvements as a result.  Under the 2002 legislation ComReg is accountable to the D&aacute;il through the Oireachtas committee system, which in my experience in opposition and government works well.  People underestimate some of the work done in the committee rooms of this House where we have the right to question, investigate and examine the work or our regulators and other bodies.  That political oversight exists particularly through the Oireachtas committee system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is also political oversight in the Commission for Communications Regulation Act 2002, which provides that the Minister may send strategic directions where necessary to the regulator and in that way the market.  That is an appropriate level of ministerial involvement.  It is important to have that oversight &mdash; that ultimate political control over and interest in how our regulatory system and our markets develop.  In my experience as Minister for the past few years it is a provision I have not had to use extensively.  It is better used sparingly because it is better to work with the regulator and the market in developing a policy approach on a collaborative consistent and rational basis.  If and when necessary, the Minister can set a policy direction that gives the regulatory authorities the necessary steer on a broader policy approach whereby they take on the day-to-day difficult decisions in pricing, competition and regulatory control; this legislation provides for that.</P>
        <P>Critically the Bill legislates for the introduction of a post code, which not only implements the recommendations of the national post code review board of some years ago in having a very simple, easy to understand and easy to use alphanumeric postal address system that improves the efficiency of our postal system and helps people develop a range of new Internet businesses, including Internet shopping and so on, but also contains within it the ability for us to develop a location code that will allow a range of applications through the identification down to a single house in the delivery of better services, particularly public services where we can use the information in a range of new applications approved by the Data Protection Commissioner to improve the provision of health and educational services, and local waste, water and other management services to every house in the country.  The legislation is critical in allowing for that development, which is now progressing on a very certain path, as we go to the procurement phase to identify an agency or company that will manage the delivery and operation of that postcode system which we expect to see later this year.</P>
        <P>Having provided a broad outline I will now go into the details of the legislation section by section.  I will set it in the context of what is happening in the postal market in general and <Col N="553"/>some of the strategic developments which we should consider in the context of this legislation and the changing market conditions.</P>
        <P>We must recognise that in the postal business the market is contracting quite dramatically, even in the past three or four years, by an estimated 20% reduction in the core volume of mail business.  That is due partly to the economic downturn but a significant amount of that reduction is due to systemic changes in the nature of communications.  The development of e-mail, instant messaging and a range of new communications systems is replacing a previous communications system, which will not come back because the world is moving to those new Internet and other new telecommunications systems in a way which works competitively.</P>
        <P>A UK Government study assessing the five years from 2010 to 2015 expected a 25% to 40% reduction in mail volumes.  Taking aside the economic downturn, we are in a market that is going through a fundamental and difficult change for those involved in the industry.  We have already seen a change to the extent that the vast majority of mail, approximately 90%, is business orientated.  Much of it is in direct marketing or other new services which have kept the volumes up, but the traditional letter post use of the mail system has changed radically.  We must plan for continued change in a way that requires a different way of doing business.  It requires new strategies, new innovation, new working mechanisms and new market mechanisms to ensure that we have a strong postal service here, and particularly a strong An Post company.</P>
        <P>In this context we held a useful consultation exercise in November 2009 where we brought together all of the interested parties.  We brought together An Post management, management from other companies with an interest in this market and operating in this market, representatives from the public service policy side such as ComReg, my Department and elsewhere, and workers within the companies and representatives of the workers.  The idea was to consider future developments and ask questions such as what happens if the mail volume decreases by up to 40% or 50%, what is our model and how do we see ourselves reinventing this business to ensure it has a strong economic future.  That involvement by all parties in this process strengthens this legislation.  I hope it gives them a sense that we are not seeking to undermine one sector or one company.  We are trying to ensure there is a postal service system in this country so that it can grow, adapt, be economic and provide creative employment.</P>
        <P>An Post is a company for which I, as Minister, am responsible.  I have seen its operations over the past three and a half years.  When I talk to people in the business or meet staff at counter level, in the sorting office or at other office level, my sense is that this is a company with a strong and good working culture, with staff who are proud of their work and who are very good at what they do.  It is a company that recognises it must change.  We have seen in the past three or four years changes in its work practices which at that time were not working, inefficient and where the company was not making the best use of resources.  We have seen improvements in efficiency.  An extensive work programme is being put in place between the management and unions to make those changes, and they have been made.  I commend both parties for engaging in that process and doing it on a pro-active, positive basis.</P>
        <P>There is more work to be done.  There are further efficiencies needed when one sees such dramatic falls in volume.  We need new strategies and new ways of innovation and operating in the business but we have a chance of doing that, especially in view of the record of management in recent years, where management and workers have co-operated to start doing things differently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Post offices and rural post offices are a critical part of the social fabric of the streets, towns and villages.  In speaking to someone from An Post today, I realised that a typical post office trades in approximately 137 different services.  As certain volumes of business are lost in one <Col N="554"/>area, there are other opportunities opening.  An Post has been open to that, looking at a range of different markets and applications to see where it can develop business.  It has also tried to automate services.  Its counter service systems achieve what would seemingly be an insurmountable task to manage 137 different products but one can do it in a clever automated way using modern technology.  That is an example of where An Post has been progressive and willing to change and use new technology, which is critical in terms of making the change to a new business model.  We must be not afraid of new technology but embrace it.  We must embrace the efficiencies and the new market opportunities it provides.</P>
        <P>Earlier this morning I met some people from the village of Ballingeary in west Cork.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will know the village from her own county.  I will use it as an example to make a wider point on how I see a post office service or network developing.  As Members will be aware because it is in the newspapers, there is a difficulty in Ballingeary in terms of the existing postmaster coming to the end of his career.  The question then arises as what to do next and how to set up a postal outlet in a village like Ballingeary, a community of approximately 700 plus, that is economic, acts as a useful centre of services for the community and provides a livelihood and an economic structure to deliver key postal and other services.  I am concerned here with a broad and strategic view which I am not relating to the individual decisions on any post office or area.  That is a matter for An Post working with local business persons and the local community.  I have assiduously avoided doing that in my three and a half years and I would recommend any future Minister to do the same.  One cannot put oneself in the position of making some of the commercial calls &mdash; that is a matter for An Post, first and foremost, and the regulator &mdash; but one can set the strategic direction.</P>
        <P>I use the example of Ballingeary because of my personal knowledge of the area and its businesses to make the wider point.  I believe that one of the big economic opportunities for us in the development of the postal service is to adapt to the Internet, and particularly to on-line shopping and the delivery system that will come with it in a range of new parcel and package services.  I believe that there is a significant area of growth and opportunity for whoever manages the distribution system and the commercial systems in providing for such a new Internet shopping service.  We are starting to see it grow.  An Post is already involved in establishing last year its new on-line shopping presence which, I am told, took off despite the difficult period of weather before Christmas.  People who perhaps were not able to get to the shops in an efficient manner went on-line in large numbers.  They will stay on-line, particularly in rural areas where there might not be the same choice as in central Dublin.  This offers considerable opportunities to get to people a range of different services and products that they would not easily get in their local town or village.  We need to develop that business as a centre point of the post office, or agency offices within shops that An Post has set up across Ireland, particularly in the towns and villages.</P>
        <P>This development provides a two-way opportunity.  I know the village of Ballingeary from my own business experience in the past.  When one looks down to the village level at the companies engaged in translation services, on-line retailing of books, tourism business, and local food and craft businesses, it seems that almost all now have their marketing done on-line.  There is no reason a cheese maker in west Cork should not be able to go to a local postal collection point in order to sell to every part of this country or even Europe.  I do not know if he or she would be able to get the cheese as far as America.  Those kinds of economic opportunities are now opening up for small businesses in Ireland if the right distribution system is created to enable them to easily transfer a package from wherever they are in Ireland to the market, which would preferably be abroad.</P><Col N="555"/>
        <P>The UK has been good at delivering and developing online shopping business.  It is seen as an export opportunity and it is interesting to see the UK study on how the sector is evolving.  For every &pound;1 of goods imported over the Internet, &pound;2.80 of goods were exported.  We need to enter that space and become good at that practice.  We must have a national distribution network that will allow small businesses across Ireland to have a good contact point for an online distribution and shopping system and an export market in particular.</P>
        <P>That has implications for what we do with our rural post offices and shops with postal services.  Can we develop those shops with access systems for parcels so that people can both collect and deliver?  A local business would not have to drive 20 miles to the nearest large town and there would be a flexible and easy system allowing business to be conducted closer to home.  Critically, can we develop the number of retail outlets on a scale so that the cost of the universal service obligation mail system, which we must pay for anyway, would be increasingly subsidised or would sit with the new distribution system for goods and parcels that will grow?  We must make an economic case for both services and work the two together.</P>
        <P>I wanted to set out the process at this point using a local example which happens to be topical currently.  That is the better strategy.  An Post would have a comparative and competitive advantage with other operators already working in this area if companies can work with and feed products into An Post and there is a distributed and strong local retail presence, along with strong local knowledge and capability to use some of the new delivery and connection mechanisms which Senator Feargal Quinn mentioned in his Second Stage speech in the other Chamber.  He is a former chairman of An Post and was nervous about speaking having come from that role.  He is worth listening to because people recognise that when it comes to retailing and customer care, he has real experience.</P>
        <P>It was interesting to hear his speech cite examples of new mechanisms such as a locker outside a shop.  The current system would have a parcel delivered to a house but if the person is not there to receive it, the delivery will go somewhere else in the system and there is an awkward process of tracing and retrieving it.  A system could exist where if a person orders a product online, it could be delivered to a locker in a local shop, with a text message or e-mail giving the code to open the locker.  A person could pick up the delivery in his or her own time.  That is one example mentioned by the Senator but I will not be specific in the services we want to deliver.</P>
        <P>Such innovative thinking around customer service and the distribution system, particularly for online parcel and other business, is where the opportunity lies for An Post.  It can be delivered in co-operation with other companies.  We can see in the US and other markets that a postal company can work with FedEx or other operators to share some of the economics to make the process viable.  The distribution system would start to become very extensive, with goods travelling both out of Ireland and around the country from businesses to customers.  There would also be deliveries from abroad.  Whoever has to manage that complicated and extensive distribution system will have a real economic opportunity and will create employment that may replace the employment we will have to lose in the core business where mail volumes may contract, in our predictions, by approximately 40%.</P>
        <P>This is a statement of strategic intent in my mind as to where we should really consider going.  We should push flexibility and innovation at the retail point, whether it is a post office or local shop, to deliver many services in conjunction with Internet services.  There could also be development of a local contact point for government, using online and communications technology used for process transactions that An Post should be good at.  The body will not be good at everything and all 137 of the services may not fly.  Where An Post will have a real advantage is in areas where it has experience, scale and practice.  That would be in the large <Col N="556"/>volume transactions, including the 3 million postal movements it organises every day.  The marginal cost is very small in this regard but on the back of 3 million transactions, there is an economic case to be made.</P>
        <P>With all services it is inevitable that we will move to an online and electronic presence; this may involve the provision of social welfare or other services.  We should not shy away from the development of new technologies and other mechanisms for fear of changing the current system.  Change must come and it will do so more effectively if we proactively shape it in a way that benefits rural Ireland in particular, including small towns and villages.  They must get a strong centre that will provide a contact point to government in all its guises and an Internet shopping centre for the community.  There will also be a range of other services, financial transactions and other services in development.</P>
        <P>I have set this out as a path we should take to answer some of the concerns people rightly have in villages and towns across the country as to what is the future of the local post office and postman or postwoman.  It will be bright if we adapt to the new technology, look to new markets and create new commercial arrangements where we would work in co-operation with other companies.  Margin, business and volume could be obtained by working with firms on such a basis.</P>
        <P>This legislation allows such a process and facilitates An Post and other operators in being flexible.  They can negotiate and co-operate as trade works on this basis.  The volume of business will increase and although all the value would not be attached to one company, there would be a benefit to having an efficient system and service.  That is what the legislation is doing.  It is not an ideological argument of private versus public sectors but it is pragmatic with a sound economic sense.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We cannot just do business as usual and those who argue that this will damage or threaten business should know that is untrue; the legislation is required because European legislation has already been set in place which will create this competitive market.  There is nothing to stop a company coming in now to cherry-pick business services and what we are doing with the legislation is ensuring the new competitive market, which we need, is fair, well regulated and efficient.  It can use new postcodes and other technologies.  That is why I hope I will get the support of other parties in the D&aacute;il as we did in the Seanad.  The constructive debate and suggestions from the Seanad were useful in that regard and I hope we can have a debate for the benefit of An Post, the other companies in the industry and the people of this country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Leo Varadkar has up to 30 minutes for his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I will probably not use all of that but the Ceann Comhairle might advise when I have a minute left in the slot.  I thank the Minister for his speech.  The Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill&rsquo;s main purpose is to transpose the third postal directive into Irish law by allowing private sector postal service providers to process or deliver mail weighing less than 50 grams.  The Minister is correct to say the directive is already in force and has direct effect in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Bill seeks to maintain a universal postal service involving the delivery of mail to all households in the State on every working day and designates An Post as the universal postal service provider for seven years.  It gives the power to ComReg to both designate the universal postal service provider after that and also the power to review the position even within the seven-year timeframe.  It designates ComReg as the regulator, defining its functions, responsibilities and powers and it imposes a five-year cap on the price of a stamp, which is welcome.  It provides a compensation fund for the universal postal service provider and provides <Col N="557"/>for An Post to negotiate with private providers for downstream access, with ComReg acting as an arbitrator and, in certain circumstances, with the power to issue directions.  It also provides for a complaints resolution system, enables the Minister to establish, maintain and operate a national postcode system, further protects the inviolability of mail subject to certain exceptions and allows the Minister for Finance to designate an alternative postal service provider for the delivery of election mail.  I note that, for the time being, Members will be able to send election mail to every individual as opposed to every household.</P>
        <P>While the Fine Gael Party broadly welcomes the Bill, we have some concerns about it and will propose several amendments on Committee Stage.  In framing this legislation we must balance the benefits of competition, of which there are many, with the risks to An Post which may arise from cherry-picking or other activities that may undermine the company&rsquo;s financial basis.  Well managed competition will provide choice for consumers, keep prices down and incentivise and encourage An Post to innovate, continue to become more efficient and improve and diversify the services it provides.  Badly managed competition and poor regulation could give rise to cherry-picking and a race to the bottom as regards the terms and conditions of employees in the broader sector.  It could also undermine the universal service obligation which guarantees every home and business a postal delivery service for five days each week.</P>
        <P>A further risk arising from badly managed competition is that it may turn a profitable State company, An Post, into a loss-making entity in need of support, either from the State or private sector through a compensation fund.  Given that An Post has never required a bailout or hand-out from the State or taxpayer, the Oireachtas would not do a good job if it were to enact legislation that resulted in the company becoming unprofitable and, notwithstanding any transfers from private sector operators, end up requiring State cash to continue to perform its functions.  We must be careful to ensure this legislation does not give rise to such an eventuality.  The Fine Gael Party wants the development of a competitively priced, high quality postal industry providing services to homes and businesses in all areas on an equal basis.</P>
        <P>To address the specifics of the Bill, section 17 designates An Post as universal postal services provider for seven years and allows ComReg to review this designation at any time, including during the seven year period.  ComReg is also given power to designate a new universal postal service provider for seven years without reference to the Minister.  Moreover, the Minister is precluded from vetoing any such decision if he or she is unhappy with it.  The section also allows ComReg to decide seven years from now that a universal service obligation is no longer necessary.  The Minister is prevented from overruling any such decision.  It is possible, therefore, than in three or four years from now, ComReg may decide to designate Royal Mail or another company as the universal postal service provider.  While this scenario may be an unlikely one, it is possible under the legislation.</P>
        <P>I am concerned by the provision which allows ComReg, without the support of the Minister or the assent of the Oireachtas, to decide that the universal postal service obligation is no longer necessary.  If ComReg were to make such a decision, An Post would in all likelihood decide that daily deliveries to rural areas were no longer viable and start to curtail weekday services.  If such a scenario were to arise, I am concerned that the Minister of the day will be powerless to act and will wash his or her hands of the matter by arguing that ComReg had taken the initial decision and nothing could be done about it.  This section must be changed and the seven year period increased to 20 years to give An Post more certainty.  For example, 20 years would provide certainty that capital investment will be repaid, which would not be the case if the period were seven years.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the provision giving ComReg the power to review An Post&rsquo;s position as the universal service provider within or after the seven year period.  I am not sure <Col N="558"/>of the reason for including this provision which I do not support.  The legislation should also be amended to provide the Minister with a veto over any decision by ComReg that a universal postal service obligation is no longer necessary.  The Minister should have a final say over any decision that would result in rural mail no longer being delivered for five days each week.  The Bill gives ComReg too much power to make decisions of a sweeping nature without providing for a ministerial veto.</P>
        <P>Section 13 removes the power of ComReg to summons people to give evidence under oath when it applies to postal cases.  I am not sure of the reason this power is being removed and I believe it should probably remain in place.  If competition issues can arise in the telecommunications sector, similar issues could arise in the postal sector.  There is no reason ComReg should not retain authority to summons people to give evidence under oath in the relevant circumstances.</P>
        <P>I have some concerns about sections 30 and 31 which deal with future financial support for An Post.  As I indicated, An Post has never required State support or aid and I hope this will not be necessary in future.  Section 31, while not providing for State aid, provides for the establishment of a compensation fund into which private sector providers will pay to compensate An Post for being left with unprofitable parts of the market.  This mechanism is similar to risk equalisation in the health sector market, under which, in theory, VHI, which has most of the unprofitable customers, is to be compensated by other insurance companies.</P>
        <P>The approach set out in section 31 creates problems on two levels.  The main problem is that if the compensation fund is too large, private companies will be discouraged from entering the postal services business.  A similar scenario arose in the case of BUPA when it pulled out of the Irish health insurance market in response to the establishment of a risk equalisation mechanism.  A second problem is that it is not certain that the compensation would be adequate in the event of major competition developing in the market, particularly in central Dublin where services may be profitable.  In the case of VHI the compensation provided has not been adequate.  The result of this shortcoming has been evident in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>Although it is a difficult decision to make, on balance the Bill should be amended to allow for State aid to be provided in certain circumstances, namely, where the Minister deems it necessary and the mechanism of compensation from other providers does not work.  I will table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>Section 27 gives ComReg the role of monitoring An Post&rsquo;s service quality and next day delivery targets.  The level of next day deliveries currently stands at 87%.  While this is a significant improvement on previous figures, it is not acceptable and must improve further.  It is strange that An Post and ComReg separately assess the level of next day deliveries.  I understand An Post hires PricewaterhouseCoopers for this purpose at a cost of &euro;400,000 per annum, while ComReg hires TNS to perform the same task at a cost of approximately &euro;400,000.  Given that An Post pays ComReg&rsquo;s costs through a levy, the company and its customers are essentially paying &euro;800,000 per annum to have two companies perform exactly the same task.</P>
        <P>In addition, the results produced by PwC and TNS do not differ to a significant degree.  I understand the former estimates that the next day delivery target is reached in 89% of cases, while TNS puts the figure at 87%.  It is silly to have such duplication.  The Bill should provide that ComReg monitor next day delivery and service quality and An Post bear the costs for such monitoring.  I ask the Minister to amend the legislation.  Failing that, I will propose an amendment to achieve this outcome.</P>
        <P>Section 17, which deals with universal service provision, provides that ComReg may decide that a universal service obligation is no longer necessary.  While I am aware that there is a <Col N="559"/>market test involved, I am concerned that ComReg is being given power to make such a decision without reference to the Minister.  If ComReg were to make such a decision, the net result would be a diminution of service, particularly in rural areas.  For this reason, the power provided in section 17 should not be included in the Bill.  If it is to remain, a ministerial power of veto should be included.</P>
        <P>Section 16(1)(<i>a</i>) provides that a universal service obligation may not apply in certain exceptional circumstances.  The reason for including this provision is unclear and I ask the Minister to outline what are these exceptional circumstances.    Does the Minister suggest that, to ensure there is not a spread of the disease, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would be an exceptional circumstance?  That would be legitimate circumstances.  Would it be an exception if the company decided that certain islands were too far away and it is too costly to deliver post to them every day?  I would like clarification from the Minister on the exceptions he has in mind under this section.</P>
        <P>I wish to make some general points about An Post and the industry.  An Post is a very good company and it has never required a State subsidy.  It made an operating profit, amounting to &euro;5.7 million last year from a turnover of &euro;800 million.  In contrast to other semi-State bodies, pay levels are not astronomical but reasonable.  An Post provides employment to 10,000 people.  It provides an important social service as well as an economic one.  People know their local postman and know the important social role a postman can provide, particularly in terms of visiting elderly people.  The postman may be the only person to call to the door of elderly people.  In the extremely cold weather we had in the past month or two, the postal service held up well.  We can be impressed with the quality of service provided by An Post during that cold period when schools were closed and other services ceased to function.  The postal service continued to function.</P>
        <P>Its prices are also reasonable, at or below the EU average.  We have the eighth cheapest postal and package delivery costs out of 29 OECD countries.  This is in stark contrast to other semi-State bodies, where prices are higher than the European average even though the Minister continues to deny it.  The service quality is getting better but needs to improve further.  The Minister is correct in much of what he says.  An Post needs to move with the times and must continue to become more efficient.  It must also innovate.  At present, 75% of its revenue goes on labour costs.  This is not because pay levels are particularly high but because it is a low-tech enterprise and is low-tech in the services it provides.  Irish postal volumes will continue to decrease, although I do not believe they will fall by 40%.  They will fall considerably in the coming years but relative to France, Britain and Germany, postal volumes in Ireland are quite low.  There are a number of reasons for this.  One is the legacy of high prices in the past.  For bulk mail, prices remain high.  A politician who has leaflets delivered by An Post knows that it costs &euro;90 per thousand, having been &euro;70 per thousand a few years ago.  Other providers will do it pretty well for &euro;40 per thousand.  There is a legacy of high prices in certain sectors.  There is a previous legacy of poor delivery and the absence of postcodes, which reduces the volume of targeted mail and bulk mail.  There are reasons to suggest, notwithstanding the long-term trend of falling volumes, that we could have a higher mail load, bringing us back to the European average.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Post offices need to develop beyond the remit of providing postal services and social welfare payments.  The Minister mentioned this and I agree with his point.  Post offices should be local communications hubs, something like what they have in Australia.  Although it is a different country and Australia is genuinely rural, the post office system there is impressive.  There has been considerable diversification by An Post.  Postfone is a welcome innovation and I am delighted to see it move forward.  Pay point services are impressive and it is a real disappointment that Postbank did not succeed.  If Fine Gael is part of the next Government, I hope we <Col N="560"/>will examine it and try to find a new partner to establish Postbank and provide banking facilities in post offices.</P>
        <P>It is likely we will see a significant diminution in the branch network of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In my constituency of 100,000 people, there is one branch of AIB yet other parts of Ireland have 50,000 people and seven branches of AIB.  Realistically, AIB and Bank of Ireland branches will close down over the coming years as those banks shrink and try to become more profitable.  There is an opportunity for An Post to provide banking services and cash services on behalf of banks in areas where banks no longer have branches.  This should be investigated.</P>
        <P>There is also a role for Internet services as more and more Government services move online.  We could use the post office as a communications hub in which people without Internet access or who are not familiar with the Internet can be assisted to carry out Internet transactions.  It could become a portal for Government services and services for business.  The Minister is correct in stating that An Post can become a hub for goods and parcels and Internet shopping.</P>
        <P>The company must expand its services to business.  Many SMEs are happy with the service provided and the price levels but they would like to see a collection service.  If An Post does not do it, it is an obvious area for a private company to provide the service.  An Post should also become involved in printing.  Large corporate companies that do not engage in e-billing do not particularly want to send out bills anymore.  They want to e-mail a file to a company that will print, package and post it.  An Post should provide the service.  O2 or Vodafone should be able to send a simple e-mail to An Post and the latter can print, package and deliver to customers who want paper bills.  That service is available in other countries and it is disappointing that much bulk mail in Ireland is posted from Britain.  This post theoretically originates from Ireland but is posted from a company in Britain because it is cheaper to do so.  The services that exist in Britain do not exist here.</P>
        <P>An Post has something unique and valuable &mdash; a network that visits every home and business in Ireland every day.  Many businesses would kill for this network.  An Post must leverage the network and get more value from it.  Politicians also kill for a network that accesses every home every day in the way An Post does.</P>

	<P>The Minister only touched on postcodes but the Bill is an enabling provision, allowing the Minister to establish and operate post codes.  I am still very confused about post codes.  There is a tender process ongoing at the moment but it is not clear to me how open it is and whether the process is free to consider a fully numeric system.  Perhaps it must choose an alphanumeric system and the Minister might refer to this in his response.  Perhaps he can assure us that the tender can consider all forms of post codes and not just the Minister&rsquo;s favourite model, the alphanumeric system, which he believes will help people to remember post codes.  I do not know how people remember post codes.  The only one I can remember is my sister&rsquo;s post code.  I must look up everyone else&rsquo;s post code in the UK.  I hope we will see post codes this year and there will not be too much of a delay.</P>
        <P>In the Minister&rsquo;s response, I ask him to explain why this Bill was not brought forward last year.  European legislation was passed in 2008 and almost every other country has enacted it in domestic law.  When we discussed this issue during Question Time in early December, the Minister promised to introduce the Bill before the Christmas recess.  It is only being brought in now even though the directive is already in force.  Perhaps the Minister can explain why this was not done.  Fine Gael broadly welcomes this Bill, which derives from European legislation that is already in force.  Competition will provide low prices or keep prices low for consumers. <Col N="561"/> It will provide new services for consumers, particularly business consumers.  It will also encourage An Post to continue to innovate and become more efficient.</P>
      
        <P>However, the protections in the Bill are not strong enough.  We need stronger provisions to ensure that An Post remains a strong company and that the universal service obligation is not undermined.  If the universal service obligation is changed, it should be done by ministerial decision and not by ComReg.  We also need to ensure there is provision for State aid in the unlikely event that it is necessary to compensate An Post for providing postal services to rural areas on an equal basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret that the Minister has left, although I am sure he had important business.  The most important statement I can make is to urge him to have an open mind, because this legislation is flawed and it is important that it is amended.  I had hoped he would listen to what the Opposition had to say about amendments we will be tabling, so I regret that he has now left the Chamber.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The premise underpinning this Bill is that liberalisation is good for the postal consumer.  It is 20th century legislation, based on an ideology that is fast becoming out of date in today&rsquo;s harsh economic climate.  It presumes that a market solution for postal services is always progressive.  However, the one-size-fits-all approach devised by the EU has had mixed effects in different countries.  In some cases, far from improving the service, it has led to deterioration, job losses and the undermining of equal access.  In a country such as Ireland, with a small market and a large scattered rural population, there are genuine concerns that the negatives resulting from liberalisation will outweigh the benefits.  Large companies may benefit, but for the general public and for SMEs there is a danger that higher prices and a poorer service will result.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister adopts an open mind to amendments that the Labour Party will be putting forward on Committee Stage.  Our concern is that this Bill, unless amended, may put undue strain on an essential public service.  This is not a good time for An Post.  At a time when electronic communication is having a major impact on postal communication, the Minister should be conscious of his responsibility to protect the consumer and the universal nature of the postal service.  In 2005 an ECORYS report commissioned at EU level listed Ireland as a country in which the potential for the development of competition in a liberalized environment in the medium term was relatively low.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill transposes the third postal directive, which eliminates all remaining obstacles for a fully liberalised postal market.  Its purpose is to establish an open and competitive market across the EU by opening the final reserved area &mdash; the delivery of letters of less than 50g, which makes up around 40% of the revenue of An Post &mdash; to competition.  It is worth remarking that we are introducing this legislation after the deadline has passed.  In fact, Ireland&rsquo;s postal market has been open to full competition since 1 January 2011.  It is not clear, even at this late stage, whether there is any significant interest from private operators in entering the under 50g market.  We must presume there will be such interest, and improve the legislation accordingly, if we are to meet the needs of the public.</P>
        <P>I have reservations about the political approach to the liberalisation of essential services in Ireland.  We should learn lessons from our past.  It has taken years of costly effort to open up the electricity market, for example, and the consumer has paid a heavy price.  Competition only began when one semi-state company, Bord G&aacute;is, took on another, the ESB.  The small scale of the Irish market, whether in energy, postal services or telecommunications, should influence how we protect essential public services.</P><Col N="562"/>
        <P>If we are not careful we could end up sacrificing our competitiveness on the altar of competition.  We have done so in the past and we cannot afford to do it again.  The Eircom privatisation debacle should be the lodestar for our decisions now.  The proud boast in 2004 by the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that Ireland would be a world leader in broadband provision has disintegrated to dust.  Instead, we ended up with a company that has changed ownership six times and at every stage declined deeper into debt.  By failing to protect an essential telecommunications infrastructure, Ireland has lost out badly.</P>
        <P>In the D&aacute;il we often ask parliamentary questions about broadband provision and regularly highlight the problems affecting businesses, homes and services across the country.  The Minister&rsquo;s reply to such questions is revealing.  He has stated many times: &ldquo;The provision of telecommunication services, including broadband, is a matter for the private sector&rdquo;.  This means we are not delivering next-generation broadband, and other countries are passing us out.</P>
        <P>While the Labour Party does not intend to vote against this Bill, I am asking the Minister to be aware of the concerns being expressed about the implementation of this directive and open to addressing them.  The postal market has changed in the last two years.  The recession has had a heavy impact: mail volumes are down by approximately 16%, and the Minister claims this will grow to 20% or more.  Each percentage point drop represents a decline of millions of euro in revenue.  We all recognise the inevitability of the substitution of e-mail for traditional mail and the growth of e-billing, and that challenges have opened up for An Post as a result.  That is the way life is.  Nobody will be able to hold back such development, nor should we.  However, we must ensure that consumers always have choice.  I raised the issue of certain mobile telephone companies that tried to pull a fast one on consumers, forcing them to use e-billing even if they did not own a computer, and I was glad that ComReg took an initiative in that regard.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to An Post and its staff for its long record of service.  This was brought home to me, like Deputy Varadkar, particularly during the recent snows.  Coming up to Christmas, people were expecting letters and parcels, and An Post carried on delivering these in a commendable way.  It should be no surprise that in 2010 it was assessed as the seventh most efficient operator out of 29 from various countries.  Its management and workers have played a vital and progressive role in developing the public service.  An Post has fulfilled its brief.  The universal service obligation ensures a legal guarantee of equal access for every citizen to the postal services.  It guarantees the delivery and collection of mail five working days per week, regardless of where one lives, and for the same price.  As has been said here, An Post has been providing this service without having to resort to any State aid or subvention.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that An Post is designated as the universal postal service provider for a period of seven years.  As stated in the explanatory memorandum, &ldquo;ComReg is to review this designation before the end of the seven years and may designate An Post again, or designate another postal service provider or decide that no such designation is required, as the market is meeting users&rsquo; reasonable needs.&rdquo;  The question is whether that brief can be fulfilled in the future.  How feasible is the notion of more than one postal operator running different aspects of the universal service obligation?  It could cause immense confusion in terms of delivery, cost and quality of service.  While the seven years&rsquo; grace for An Post is welcome, it is important that there is political involvement in determining the future after those seven years.  It should not be left to ComReg.</P>
        <P>The principle underpinning An Post, as has been said by the Minister, the Fine Gael Members and myself, is its importance in the social and cultural fabric of Irish society.  That <Col N="563"/>visit by the postman or postwoman &mdash; that certainty, that connection &mdash; is valuable, particularly at a time when communities are becoming more atomised.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, is present; she may be conscious of this aspect, and play her part in ensuring that the Minister amends the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the social and cultural significance of the postal service.</P>
        <P>The trade union representing postal workers, the Communications Workers Union, has been an important participant in the modernisation of An Post.  It has raised key issues on financing the universal service obligation, which I want to put on the record.  The CWU stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Liberalisation will remove the restricted monopoly that An Post currently uses to fund the loss-making parts of the USO.  The Government view appears to favour the establishment of a compensation fund, referred to in the Bill as a sharing mechanism.  However the CWU would prefer [and I agree with its view] that all funding options would be included in the legislation &mdash; nothing should be ruled out until we know what a liberalised market in Ireland looks like.  We must learn from the lessons of other countries, such as the UK, where the USO is now under serious threat due to the regulatory choices made there.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The sharing mechanism as set out in this Bill in section 31, states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">. . . where the commission makes a determination under section 30 that the net cost of provision of a universal postal service represents an unfair financial burden on the universal postal service provider within the scope of the universal postal service and such providers shall make a contribution, in accordance with the cost apportioned to each of them, for the purposes of meeting that burden.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">According to the Minister, the sharing mechanism will be funded by new companies entering the Irish postal market to deliver the letter post on a profitable basis.  If new companies do not enter the market and make a sustained profit there will be no money contributed to the sharing mechanism.  Similarly, if new companies do not even enter the market there will be no funding for the sharing mechanism.  What will happen if that is what emerges?  Money will not be contributed to the sharing mechanism or there will be certainly great resistance to making that contribution if it is required.</P>
        <P>There is no plan B if the sharing mechanism does not function as planned.   The CWU has suggested that this kind of funding model has not been proven to work anywhere to date.  This must be taken seriously in order to have a more comprehensive section in the Bill that allows for different options if required.  This levy on operators is similar in part to the risk equalisation fund in private health insurance, which has been the subject of repeated court proceedings.  It is additional to the levy required on operators to fund the regulator, ComReg.</P>
        <P>We must learn from experience, otherwise we are condemned to making the same mistakes.  It is not that long ago since a furore was created by a similar levy imposed on radio and television broadcasters to fund the Broadcasting Authority.  I regret that this legislation has not offered the opportunity to provide one new regulator combining the Broadcasting Authority and ComReg.  It was an ideal opportunity to rationalise one regulator instead of having two.  Professor Colm McCarthy recommended it in his report, yet the Minister, who has a blind spot in this matter, insists on having two regulators in an area where only one should apply with resulting efficiencies of scale.</P>
        <P>Returning to the funding of the Broadcasting Authority levy, there was a protracted campaign by radio and television broadcasters, but particularly the small local radio stations which were badly hit.  It was interesting that it took so long to get the message through, although finally there was a response to the distress caused by the levy.  It revealed an ignorance on the <Col N="564"/>part of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, as to the reality of a country in recession.  In particular, the SMEs have had to endure the pain of recession.  That ignorance was significantly revealed, so we must be conscious of what we are doing with the legislation and how its provisions are being applied in that sector.</P>
        <P>The economic value of An Post is significant.  It is self-financing and successful.  It is one of the largest employers in the State and delivers 3 million items of mail per day.  There are approximately 6,000 post-box points and several thousand customer collection points.  Every week, An Post serves 1.7 million customers through its unique national network.  The rate of next-day delivery &mdash; although not perfect and behind target &mdash; has been improving.</P>
        <P>An Post has made a profit, even though the profit is going down, so clearly there is pressure which we must acknowledge.  It is worth restating certain facts, however.  An Post has the eighth lowest postage costs out of 29 European countries.  It is the seventh most efficient operator out of 29 countries.  In 20 years, the price of a stamp increased on only three occasions and lags inflation for the same period.</P>
        <P>We are talking about a good operation, so my feeling is &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;.  We may say that nobody else coming in from the private sector would have a major impact on An Post in these hard times.  However, the legislation is all about opening up the market, so we must have safeguards in place.  We need to make changes in this legislation to protect the common good and the public interest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Other issues have been raised in a useful commentary on the Bill by the Communications Workers Union.  They include job losses and social dumping, downstream access, and cherry-picking of profitable routes.  I wish to outline these matters in more detail.  We must maintain certain employment standards to avoid job losses and social dumping.  I understand that, if properly implemented, Recital 16 on social protection from the European directive will protect employment standards.</P>
        <P>On the issue of downstream access, the CWU states</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Looking at the experience of Royal Mail in the UK we can see how important it is to get downstream access right.  If it is handled badly it could spell the end of An Post and 10,000 jobs.  Access to the An Post network must be on a commercial basis and not based on a price imposed on it by the regulator.  In addition, access to the network must not be below the mail centre level as this would render useless much of the investment in technology that An Post has made in recent years and require the entire delivery network to be reconfigured.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">We may have different views on that issue but there is a genuine concern in terms of how we will have a viable An Post company in future that would have a nationwide network delivering for our people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another concern is cherry-picking, which occurs when An Post competitors compete for business on profitable postal routes only.  The effect of this is twofold.  It reduces vital revenues for An Post, leaving it only with the loss-making routes, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case are substantial; and, in turn, it threatens the viability of the USO.  That is a central issue.  I am sure the Minister will argue that the protections are in place, but we need to tease that out on Committee Stage.  This matter must be crystal clear.  It is blatantly obvious that, because of our widespread rural population and urban centres of critical size, cherry-picking of profitable postal routes can be very attractive to a private operator.  Such an operator may wish to pick off what will make money, while leaving An Post to bear the loss-making routes.</P>
        <P>The price control mechanism, as outlined in the Bill, should take into account declining mail volumes.  This is a feature of price controls in other European regimes, such as Royal Mail and <Col N="565"/>Groupe La Poste.  It is essential that An Post can continue to ensure its prices are cost-oriented. There also appears to be a conflict in the Bill regarding the terms and conditions which require all USO prices to be approved in advance by ComReg.  Section 19(2)(<i>b</i>) gives ComReg <i>ex ante</i> control over all prices for all services within the USO.  This appears to conflict with the concept of a price cap, which is set out in section 1.</P>
        <P>Part 3 provides that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may establish, maintain and operate a national postcode system.  The Minister is persisting in taking a bewildering approach, to say the least.   Ireland is the last country in the European Union to develop a postcode system, despite our technological capabilities.  However, the Minister, who talks a good deal about the smart economy, persists with the notion of a location-based cluster system even though a unique identifier system could be introduced at far less cost, with a far less significant maintenance requirement and with many more possibilities to develop follow-on applications in line with technological advances in satellite navigation and so on.  I am bewildered and frustrated by the Minister&rsquo;s persistence in plodding along as if his way is the only way.  It is an inadequate approach in terms of the current and future needs of a smart economy.  It is also a ponderous and burdensome way to approach the development of a postcode system because it will require continuous and costly maintenance as properties are added to particular clusters.</P>
        <P>I was appointed rapporteur when the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources undertook to produce a report on options for a postcode system.  Our report, which was endorsed by the committee, proposed a unique identifier system as offering several advantages such as facilitating a speedy response by emergency services, providing greater efficiency and interaction with GPS technologies, and not requiring a change in the names of townlands. Such a system would have low maintenance costs, support spatial planning and facilitate the delivery of health services.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to review that report.  It is crucial that we use the best available technology.  We may be behind our European Union colleagues but we should aim to be the best in terms of delivery.  A postcode system based on a unique identifier scheme offers a range of benefits and can utilise the best, most up-to-date technology.</P>
        <P>Our report to the Oireachtas committee also recommended that a roadmap outlining precisely how postcodes will operate should be published by September 2010.  This would have fully prepared the public, businesses and State bodies for the changes.  The Minister is talking about changes being introduced by the end of 2011, but nobody knows what is involved.  A roadmap is vital to  provide clarity and direction and to ensure people buy into the concept.  A new system will not work unless people operate it.</P>
        <P>The report also recommended that if a short lead-in time is envisaged, an incentive-based scheme should be introduced to encourage the use of postcodes.  This could include free postage for a month for households who opt to participate.  That proposal was also favourably received by the committee.  As part of our consultation process we received valuable contributions from various organisations including the Health Service Executive and the National Centre for Geocomputation.  Both of these bodies of critical mass were crystal clear in their endorsement of a unique identifier system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What the Minister is proposing, however, is a type of hybrid which has been endorsed by nobody.  None of the reports produced by various consultants and interested parties called for such a system.  We need a postcode system that represents good investment practice and which is in line with the objective to develop a modern and progressive digital economy.  It is regrettable that the Minister is not listening.  I would be the first to applaud him were he to open his <Col N="566"/>eyes and take that leap into the 21st century.  We get a great deal of rhetoric from the Minister, yet here we have a practical example where, given a choice, he has chosen wrong.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s arguments against a unique identifier system are that, first, people will have difficulty remembering such a number and, second, that there is a data protection issue.  Neither argument stands up and the first is insulting.  People remember their mobile telephone number and PPS number, for example, without difficulty, and some with good numerical ability can remember entire lists of numbers.  Regarding data protection, I will put forward an amendment to deal with that issue, which I hope the Minister will accept.  Even without the amendment, the reality is that what the Minister seems to be saying, in his rather convoluted way, is that locational codes can become unique identifiers.  If that is the case then data protection is not an issue.  In other words, he is developing a very slow route towards the same objective whereas I would urge the fast track.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Coming back to An Post, it has a good record in meeting many difficult challenges.  It is blessed in that the staff union has been very active in representing workers while at the same time taking a realistic approach in terms of meeting challenges.  There is a good bedrock for new initiatives.  At a meeting of the Oireachtas committee some time ago to discuss the demise of Postbank, the Minister painted a rosy picture of all the opportunities available to An Post and of its wonderful network &mdash; which is true &mdash; yet here was a practical initiative that went into the sand.  Will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, why that was allowed to happen?  That meeting was attended by Mr. Ian McArdle of the Communications Workers Union, CWU, and he made the point that when BNP Paribas, which was 50% partner in Postbank, decided to pull out, the union had tried to engage with the Minister for Finance based on his declaration at the time that no Irish bank should be allowed to fail.  It is extraordinary that this innovation which met a need at local level &mdash; particularly in small provincial towns and villages, including many in my constituency, where banking services had been lost &mdash; was allowed to go under.  The Minister for Finance was asked for the relatively modest sum of &euro;50 million, which seems like peanuts compared with the figures involved in the bank bailout, to keep that service going, but it was not forthcoming.</P>
        <P>We must be realistic about the challenges facing An Post.  I do not go along with the rose tinted view that An Post can do all sorts of lovely things and provide for rural communities in a progressive way.  It may be able to do so &mdash; I hope it will &mdash; but it will be very difficult.  We are faced with an extremely harsh climate in which to develop innovative schemes whether in the public or private sector.  We must be conscious of that in terms of making this legislation work.  I urge the Minister to be open to amendments.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar has raised a couple of very valuable points.  I hope I can do the same when the time comes.  I note we are not to have Committee Stage next week but I suppose it is no surprise that these matters continue into the never-never since the Government wants to do the same.  To be cynical, if An Post had been in a position to take the Minister out onto the golf course, perhaps it would have got its &euro;50 million.</P>

	<P>Sinn F&eacute;in probably stands alone in this Chamber in support of the postal workers and the rights and entitlements of people who live in rural communities.  It is totally opposed to this Bill.</P><Col N="567"/>
        <P>The object of the Bill is to liberalise the postal services.  That means it claims to protect the universal service obligation.  That claim is not worth the paper it is written on, nor is the claim that the EU directive will protect the obligation forever.  If we need proof of this, we need only look to what is happening in the United Kingdom at present.  When similar legislation to give effect to the EU directive was published, assurances were given that six-day deliveries and collections would be copper-fastened.  Now that the UK Government is preparing to privatise Royal Mail, it has emerged that the provision of all services will be dependent on profit margins.  This will mean that if a postal company can prove that it is losing money, it will be able to downgrade its services and only operate the profitable ones.</P>
        <P>Defenders of this Bill claim the universal service obligation is copper-fastened.  In fact, section 17 makes it clear that this will be reviewed by ComReg even before the seven-year period for which An Post is designated as universal provider is up.  The section also provides for the designation of companies other than An Post as the universal provider but, more important, contains a clause under which the obligation can be removed altogether.  There are currently no plans to privatise An Post as a whole but the Bill and the tenor of the EU stance on the liberalisation of postal and other public services will inevitably lead not only to the breaking up of the postal services, but to cherry-picking and the selling off of the most profitable ventures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That the privatisation of State assets will be part of the IMF-EU bailout for the banks is clear.  The Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, chaired by Mr. Colm McCarthy, who has already made clear his support for privatisation, is due to be presented soon.  It would be interesting to see what he recommends and the way in which the Government and its successors act upon the recommendations.  The report was supposed to have been published before the end of last year but in reply to a question from me yesterday, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated the group is to engage in further consultation before it presents the report.  Has the postponement anything to do with the fact that light was shed on the interests of a company chaired by the former Taoiseach in buying Coillte?  Mr. McCarthy, in his an bord snip nua report, already recommended that the privatisation of our forestry sector be given consideration so it might have been a bit embarrassing if his report were to repeat that at a time when people had realised the interest of former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and his chums in buying up 7% of the State&rsquo;s land.</P>
        <P>In another reply, the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, told me that privatisation of State assets has been discussed as part of the bailout and that the Government will consult the Commission on the results of this assessment with a view to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of State-owned assets.  He specifically mentioned An Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB.</P>
        <P>It is clear, then, that in the current climate we need much firmer guarantees that An Post will not be asset stripped and that the people of this State will not be left with a poorer and more expensive service.  It must also be guaranteed that rural communities will not be left in circumstances where postal collection and deliveries do not take place six days per week.</P>
        <P>The service provided by the postal service to people in isolated rural areas, particularly those who are most in need, including the elderly, is second to none.  The service constitutes a point of social contact for many in rural Ireland.  I know postal workers who, in the line of duty, make deliveries to people who are unable to make it to the nearest village or town.  They take papers and groceries to those who need them and act as a conduit to the general public.  The service will almost certainly be lost with the privatisation of An Post, thereby doing considerable damage to rural Ireland.  The damage will add to existing damage to rural Ireland by the Government and its predecessors down through the years.</P>
        <P>We need guarantees to protect the tried and tested service.  If such guarantees are not built into this Bill by way of amendment, Sinn F&eacute;in will vote against it.  It will do so to protect the <Col N="568"/>jobs of postal workers and the excellent service that An Post currently provides throughout the State.  It will also be opposing it because it does not believe that public companies that have been built over generations should be stripped down, torn apart and sold off to private interests.  It certainly does not support the selling off of any State company in order to comply with the terms of the IMF-EU bailout for the failed bankers, speculators and developers, some of whom will no doubt be joining their former Taoiseach in companies ready to move in for the kill if and when the services are sold.</P>
        <P>It is clear that this Bill, as it stands, does not serve to protect our postal services.  It is also clear that it lays the basis for the breaking up of An Post and the selling off of profitable parts of the company to private companies.  Sinn F&eacute;in will stand against the content of the Bill and it has tabled amendments thereto.  If they are not accepted and implemented to the letter, we will stand against this Bill.  We will stand with the workers and those who live in rural Ireland who have no service.  We will stand with the postal workers because an inevitable consequence of privatisation, if this Bill is passed, will be that they will lose their jobs.  Services that are less profitable or unprofitable will be done away with.  This will mean the only interest the private companies will have in any future postal service will be based exclusively on profit for themselves.</P>

        <P>Courtesy normally ordains that a Minister be present for the opening slots when a Bill is being considered.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AengusOSnodaighSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh</NameTxt>
	<P>I tweet as well but I am not a twit.  Having said that, this is serious legislation.  I am opposed to it because I am ideologically opposed to its thrust.  It is one of the hangover Bills from the Progressive Democrats, the agenda of which was fully endorsed by Fianna F&aacute;il in various coalitions.  It has now been embraced totally by the Green Party.  I am opposed to it.</P>
        <P>I was recently at the GPO, which is running an interesting exhibition entitled, &ldquo;The Letters, Lives and Liberty&rdquo;.  It shows the pivotal role of An Post and its predecessor in Irish history and society.  I advise the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to attend the exhibition before he destroys one of our society&rsquo;s best organisations and the network it has created.  Rural Deputies in particular would be able to outline the vital role played by An Post.</P>
        <P>By privatising postage, the Bill will discard the proud record of An Post and end in tears, as it will ruin the postal service as we know it.  It is a charter for cherry-pickers.  Cherry-picking is a process whereby market entrants only provide services to the lucrative end of the market, leaving existing operators with most of the loss-making part of the operation.  In terms of postal <Col N="569"/>services, we can expect postal operators to be interested in large towns and cities, the likes of Dublin and Cork, while much of rural Ireland will be left alone because of its isolation.  Due to the cost involved in daily deliveries, those areas would be left without a proper postal service and definitely without daily deliveries.  This would make the provision of rural services non-viable for what remains of An Post without a significant price hike or subsidies from the taxpayer.  Given our current crisis, the Minister should consider how we will need to bail out An Post.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Cherry-picking is not a possible outcome of the legislation.  Rather, it is a certainty.  The 2005 ECORYS report on the development of competition in the European postal sector predicted that private providers in Ireland will seek to operate in niche markets and certain geographical areas.  Instead of establishing any genuine competition with An Post, private companies will simply take the easy profits.  This will remove the revenue streams that are necessary for An Post to cross-subsidise the price of deliveries to rural homes.  As a competing business, An Post will be left with few options.  One would be to increase the price of stamps exorbitantly for rural post, another would be to seek Exchequer support and another would be to close up shop.</P>
        <P>The so-called sharing mechanism outlined in the Bill is a non-runner.  The Bill provides that ComReg may, at an unspecified time, develop some sort of mechanism to have new private operators compensate An Post for the burden of the latter&rsquo;s universal service obligation.  Deputies should remember the debacle that was the battle over risk equalisation in the health insurance market, which was liberalised in the not-too-distant past.  We all know how that ended.  The compensatory transfers necessary to ensure community ratings were successfully challenged by the new insurance entrants.  Cherry-picking still continues.  This situation has contributed to what is fundamentally a piecemeal system as well as to phenomenal price hikes, such as those announced by the VHI last week.  Likewise, private postal companies will challenge the proposed sharing mechanism as a barrier under EU competition law.  A likely outcome of the Bill will see the taxpayer needing to bail out An Post.  Given that An Post would not need a bailout in the absence of private operators, it is important to ask who those operators would benefit.  In this case, the beneficiaries would be the usual suspects, namely, Germany and Britain.</P>
        <P>I have more to say on this matter.  The Bill is based on the policies of a former Deputy and Commissioner, Mr. Charlie McCreevy.  It is interesting that today he is a director of one of Ireland&rsquo;s most anti-union companies, Ryanair.  It is regrettable that he has strange bedfellows in the Labour Party, which supported the European directive from which this Bill stems and failed to oppose the Bill in the Seanad.  I urge Labour Party Deputies in particular to concentrate more on this Bill and to oppose it and the political and ideological agendas behind it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to open the postal services market to competition.  While competition can be of benefit, for example, in the case of airlines, I am not convinced the postal service situation is comparable.  I am stating the obvious when I say we have an excellent postal service.  It is efficient, regular and reasonably priced.  Our prices are the eighth lowest among 29 European countries.  I hope the Bill will protect our high levels of service.</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge another aspect of postal services, namely, the social service that postmen and postwomen provide, particularly in rural areas.  It is positive, albeit unfortunate, that a postman or postwoman is often the only source of contact for people in some isolated rural areas.  The Minister acknowledged the role of post offices throughout the country and the considerable range of services they provide.</P>
        <P>Is it a case of reinventing a system that works?  If something is not broken, why are we trying to fix it?  Like others, I have been contacted by people who are worried about the Bill&rsquo;s <Col N="570"/>implications.  They are concerned that with the opening of the postal market, there may be an erosion of service levels.  In Europe, liberalisation has seen social dumping.  People are concerned about job losses and that reliable and socially beneficial jobs may be replaced by temporary and poorly paid positions.  This type of social dumping cannot be allowed and employment standards must be protected.  There are also concerns that An Post&rsquo;s high standards will not be maintained.</P>
        <P>One section of the Bill relates to ensuring that postal service users may avail of a universal postal service that meets their reasonable needs but is this not the case under the current system?  Will the Bill have positive or negative effects?</P>
        <P>I welcome some provisions.  For example, the postal service will be free of charge for blind and partially sighted persons and address the needs of specific social groups, in particular disabled postal service users.  I welcome the provisions on the quality, regularity and reliability of service standards and the directions regarding corrective action where necessary.  I also acknowledge the conditions regarding the withdrawal of service, the code of practice for the handling of users&rsquo; complaints and the provisions on a price cap.</P>
        <P>An Post will be the universal postal service provider for a period of seven years.  This will pose it with a challenge and an opportunity.  It has been facing other challenges, given the advantages posed by IT and the need to generate new income but I trust its board and management will rise to the challenge and ensure it is the operator of choice in a liberalised market.  I hope its board and management will not get caught up in the culture of bonuses and expenses.  Workers in post offices and those who deliver the mail have been doing their part efficiently and responsibly.  I hope the fears of many workers and their families that this Bill is a threat to the postal service and the 10,000 jobs that depend on it will not be realised in this legislation.  I hope the high standards to which we are used, the efficiency and reliability of those working in An Post and a reasonably priced service that covers many needs and the wonderful work being done in post offices will be maintained.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this new legislation.  I support the principle of a universal postal service.  I also support the 18,000 people employed in the communications sector.  I commend the Communications Workers Union, CWU, and its members on their dedication and professionalism in providing this service.  My late father was a postman and a committed public sector worker.  The significant community service provided by postal workers, particularly to senior citizens and people who live on their own, has been mentioned.  Many of us remember the joy when the local postman delivered a parcel from America.  It is important to remember such community contacts because they are relevant to the debate.</P>
        <P>This legislation also relates to quality public services.  It is important to recognise the great work done by CWU members.  It seems not to be fashionable to stand up for public sector workers and trade union members but I support the public service, the teachers, nurses, civil servants, council staff, postal staff and health care staff.  Most of them do a great job but are often blamed by certain political and other sections of society.  From the lack of informed debate, one would think public servants caused the economic crisis.  Politicians, bankers, developers, sections of the media, the regulator and a greedy section of society caused this economic mess.  Any other view is inaccurate and unacceptable.</P><Col N="571"/>
        <P>The legislation will shape the future of the Irish postal market for generations.  The changes that will be introduced under the legislation must be carefully considered to ensure we do not make the mistakes other European countries have made when liberalising their postal markets, which led to job losses, higher costs and lower service levels.  At stake is a vital public service that must be considered a basic right as it connects every household and business to a communications and economic infrastructure that is essential to the social and economic well-being of the country.</P>
        <P>I have major concerns about the liberalisation of the postal service.  The viability of the universal service obligation would be under threat in a liberalised market.  In the absence of a proven method of financing, there are serious questions about the USO.  Liberalisation will remove the restrictive monopoly that An Post uses to fund the loss making parts of the USO.  The Government view appears to favour the establishment of a sharing mechanism but the CWU would prefer all funding options to be included in the legislation, including state aid.  Nothing should be ruled out until we know what a liberalised market looks like.  We must learn the lessons from other countries, such as Britain, where the USO is now under serious threat due to the regulatory choices made there.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Looking at the experience of the Royal Mail in Britain, we can see how important downstream access is.  If it is handled badly, it could spell the end of An Post and the loss of 10,000 jobs.  Access to the network must be on a commercial basis and must not fall below mail centre level as this would render useless much of the technology in which An Post has invested in recent years and would require the reconfiguration of the entire network.  Cherry-picking occurs when An Post&rsquo;s competitors compete for business on profitable postal routes only.  The effect is to reduce vital revenues for An Post, leaving it only with the loss making routes, which are substantial in Ireland, thereby threatening the viability of the USO.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately job losses and liberalisation go hand in hand.  This has been the experience in every postal market that has been opened to competition as shown in a comprehensive study by the UNI across a number of liberalised markets.  Social dumping is also a concern, where decent jobs with reasonable terms and conditions are replaced by low paid temporary posts that force employees to maintain dependence on social welfare, as has happened in Germany.</P>
        <P>The social value of the postal service is widely acknowledged, particularly in rural communities and especially in bad weather conditions like those we saw recently.  It is striking that the legislation does not refer to the fact that the postal network is a vital part of the fabric of our communities.  It should be the case that decisions of the regulator must take into account the unique value of the postal service in Ireland, with its substantial rural population, and care should be taken to ensure the interests of a competitive market do not take precedence over or put at risk this vital public service, which is part of the fabric of our communities and provides a sense of national cohesion.</P>
        <P>We must also address the positive side of An Post and its services.  Postage costs in Ireland are the eighth lowest of the 29 European countries according to a 2010 survey, while it is the seventh most efficient postal operator.  In 20 years, prices have increased on only three occasions and it has lagged behind inflation for the same period.  It operates with no State subvention or taxpayer support.  It is important to remember that An Post made &euro;5.7 million in operational profit in 2009 on a turnover of &euro;805.2 million, down 5.4% from &euro;850 million in 2008.  We have also seen the decline in mail volumes due to modern technology, down 16% since the start of 2009.  Each 1% decline represents &euro;5 million.  We also have e-billing becoming more common and grave concern has been expressed by An Post about companies imposing such billing on customers.</P><Col N="572"/>
        <P>The greatest challenge is the funding of the USO in the future.  A compensation fund has not worked anywhere else in the world.  We need state aid as an option for the future because we do not know how the market will look in five years.  We need a plan B in case the market needs it.  A lack of planning led to many of our current problems so we must ensure An Post has commercial freedom to compete with new market entrants in profitable areas.  Access below mail centre level will signal the end of An Post and must therefore be covered in the legislation.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The main purpose of this Bill is to transpose the third postal services directive, providing for the final phase in the opening of postal services to competition.  The Bill sets out a regulatory framework the main purpose of which is to safeguard the permanent provision of a universal postal service while encouraging competition in the market.  We must ensure financial support for the provision of universal postal services.  I am concerned, however, about the influence of the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, on this directive.  We have learned that the direction in which such people brought the country was part of the problem that led to the current crisis.  We must learn those lessons when looking at this legislation.   I commend the staff on doing an excellent job.  They have a fantastic record for delivering the services, including a day-after postal service.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to listen to my concerns about this legislation.</P>

	<P>The Communication Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010 is vital legislation which should be used to improve the postal service for the population as well as allowing greater efficiencies for business.  It also has the potential to be of great benefit to the emergency services.  However, in achieving these efficiencies, job losses must be minimised and negative repercussions for our rural communities must be avoided.</P>
        <P>I have serious concerns about opening the Irish postal services market to free competition.  My fear is that it will lead to significant inefficiencies within the postal service and widespread job losses.  I am also of the opinion that it will jeopardise the vital services currently provided by the existing postmen and postwomen in rural Ireland who for decades have provided an essential service to rural communities.  Our elderly population, especially in rural areas, often rely on the staff of An Post for peace of mind and, at times, they are their only form of communication with the outside world.  I doubt that this vital cog in the wheel of rural Ireland will be maintained if we adopt an approach which opens up the market to private operators.</P>
        <P>This provision in the Bill will, in my view, lead to widespread job losses throughout the country.  We must learn from the experience of our fellow EU members where the opening of the postal market has led to job losses but has failed to have the desired effect of decreasing costs.  According to British commentators, the Royal Mail was seriously damaged when private operators were allowed to gain access to the market.  In Germany, staff numbers were slashed when liberalisation was introduced.  However, the German consumer experienced no drop in prices for the service.  Currently, 10,000 jobs are dependent on the postal service in Ireland and we have the eighth lowest price out of 29 European countries for postal services.</P>
        <P>I question whether this provision would lead to a more efficient postal service.  Currently, An Post operates very efficiently.  On the other hand, the quality of service in countries where the service has been liberalised has suffered a decline.  The Communication Workers Union has told an Oireachtas committee that liberalisation will not necessarily guarantee an increase in postal volumes or employment, nor will it lead to a decrease in the cost of postage.  The <Col N="573"/>universal service obligation, which guarantees five days a week delivery to every address in the country, comes under threat.  We must protect this critical element of the Irish market which provides the same service to everyone in the country at the same price.  There are significant doubts as to whether there will be any interest from private operators.  To date, there has been no contact from any private operator inquiring about the prices which An Post may charge for access to the service.</P>
        <P>In my view, the most important aspect of the existing postal service is the contribution to rural communities.  The introduction of the provision would have a significantly negative impact in this regard.  The postmen and postwomen call regularly to isolated rural homes.  This provides an important social outlet for the elderly and provides security and peace of mind for thousands.  The liberalisation of the postal service would seriously jeopardise this important social service.  It must be remembered that 40% of the population is rural and widely dispersed.  The most probable outcome of opening the market would be widespread cherry-picking of the more profitable urban routes, leading to the neglect of rural areas.  This is of significant concern to me.</P>
        <P>I welcome certain elements of the Bill.  The introduction of post codes is long overdue.  Ireland is the only OECD country which does not have a national post code system.  The introduction will undoubtedly benefit businesses and consumers and emergency services.</P>
        <P>We must be prepared to learn lessons from the international experience.  We need to examine events in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.  Ireland cannot afford the inevitable job losses which will occur.  We need to support An Post which already offers very competitive prices.  Most important, we must maintain the valuable services provided by postmen and postwomen in rural Ireland, as I have outlined.</P>
        <P>It seems to me that some of this legislation we have introduced in the past few years has had a very negative impact on rural Ireland.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that rural Ireland has taken a bit of a hammering in this respect.  We must not isolate these communities further by doing anything that would jeopardise them.</P>

	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Bill.  I welcome the Minister and I hope he is listening and will engage with all sides of the House before the Bill is rushed through or given a swift passage through the House.</P>
        <P>This legislation proposes to open the Irish postal market to free competition.  This may be regarded as a wonderful thing but, unfortunately, we have found out in recent times that it is not all it is made out to be.  The result will be to undermine the current funding model for the universal service obligation of the Irish postal services.  This is a fundamental tablet of stone that has been used by An Post and successive Governments since the foundation of the State.  This is the mechanism that allows An Post to fund the loss making part of its service provision.  This is critical for our society and our communities as it guarantees a five days a week delivery service to every address in the country at a single price.  It is the backbone of the postal service.</P>
        <P>With advances in technology, communications networks are changing drastically.  There are more ways and options available for people to communicate, but this does not take away from the importance of the postal service which provides a door-to-door service to every household, at a reasonable cost.  It also facilitates and further embodies the age-old practice of letter-writing.  The art of letter-writing is a creative art in itself and is treasured by many people in both rural and urban Ireland.  Many elderly people have learned that wonderful craft of letter-writing in school and enjoy writing letters and look forward to the postman whistling as he comes to the door.</P><Col N="574"/>
        <P>The viability of this service is threatened by this Bill, as are 10,000 jobs in the sector.  At a time when jobs are haemorrhaging at an alarming rate, if this Bill is passed, we will be accused of paying lip-service and of uttering pious platitudes and passionate pleas about stimulating growth and preserving jobs.  It beggars belief that the Bill will have such a fundamental impact.</P>
        <P>I have been lobbied not only by postmen and women and post mistresses and masters, but also by trade union representatives, who made solid cases.  They asked us to look over our shoulders to our near neighbours in Britain.  Evidence from across Europe, including Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, where liberalisation has already occurred, indicates that the opening of the postal market results in an erosion in service levels and job losses.  It also results in social dumping.  That is new jargon but we all know what it means.  Decent jobs with reasonable pay and conditions will be replaced by low paid work.  We have heard too much about that in the context of the recent unfair reduction to the minimum wage.  In Germany, the temporary and precarious nature of postal jobs force employees to depend on social welfare for supplementary income.  Employment standards in the industry must be protected.</P>
        <P>The Bill must include a reference to recital 16 of the European postal directive, which states that social considerations should be taken into account when preparing to open postal markets.  With the advent of the Celtic tiger, social considerations were put on the back burner.  Recital 16 was specifically included in the directive to provide member states with an opportunity to legislate against negative outcomes.</P>
        <P>An Post has never needed State aid or taxpayer support.  The price of a stamp funds a service which delivers post to every door.  Clearly, a significant amount of human labour is required from the time the stamp is fixed onto an envelope in a friendly post office until it is delivered locally, in some cases by bicycle.  I compliment postmen and women on their work.  As a small boy I remember the friendliness of my postman.  That is still the case in rural Ireland and, I believe, in our towns.  It was never needed more than during the recent cold spell, when the postman or woman was the only individual who regularly checked in on elderly and isolated people.  In many cases, they were the ones who raised the alarm when they discovered somebody who was unwell or worse.</P>
        <P>Postmen and women have also prevented crimes.  I sit on the national board of Muintir na Tire, which runs the community alert and neighbourhood watch programmes.  Many postmen went beyond the call of duty to act as the eyes and ears for their communities.  They are not spies, however, but decent people who are mindful of who they meet in strange places and vehicles.  They play an important role in ensuring the safety of our communities.</P>
        <P>The efficient service which An Post operates is one of the least expensive in Europe, but it operates to some of the highest standards.  Its prices are the eighth lowest out of 29 countries surveyed.  These high standards must be protected.  The employment conditions of postal workers who work in difficult conditions should not be undermined.  I acknowledge the importance of postal services to the public good.  They form an essential part of the fabric of our society and provide stable jobs that must be protected in the current economic conditions.</P>
        <P>All post offices do a great job but sub-post offices face particular dangers because of the money which they carry on behalf of An Post and the State.  Many have been violently robbed and they must operate to high standards of security.  I have an intimate understanding of the risks they face because my own sister is a post mistress.  There is no more important social role than that of postal worker.  We have stripped away many social services but we cannot allow this one to be undermined or threatened in any way.</P>
        <P>The Minister has good reason for introducing this Bill but it is badly thought out, ill-advised and must be re-examined.  The experience across the water in the UK indicates the importance <Col N="575"/>of downstream access.  If this is handled badly, it could spell the end of An Post and 10,000 jobs.  I am not scaremongering; I refer to the experience of our nearest neighbour.  Opening up the service will lead to the cherry-picking of profitable routes.  We saw what happened to Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  I have repeatedly argued in this House and elsewhere that the ESB should not be a monopoly but I am certainly not in favour of opening up services as we did with Eircom in 1999.  A good friend of mine who is employed by that company was previously based in Clonmel but is now required to cover the entire south east.  He would need a helicopter to travel and he is on call almost every second weekend.  Eircom&rsquo;s employees work very diligently but local knowledge has been lost.  The company has changed hands so many times that its employees would be hard pressed to know who owns it now.  That cannot be allowed to happen to An Post.</P>
        <P>I have no intention of voting for the Bill because it may do irreversible damage to the fabric of rural communities.  We have seen the result of the loss of rural co-operatives.  The meitheal spirit of the late Canon Hayes, which led to the creation of small and beautiful co-operatives, mushroomed into Glanbia and Dairygold, with the result that wastelands have been created in the centre of our towns and villages.  Trucks are on the road 24-7 but the human way of life in rural Ireland has been undermined.  The inclement weather restored the spirit of co-operation somewhat because people had time to check on each other or sit and talk because they could not drive along the roads.  It was an act of God that brought us back 20 years to a time when we engaged with our neighbours.</P>
        <P>Several years ago, we fought a huge battle over the proposal to install green boxes at the end of certain lanes.  It may have been a cost cutting exercise but it was also a retrograde step.  Postmen and women are often invited to have a cup of tea and a chat with lonely people.  Sometimes they deliver or exchange newspapers.  I hope I do not get anybody into trouble when I note that many postmen drove past the boxes to deliver post personally.  It is part of the human nature of Irish people, who are diligent about their work and interested in human engagement.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, job losses and social dumping go hand in hand with liberalisation.  We need look no further than Eircom for evidence of this.  According to a comprehensive study undertaken by the UNI network, job losses occurred in nearly every postal market opened to competition.  That first class research on countries which opted for liberalisation is there for anybody to examine.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>We cannot allow this and must call a halt.  We must hold on to what we have and go back to sensible engagement.  I do not believe many people will line up to take this over in the current climate.  We should hold on to what we have as we have lost enough.  It is incumbent on all of us go nd&eacute;anfaimid &aacute;r nd&iacute;cheall chun an seirbh&iacute;s sin a choime&aacute;d.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill 2010.  The reality is that An Post has never received state aid as a semi-State company.  In fact, it has been one of the more profitable semi-State companies.  Throughout its history it has been seen as one of the leaders in Europe in regard to its efficiency as an operator.  It is the seventh most efficient operator of 29 countries surveyed by DHL last year.  That survey also showed that An Post is the eighth cheapest in regard to postal costs.  Last week, we saw the appalling situation in regard to the VHI and the dramatic increase in premiums.  In 20 years An Post has increased the cost of a stamp on three occasions.  It is semi-State company which has done well.</P>
        <P>This side of the House has made the argument that we need to restructure and reform our semi-State companies to deal with the challenges in our economy and An Post has met those <Col N="576"/>challenges head on.  We do not want to see badly managed and poorly regulated competition introduced into the postal market that will end up with the State and the taxpayer having to subsidise An Post.  The company and its employees do not want that situation to arise either.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important that we do not repeat the mistakes made in other EU countries.  In other EU member states services, in particular rural services, have been degraded.  There has been a dramatic impact on rural services in many of the countries which have deregulated the sector in regard to the letter market.  The UK is a prime example where the situation is a complete mess.  The British postal system will never be repaired.  It will cost a significant amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money in the UK to address the situation on foot of deregulation taking place there.</P>
        <P>The postal service is a vital public service.  I spoke to an elderly person earlier this week and he made the point that unless he meets the postman in the morning, he does not know what is going on in the local area because he will not see another individual for the whole day.  If he misses the postman, he will not know what is going on, whether a neighbour is sick, someone has passed away or whatever.  It is a communications lifeline for many people in rural and isolated areas.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge that our country is largely rural and that the population is very dispersed.  One cannot compare what happens in Ireland to what happens in other European countries where there are high proportions of densely populated areas.  Large proportions of our population live in rural areas.  There is a crucial social service aspect to the postal service and that must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>On foot of this legislation, there is a question mark over the five day postal delivery service in rural areas.  As my colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, pointed out earlier, section 17 allows ComReg to remove this requirement without ministerial approval.  Many of us who have had direct experience of ComReg down through the years would not exactly sing its praises in regard to its performance in the telecommunications sector.  We are now giving ComReg a role in regard to the postal service.  There is a real and genuine fear that because of costs, An Post will be forced into a situation where it will reduce the five day per week rural delivery service, which it currently provides, to a two or three day per week service.  It is imperative that the nationwide door-to-door postal delivery service remains in place and that it remains a cornerstone of policy for this Government, or the next one.  As far as Fine Gael is concerned, it will be a cornerstone of our national policy on the postal service.</P>
        <P>We must ensure this legislation guarantees the continuation of that vital aspect of the postal service, that An Post remains a truly nationwide company and that it continues to run in a cost effective and efficient manner, something which it has done down through the years.  Over the past number of years it has made significant investment in its mail system and the last thing that should happen is for that system to be undermined by this legislation.  We do not want a situation to arise where there is a requirement to turn to the Government for a subsidy.  The protections must be enshrined in this legislation to ensure that does not happen.</P>
        <P>Not only are we looking at the possibility of a threat to the daily delivery service, we are probably looking at a significant increase in the cost of postage in rural areas.  What will in all likelihood happen is that a zonal system in regard to charging will be introduced with the cheapest delivery cost being the main urban centre of Dublin, with the next rate being the other urban centres throughout the country.  Then as one moves further from Dublin, additional costs will be involved.  We will lose the universality which has been the cornerstone of our postal system to date.  This will also have an impact on isolated individuals and rural communi<Col N="577"/>ties.  They are not prepared to accept a reduction in service.  We have a company which is able to provide a cost effective and profitable service to every home in the country.</P>
        <P>There is also a huge security aspect in rural areas.  Over the past number of years the Government has downgraded or closed many rural Garda stations and run down many of the other services available in rural communities.  Having the postman call on a daily basis gives that added element of security to elderly people and individuals living in isolated areas.</P>
        <P>It seems the Government is trying to use a telecoms model of liberalisation in this legislation.  As we know, the telecoms model has failed dismally.  My fear is that if we introduce this, we will destroy the services that have been so important to rural areas.</P>
        <P>I also have serious concerns about the proposed compensation fund which seems very like the proposal put in place for the health insurance sector.  Introducing a compensation fund in the health insurance sector has been an unmitigated disaster.  As we have seen, the VHI has hiked its premiums for the third year in a row, this time with a massive increase of 45%.  We will now use something similar in regard to the postal service.  It has not worked in regard to the health insurance sector, nor has it worked in any other EU country where it has been introduced.  It is a failed system and if it has failed in another EU country, I do not see why we should try to adopt it when it has not, nor is likely, to work.  We should consider the Finnish model which seems to be very successful.  That country has a very dispersed population similar to Ireland.  There has not been the cherry-picking we have seen in other EU countries.</P>
        <P>It is also important that the Minister should have powers to direct the regulator.  This has been a fundamental flaw in energy regulation here and we have had debates in the House when the Minister stated he should not give a direction to the energy regulator.  It is imperative that the Minister should have the ability to give such direction to the regulator.  Let him lay those directions before the House and put them in the public domain.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P><Col N="578"/>
        <P>The waiting times for patients attending emergency departments in many hospitals during the first week of January were unacceptable and I very much regret the delays that patients experienced.  I have discussed plans with the HSE for ensuring that this situation does not recur.  The HSE has assured me that it will take all possible steps to improve waiting times in emergency departments, so that all patients are assessed, treated and discharged or admitted without unnecessary delay.  The HSE has taken specific steps to cope with the increase in activity that is normally experienced at this time of year.  These include opening beds which are normally closed for seasonal reasons.</P>
        <P>Other actions taken by hospitals include increasing the number of ward rounds to ensure that any patients who are ready to go home are discharged with support as necessary from community-based services.  Hospitals are also ensuring that discharges are carried out early in the morning and over the weekend to make beds available for patients being admitted through the emergency departments.  In addition, the HSE is working to have senior clinical decision makers and diagnostic services speedily available for emergency departments.  The HSE has also provided for enhanced GP out-of-hours services through the expansion of the GP co-operatives.</P>
        <P>The steps I have outlined are taken to address the current short-term difficulties.  Improving access to hospital services requires a wider health-care approach.  In recognition of this, the HSE has undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years.  These include the winter initiative programme, the introduction of the code of practice for integrated discharge planning and actions to reduce the number of delayed discharges, including the introduction of the fair deal.  Other innovations undertaken by the HSE include the development of emergency care networks and the acute medicine programme which involves the establishment of acute medical and surgical assessment units, rapid access clinics and minor injury units.  The programme seeks to channel patients quickly to the service best suited to their needs and to reduce the usage of emergency department services by those who can be best treated elsewhere.  A new acute medical unit was opened at Cork University Hospital last Monday.  Other similar units are already in place at Kerry General Hospital and St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny.  The HSE service plan for 2011, which I recently approved, commits to the establishment of 12 acute medical units during 2011 with an investment of &euro;8.5 million.</P>
        <P>Emergency departments have particular infection control protocols in place for staff to manage patients attending with flu-like illnesses including the H1NI virus to minimise risk to patients and staff.  The key to addressing the emergency department challenge is an integrated proactive management by all concerned throughout the system.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that minimising waiting times in emergency departments is a key priority in their service to patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Minister a happy new year in her first Question Time of the new year &mdash; possibly her last if I hear correctly what is going on outside.</P>
        <P>As I raised this issue with you this morning, a Cheann Comhairle, I will now read into the record of the D&aacute;il the question I put and not the question that was issued by the General Office:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">To ask the Minister for Health and Children in view of the number of patients waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency, which reached an unprecedented high of 569 in January 2011, the precautions being taken to protect patients from cross infection from swine flu and other hospital infections; the additional capacity put in place to deal with the winter increase in hospital admissions; the way she will defend the closure of beds when demand is high; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P><Col N="579"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">While the Minister has given us her answer, I must point out that in January 2007 the average number of people lying on trolleys was 243.  It increased to 286 in January 2008, 346 in January 2009 and 387 in January 2010, and so far this month the average has been 464.  Whatever plans the Minister has been putting in place have clearly not worked.  Given that we know this increase in demand occurs every year during the winter and we end up with this crisis, surely to God there ought to be a plan to deal with this problem, with an additional ward available in the hospitals most at risk.  Why has the Minister not, as I have suggested before, put out to tender to nursing homes for additional beds with associated occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech and language therapy?  That would help to move out of our hospitals 500 patients who have finished the acute phase of their treatment.</P>
        <P>I also asked about swine flu and cross-infection.  On Monday night I was stopped on the road by a taxi driver who told me his wife had been admitted to the Mater Hospital with emphysema and she now has swine flu.  I spoke to a doctor at Beaumont Hospital who told me about a younger man with cancer on chemotherapy who was left beside a patient with swine flu, subsequently contracted it and became very unwell.  These are real risks for people that are unnecessary if the situation were handled properly.  What realistic plans is the Minister putting in place now?  Why have the plans she put in place in the past not worked?  The lack of junior hospital doctors is putting even more pressure on our hospitals in their ability to deal with the influx of patients into hospitals.  How many junior hospital doctor vacancies now exist?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no role in phrasing the questions, nor has my office; it is a matter for the General Office.  I want to make that clear &mdash; in fairness I do not believe the Deputy was suggesting that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not have a role in answering them either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not respond to that provocative comment from Deputy Flanagan.</P>
        <P>I will not dispute the figures even though the official figures are different from the figures quoted by the IMMO.  Arguing between 400 and 569 is a futile exercise; from my point of view too many people have to wait for an unacceptable period of time in emergency departments.  The truth is that there has been virtually constant improvement over the years.  For example, last year during January an average of 57 people were waiting and the previous year it was 69.  Until we get to the end of January we will not be able to see what the average is for this year.  However, those figures are still too high.</P>
        <P>The initiatives being taken include the fair deal, which has had a dramatic impact on late discharges.  Additional capacity is coming on board; for example St. Joseph&rsquo;s in Deputy Reilly&rsquo;s area will greatly relieve pressure at Beaumont Hospital.  Owing to HIQA requirements, that needs to be ramped up gradually and cannot be opened all at once.  The opening of the new unit in Cork last Monday has already had an impact on Cork University Hospital.  Ultimately, the decision on waits in emergency departments relate to the overall functioning of the hospital.  In particular, I am not satisfied with the functioning of six or seven hospitals that constantly have problems, which is why the HSE recently appointed a team to go into those hospitals &mdash; in the first instance they are in Beaumont, Limerick and Drogheda.  Shortly they will go into Tallaght hospital to work with those hospitals.  The team is composed of people from here and from the UK &mdash; they successfully completed such an exercise in the UK.  It will work with those hospitals on the internal mechanisms that lead to long and unsatisfactory waits for patients in emergency departments.</P><Col N="580"/>
        <P>The HSE had closed more than 400 beds, a seasonal measure taken over Christmas, which is always a quieter time for hospitals.  Those beds did not reopen on time this year; I accept they should have opened earlier.  If they had opened, we would not have had the problem we had last week.  Those beds have now been opened, but for cost reasons the remaining beds cannot and will not be opened.  I do not believe it is an issue of simply opening more beds.  There is a subsequent question on hospital beds.  It is a matter for the appropriate functioning of the hospital &mdash; daily discharges with senior clinicians on hand seven days a week.  The HSE is putting in place structured clinical cover at the weekends in the hospitals to ensure that the emergency departments do not suffer from the kind of problems we experienced last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>How long does it take to solve a problem?  The Minister stated this was a national emergency in 2006.  I would have to dispute the Minister&rsquo;s point, that matters were getting better.  There were over 550 patients one day last week, according to the INMO figures, and 442 is the figure for today.  If the Minister has been to any of these emergency departments, they are squashed into tiny little spaces in most unsafe conditions.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister accept that whatever measures she put in place in 2006 when she stated it was a national crisis have failed?  Has she, as I asked in my question, carried out a review of those measures to judge their success and see what has been successful and what has not?  She states that the HSE will do this, that and the other now, but this dates back to 2006 on her own admission.  We cannot live horse and get grass.  There are people lying on trolleys for hours on end who cannot wait until such time as someone somewhere decides to do something.</P>
        <P>There are currently, according to the INMO, 1,672 beds closed in the system.  Will the Minister give the authorisation to open up some of those beds so that we can get rid of this scandal of people lying on trolleys?  The main reason Limerick and Drogheda &mdash; two of the hospitals to which the Minister referred &mdash; are in trouble is because they are having to cater for people from all over their regions and because she has closed other emergency departments.  Let us get real here and let us solve this problem for the people of this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I say to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, and mentioned this in response to Deputy Reilly, I will not dispute the figures, except those figures that are not correct.  The highest figure at 8 a.m. last week was 414.  It suits people to quote an INMO figure one day when it is less favourable and on other occasions to quote a different figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I only always quote the INMO figure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan should quote the official figures.</P>
        <P>Second, we will not be opening more beds.  We have opened over 400 beds that were closed over the Christmas period for seasonal reasons, which is normal and has been normal for umpteen years.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements.  That is not to say that there have not been occasions when there were blips.  We all are aware that there is a swine flu problem.  That has led to over 300 people being in hospital over the past period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Even the Minister's officials state that is not a major factor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a factor.  If swine flu patients are taking up over 300 beds and over 70 ICU  beds, it is a factor.  It is a bigger factor this week than it was last week because we have seen a doubling of swine flu incidents this week over last week.  It has been doubling <Col N="581"/>each week for the past number of weeks and there will be a press conference later today to review that.</P>
        <P>Among the issues identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and everybody else who has looked at this issue, is the need for senior clinicians in the hospital seven days a week, particularly at weekends because there was a high incidence of those who were in hospital on Friday still being there on Monday.  That is being put into effect.  That is possible, both under the new consultant contract and some other issues to do with the Croke Park agreement which are crucial to staff working differently, particularly as far as diagnostics are concerned.  Many patients end up waiting an unacceptable time in the emergency department because they cannot access diagnostics speedily, particularly at night and over the weekends.  I look forward to some of the initiatives that have been tabled by the management of the HSE in the context of the Croke Park agreement being agreed in order to address some of those issues.</P>

	<P>We will keep moving all right, the Ceann Comhairle need not worry about that.</P>
        <P>I want to correct the Minister.  The figures that I gave in this House are totally at variance with how she can say matters have improved significantly.  The figures come from the INMO site.  They may be at variance with those of the HSE which has driven the emergency room consultants to draw their own numbers up as they grew weary of arriving in the morning to be told there were three persons on trolleys in their department when they could clearly see there were still eight, nine or ten waiting for a bed overnight.  We have consistently quoted the INMO, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  I repeat that there were 243 on trolleys in 2007, 286 in 2008, 346 in 2009, 387 in 2010 and 464 in 2011.  It has got worse year on year and for the Minister to state otherwise is to go back to the GUBU years of former Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey in the belief that if one states it often enough it is so.  I say to the Minister it is not so for those who must suffer those conditions in this country and it has gone on too long.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us remember it is Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask a supplementary question.  Why is it not possible to open more beds?  Why, when the Minister is paying out &euro;1.1 billion annually in overtime and allowances, can she not take some money away from that through proper organisation &mdash; overtime should be an exception &mdash; and use it to temporarily open beds?  Why has the Minister not brought in generic drugs prescribing and drugs reference pricing, which, the Minister herself admits, could save a couple of hundred million euro but which she has put on the long finger?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister saying to this House that the emergency room consultants of this country are talking through their hats when they state they believe the swine flu has very little to do with the significant numbers who are now attending?  I am aware that in one hospital, the number admitted up to two weeks ago was only 12.</P>
        <P>Since I have come into this House the Minister has muddied the waters.  Those who come to accident and emergency looking for an X-ray or some other diagnostic test because they cannot get it in the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Reilly is imparting information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;do not get admitted, are not waiting on admissions and are not counted as persons lying on trolleys.  They are people in for a test and they then leave.</P><Col N="582"/>
        <P>The sad point on which I will finish is that the bulk of the on average 464 patients each day this year are sitting on plastic chairs with IV drips hanging out of them, in distress, with no privacy and exposed to cross-infection.  That is the reality.  In Beaumont alone, there are only 12 trolleys and yet there were 47 at one stage waiting admission.  There were four Buxton chairs, which leaves 31 patients waiting in admission on plastic chairs.</P>
        <P>That is the Minister&rsquo;s legacy in health in January 2011 and it saddens me to say it.  She has been an utter failure.  Her plans have failed at every turn.  She has no new plans.  She stands here before us today and tells us there has been significant improvement.  Tell that to those who get cross-infection and to those with cystic fibrosis who risk the needless additional anxiety.</P>

All of the research, both in Ireland and elsewhere, on emergency departments is that quick access to diagnostics and key clinical decision makers are the two most important ingredients in ensuring speedy access through the emergency department.</P>
        <P>The reforms that we have been putting in place are leading to significant improvements, and most of those reforms have been opposed by Deputy Reilly because every vested interested is represented by him, as health spokesperson for his party.</P>

Deputy Reilly constantly states, when the information is at his disposal, that we would save hundreds of millions of euro by simply introducing reference pricing.  We are introducing the legislation this year and it will save an extra &euro;7 million this year.  I have taken a couple of hundred million euro in costs out of the drugs bill and Deputy Reilly has opposed it.  He would not even stand up to the pharmacists when we were reducing costs in the way they were remunerated.  I will not take any lecture from Deputy Reilly about drugs because he opposed all of the changes we made.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>First, we do not have the money to do so.  Second, it is not the only way of dealing with the problems that arise in the emergency department.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.  In a moment, I will give data on beds.  With fewer beds there are more than 1 million more people being treated in our hospitals.  The solution is not more of the same and pouring more money into doing things the way they have always been done.  There must be change through innovation like the acute medicine programme, which I know Deputies opposite have been briefed on and which is to be introduced in some of our hospitals.  As some hospitals are not performing to the standard expected, we have brought in teams to help them.  It is being done in the UK.  The teams that were involved in the UK are here to help our hospitals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I meet monthly with senior officials from the HSE to discuss a range of child protection issues, including deaths of children in care.  Last March, I established an independent review group on child deaths, which is reviewing the deaths of children over the period of 1 January 2000 to 30 April 2010 who were in care within the meaning of the Child Care Act 1991 at the time of <Col N="584"/>death; in receipt of after care within the meaning of section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 at the time of death; or known to the child protection services within the meaning of the HIQA guidance to the HSE of 20 January 2010 at the time of death.  The review group has indicated that it expects to report to me early next month.</P>
        <P>As set out in the Ryan report implementation plan, HIQA has developed guidance for the HSE for the review of serious incidents, including deaths of children in care.  The HSE has established a panel, chaired by an independent expert, Dr. Helen Buckley of Trinity College, Dublin, to carry out such reviews.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State outline to the House when and in what way he specifically conveyed the views of the Irish public to the HSE on the matter of the totally unacceptable culture of secrecy, lack of transparency, complete absence of accountability and the scandal that has been and continues to be deaths of children while in care?  The Minister of State indicated that he established the review group but is he satisfied that the review group has received all the appropriate papers from the HSE?  Is he concerned at the reports that in spite of legislation rushed through this House because of the legislative weakness in the HSE structure, the review group only received some vital information by way of a consignment of files some weeks ago?  Those files were sought earlier in the year.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State outline to the House the number of children who have died in care during the period under review by the group?  These figures appear to be unavailable and seem to change, again giving rise to well-grounded feelings on the part of people involved that there continues to be a culture of secrecy and a total lack of transparency and accountability in the provision of these figures and such vital information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an extremely sensitive and important area; I do not use those words carelessly.  It is important because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the question because it is important.  That is a given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy might listen to the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan.  The point is this is the way in which members of the public see our child protection services.  Child protection cases are not reported in newspapers because of privacy associated with section 31 of the Child Care Act.  The only way we can see it is in this type of reporting, so it is extremely important it is done correctly.  As we saw in the tragic circumstances surrounding what is commonly known as the Roscommon case, the High Court took great care in ensuring the manner of its publication struck the right balance between the public interest, which Deputy Flanagan says he represents, and the importance balancing right of the families to their privacy and the continuing care often associated with families which must deal with the tragedy after the event.</P>
        <P>Striking the right balance is at the core of the issue.  It is easy to feed into the narrative of secrecy a lack of transparency and an attempt to conceal information when the truth is that we are striving to strike the right balance.  That is why we set up the independent review group and the group chaired by Dr. Helen Buckley.  This is so that in future there would be a very clear standard for reporting in this area and members of the public can have confidence that the HSE is not inspired by a desire to conceal information but rather to get that information into the public domain in a way that strikes the balance I have referred to and which the High Court took such great care in trying to achieve.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P>In terms of numbers, the HSE has transferred documentation and the review group hopes to have examination of these files completed, with a report by next month.  To date, 185 files have been transferred and another 11 are in the process of being handed over following a further trawl of case files.  There is a continuing process which I would not describe as a case where there is a reluctance to act.  Clearly everybody wants to comply with the law as it applies to the transfer of these very sensitive case files to allow the review group to complete its work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle will forgive me if I exhibit a sense of frustration at the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  He refused to accept my invitation to confirm to the HSE that he had conveyed the abhorrence of the public to the scandalous litany of failures in the child protection services.  I thought he might confirm at least that he conveyed the displeasure of the people but he chose not to.</P>
        <P>Having regard to his comments on the review group, there will be another opportunity to discuss the matter.  I dispute the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.  Leaving aside the review group, how many child deaths have taken place in care since March 2010 or when the review group was set up?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will clarify how I conveyed to the HSE the abhorrence spoken of by the Deputy.  I initiated the policy of meeting HSE representatives on a monthly basis to deal with child protection issues.  We have ensured that 200 additional social workers are in place to alleviate the case load that social workers had in the child protection area; we achieved that target, on which I was rightly questioned throughout the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not as simple as that.  It is a different question and the Minister of State should answer the question he was asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a new national director with specific responsibility for children and families.  My point is that the Deputy should not take my word for it but look at our record on child protection.  We hired social workers when a moratorium was in place and there was virtually no other recruitment in the public service.  That proves the commitment from the Government and me to ensuring child protection services are improved.  We have confirmed the appointment of a new national director with specific responsibility for children and families, reporting for the first time to the chief executive of the HSE.  That will centralise and mainstream child protection in the HSE for the first time.</P>
        <P>I answered a question on the figures of deaths in care since March 2010 but I do not have the figures to hand.  I will provide them to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>

        <Quest>  her plans to introduce a supplementary redress scheme for the surviving women victims, and surviving next of kin of deceased victims, of Michael Neary, in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, County Louth who were not covered by the redress scheme established and who have for long been campaigning for proper recognition. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1842/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lourdes hospital redress scheme was established following an inquiry into peripartum hysterectomy at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The inquiry was chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark.  Judge Clark was requested by the Government to advise on an appropriate scheme of redress arising from the findings of the report.  Having <Col N="586"/>received her advice, the Government approved the establishment of a non-statutory <i>ex gratia</i> scheme of redress in 2007 and appointed Judge Clark as its chairperson.</P>
        <P>The Lourdes hospital redress board has now concluded its work and all awards determined have been notified to successful applicants.  The total cost of the scheme was &euro;20.6 million.  I was asked to consider an extension of the scope of the scheme to include additional former patients of Mr. Neary outside of the terms of the scheme.  I gave due consideration to the request and consulted Judge Clark in the matter, who advised against an extension.  Acting on this advice, I decided against an extension of the scheme and this was publicly communicated in November 2008.</P>
        <P>The Government believes that the Lourdes hospital redress scheme addressed the matter in a sensitive and timely fashion.  It was always the Government&rsquo;s intention that the women who qualified for the scheme would receive adequate compensation and that has been achieved in a fair and reasonable manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been a member of an all-party Oireachtas group which, for a considerable period, has been pressing the Minister by every means open to it to acknowledge and provide compensation for the unfortunate women in question.  The group is made up of representatives of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Fine Gael Party, Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party across the entire north-east region and Dublin North.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The pain and anguish of the women concerned has been compounded by the Minister&rsquo;s persistent refusal to recognise properly their loss and suffering.  Only 35 cases are excluded under the terms of the Lourdes hospital redress scheme.  This very small cohort of tragic women includes one woman who was three days past her 40th birthday when her procedure was performed having been deferred by one week.  Why were women aged over 40 years excluded under the terms of the redress scheme?  I ask the Minister not to trundle out once more Judge Maureen Harding Clark&rsquo;s recommendations or advice because that is exactly what they were &mdash; recommendations and advice.  The Minister has the power to respond appropriately to the cases in question.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge, uniquely in my experience as a Deputy of almost 14 years, the cohesion and commitment to work together of all the Deputies and Senators who have been a constituent part of the all-party Oireachtas patient support group.  I have no doubt that the points I am putting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;also carry their imprimatur.</P>
        <P>It has been reported that the Minister, in the company of representatives of Patient Focus, indicated to some of the excluded women that they would be catered for, and the Minister has not denied that she made such a statement, including at an engagement that we had with her at one point over this long and protracted lobby.  I ask the Minister to respond positively and appeal to her to establish a supplementary Lourdes hospital redress scheme.  The number of women involved is small, as would be the size of any compensation fund.  Right and justice demand, however, that this be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s wish and those of his colleagues in the constituencies in question.  Unfortunately, however, as a Minister, I have wider responsibilities, as has the Government.  The inquiry chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clark and the report she produced were well received by the patients concerned and their representative organisation.  The judge continues to be held in very high esteem.</P><Col N="587"/>
        <P>Following the inquiry, when I recommended to the Government the establishment of an<i> ex gratia</i> compensation scheme, I believed it appropriate to ask Judge Harding Clark to determine the terms of the scheme because she had more information than anyone else and enjoyed credibility, authority and the support of the relevant organisation.  I am not seeking to pass the buck to the judge.  However, given her experience as chairperson of the inquiry and on the basis of her recommendations, I asked her what should be the parameters of the redress scheme.  She recommended that redress be given to any patient who had an unplanned obstetric hysterectomy which, in the opinion of a consultant obstetrician, was medically unwarranted and any woman who had an unplanned bilateral oophorectomy which, in the opinion of a consultant obstetrician, was medically unwarranted.</P>
        <P>When the issue arose of extending the scheme to others, I consulted Judge Harding Clark and she strongly recommended against doing so.  I recall her saying to me that when one establishes a compensation scheme of this nature, in other words, one which did not cover all of the patients of the doctor in question &mdash; the inquiry was not held into all his patients &mdash; there will always be hard cases.  She also drew my attention to several hard cases and we asked the State Claims Agency to deal with them.  I believe the agency has done this.</P>
        <P>As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in will be aware, one lady took a judicial review because she was not compensated under the redress scheme.  The case was struck out by the High Court.  I must be honest with the Deputy because I am not in a position to re-open the redress scheme or establish a supplementary scheme.  It may well be that others may wish to do so in future but I do not believe it would not be appropriate for me to recommend such a step to the Government.  Even if I did believe it appropriate to make such a recommendation, I do not believe that, in the current circumstances and given the other two groups from the region in question which also have grievances against individuals from the hospital concerned, the Government would re-open the redress scheme and extend it beyond the scope recommended by Judge Harding Clark.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in may ask a brief supplementary question.  I remind him, however, that we are over time on priority questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There are five constituencies in the area in which the 35 excluded women, at least those of them who have survived, reside.  The Minister, in her response, exposes the weakness in her position.  One cannot give to somebody who is not democratically accountable and does not have ministerial responsibility the right to make the final determination as to what is appropriate in a particular situation.  Whereas the Minister invited recommendations and advice, the ultimate responsibility in determining what is the appropriate response rests with the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Minister cited two particular groups Judge Maureen Harding Clark recommended for inclusion under the terms of the redress scheme.  The judge also recommended those who had reached the age of 40 years, a group which I specifically and deliberately referred to in my earlier contribution.  How can the Minister, as an officeholder but also &mdash; if I may &mdash; as a woman, explain the decision to reject this recommendation?  Will she explain the idea that women who had passed their 40th birthday were in some way less hurt than women who had not reached 40 years of age?  Among the 35 cases excluded from the scheme is a woman who had her procedure deferred by one week immediately before her 40th birthday and had it performed three days after her birthday.</P>
        <P>With all respect, whatever responsibilities will rest on those who will take up government after the upcoming general election, surely the Minister recognises that one of the last actions, in all justice and fairness, that she should take is to proceed as she has indicated she is not of mind to do, namely, by recommending to government, however late in the day, that a supplementary redress scheme be introduced.</P><Col N="588"/>
        <P>We welcomed the money allocated for the first scheme and correctly covered many of the cases which came under it.  I understand this money was not fully drawn down.  There is a question that the additionality in this particular instance is so small that it is not beyond either the Minister&rsquo;s gift or duty to make such a recommendation and do justice and right by the women concerned.  I conclude again with that appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accede to the Deputy&rsquo;s appeal, notwithstanding the passion with which he makes it.  When the Government decided, on foot of the report of Judge Maureen Harding Clark, to have an <i>ex gratia</i> compensation scheme &mdash; the term &ldquo;redress scheme&rdquo; is more appropriate because it is not possible to compensate those concerned with money for the traumatic impacts on their lives &mdash; we asked the judge to recommend the terms of the scheme.  We made this decision because we believed she had the expertise to make recommendations.  I accept, however, that I made the final decision in conjunction with the Government.  I am not trying to pass the buck to the judge who simply gave advice.</P>
        <P>When a plea was made to extend the terms of the initial scheme, I sought and secured Judge Harding Clark&rsquo;s advice and spent some time discussing the matter with her.  She took a strong view that the scheme should not be extended for a number of reasons.  While the Government did not have an obligation to introduce a redress scheme, on the basis that the women in question could not vindicate their rights through the courts for a number of reasons, we believed it was right to establish a redress scheme.</P>
        <P>When one opens up a redress scheme of this kind, one will always find some people are unhappy because they find the redress insufficient or the cut-off point &mdash; age in this case &mdash; is unreasonable.  We felt there were a number of hard cases outside the scheme and we asked the State Claims Agency to deal with them.  I believe the agency has dealt with them.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Not with these cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept they did not deal with the 35 cases.  One of those 35 cases is the woman who recently took the judicial review, which was denied.  I know the name of the woman but not her circumstances.  She felt the redress scheme should have dealt with her but it was denied by the courts.  For a host of reasons, I am not in a position to reopen this scheme or to establish a supplementary scheme.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>  her plans for the provision of acute emergency services at Roscommon County Hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1841/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Roscommon County Hospital provides an important range of elective and emergency services and treats cases on both an inpatient and a day case basis.  Like a number of other hospitals, Roscommon County Hospital has experienced difficulties in recruiting non-consultant hospital doctors during the normal six monthly rotation in January 2011.  This is not a staff moratorium or financial issue; smaller non-training hospitals like Roscommon County Hospital are finding it increasingly difficult to attract the number of non-consultant doctors required to maintain all services as structured at present.</P>
        <P>The HSE has assured me that, in the light of these difficulties, it will employ all possible measures to address the staffing issues, including continued recruitment efforts and the use of nursing and other supports from Merlin Park University Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, to maintain the 24-hour emergency service provided at Roscommon County Hospital.</P><Col N="589"/>
        <P>The HSE is in the process of devising a reorganisation programme for hospital services in Galway and Roscommon.  This will be informed by the HSE report on the national acute medicine programme, which was published in December.  As a first step, in 2010 a clinical director was appointed to manage Galway University Hospital, Merlin Park University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital as one integrated service, to provide additional support to the hospitals concerned and to ensure that care is delivered on a safe and sustainable basis.</P>
        <P>A reorganisation project group has been established to develop a plan for services in Roscommon and Galway.  Following consultations with key stakeholders including clinicians, senior managers and directors of nursing across the three hospitals, a reorganisation plan will be developed by the group.  A clinical lead will be identified in the coming weeks and a project manager will be appointed to co-ordinate and drive planning and implementation.  It is expected that an agreed detailed plan will be available in the course of 2011.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her response.  I ask the Minister to clarify why every other appointment to Roscommon is done on a joint basis of a hospital group of Roscommon, Galway University Hospital and Portiuncula, yet in regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, it is specific to the hospital in Roscommon.  This situation could be addressed overnight and reduce the 22% deficit of non-consultant hospital doctors to 3%.</P>
        <P>There is a specific crisis in respect of theatre nurses in Roscommon.  If two theatre nurses are appointed, we can deal with the colonoscopy backlog in Galway University Hospital.  Theatre nurses are critical health staff and their absence is jeopardising the 24-hour service.  In light of the commitment given by the Minister in respect of the 24-7 service, will she ensure non-consultant hospital doctors are appointed on the basis of a group of hospitals and will she make two theatre nurse appointments to ensure the services continue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is changing the manner in which non-consultant hospital doctors are appointed.  This week, I met with Dr. White and others on this point.  It is becoming difficult in an environment where there is a global shortage to get non-consultant hospital doctors for smaller, non-training hospitals.  The most effective way of overcoming the difficulty is to have smaller hospitals combined with larger hospitals.  This is already happening in regard to some of the midlands hospitals and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  It should also happen in regard to Galway University Hospital.  I will pursue the matter.</P>
        <P>I am aware there is a shortage of nurses in Roscommon.  I have spoken to the HSE about the quantum of nurses in the region to ensure Roscommon can function.  I do not want to see a hospital with a deficit because of a particular problem in regard to nurses.  We have a high ratio of nurses.  Every time I say this, Mr. Doran talks to me about it.  We have a high proportion of nurses in the Irish health care system, notwithstanding the moratorium and retirements.  The comparison with Canada in <i>The Irish Times</i> supplement shows we are substantially ahead of Canada in the number of nurses working in our health care system.  We have a sufficient number of nurses in the region to assign nurses to Roscommon County Hospital.  I will endeavour to ensure that happens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Deputy Denis Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her commitment on these two specific issues.  I ask the Minister to assure the House about rumours in Roscommon to the effect that the hospital will be removed from the 24-7 on-call service.  In light of the lack of an out of hours GP service, the grossly inadequate ambulance service and the fact that the HSE has publicly committed to addressing both of those issues before considering a reduction in services, can the Minister give a commitment that it will happen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand Deputy Naughten was speaking with Dr. O&rsquo;Keeffe, who manages the three hospitals, this week and he is familiar with the arrangements.  This week, I <Col N="590"/>had a meeting at HSE on this point and others, including emergency units, and I am assured that 24-7 services will continue.  I cannot guarantee it will continue forever but I can guarantee the best endeavours are being used as we speak to ensure we maintain services for the region.  The future for Roscommon County Hospital, Galway University Hospital and Portiuncula is to work together as a single hospital, albeit on three sites.  There is no doubt in my mind on this point in terms of staffing, recruitment of required expertise, the financial perspective and the perspective of patients.  Many patients from Roscommon still go to Galway and procedures could be supplied in the local hospital if the three hospitals worked as one.  There are a number of benefits when three hospitals work as one and that is the future.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 23 together.</P>
        <P>It is important that the clear focus of the health service is on the number of patients we treat and not on the number of beds.  Increasingly, our focus is on measuring and improving patient outcomes and this will continue over the coming years.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 11,800 inpatient beds and 1,800 day beds in the public hospital system.  The exact number of beds available at any one time fluctuates, depending on such factors as planned activity levels, maintenance and refurbishment requirements and staff leave arrangements.  Beds may also be closed from time to time in order to control expenditure, given the need for every hospital to operate within its allocated budget for the year.</P>
        <P>HSE data on the number of beds closed at the end of December 2010 indicates that, for the week ending 2 January 2011, some 1,378 inpatient beds and 229 day beds were closed for seasonal reasons or for infection control, refurbishment or cost containment.  However, in the week ended 9 January, the number of beds closed had fallen to 997 inpatient and 64 day beds.  The reopening of the excess of 500 beds is in line with normal practice, whereby bed capacity is reduced over Christmas and reopened when the seasonal holiday period comes to an end.   The HSE 2011 national service plan, which I approved on 22 December, sets out to achieve increased efficiency with broadly the same level of overall hospital activity as in 2010.</P>
        <P>For acute hospital services, the focus for 2011 will continue to be on increasing day case rates where appropriate and on key performance improvements in areas such as same-day admission and minimising length of stay.  Hospital activity levels have a target of a 2% reduction in inpatient activity, offset by a 3% increase in day cases.  There will be a continued and concentrated focus on reducing variations in length of stay for similar treatments.</P>
        <P>The HSE is driving efficiency in the acute hospital system by increasing the proportion of surgery undertaken on a day basis, increasing the admission of inpatients on their day of surgery <Col N="591"/>and reducing the lengths of hospital stays consistent with patients&rsquo; clinical needs.  The actions being taken by the HSE in all regions are focused on protecting front line services, particularly emergency services, maintaining the quality and safety of services and delivering to service plan targets.</P>
        <P>The HSE&rsquo;s commitment to implementing a number of national programmes, such as the acute medicine and surgical programmes, will support the achievement of these targets in 2011.  The HSE is working hard to improve emergency department services and patient experiences across the country.  The key to addressing this challenge is integrated, proactive management by all concerned based on implementation of the standards and frameworks of the acute medicine programme and related programmes.  The HSE plans to continue the implementation of these measures over the coming years.  I am confident this is the correct approach and will allow the HSE to address the impact of planned health service budget changes signalled over the next few years while maintaining the numbers of patients treated and improving patient outcomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, a record-breaking number of 569 patients were on trolleys and chairs in the accident and emergency departments of our public hospitals, and today&rsquo;s figure is 442.  I know the Minister and the HSE consistently refuse to accept the figures presented by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  As in so many other areas, the Government has its own figures, but few are buying it.  I do not propose that we have any further tussle about that.</P>
        <P>In 2006, the Minister said that the accident and emergency situation was a national crisis.  Yet the figures last week were even worse than at that time in 2006.  The Minister is entitled to her break, but she was not in the country at the time.  For example, at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which is in my own region and Deputy Morgan&rsquo;s constituency, the highest ever number of patients on trolleys was reported.  The equivalent of two full wards were waiting for admission from the emergency department.  I ask the Minister to consider that for a moment.  Was she aware that two full wards of patients were waiting for admission in the emergency department of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda?  That has been correctly described by the INMO as being extremely dangerous for both patients and staff.</P>
        <P>The INMO has called for an urgent meeting with the management of the HSE.  Does the Minister not recognise that this is the same management that had given commitments to achieve efficiencies in order to alleviate overcrowding when it went ahead with its own plans, which were described as the reconfiguration of hospital sites across the north-east region?  These had a direct impact on the accident and emergency services at my own local hospital, Monaghan General Hospital, as it was then known, and at Louth County Hospital in Dundalk.  None of the commitments or promises from the HSE management has ever come to anything in terms of making good the beds that were lost across the region or dealing with the current outrageous circumstances.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister not accept that the increase in overcrowding due to bed closures and the downgrading of hospitals across our region was correctly predicted not only by this Deputy and other voices in this Chamber, but by the INMO itself, and that the results we are seeing today are consequent upon those actions?  Let us be clear.  A total of 1,500 beds were closed before budget 2011 was introduced last month.</P>
        <P>I again ask the Minister whether she has assessed the impact of budget 2011 on the crisis across our public hospital accident and emergency departments.  That is something she did not mention in her response.  I am anxious to know whether the Minister has carried out any impact assessment of the measures proposed in budget 2011, not only in the current year but also over the period of the four year plan to which she is a party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I call the Minister, I must advise the House that we are falling into a serious problem with Question Time.  Standing Orders provide approximately one minute <Col N="592"/>for supplementary questions.  We are drifting into the making of Second Stage speeches during Question Time, and this limits the number of questions that can be dealt with during the period.  It is contributing to poor order in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a number of questions.  We must become less focused on beds and more focused on activity.  I say this for a number of reasons.  If we compare the figures for 2010 to those for 2005, we will see that we are now treating an extra 100,000 patients in emergency departments, an extra million outpatients, an extra 250,000 day cases and an extra 20,000 inpatients.  That is in addition to 16,000 extra births.  This all represents additional activity with fewer beds than we had then.</P>
        <P>The focus of the reform programme is on seeking to get more from less.  In particular, hospitals are trying to deal with more day-case activity and same-day admissions for surgery.  We have a list of 24 procedures which should be dealt with as day cases: same-day surgery with the patient going home the same evening.  The list is based on the basket of 25 day-case procedures used in the UK, but because we do not have abortion in Ireland, the list contains only 24 procedures.  The HSE is making great strides in this regard, although there is major variation across the country.  If every hospital operated to the standard of the best in the country, there would be enormous improvements.</P>
        <P>Let us take as an example St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin, the largest hospital in the country, or St. Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny.  Even last week, when there were major challenges, they were able to cope successfully.  While I am not saying that all of the issues are the result of the internal functioning of hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, I feel there is major room for improvement.  The task of the teams that have now been appointed for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital &mdash; the next will be Tallaght hospital &mdash; is to work with the hospitals in this regard.  In the UK, a person with a lot of management experience was brought in, accompanied by a television camera.  If one brings in a television camera one can achieve many changes.</P>
        <P>Everybody, including nurses, must think about how he or she works.  In particular, I want escalation protocols to be put into effect, as they have been all over the world.  These protocols are highly successful.  Advice from emergency consultants, as well as other medical advice available to me, strongly supports it.  The Chief Medical Officer has provided evidence to the Joint Committee on Health and Children to show the effectiveness of these protocols when patients are moved from emergency departments up to the wards.  Some 25% of patients are admitted within one hour and there is a major improvement over a four-hour period.  These are the types of change I expect to see from nurses and others working in the system through the Croke Park agreement so that the stock of beds can be used as effectively as possible.</P>
        <P>There will be major challenges this year; I am not going to pretend there will not.  We have effectively taken &euro;1 billion out of the public health Vote for 2011 compared to 2010.  That is an enormous amount of money.  Even with the major work practice changes we will achieve through the Croke Park agreement, there will still be enormous challenges.  The commitment is to provide a similar level of service in 2011 to that provided in 2010 in terms of activity, although there will be some changes.</P>
        <P>I mentioned swine flu earlier.  I am not going to pretend this is the reason for the problem in accident and emergency departments, but it is having an impact.  We now have two confirmed deaths, unfortunately, and the flu has consumed 72 intensive care beds and 393 hospital beds.  It is not the reason for the crisis, but the incidence here is doubling every week.  It has doubled this week compared to last week and it doubled last week over the previous week.  I am sad to report that there have been two confirmed deaths in the Republic over the last week as a result of swine flu.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="593"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with the Minister in stating that it is sad to note that anyone has fallen victim to swine flu.  We convey our sympathies to the families concerned.</P>
        <P>When the Minister makes the point about more from less, will she not acknowledge that all we are seeing is more anguish, more stress for patients and front line service providers in our accident and emergency departments, and more people unnecessarily on trolleys and chairs over a long period?  There can be no doubt that we are looking at a much disimproved situation from what the Minister previously described as being a national crisis only a few years ago.  It is worse today.  The Minister cannot defend that.</P>
        <P>Given the suggested &euro;1 billion cuts in the current year, has an impact assessment specific to accident and emergency departments been carried out concerning our public hospital sites?  Has the projected &euro;1.5 billion in cuts over the period of the four year plan been worked through in each of the subsequent years?  Will the Minister indicate that her Department is conscious of what is happening and what is likely to continue to happen over the lifetime of this plan, if it is adhered to?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was agreeing the service plan in the context of the budget and the financial position for this year.  Every effort was made to minimise any impact on services to patients and to maximise the cuts in the procurement of legal services, telecommunications and all services procured by the HSE, including fees on the drugs bill.  A huge proportion of the cutbacks will come from that source in addition to the redundancy package, which will bring savings of between &euro;50 million and &euro;70 million because the take-up was not as anticipated.  Every effort was made concerning all the services procured by the HSE, which is the biggest procurer in the country.  All of those companies were spoken to with a view to reducing substantially the cost of providing those services to the public health system so that we can maintain services to patients.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to say that things are getting worse.  By every yardstick &mdash; whether it is infection control, life expectancy, infant mortality, cancer treatment, the performance of hospitals in terms of their volume of activity &mdash; there has been huge progress.  It may surprise the House to know that we get a high volume of correspondence and if any of the Deputies opposite succeed me, I will leave the file for them to see.  That correspondence is from patients and their families saying how wonderful the service is and how much it has improved from their previous experience.  I know there are people who work in the health service who love to run it down.  The health service is quite unique in that respect, but I get fantastic feedback from the vast majority of those who work in it &mdash; whether they are consultants, junior hospital doctors or nurses &mdash; about the improvements taking place.</P>
        <P>Sometimes, as changes happen, it is not as evident to those of us who are not in daily contact with that work.  That is not to say that people are not working under enormous pressure, that there are not huge challenges, deficits and difficulties &mdash; of course there are.  It would be a sad reflection on all of us, however, given the huge investment of public resources that has gone into the public health service, and the commitment to change that has occurred in recent years, if we were not seeing substantial improvements, year in and year out, across virtually all headings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sad reflection that the health service has not improved.  That is the problem, given all the money that has gone in and all the waste that is there.  The Minister referred to me accusing her of misleading the D&aacute;il.  I will cite one instance that springs to mind immediately.  She said the cancer czar, Professor Tom Keane, had met the Irish College of General Practitioners and agreed new protocols for GP referral when no such meeting had taken place.  All that took place was a lunch, but the Minister failed to correct the record no matter how many times she was reminded of it.  That is just one example.</P><Col N="594"/>
        <P>On what I have said, other doctors are saying it publicly.  I am careful in what I say and I do not believe in scare-mongering, but I have already given the Minister two instances.  I join Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in in conveying my sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives to swine flu.</P>
        <P>The big issue here &mdash; the Minister was asked about this in the previous question, but she did not answer it &mdash; is the lack of isolation facilities within the accident and emergency departments.  They are so overcrowded that people are sitting on top of each other because trolleys are not available.  I have already outlined the situation and I do not wish to reiterate it.  We are still talking about plans for tomorrow instead of action today, which bothers me.  The Minister has still not told us why she will not tender out to nursing homes for rehabilitation.  There are 2,000 such beds so surely some nursing homes could be asked to tender 30 or 40 beds for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy.  That would take the pressure off the 500 people who are lying in hospital but do not need to be there at the moment.  Those beds could thus be freed up.</P>
        <P>Why is not every hospital operating to the best standards?  The Minister has had six years in office.  If she knows what best practice is, why has she not been able to standardise it?  What in the name of God was the HSE for, except to bring uniformity of care to 4.2 million people?  It has utterly failed as a project, like so much else that the Minister has put in place, including her non-existent co-located hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards co-location, it is interesting that this week some Fine Gael Deputies were still lobbying me on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>We were told about fast-track beds six years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has an interesting perspective.  Some days he accuses me of taking the privatisation route in long-term care, while he then asks why I do not tender out to private nursing homes.  The Deputy cannot have it every way.  He opposes things but then proposes them as a solution to a problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not have to build private hospitals on public grounds.  That is the point the Minister missed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>He just prefers them to be down the road so that doctors can spend their time in their cars going from A to B.</P>
        <P>I must again correct the Deputy concerning Professor Tom Keane.  I gave accurate information to the House, that Professor Keane had a meeting.  I did not know the nature of the meeting, whether it was over lunch or coffee.  He had a meeting with the Irish College of General Practitioners.  That is a fact.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>For the Deputy to suggest that there have been no improvements in the public health system is bizarre.  I cited infection control and cancer outcomes.  Does the Deputy deny that the reorganisation of cancer services has been enormously beneficial for patients with better treatment and faster access to highly skilled expertise?  Would he deny that life expectancy, which is a measurement of the public health system, is increasing faster in Ireland than in any other country?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>When vaccination is stripped out, only about 20% of life expectancy is due to health risks.  That is a fact and the Minister knows it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is time for the Deputy to bring some honesty into this debate and stop the hypocrisy.  He goes on about reference pricing, but as a practising doctor did he do a lot of generic prescribing?  I would love to see his record on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>That question has nothing to do with this debate, but the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to see the record of that.  I would be very happy to acknowledge that if it is the case.  The answer to having cheaper medicine is to get more non-branded drugs prescribed.</P>

	<P>Answer the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  We will not outsource services like that to nursing homes.  Nursing homes already have contract arrangements to provide long-term care.  We have 30,000 long-term care beds in the country, some 21,000 of which are in the private nursing home sector, while 9,000 are in the public nursing home sector.  The fair deal is working successfully.  We do not anticipate outsourcing more activity of the kind the Deputy suggests.  We want to ensure that our public hospitals work as effectively and efficiently as possible and that those who work in our hospitals provide services that are performed to best practice from a staffing, industrial relations and operational point of view.  That is what the Croke Park agreement is all about.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>So the 500 patients will stay in hospital even though they do not need to be there.  Is that what the Minister is saying?  That is very sad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>

	<P>When I saw that three of the first four ordinary questions had gone in the lottery to my colleagues, Deputies Reilly and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I was going to suggest that, considering their good luck, they should do the lotto this evening.  However, seeing that Question Time is almost over, it is not of any great advantage to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in expressing sympathy with the families of the two people who have died as a result of swine flu.  Can the Minister provide any further information in this regard?  I do not know how much of it is a matter of public record.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to a special team that will go into some hospitals to deal with overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  She mentioned Drogheda, Beaumont, Limerick and Tallaght hospitals.  Will she outline the terms of reference of this team, what exactly it will be doing in the hospitals, when its work will commence, whether there is a prioritisation in terms of the order in which the various hospitals are inspected, whether the same team will operate in all the hospitals and how broad is the team&rsquo;s remit?</P>
        <P>One innovation that has improved the situation in terms of transferring patients into hospital beds and out of clogged accident and emergency departments is where general practitioners have greater access to clinical decision makers.  That works well in certain hospitals, including in Limerick where there is an effective unit.  A similar system is also in operation in Kilkenny.  Having said that, problems persist in Limerick and they are largely a question of patient volumes and lack of capacity.  To what extent is work being done to ensure better relationships between general practitioners and acute hospitals in order to alleviate the situation in accident and emergency units and, for example, facilitate access to diagnostics, which was one of the issued raised by the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister tells us she will not reopen closed hospital wards or bring acute beds back into service because there is not enough money to do so.  Does she regard additional beds as essential in view of the numbers &mdash; 569 nationwide the other morning <Col N="597"/>&mdash; on trolleys, with 50 alone in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda?  If not, why not?  Does she regard herself as having a duty of care to patients in accident and emergency units?  I heard a graphic account on local radio the other day of people with blood running out of them sitting in the accident and emergency department waiting for treatment.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister see herself as having a responsibility to manage with some degree of comprehension the system for which she has ministerial responsibility?  Does she accept that money can be found for banks because we are told it is essential?  This is brought up in the context of almost every issue but what could be more important than caring for people in acute situations who are having to wait 13, 14 or 15 hours on plastic chairs?  Does the Minister accept that her attitude in this regard is nothing short of Thatcherite, that she is simply walking over these patients and that it is completely unacceptable?  Does she see herself as having responsibility in this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must allow the Minister to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want a more realistic response from the Minister than the ones she has given to the House thus far.  The situation in accident and emergency wards is a scandal and it is disgraceful that the Minister is getting away with it.  She can do what she wants because there is no accountability whatsoever in this bloody Government.  It is long past time that she and her colleagues were thrown the hell out of office and somebody put in who can look after these patients&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy seems to have a two-island approach to many issues, not just in the area of health.  He has a different approach to policy across the Border.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely not.  We are not the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s question, there are genuine capacity issues in Limerick and that is why we have sanctioned the new extension which will be operational at the start of 2012.  That is needed not only for Limerick itself, but as part of <Col N="598"/>broader reform in the mid-west region.  Limerick has some of the most dynamic doctors in the country in the accident and emergency unit and other departments.</P>
        <P>In regard to the teams that are going into hospitals, the view was that assistance needed to be given to some hospitals in respect of their operational issues, particularly in regard to accident and emergency services, but also in terms of their broader remit.  The teams have already commenced work in Beaumont and Drogheda and, as far as I am aware, Limerick.  I will provide the Deputy with the terms of reference; they are not rigid but rather involve the input of people with expertise and experience from this country and abroad who have undertaken this type of task before.  It is not a big stick approach but rather a case of sitting down with the key stakeholders who run the hospitals to see how they can be operated differently with a view to improvements.  Six hospitals have been identified, of which work has already commenced in three, with the next being Tallaght.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not answer my question about acute beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are providing more capacity in Limerick.  In general, however, the problems being identified in accident and emergency departments in some hospitals have to do &mdash; not exclusively, but in the main &mdash; with how those particular hospitals function.  Our effort is focused on ensuring they function to the appropriate standard that is required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will action be taken in all hospitals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, many hospitals do not have an issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I attended Dromclough national school in Listowel and have retained a strong interest in its fortunes ever since.  The number of enrolments continues to increase because it is an excellent school with an excellent principal and staff.  In April 2002, on the advice of an inspector, the school board of management made an application for an extension.  In January 2003, an application was made for a major refurbishment and extension.  In January 2006, a letter was received from the Department of Education and Skills indicating that construction of eight classrooms was approved and that a technical team would visit the school shortly.  Five years later no such visit has taken place to advance the project to the next stage.</P>
        <P>On 6 December 2007, I raised the same issue on the Adjournment.  On that occasion, after outlining all the investment that has been made in the provision of school buildings throughout the State, the then Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, noted that Dromclough is a co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 194 pupils.  That number has now increased to 200, from a figure of 164 in 2001.  The school has a current staffing of a principal, seven mainstream assistants and three learning and support resource teachers.  I made the point that the school had to convert a toilet into an office to accommodate the teachers.  I am very familiar with the size of the classrooms and staffroom.  The parents, children and staff really coped with the circumstances but those circumstances are very unfair.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The school has submitted an application to the Department for an extension and the long-term staffing figure on which accommodation needs will be based has been determined and notified to the school authority.  It has been agreed that appropriate accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of principal, eight mainstream assistants and [...] appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">The next step is to carry out a technical investigation of the existing building and site to determine their suitability.  When this inspection has been completed the project will be progressed in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This has simply not happened.</P>
        <P>Recently a serious issue arose because wheelchair access to the school could not be provided.  The school must be one of the few in the country that has no wheelchair access.  The school is a polling booth at election time and this will present access difficulties at the next general election, which will be quite soon.  There were serious water leaks at the school recently and there was a problem with the power supply.  Other problems arose also.</P>
        <P>Some time ago the INTO submitted to the Department a list of some 150 schools in a very bad state of repair.  Over time, it has discussed these schools and has tried to advance their cases.  Some 120 schools have been taken off the list and there are just 30 left.  The staff of Dromclough national school are asking what the building section of the Department of Education and Skills has against the school, including its 200 pupils, eight staff and ancillary staff.  It is very hard to understand its reasoning.  I would deeply appreciate it if the Minister for Health and Children would, in the dying days of this Government, shed some light on the procrastination over the school.  I know she would respond positively to my request if the matter were totally in her hands.  The circumstances of the school seem to be totally unfair. <Col N="600"/> Schools that were below Dromclough national school on the list have been built but the Dromclough project has not been progressed.  Perhaps we will receive an answer this evening.</P>

I thank Deputy Deenihan for his very kind remarks.  Perhaps he will pass them on to Deputy Reilly, with whom I have just had a robust debate.  The latter does not share Deputy Deenihan&rsquo;s perspective.</P>

	<P>That is true.  Absolutely.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, in addition to meeting the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Skills assesses all applications for capital funding.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting, based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity, leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.</P>
        <P>The staff of Dromclough national school comprises a principal, seven mainstream assistants and four permanent learning support or resource teachers.  The school&rsquo;s enrolment at 30 September 2009 was 203 pupils, which represents an increase of 1% over the previous five years.</P>
        <P>The forward planning section of the Department of Education and Skills has identified 43 priority areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary levels in the medium term.  The indication from the forward planning section is that the Listowel area is not one where there is likely to be significant growth in demand for additional classroom accommodation in the short term.</P>
        <P>The school authorities in question submitted an application for large-scale capital funding for an extension and refurbishment project.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects and assigned a band 2 rating.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and band 4 is the lowest.  Band 2 comprises the second highest priority.  Documents explaining the band rating system are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>It has been agreed with the school that the long-term projected staffing will constitute a principal plus eight mainstream class assistants.  The next steps for the progression of the school&rsquo;s major project include a technical visit.  However, to date, it has not been possible to arrange such a visit in light of the demands on the resources of the Department.</P>
        <P>In 2008, two additional prefabs were relocated to the school to alleviate its immediate accommodation difficulties.  The school also received an ICT grant for the prefab being used as a mainstream classroom.  In October 2010, the school was included in a list of schools that were approved a grant for water conservation measures.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design through to construction, will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual <Col N="601"/>schools building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

      <sTitle>State Asset Privatisation</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I asked for a debate on this matter is because of the real threat that exists at present to State companies.  We are still awaiting the report of the McCarthy group on State assets.  However, judging from the tenor of an bord snip nua&rsquo;s report, it is highly likely that the McCarthy group will recommend the selling of State companies across a range of areas.  I am very concerned about the influence of various Departments on the report.</P>
        <P>The McCarthy group was established in July before the IMF and European Union intervened here, yet it and the intervention are linked.  Every state in which the IMF has intervened has been forced to carry out a fire sale of state assets.  In reply to one of my questions yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated the IMF was briefed on the work of the McCarthy group.  It clearly has an interest in the matter.  The Minister also informed me that a review of State companies &mdash; he referred specifically to electricity and gas &mdash; would be conducted as part of the IMF-EU programme.  He further added that &ldquo;the Government will consult with the Commission on the results of this assessment with a view to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of state-owned assets&rdquo;.  In another reply, the Minister stated: &ldquo;it would be negligent not to examine all reasonable ways in the public interest to reduce the State&rsquo;s indebtedness, including through the sale of certain State assets.&rdquo;  Privatisation is clearly part of the agenda along with an austerity programme involving cuts.</P>
        <P>In my opinion and that of many who have examined the experience of other countries who have come under the effective control of the IMF, such a sell-off would be a disaster.  An example of such a disaster is evident in what occurred after the sugar industry was privatised.  Hundreds of jobs were destroyed to facilitate property speculation by the new owner, Greencore.  If the same occurs in respect of An Post, Bord G&aacute;is, Coillte or the ESB, we can multiply that devastation many times over.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We know from the experience of countries such as Russia that a sell-off of state assets does not lead to some wonderful free market.  What happened in Russia was that those with access to power were able to use their political influence to take over the former state companies, including Russia&rsquo;s oil, gas and mineral companies.  In Ireland there are people with such ties who have already positioned themselves for a sell-off.  For example, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is the chairman of a company that has expressed an interest in buying the forestry lands under Coillte&rsquo;s control.  This amounts to 7% of the Irish landmass.  Professor Colm McCarthy&rsquo;s an bord snip nua report recommended that the privatisation of Coillte be considered.  If he recommends such a sale again and the Government of the time follows it, some people are well poised to move on it.</P>

        <P>A reply to a question I asked about the an bord snip nua recommendations on Coillte was interesting, in that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food stated that, as a shareholder, he agreed with Coillte being subject to the current review of State assets.  On the basis of the previous McCarthy report, we can expect a recommendation on the sale of Coillte&rsquo;s assets.  We can see where this is heading.  A part of the State&rsquo;s elite destroyed the economy.  The political elite brought in the International Monetary Fund.  A combination of the two are now preparing to cash in on the mess by selling off and buying up State assets.  It is a matter of real concern about which people need to be aware.</P>
        <P>People also need to be aware that parties which agreed to administer the IMF-EU bailout will have no choice but to go along with that agenda, a central part of which is privatisation.  People need to know the Government&rsquo;s intention and the roadmap it is setting out for the next <Col N="602"/>Government.  Are we pursuing a line of privatising State assets and selling them to speculators and others who intend to capitalise on the sweat and blood of those who created those State&rsquo;s assets?  Will the situation resemble that of the sugar beet industry, whereby Greencore and many shareholders, such as Mr. Liam Carroll, were able to make a killing from the sweat and blood of generations of people, particularly in rural Ireland?  This should be a concern for anyone with a moral conscience about the country&rsquo;s future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has raised an issue arising from the memorandum of understanding on the financial assistance programme for Ireland recently agreed between the Government and the IMF and the EU Commission in liaison with the ECB.  The memorandum provides <i>inter alia</i> that, building on the report of the McCarthy group on State assets, an independent assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas sectors will be carried out before the end of 2011 with a view to enhancing their efficiency.  The Government will then consult with the Commission on the results of this assessment with a view to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of State-owned assets.</P>
        <P>The House has had a number of opportunities to discuss the provisions of the financial assistance programme during the month of December and was twice provided with the documents outlining the terms of the programme during that month.  The first time was on 1 December when the memorandum was provided in the context of a lengthy discussion about the national recovery plan and the financial assistance programme.  On 14 December a document, entitled &ldquo;EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland&rdquo;, was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This document incorporated the memorandum on economic and fiscal policy, the memorandum of understanding on specific economic policy conditionality and the technical memorandum of understanding.  It was provided in the context of a D&aacute;il motion on 15 December which approved the terms of the programme.</P>
        <P>The terms of the memorandum of understanding do not represent a commitment to privatise State assets.  They are an agreement on the Government&rsquo;s behalf to examine the policy issues involved and to discuss them with the Commission.  Given the current financial condition of the State, it would be negligent not to examine all reasonable ways in the public interest to reduce the State&rsquo;s indebtedness, including through the sale of certain assets.  It is not sustainable for the State to continue borrowing at current levels and efforts to return the deficit to more manageable levels and put the public finances on a more sustainable footing must continue during the coming years.  Given the scale of the adjustment required, all avenues for reducing expenditure and raising additional revenues must be explored.</P>
        <P>It was in this context that the Minister for Finance established the review group on State assets and liabilities in July 2010 to advise him on how these assets can be better deployed or disposed of to support growth and contribute to national investment priorities.  The group is chaired by Professor Colm McCarthy.  The other members are Mr. Donal McNally, Second Secretary at the Department of Finance, and Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College, Dublin.  The Government gave the group the following terms of reference: to consider the potential for asset disposals in the public sector, including commercial State bodies, in view of the indebtedness of the State; to draw up a list of possible asset disposals; to assess how the use and disposition of such assets can best help restore growth and contribute to national investment priorities; and to review where appropriate relevant investment and financing plans, commercial practices and regulatory requirements affecting the use of such assets in the national interest.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s attention has been focused primarily on the commercial State bodies, but it has also examined the intangible assets under State control to determine whether they are efficiently allocated and priced at an economic rate.  All commercial State bodies and Depart<Col N="603"/>ments were invited to make formal submissions to the group and the group advertised generally for submissions from interested parties.  More than 45 submissions were received.  Since September, the review group has engaged with almost all commercial State bodies.  It is finalising its report, which the Minister for Finance will receive in due course.</P>
        <P>The Government acknowledges the important role that State agencies have played in the economic development of this country through the provision of key infrastructure such as energy and transport and the commercialisation of agriculture and resource-based industries.  The overwhelming public need is to restore the fiscal balance and economic growth as quickly as possible.  In the current economic and fiscal environment, it is therefore crucial to review the contribution that the State agencies might make in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue for south County Tipperary on the Adjournment.  I am glad that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is present.</P>
        <P>I am deeply concerned about the HSE&rsquo;s plans for the Cluain Arann welfare home in Tipperary town.  This home caters for 19 individuals who the HSE is planning to relocate without appropriate consultation with residents, their families or the wider community, which has supported and facilitated the delivery of services in Cluain Arann and made it an appropriate setting.  &ldquo;Welfare home&rdquo; is probably the wrong name for it.  It is a caring, friendly and warm centre.  I have often met its residents around the town and in neighbouring villages.  One resident who I met in Donohill but whose name eludes me came to play us a few tunes on an accordion on Dan Breen Sunday.  The centre&rsquo;s residents are mainly in reasonable health, but are uneasy about staying at home because of a lack of facilities.  They have been residents at Cluain Arann for a number of years.</P>
        <P>There is no local area manager for Tipperary town.  As a result of the recent redundancy scheme, some local managers have left.  I pay tribute to two recent managers, Mr. Seamus Moore and Mr. Chris Monahan, both of whom I have interacted with and who were in negotiations with the HSE before leaving.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, to ensure a manager is appointed.  I have failed to make contact with Ms Breda Kavanagh.  I have spoken with Mr. Monahan, but there is no clarity.  All of this is causing the residents unease.  I understand staff were consulted and told there would be no staff lay-offs, so I wonder what will happen to them.</P>
        <P>If a model is not broken, why try to fix it?  Cluain Arann is a wonderful facility adjacent to another HSE facility.  Residents are happy to live out their lives in its environment.  They are privileged to be residents of the home and finding somewhere even remotely like it to relocate them will be difficult.  They have made friends, so their relocation will be difficult on them.</P>
        <P>The HSE is conveniently using the quality guidelines of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, as an excuse to close the facility, but where were those guidelines when we were being told last week of 500 patients on trolleys throughout the country?  Where are they when there is bedlam in accident and emergency units at night?  Hiding behind HIQA when it suits the HSE is farcical.</P><Col N="604"/>
        <P>The Cluain Arann facility should be used as a role model for other communities.  The old adage is appropriate, namely, where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows.  I am glad the Minister is present.</P>
        <P>As with the working time directive in respect of doctors, we have quoted HIQA&rsquo;s guidelines.  It is what we always hear when somewhere is to be closed.  I do not accept this jargon and do not accept that we must obey these guidelines.  They are used very conveniently.  I met HIQA as one of a number of backbenchers and asked the same questions but the HIQA representatives shrugged me off; they were not interested.</P>
        <P>How unsafe is it for patients to be on trolleys?  There are hundreds of them around the country.  Those involved are, however, well cared for and able to look after themselves to a great extent; they do not need specialised care.  There is no staff shortage but the staff have been told they will be redeployed but we do not know where.  I hope it is not like Cashel Hospital, which closed years ago, yet some of the staff are still there.</P>
        <P>This is unnecessary.  This welfare home should be a model and I ask the Minister to tell us who is in charge in that region of the HSE.  The Minister of State now accepts there was no consultation in St. Michael&rsquo;s Hospital last year, despite what we were told by the HSE officials.  There was consultation in this instance &mdash; to be fair the manager told me that &mdash; but we should be copying this model to put in place low cost facilities around the country.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Cluain Arann Welfare Home provides residential services to people over 65, with a range of dependency needs.  Many of these residents are capable of living independently and require minimal assistance in a home-from-home environment.  The management of Cluain Arann Welfare Home consists of a director of nursing and here are 7.5 full-time posts, with all staff reporting to the director, providing 16 hours nursing care per week.</P>
        <P>It is located in Tipperary town, on the same site as Cluain Arann community nursing unit, which shares some facilities and is integrated into the same building.  While both units are managed independently, they share the entrance and reception area, a large kitchen, dining room, sitting room, physiotherapy department, sluice room, cleaning room, laundry, records room and staff facilities.</P>
        <P>The welfare home has 35 residential beds, 19 of which are currently occupied.  These are configured into 20 single bedrooms with wash-hand basins and five three-bedded rooms with shared wash-hand basins and toilet facilities.  There are three bathrooms, two with showers, and one with a bath.  In addition there are four separate toilet facilities for residents&rsquo; use.  Each room has adequate storage space with a lockable wardrobe available in all bedrooms.  The goal is to maintain an independent style of living with appropriate supports provided.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the care and welfare regulations for designated centres for older people currently require 24 hour nursing care.  The home had been inspected in September 2010 by the Health Information and Quality Authority and one of the issues highlighted was the lack of 24 hour nursing care.  In this context the HSE felt that it was necessary to close the home and provide the residents with alternative appropriate residential care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department has recently commenced a review of the care and welfare regulations and one of the issues being considered is the level of nursing care that would be appropriate in designated centres.  In anticipation of the outcome of this review, the HSE is reconsidering the options that may become available.  The HSE will engage with HIQA to see what arrangements can be put place to enable the home to meet the regulatory requirements and remain open.</P>
        <P>Convalescent, respite, and palliative care will continue to be provided at Cluain Arann.  There is a ten bed unit on the same site which, as I stated earlier, currently shares many facilities with <Col N="605"/>the welfare home.  I acknowledge this may have caused anxiety for residents and their families but at all times the HSE was acting to provide the most appropriate care possible for the residents.</P>

      <sTitle>Regional Airports</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision to eliminate the public service obligation subsidies for all regional airports in the west is both wrong and illogical.  The Minister has announced that he will close the regional airports on the north-western, western and southern coasts apart from Kerry and Donegal.  His argument for retaining Donegal is the county&rsquo;s isolation and lack of interurban roads.  Sligo and Knock are in the same position in that there is no direct road link to Dublin.  It is amazing the Minister should retain Donegal when he knows there is another airport in the north-west, in Derry, because he used it to travel to the Glenties to attend the Magill summer school.  The entire province of Connacht, however, will now be deprived of any Government subsidy for regional airports.</P>
        <P>It is outrageous the Minister should be making an announcement of this nature.  There were indications in the budget that the PSO would be reduced but the total elimination is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not consult other relevant Departments, such as the Department of Finance or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, to see what could be done in terms of connectivity for the isolated periphery of the country.  We know these regions are economically dependent on airport accessibility and that foreign direct investment depends upon them.  Multinational businesspeople need global transport structures to go about their business.  Industries were attracted to peripheral areas because the IDA could promise accessibility that is now being done away with.  The only part of the economy doing well at present, the export-led multinational sector, is having the rug pulled from under it.  Personnel will not have the necessary connectivity.  It is outrageous.</P>
        <P>There is not much good land in the west of Ireland but the landscape is very attractive.  The tourism industry is highly dependent on airport access, with regional airports in Sligo and in Knock, a place where we never thought an airport would survive.  Effectively, Knock is now in a serious position and will find it difficult to operate on a commercial basis.  The Minister stated in the document that it is not commercially viable.  It could easily close.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport is not operating unilaterally.  This is not merely a transport matter, but a matter of the economy, tourism, foreign direct investment and accessibility.  He should link up with the other relevant Departments and put together a task force to deal with the threat to the regional airports, ensuring the service that is so urgently needed continues to be provided in those areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</P>
        <P>Having fully considered the conclusions and recommendations of the value for money review of Exchequer expenditure on regional airports, the Government has agreed to support the continuation of a public service obligation, PSO, route between Donegal and Dublin and between Kerry and Dublin.  The necessary approval to continue these PSO air services will be sought from the European Commission.  Once approved, specifications for the services will be settled and arrangements will be put in place for a tender competition in respect of these two routes.</P>
        <P>In line with the review, the Government has also agreed to cease requiring PSO routes between Dublin and Sligo, Knock, Galway and Derry, from July 2011, recognising, <i>inter alia</i>, <Col N="606"/>the improvements in alternative transport modes by rail and road which have taken place particularly with Government investment under Transport 21 in recent years.</P>
        <P>The VFM review is part of the Government&rsquo;s value for money and policy review initiative introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure.  The review initiative evaluates past Exchequer expenditure against the regional airport programme objectives and examines the scope for achieving those objectives more efficiently and effectively in the future.  The review was published yesterday and is available for download on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Under updated EU legislation governing the PSO air services, more stringent conditions will apply in the future, having regard for example, to the availability of other transport connections and especially rail services with a travelling time of three hours or less.  The change in EU legislation, the substantial investment in surface transport, the completion of the review and the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources, were all taken into consideration by Government in making this decision and it is not the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s intention to reverse that decision.</P>
        <P>It must be borne in mind that there are many demands on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Vote and trying to maintain a level of expenditure on the regional airports programme which is no longer justified or sustainable would impact negatively on other areas such as public transport provision and-or road maintenance.  Overall, the Minister for Transport believes the combination of an improved surface transport network together with a more consolidated air service network to regional airports, along with the State airports at Cork, Shannon and Dublin, provides the necessary transport access to underpin Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable development.</P>
        <P>Where a PSO route is being terminated from mid-July 2011, the route will be open to commercial air services from that date. In addition to the PSO scheme, there are two other schemes which provide Exchequer support to the regional airports, an OPEX scheme which provides money to airports to cover all or part of their operational losses in any given year and a CAPEX scheme which provides finance towards the cost of necessary infrastructure at our regional airports.  The Minister for Transport is giving further consideration to these schemes and will revert to Government shortly with proposals.</P>
        <P>If I might just add a couple of comments of my own, at some time in the past 20 years I have used every single regional airport, some of them several times.  They are an asset to the country but they were constructed at a time when the road services in particular and the frequency of rail services were very different from what they are now.  At least one regional airport, the south-east Waterford airport, was never in receipt of a PSO.  I gather it has had discussions with the Department of Transport and it is satisfied with the outcome.  I hope all the regional airports mentioned will continue to provide services but under other conditions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 24, 113 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>I am very disappointed at the decision of the VHI to increase its prices so significantly from 1 February.  There is no doubt that the increases will make it harder for those who benefit most from health insurance to renew their policies.</P><Col N="608"/>
        <P>I want to ensure that everyone is aware of the various alternative health insurance policies on offer.</P>
        <P>It is important to stress that customers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value, including better cover or to reduce their premium costs. It is not open to a company to refuse a customer of another insurer the same level of cover. The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provide advice on switching by telephone or via the internet and I would urge any consumers with concerns to contact the HIA.</P>
        <P>I have asked the HIA to monitor the situation closely to ensure that all customers are given accurate information about their right to switch policies, without penalty.  In particular, I am anxious to make sure that customers are not misled by any insurer about the ease with which changes can be made, or about the requirements that must be met before switching.  The HIA will play an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information, and in monitoring the implementation of the law protecting consumers in relation to health insurance.</P>
        <P>I am committed to protecting our community-rated market through risk equalisation.  </P>
        <P>If there is more than one insurer in the market, as is the case in this country, community rating needs to be supported by a scheme that subsidises the cost of health care for older and sicker people across the entire market.  Otherwise, companies would have a clear incentive to attract and retain only healthy customers who were less likely to make claims. This support system is called risk equalisation.   A system of risk equalisation is particularly necessary in the Irish market because, for historical reasons, the VHI has a greatly disproportionate share of older customers, as is evident from the fact that is has 80% by value of all claims in the market but only 62% of all customers.</P>
        <P>The Government had a risk equalisation scheme in place but following a challenge by BUPA, the scheme was struck down by the Supreme Court in July 2008.  In response the Government introduced a temporary scheme of tax relief/community rating levy in January 2009 which provides a very significant degree of support for the cost of health insurance claims by older people.</P>
        <P>It allows insurers with additional costs arising from insuring older people,  to be compensated for up to, but no more than, 65% of these additional costs. This was increased from a figure of 50% in 2009 and 2010 following advice from the Health Insurance Authority.  The Government is also preparing to put in place a risk equalisation scheme that will &lsquo;equalise&rsquo; risk as far as is possible on age, health status and gender grounds. The scheme is designed to be legally robust and to be fully in accordance with European and Irish law requirements. The Health Insurance Authority has completed its consultation process on risk equalisation and submitted its analysis and recommendations to me on 23rd December 2010. My Department is currently considering this report and I intend to prepare legislation for a transitional scheme which will come into effect in 2012 and a risk equalisation scheme to come into effect at the start of 2013.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Authority have estimated that the net benefit of the tax credits/levy to VHI in 2011 will be in the region of &euro;70M and the corresponding net cost to Aviva and Quinn will be in the region of &euro;33M and &euro;37M respectively.</P>
        <P>The VHI continues to be exempt from prudential solvency requirements arising from a derogation under the 3rd Non-Life Directive.  The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2008 provided for the VHI to acquire sufficient funding in terms of its capital reserves to enable it to make an application to the Financial Regulator for authorisation.  The date originally fixed by that Act was 31 December 2008.  At the time the original date was fixed, the <Col N="609"/>Supreme Court had not yet ruled in relation to the risk equalisation scheme. Since then I have extended the date by which the VHI must accrue the necessary reserves on five occasions.  The date is now 1 January 2012.   The Government strategy also provides for disposal of the VHI and I expect advisers to assist in that regard to be appointed next month.  It remains my firm conviction that the VHI should be properly authorised and that the derogation should be lifted.  The Government is committed to making a substantial capital investment into the VHI to secure its authorisation.  The actual amount of capital required will be determined between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children in light of expert advice received.</P>
        <P>Almost 50% of the population have private health insurance. There were 2.238M people with private health insurance at the end of December 2007. This figure increased by 59,000 to 2.297M at the end of December 2008. There was a reduction of 37,000 in 2009 to a figure of 2.26M at the end of December 2009 and a further reduction of 33,000 up to the end of September 2010 giving a figure of 2.227M at that date, which is the latest information available.</P>

	<P>I welcomed the publication of the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children on <i>Primary Medical Care in the Community.</i>  The Report contains 40 wide ranging recommendations and in his foreword the Chairman highlighted that more emphasis must be placed on the physical structure of Primary Care Teams and providing community mental health services through those teams. He also called for an immediate expansion of GP training places to a minimum of 150 places and stated that services such as radiology, ultrasound and cardiac diagnostics need to be available at Primary Care Centres.</P>
        <P>Recommendation 13 of the Report focuses on the provision of Primary Care Centres and recommends the introduction of a system of incentives, including Capital Tax Allowances, Stamp Duty Relief, and Rates Relief. These recommendations are not my responsibility but are for my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The development of Primary Care Centres is continuing and the HSE expects at least 115 centres to be operational by 2013, supporting 160 Primary Care Teams.</P>
        <P>In so far as the recommendations relating to me are concerned, significant progress has been made.</P>
        <P>Community Mental Health Centres are being developed in tandem with Primary Care Centres, where space allows.  228 such developments have been planned in total, one of which has opened in Letterkenny and a further 31 sites have been identified.</P>
        <P>There are now 157 GP training places.</P>
        <P>Access to diagnostic services in primary care will be a particular focus of the work of the National Clinical Director for Radiology Services and each Clinical Director in determining the clinical care pathway for their specific care programme will stipulate the appropriateness and frequency of out reach services.</P>
        <P>Many other developments have taken place in Primary Care since the publication of the Joint Committee&rsquo;s report. The development of Primary Care Teams will continue and 527 Primary Care Teams have been identified for development by the end of 2011, when ultimately <Col N="610"/>everyone in the country should be able to access 95% of the care they need within their local community.</P>

	<P>The new National Paediatric Hospital is a priority for the Government.  </P>
        <P>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has formally asked An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la for the project to be considered under the Strategic Infrastructure legislation.  Two meetings were held with An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la in November and December 2010 as part of the pre-consultation engagement by the Development Board.  This pre-planning consultation is expected to conclude by the end of this month, with a formal planning application expected to be submitted following review by the Development Board at its January 2011 meeting.</P>
        <P>The Development Board anticipates that the planning process is likely to include a public oral hearing.  It estimates that a decision on planning permission will take a number of months, as would be normal for projects of this size.  The Development Board will, of course, continue to work intensively on the detailed planning of the project as An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s consideration of the planning application proceeds.</P>
        <P>Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the new hospital is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of this year with completion of construction scheduled for the end of 2014.</P>
        <P>I met with the Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals on the 16th of December last.  At this meeting I emphasised the need for early progress on establishing robust governance structures for the new hospital.  The Chairs and CEOs all committed to a process aimed at agreeing such a governance structure as soon as possible.  The first meeting of the group established to bring this work forward will take place tomorrow, Friday 14 January.</P>

	<P>The Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 (the &ldquo;Croke Park Agreement&rdquo;) enables the introduction of significant transformation in the health sector. This is essential to maintain and improve the quality of services while achieving an ongoing reduction in the cost of delivery of public services.</P>

        <P>The Agreement also provides a framework for implementing the changes agreed. This includes a National Implementation Body chaired by Mr. P.J.

	<P>In early November 2010 I announced that the Government had decided to approve a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme and a voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes was to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.  </P>
        <P>The VER and VR schemes were open to employees in the management and administrative staff and general support staff categories. The exact grades covered by the two schemes were set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).</P>
        <P>The most recent detailed information available from the HSE indicates that 2,003 individuals have departed from the health service under the schemes; 641 under the voluntary early retirement scheme and 1,362 under the voluntary redundancy scheme.  However, there may be minor adjustments to the numbers as outstanding queries are finalised.  Of the total, 1,409 were HSE employees while the balance of 594 were employed in voluntary hospitals, disability organisations etc. Details of the 1,409 HSE employees who availed of the schemes are as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />876 individuals availed of the voluntary redundancy scheme</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />533 individuals availed of the voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I understand from the most recent information that the once off cost in 2010 of both schemes was in the region of &euro;100m and the likely savings are expected to be in the region of &euro;50m to &euro;70m annually.  The HSE is currently collating definitive information in relation to the costs of these schemes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P><Col N="612"/>
        <P>Approximately 650,000 seasonal flu vaccines were delivered to the HSE in September 2010 and have already been distributed to GPs and HSE sites. The HSE is in the process of drawing down a further 100,000 vaccines which were part of the contingency arrangements within the same contract.</P>
        <P>The HSE will also deliver supplies of Pandemrix, one of the vaccines used during last year&rsquo;s H1N1 pandemic vaccination campaign, to GPs and to other HSE sites. As most of the seasonal flu cases at present are swine flu, this will ensure continuity of supply of vaccines against swine flu if infection rates continue to rise as expected over the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>Those to be vaccinated are the same now as advised in September last following advice from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). The groups strongly recommended for the 2010/11 seasonal influenza vaccine include all those aged 65 years and over, adults and children over 6 months of age with long-term illnesses such as chronic respiratory disease, moderate or severe asthma, chronic heart disease and all those who are immunosuppressed due to disease or treatment as well as healthcare staff and carers.</P>
        <P>In addition, healthy pregnant women and women up to six weeks after giving birth who have not previously received the swine flu vaccine are urged to get the seasonal flu vaccination this year as they are at higher risk of complications from swine flu.  Pregnant women who have a long term medical condition such as diabetes, heart or lung disease need to get the seasonal flu vaccine even if they have already had the swine flu vaccine last year.</P>
        <P>The HSE is satisfied that it has sufficient supplies of vaccine to cater for the need.</P>
        <P>The report referred to by Deputy Ferris is the &ldquo;Pandemic Preparedness for Ireland: Advice of the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group&rdquo; which was published in 2007 and revised in November 2008. The aim of the document is to provide authoritative information on pandemic influenza, clinical guidance for health professionals, and public health advice for the public, public health professionals, and policy makers in my Department and other government Departments and agencies, all of whom are involved in the response to any influenza pandemic. This document is an advice paper which forms part of the ongoing deliberations, inter alia, of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) which met on a daily basis during the influenza pandemic of 2009.  It continues to meet now as required to monitor and review influenza activity. The NPHET refers issues on a regular basis to the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group for advice and where appropriate their recommendations are taken into account by the Department, the HSE and by the NPHET.</P>

	<P>A number of priority developments are complete &mdash; the Limerick trauma theatre and Nenagh endoscopy suite, or underway in the Mid West region to support the reconfiguration of hospital services.  In particular the development of a new critical care block at a cost of &euro;35m is a key component in the reconfiguration project. Construction of this facility is underway and is intended to be complete in 2012.  Other priority projects include a dedicated trauma theatre in Limerick, a replacement <Col N="613"/>ward at Ennis, a region wide PACS / radiology system and new endoscopy suites at Nenagh and Ennis.  Prioritisation of these projects and the commitment of significant capital resources totalling &euro;64m has been informed by local requirements and priorities.</P>
        <P>The design of the critical care project in Limerick includes provision to facilitate expansion and/or relocation of other services at the hospital.  In addition to the accommodation necessary for the critical care facility, accommodation on two further floors is also being provided.  I want to progress the development of a new emergency department.  This however is subject to agreement on staffing and revenue requirements.  This is to ensure that it becomes operational as soon as possible after equipping and commissioning the facility.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the priority needs of the region and the infrastructure requirements of the reconfiguration programme will continue to be given significant weight in the allocation of limited capital investment.</P>

	<P>The report  on Cardiovascular Health Policy 2010-2019 recommended that stroke services be reconfigured into stroke networks, with a number of hospitals working together to provide the comprehensive range of services needed for optimal stroke care and working closely with community services.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has appointed two lead clinicians within the Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care to direct the implementation of the recommendations in so far as stroke is concerned. Discussions are taking place at local and regional level to further improve access and quality of stroke services for patients.  Service developments will be accompanied by initiatives to improve quality across the spectrum of stroke care.</P>
        <P>Two or three stroke hospital networks has been proposed by each of the 4 HSE regions.  The HSE National Clinical Programme for 2011 provides for the establishment of a further 9 acute/rehabilitation stroke units in addition to the 19 already in place.  Work is underway locally to clarify the roles of each hospital and the care pathways between hospitals in each network. The identification of stroke rehabilitation services in the community, to support strategic planning of those services is also underway. Continuous improvements in prevention and in acute stroke care &mdash; stroke units, thrombolysis and rehabilitation &mdash; will improve outcomes for patients with stroke.</P>

To help achieve this goal, it will be <Col N="615"/>necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years.</P>
        <P>The appointment of senior management posts is covered by the Employment Control Framework for the health sector. The Framework includes provision for the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public service. However, the Framework does allow for the filling of certain exempted grades and there are also grades/posts to which special provisions apply. In addition, the Health Service Executive can also make exceptions to the moratorium on recruitment under certain conditions.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The HSE has advised that any other senior manager appointments within the HSE in 2010 have been as a result of redeployment of existing staff under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014.</P>
        <P>The HSE has further advised that the new service delivery model for the HSE is based on a smaller number of area management units and consequently requires less senior managers. These positions are being filled through a redeployment process under the Public Service Agreement. Furthermore, a significant number of senior managers left the HSE under the exit schemes programme at the end of 2010.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 28, 51, 63, 66 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>The HSE has stated that the Acute Services Division of the Integrated Services Directorate has not received any reports on whether the recent water restrictions have adversely affected the functioning of emergency departments.</P>
        <P>The waiting times for patients attending Emergency Departments in many hospitals during the first week of January were unacceptable, and I very much regret the delays that patients experienced.</P>
        <P>I have discussed plans with the HSE for ensuring that this situation does not recur.  The HSE has assured me that it will take all possible steps to improve waiting times in Emergency Departments, so that all patients are assessed, treated and discharged or admitted without unnecessary delay.</P>
        <P>The HSE has taken specific steps to cope with the increase in activity that is normally experienced at this time of year.  These include curtailing elective surgery and opening beds which are normally closed for seasonal reasons. Other actions taken by hospitals include increasing the number of ward rounds to ensure that any patients who are ready to go home are discharged with support as necessary from community based services.</P>
        <P>Hospitals are also ensuring that discharges are carried out early in the morning and over the weekend, to make beds available for patients being admitted through the ED.  In addition the HSE is working to have senior clinical decision makers and diagnostic services speedily avail<Col N="618"/>able for Emergency Department needs.  The HSE has also provided for enhanced GP out of hours services through the expansion of the GP co-ops.  Where deficits in staff numbers have occurred a mixture of cross-cover, overtime, locum cover and agency staffing has been used to ensure continuity of service and the provision of a safe level of service for patients.</P>
        <P>The steps I have outlined above are taken to address the current short-term difficulties.  Improving access to hospital services requires a wider healthcare approach.  In recognition of this, the HSE has undertaken a number of initiatives in recent years. These include the Winter Initiative Programme, the introduction of the Code of Practice for Integrated Discharge Planning and actions to reduce the number of delayed discharges, including the introduction of the &ldquo;Fair Deal&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Other innovations undertaken by the HSE include the development of Emergency Care Networks and the Acute Medicine Programme which involves the establishment of Acute Medical and Surgical Assessment Units, Rapid Access Clinics and Minor Injury Units.  The programme seeks to channel patients quickly to the service best suited to their needs, and to reduce the usage of Emergency Department services by those who can be best treated elsewhere.</P>
        <P>A new Acute Medical Unit was opened at Cork University Hospital last Monday.  Other similar units are already in place at Kerry General Hospital and St Luke&rsquo;s General Hospital in Kilkenny.  The HSE Service Plan for 2011 commits to the establishment of 12 Acute Medical Units during 2011 with an investment of &euro;8.5m.</P>
        <P>Emergency Departments have particular infection control protocols in place for staff to manage patients attending with flu like illnesses including the H1NI virus to minimise risk to patients and staff.</P>
        <P>The key to addressing the ED challenge is an integrated pro-active management by all concerned throughout the system.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that minimising waiting times in EDs is a key priority in their service to patients.</P>

	<P>One of the main recommendations of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing in 2003 was to increase the number of consultants and to reduce the number of NCHD posts in order to create a consultant-provided service. </P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has advised that there are currently 2,439 approved consultant posts.  The number of consultants employed as at 30 November 2010 was 2,450.  This figure, however, includes locum, temporary and part-time appointments. Given the manner in which consultant posts are filled it is not possible to provide a precise figure for vacancies.</P>
        <P>The move to a consultant provided service is also reflected in the 2008 contract.  This provided for consultants to work as part of a team over an extended working day of 8am to 8pm, an increase in the length of the working week and also structured weekend work.  It is also <Col N="619"/>provided for in the HSE&rsquo;s Employment Control Framework which allows for new hospital consultant posts to be created by the suppression of two NCHD posts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 75 together.</P>
        <P>In early November 2010 I announced that the Government had decided to approve a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme and a voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes was to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.</P>
        <P>The VER and VR schemes were open to employees in the management and administrative staff and general support staff categories. The exact grades covered by the two schemes were set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).  The schemes were not targeted at those providing front-line services.</P>
        <P>The most recent detailed information available from the HSE indicates that 2,003 individuals have departed from the health service under the schemes; 641 in respect of the voluntary early retirement scheme and 1,362 in respect of the voluntary redundancy scheme. Of this total, 1,409 were HSE employees while the balance were employed in voluntary hospitals, disability organisations etc. 533 individuals employed in the HSE accepted the VER scheme while 876 individuals employed in the HSE availed of the VR scheme.  Overall, a total of 1,364 individuals from the Management and Administration category availed of the schemes while the remaining 639 are categorised as General Suppor Staff.  These numbers are subject to minor adjustment as queries are finalised etc.</P>
        <P>The Government has made clear that a critical part of its strategy to restore the public finances is to achieve sustainability in the cost of delivering public services relative to State revenues. To help achieve this goal, it will be necessary to restructure and reorganise the public service and to reduce public service numbers over the coming years. This requires that the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the health service will continue to apply until the numbers have fallen to the level set out in the Employment Control Framework 2011-2014 for the health sector. The Framework gives effect to the Government policy on employment in the public sector.  A basic objective of the Framework remains to reduce the numbers of management and administration staff and non-frontline staff employed in the sector.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda vetting is a pre-employment check carried out if a prospective employee, volunteer or student on placement will have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  There is no proposal to extend this category of employee. </P>
        <P>Garda vetting provides for the disclosure by the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) to the prospective employer of details of prosecutions and convictions of the candidate.  It is a matter for the employer to assess the implications of the information before a decision is taken on the candidate&rsquo;s suitability to take up duty.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Minister for Children in my Department, the HSE, the Voluntary Hospitals  and the following bodies funded from the Health vote are registered with the GCVU: Health information and Quality Authority; Mental Health Commission; Ombudsman for Children; Health &amp; Social Care Professionals&rsquo; Council.   The other  Bodies funded from the Health vote are not registered as their employees do not have unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>All nursing homes in Ireland have access to Garda vetting services under the auspices of Nursing Homes Ireland; home care providers under the auspices of the Irish Private Home Care Association IPHCA; all nursing agencies, locum agencies and out-sourced employers and contractors to the health service under an umbrella body known as the National Recruitment Federation.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Working Group on G&aacute;rda Vetting (2004) noted that vetting is not a substitute for good human resource management policy in relation to the recruitment and selection of staff and volunteers;  and that a proper selection process is one of the most effective means of evaluating an applicant&rsquo;s suitability  and deterring potential abusers.  It recognised vetting as a further protection measure to children and vulnerable adults.</P>

This is the same target as in 2010. The Deputy will appreciate that the Executive has operational responsibility to manage this particular service at national, regional and local levels, as part of delivering its overall community-based services to older people. My Department will liaise closely with the Executive over the course of the year in relation to monitoring services for older people.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the commitment of the Government to protect services for older people is also highlighted by the additional funding of  &euro;14 million provided in Budget 2011, for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and for Home Care Packages.</P>

However, if a child needs hospital care, the HSE will provide this. The Health Service Executive will continue to fund Jack &amp; Jill in 2011 on the same basis as in 2010, subject to any overall resources limitations that may arise for all providers in the disability sector generally, but it is not in a position to provide additional funding for the Foundation to compensate for the drop in its private fund-raising income.</P>

	<P>Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible and, where this is not an option for whatever reason, to support access to high quality long term residential care. The Government has in recent years provided significant investment to the Health Service Executive, to develop its range of community based services to older people.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care generally, whether by statutory or non-statutory providers. The HSE, and the Department progressed during 2010, various improvements in home care provision overall, particularly relating to the governance of services. The position in relation to these is that:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The<i> National Guidelines &amp; Procedures for Standardised Implementation of the Home Care Packages Scheme </i>was recently completed, and will be implemented across all Local Health Offices in 2011.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The HSE launched a <i>Public Procurement Framework for Home Care Services</i>   on 22 October last. The Executive is  at present progressing this, in line with the requirements and procurement timeframes contained in the Framework.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Executive is also progressing, with a view to implementation in 2011, <i>Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People</i>and   <i>National Guidelines for the Home Help Service.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Procurement Framework, together with the Quality Guidelines, will enhance the standard of Home Care services provided by, or on behalf of, the HSE.</P>
        <P>With reference to the possible regulation of home care services, the July 2008 <i>Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance</i> recommended<i>, </i>amongst other things, the extension of licensing systems to the primary health care area. The Law Reform Commission published, in July 2009, a consultation paper entitled <i>Legal Aspects of Carers.</i>  This considers the legal issues surrounding home care and makes a number of provisional recommendations in the area of standards and regulations generally.</P>
        <P>As previously indicated to the House, the question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for the area of Home Care for older people generally is under consideration. The Department is, at present, examining the regulation of this sector in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers. Legislation is currently being prepared in this regard, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission on Patient Safety, and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to do everything possible to protect all older people receiving Home Care. Our approach is to progress the various initiatives I have outlined, while examining the options and implications of introducing statutory regulation. It is not possible at this stage to provide a timeframe to indicate when any new statutory regime might be introduced. I wish to assure this House, however, that the Department of Health and Children will progress this work as quickly as possible, in conjunction with monitoring the other initiatives I have outlined above. This would include liaison, as appropriate, with relevant statutory and non-statutory organizations to ensure quality standards for all people receiving Home Care.</P>

        <Quest> if she will, without further delay and on a statutory basis, put in place regulations for the home care sector, to empower and resource the Health Information and Quality Authority to monitor compliance with these regulations, to establish proper qualifications, pay and conditions for home care workers and to change her policy from privatisation to one of direct provision of home care by the Health Service Executive. </Quest>

	<P>Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible and, where this is not an option for whatever reason, to support access to high quality long term residential care. The Government has, in recent years, provided significant investment to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to develop its range of community based services for older people. In some cases, where the service is approved and funded by the HSE, this may be undertaken by the Executive through a partnership arrangement with non-statutory providers to maximise service delivery.</P>
        <P>In relation to the possible regulation of home care services, the <i>Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance</i>of July 2008 recommended<i>,</i>amongst other things, the extension of any licensing systems to the primary health care area.

The Department of Health and Children accepts the need for a more standardised approach to the regulation of home care, whether by statutory or non-statutory providers. The HSE, and the Department, progressed during 2010 various improvements to home care provision, particularly relating to the governance of services. The recently approved HSE Service Plan 2011 commits the Executive to developing its model of care this year to maximise community services to vulnerable older people. This provision includes:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>National Guidelines &amp; Procedures for Standardised Implementation of the Home Care Packages Scheme;</i></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>Quality Guidelines for Home Care Support Services for Older People;</i></P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><i>National Guidelines for the Home Help Service.</i></P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, the HSE launched a Public Procurement Framework for Home Care services on 22 October last. The Executive is progressing this Framework, in conjunction with the other measures outlined above, to enhance these services for HSE home care recipients.</P>
        <P>As indicated to the House in recent times, the question of possible changes to legislation, including regulation and inspection, for Home Care services for older people is under consideration. The Department is, at present, examining this matter in the overall context of the licensing of Health Care providers. Legislation is currently being prepared in this regard, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission on Patient Safety, and the Law Reform Commission.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to do everything possible to protect vulnerable older people. This includes progressing the various initiatives I have outlined, while examining the options of introducing statutory regulation. This would have to take account, for example, of any resource or implementation implications. Not all of the issues raised by the Deputy, such as pay, would necessarily be covered by any new statutory regime. The Deputy can rest assured, however, that the Department of Health and Children will work closely with relevant statutory <Col N="624"/>and non-statutory organizations to take all measures necessary to ensure quality standards for all people receiving Home Care.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest> if she will divert funding from the National Treatment Purchase Fund to be used directly by public hospitals, many of which, due to cutbacks, have unused or under used capacity, including closed beds and wards, while private corporations are profiting from public money in the form of NTPF contracts. </Quest>
        <QRef>[1775/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Treatment Purchase Fund&rsquo;s primary role is provide treatment for those public patients waiting longest for surgery or diagnostic services  principally, through providing additional treatment capacity, largely from private hospitals.  Its discrete budget ensures that these resources are used for elective activity and not diverted.</P>
        <P>The Fund is obliged as a matter of policy, to source at least 90% of treatment from the private system. Capacity is purchased from the public hospital system for activity, such as paediatric surgery, which cannot be carried out in private hospitals, but this activity must not adversely affect core services. In 2010, the NTPF sourced 7% of its activity from the public system.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to change the Fund&rsquo;s role or the way it operates.  Its operation is subject to ongoing monitoring and review, to ensure that resources are used efficiently and are targeted so that they achieve the greatest benefit for patients. I have emphasised to the Fund the need for maximum cost-effectiveness, consistent with safe and effective care. I have asked it to seek even better value from private hospitals and the Fund has successfully negotiated price reductions for certain high-volume procedures.  In addition, it will not purchase services where the price is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>In light of the report of the Expert Group on Resource Allocation, I have instructed the HSE to develop pilot arrangements with the NTPF for the prospective activity-based funding of certain elective orthopaedic procedures and a more innovative approach to respite services for people with disabilities.</P>
        <P>For respite services, I have asked the HSE to undertake a study with the NTPF in two pilot areas, Galway and Limerick, to assess the relative cost effectiveness of different approaches to the provision of respite care by both statutory and voluntary providers.</P>
        <P>The objectives of the orthopaedic initiative would include more patient treatments and reductions in waiting times and the average cost of treatments. Clinical guidelines and protocols will support efficient care and the achievement of good patient outcomes. I have asked the Executive to undertake the necessary preparatory work with the Fund in the first quarter of 2011, with a view to the pilot will commencing in April.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 57 together.</P>
        <P>General Practitioner (GP) out-of-hours co-operatives are an important part of our primary care services. While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in co-operatives, GPs contracted under the General Medical Services Scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them (or a locum/deputy) for emergencies outside normal practice hours.  Co-operatives provide an ideal facility to enable GPs to discharge this obligation.</P>
        <P>There were over 983,000 contacts with GP out-of-hours co-operatives in 2009 and the total cost of funding out-of-hours services was in the region of &euro;110 million.</P>
        <P>A National Review of GP Out-of-Hours Services was published by the HSE in March 2010.  It reviewed the 9 GP co-operatives and the 4 extended-hours services that are currently in place. The Review makes a series of recommendations designed to strengthen and standardise out-of-hours services across the country, including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Out-of-hours services to be extended to cover parts of the country where there is currently no such provision.  Each of the 4 HSE regions will now engage with non-participating GPs with the aim of ensuring full out-of-hours coverage nationally.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The number of call centres to be reduced from 7 to 4.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A working group comprising representatives from the HSE, the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Association of General Practitioner Co-operatives has been established to advance the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>As aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the HSE, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address these matters and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The HSE has advised that as of 11th January 2010, approximately 150 of 4,638 Non Consultant Hospital Doctor (NCHD) were vacant. Locations experiencing particular difficulties are Drogheda (Anaesthetics and Paediatrics), Letterkenny (Emergency Medicine and Medicine), Limerick (Emergency Medicine) and Beaumont (Emergency Medicine).  The moratorium on public sector recruitment is not a factor in these NCHD vacancies. Other countries are also experiencing difficulties in recruiting NCHDs.</P>
        <P>My Department is working with HSE and relevant stakeholders to ensure that an adequate number of NCHDs is maintained in the public health service.  In addition the HSE have developed a range of strategies and initiatives for the current and July 2011 rotations with a view to maximising recruitment.  Key measures include:</P><Col N="626"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><b><i>Professional Development Posts</i></b><i> </i>- On 3rd   December the HSE advertised all vacant non-training NCHD posts as &lsquo;Professional Development Posts&rsquo; under 2 year contracts to one of the four HSE Areas, with a minimum of 6 months in a regional centre, participation in a Professional Development Scheme under the relevant postgraduate training body and access to a range of financial incentives.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><b><i>International recruitment</i></b>   &mdash; the HSE recently facilitated two recruitment campaigns in Budapest and Bucharest.  This has resulted in a significant number of potential candidates for vacant NCHD posts. The HSE is also working to facilitate a recruitment process in India and Pakistan this month.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><b><i>Increase in training posts</i></b><i> </i>  &mdash; Introduction in July of additional Initial Specialist Training posts in Emergency Medicine and additional Initial Specialist Training posts in Surgery;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" /><b><i>NCHDs registered on Trainee Specialist Division working in other hospital sites</i></b> &mdash; the HSE has written to its Hospitals and Agencies clarifying that NCHDs registered on the Trainee Specialist Division may be offered the opportunity or required by their employer to <i>provide services appropriate to their training specialty, grade and training programme in other clinical sites&rdquo;. </i>  This would allow &mdash; for example, the employer to offer a trainee in emergency medicine employed in St James&rsquo;s Hospital the opportunity to perform additional work in Beaumont.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, each HSE Area has a contingency plan in place to ensure safe services are maintained in the context of any ongoing vacancies.</P>

	<P>In 2011, the Health Sector will benefit from a total capital investment of &euro;399m which will allow for the progression of a wide range of health infrastructure developments.  </P>
        <P>The capital allocation for the Health Service Executive in 2011 is &euro;372.75m of which &euro;40m is to support its ICT infrastructure.  A further allocation of  &euro;15m over and above this provision is expected to be available based upon the proceeds of disposals of sales of surplus assets.  In drawing up its capital programme the Executive is required to prioritise the capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital funding allocation taking into account the programme&rsquo;s capital commitments and costs to completion over the multi-annual period 2011 &mdash; 2015.   Given the level of commitments and the completion costs there is limited funding available for new projects in 2011.  Details of the capital infrastructure projects already in progress are set out in the HSE&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2010-2014 which is available on its website.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive submitted its draft capital plan for the five year period 2011-2015 to my Department in December 2010.   My Department is reviewing the plan and will follow up with the Executive where further details may be required.  The proposed plan requires my approval with the consent of the Minister of Finance.  Following its approval, details of the plan will be published by the HSE.</P>
        <P>Of the &euro;15.45m allocated to my Department, &euro;0.45m will support its internal ICT and &euro;15m is allocated in respect of capital grants to directly funded agencies.</P>

        <P>An additional &euro;1 million was provided in the recent Budget for the NOSP for 2011 which will enable the Office to build on initiatives to date and bring added momentum and new impetus to their activities to address the increasing incidence of suicide.

The Plan also reflects my guidance to the HSE that there should be a particular focus on protecting services to vulnerable groups, in particular mental health and disability services.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficult financial environment, the Government has made available additional resources to underscore its emphasis on particular priority service areas and to support ongoing reform of the public health services.  In relation to primary, community and continuing care services, activity levels are in line with 2010, with some growth in activity proposed in areas such as home care packages and medical card schemes to address pressures on these <Col N="629"/>areas.  Hospital activity levels will target a 2% reduction in inpatient activity to be offset by a 3% increase in day cases, leading to a modest increase in total hospital care.  The implementation of national programmes such as the acute medicine and surgical programmes will support the delivery of these targets.  The quality agenda for cancer services will also continue, as will the outpatient service improvement programme.</P>
        <P>It is a challenge to everyone working in the health services this year to focus on delivering the innovation and change required to protect and indeed improve our services for patients.  The early approval of the Service Plan will allow a strong budgetary focus to be in place at all levels within the health service from the outset of the year.  By reducing costs and reforming the way services are provided, I am confident the HSE will maintain appropriate access to services and continue to improve health outcomes for the population.</P>
        <P>The Plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published on the HSE&rsquo;s website on 22 December.  During 2011, the HSE will provide me with monthly performance reports on all aspects of progression of the Plan.</P>

        <Quest> the overall absenteeism level in the public health service in 2010; the total estimated cost of absenteeism to the Health Service Executive in 2010; the targeted absenteeism rate for public health services; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Absenteeism through illness is a normal incidence of working life. The HSE has advised that an analysis of the data collated by the Executive indicates that a substantial majority (in the order of 85%) of such leave is certified by medical practitioners. Indeed, Health Service employers have available to them a comprehensive set of management tools allowing for a robust engagement on absenteeism with staff, with the objective of ensuring the necessary supports and interventions are available to reduce the impact of non-attendance on the delivery of services and to assist staff return to work in a timely and effective manner in both the interests of staff and services.   </P>
        <P>Combined absenteeism levels have reduced from 5.05% in 2009 to 4.71% for the year to October 2010. This represents a fall of 6.73% on 2009 or 18.23% on 2008 (5.76%). A rate below 5% has been maintained since January 2010 and the HSE is working towards achieving a rate of no more than 3.5%.</P>
        <P>Current figures put the Health Services generally in-line with the upper quartile figure reported by IBEC for large organisations in the private sector and available information for other large public organisations and are below figures reported by Department of Health &amp; Social Services in Northern Ireland.  The HSE estimates that the payroll costs for each 1% of absenteeism are in the order of &euro;60M.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the HSE that the total number of people who left under the exit schemes was 2,003 as at 31st December 2010. Some queries are being finalised with some non HSE organisations that may result in some minor adjustment to the total numbers. There are also an additional 25 people on maternity <Col N="630"/>leave who have the option to take up an exit package on their return that would bring the total to 2028 </P>
        <P>This comprised of 1,409 in the HSE and 594 in other eligible organisations. The total number of management/administration staff who left was 1364 while the total number of staff who left from support services was 639.</P>
        <P>I also understand from the HSE that a human resources framework has been agreed with the relevant trade unions at national level to ensure that any gaps identified as a result of staff leaving under the exit schemes are being dealt with appropriately. This is being used by local management and local trade union officials to deal with the impact of those staff leaving under the schemes.  On completion of the exit schemes an assessment was undertaken at local level to determine priority positions for reassignment. This process is ongoing at local level with the staff associations.</P>
        <P>There are a number of other measures and actions being taken to minimise any affect on services through staff departing under the exit schemes. For example where a role can be suppressed or part of a role can be suppressed then this is being actioned to release staff to critical areas. In addition the HSE is seeking expressions of interest from staff in non front line areas that may be in a position to transfer in order to fill any gaps in front line services.</P>
        <P>The HSE is managing this process on a regional basis to the greatest extent possible, so that local management have the flexibility to resolve any potential gaps in services.</P>

	<P>As the House is aware, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children produced a wording for an amendment to the Constitution in February 2010.  The Committee&rsquo;s proposal was longer and far more extensive in scope than the original wording which had been contained in the 2007 Referendum Bill.  The proposal was examined by Ministers and by the Office of the Attorney General, and a wide range of policy implications were identified.  In July, therefore, the Government asked me to develop a revised wording, working with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>Working very closely with the Office of the Attorney General, new wording has been developed which I believe could form the basis of a Referendum Bill. I submitted a proposal to Cabinet on Tuesday of this week, and got approval to draft a Referendum Bill. I am in discussion with the Attorney General about one final issue but am satisfied that that will be resolved shortly.   I hope that the Bill will be published within weeks. I fully intend to share the proposed wording with the Opposition parties and seek their support for the proposal.</P>

	<P>The Mental Health Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Mental Health Act 2001 to promote high standards in the delivery of mental health services and ensure that the interests of those involuntarily admitted to Approved Centres are protected.  In accordance with the Act, the Inspector of Mental Health Services is required to visit and inspect every approved centre annually and, as the Inspectorate think appropriate, to visit and inspect any other premises where mental health services are being provided.</P>
        <P>I am aware that in a number of recent inspection reports, which are available on the Commission&rsquo;s website, the Inspector has highlighted the high incidence of the use of medication and has recommended that the practice be reviewed as a matter of urgency.  While I share the Inspector&rsquo;s concerns regarding any over reliance on medication, I am satisfied that procedures are in place to address this matter.  I also believe that those procedures demonstrate the robustness of the Mental Health Act 2001, the independence of the Mental Health Commission and the importance of its role in safeguarding the standards and quality of care in the mental health services.  It is clear that the checks and balances established by the 2001 Act, to promote high standards and good practices in our mental health services, are working.</P>
        <P>With regard to the closure of the old psychiatric hospitals, I can confirm that the transfer of patients to more appropriate community based settings remains a priority.  In this regard significant progress is being made, for example;</P>

	<P>Notwithstanding the current economic circumstances and the necessary across the board reductions in Government spending, special consideration was given to disability and mental health in Budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the allocation for the two sectors.  This relatively lower reduction, compared to other areas of the health budget, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups.  Furthermore, Budget 2011 provided an additional &euro;10 million to the Health Service Executive for disability in 2011.  This is to meet anticipated extra demand in respect of emergency residential, respite and personal assistant/home support hours for people with disabilities, and day places for school leavers in September 2011.  Taking the reduction in the overall HSE Disability budget into account, the HSE will manage the additional resources to ensure that existing support needs, and demands for additional places and supports, are managed effectively within the overall allocation.  I acknowledge the strong contribution and commitment of the Voluntary service providers in the disability sector and I have asked the HSE to work closely with the Voluntary sector in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>The new National Paediatric Hospital is a continuing priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is making good progress in planning and developing the new hospital at the Mater site.  It has formally asked An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la for the project to be considered under the Strategic Infrastructure legislation.</P>
        <P>Two meetings were held with An B&oacute;rd Plean&aacute;la in November and December 2010 as part of the pre-consultation engagement by the Development Board.  This pre-planning consultation is expected to conclude by the end of this month, with a formal planning application expected to be submitted following review by the Development Board at its January 2011 meeting.</P>
        <P>The Development Board anticipates that the planning process is likely to include a public oral hearing. It estimates that a decision on planning permission will take a number of months, as would be normal for projects of this size.  The Development Board will, of course, continue to work intensively on the detailed planning of the project as Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s consideration of the planning application proceeds.</P>
        <P>Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the new hospital is scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of this year with completion of construction scheduled for the end of 2014.</P>
        <P>I met with the Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals on the 16th of December last.  At the meeting I emphasised the need for early progress on establishing robust governance structures for the new hospital.  The Chairs and CEOs all committed to a process aimed at agreeing such a governance structure as soon as possible.  The first meeting of the group established to bring this work forward will take place tomorrow, Friday 14th January.</P>

 </tgroup>  <P Just="Left">*In November 2010, a new Adoption Authority to replace the existing Adoption Board was established. These staff numbers will no longer be included as part of the Department&rsquo;s numbers in future. Also, from end 2010 staff employed at the Office of the Ombudsman for Children will be returned separately under the health agencies returns to the Department of Finance.</P>
</table><Col N="635"/>
        <P FLI="0">This reduction in overall staffing levels has been primarily achieved by way of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement, the Incentivised Career Break Scheme and the continuing moratorium on the filling of vacancies. It should also be noted that during this period over 35 people transferred into my Department as a result of the transfer of functions and responsibilities for childcare schemes and youth affairs from a number of Departments, the rationalisation of three public service agencies and taking on of responsibility for bioethics research.</P>
        <P>In line with the Employment Control Framework (ECF) setting out Government policy on numbers employed in the public service, the numbers employed at my Department must be further reduced to 390 by 2014 and we will use all appropriate mechanisms such as re-organisation and re-allocation of work, including redeployment where necessary, to meet this target.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Institute sought to make arrangements for the review to be carried out by an external team.

	<P>At the heart of the Primary Care Strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, home helps, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health care professionals.  The Strategy is also about the reorientation of existing resources to develop new ways for health and social care professionals to work together for the benefit of people accessing primary care services in their own communities.  </P>
        <P>Currently, there are 348 Primary Care Teams operating (holding clinical team meetings on individual client cases and involving GPs and HSE staff) and providing services for over 2.6 million people.  The Health Service Executive has identified 527 Primary Care Teams (PCTs) for development by the end of 2011.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where possible, PCTs are based in a single facility to provide easy accessibility for patients and to enhance multi-disciplinary teamwork. However, there is ample worldwide evidence that health professionals can work effectively together while being based in different locations.  I set out a table giving an indication of the infrastructure in place for the current Teams.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following discussion with my Department and the HSE, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association have agreed a series of measures to deliver savings on drug expenditure of &euro;200 million in 2011.  Savings of &euro;155 million are expected under the GMS and community drug schemes, &euro;35m under the High Tech Scheme and &euro;10m on hospital medicines. </P>
        <P>The Government has decided to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution of medicines. This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients.  I expect to see significant progress on the implementation of this initiative, including the legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011.</P>
        <P>Reference pricing will deliver direct savings by limiting reimbursement to a common reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Indirect savings will also occur as a result of increased price competition. The level of savings will depend upon a range of factors. These include the number and type of products included in reference groups, the relative and absolute prices of products within reference groups and the market response for each reference group.  I anticipate that reference pricing will initially be targeted at high volume products that have the potential to achieve significant savings. I would also highlight the strategic importance of this initiative as a significant number of drugs are due to come off patent in the coming years.</P>

	<P>Special consideration was given to the mental health sector in Budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of 1.8% in the allocation for this sector.  The relatively lower reduction, compared to other sectors of health, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups.  A prerequisite for the lower savings target is the prioritising of services while reforming and modernising models of delivery.  The implementation of this measure will be monitored by my Department in the context of its monitoring of the HSE&rsquo;s Service Plan during 2011.</P>

	<P>Latest information from the HSE reports that the number of births up to the end of October 2010 was 61,791 nationally which represents a 0.5% decrease on the number of births for the same period in 2009 which was 62,131.  The trend is showing a 1.1% decrease against expected levels for 2010. October saw the second highest number of births reported in 2010 (6,418).

        <P>A clinical programme for obstetric care has been established by the HSE&rsquo;s National Director of Quality and Clinical Care. This will define best practice for gynaecology and obstetric care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The KPMG report on maternity services in the Greater Dublin Area recommended that&ensp;maternity and related services should transfer from the three existing maternity hospitals in Dublin to locations on adult acute hospital sites.  It recommended that services at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH) at Holles Street should move to the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital campus at Elm Park.

This report has been adopted by the HSE, and steps are being taken towards implementation of the recommendations made.</P>

Maternal mortality, perinatal mortality and infant mortality are all low by comparison to other jurisdictions.  As part of the HSE&rsquo;s service planning process for 2011, the hospitals are ensuring that Early Pregnancy Assessment Units are compliant with national guidelines.</P>

	<P>The scheme for the award of incremental credit on the common basic scale for post-primary teachers forms part of their terms and conditions of employment.  The criteria for the award of such credit flow from agreements reached at the Teachers&rsquo; Conciliation Council.  It is possible for teaching experience in private educational settings to be recognised for the purposes of incremental credit.  In the case of primary teaching experience, such experience must have been gained in a school which offers a range of studies and which incorporates all of the courses prescribed on the national curriculum of the State.  In the case of post-primary teaching experience, there are a number of conditions including a requirement that the teaching service is given as part of a course of a minimum of 2 normal academic years; is prescribed on the national curriculum of the State in which the school is located and includes mathematics and the national language <Col N="645"/>or language of instruction; and which prepares students for a recognised second-level State examination and qualification or incorporates continual assessment leading to a recognised national completion certificate.</P>
        <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers taught English as a foreign language in a private language centre.  The course she taught is not within the scope of the scheme.  Therefore, it is not possible to award her incremental credit in respect of the service.</P>

	<P>The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 gave statutory effect to the public service pension reduction announced in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014 and Budget 2011.  It is a tapered measure which makes a greater reduction from those with more substantial public service pensions.  The measure will play an important part in the task of bringing Ireland&rsquo;s public finances under control and in bringing the public finance deficit into line with agreed targets.  I can confirm that retired judges are subject to the public service pension reduction.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Constitution precludes a reduction in remuneration for serving members of the judiciary.  As a consequence, serving members of the judiciary were exempted from the application of the pension-related deduction and pay reduction legislation applied to public servants under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 and I have no proposals to reduce their pay rates.

        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />First Time Buyer&rsquo;s Relief;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Relief from Stamp Duty on new houses under 125 sq metres;</P>

         <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Site to child relief.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A transitional measure has been put in place for cases where these changes would increase the Stamp Duty payable on the transaction.  The new rates will not apply where a binding contract is in place before 8 December 2010 and the instrument is executed before 1 July 2011.  The transitional measure will ensure that those who had a binding contract in place before Budget day will not be adversely affected.  I am aware that there will always be winners and losers in a situation such as this, but unfortunately this will happen no matter what date is chosen to commence any new measure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 to 95, inclusive, together.  </P>
        <P>I have received submissions from industry groups and professional bodies and my officials have met with a broad spectrum of stakeholders including the Irish Taxation Institute, Irish Hotels Federation, Construction Industry Federation, Irish Property Owners&rsquo; Association, Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and Society of Chartered Surveyors in relation to the proposed changes to Section 23 and property-based tax relief schemes.  In addition my Department has received a significant number of representations from individuals affected by the measures relating to property-based reliefs, which were announced in the Budget.  All representations will be responded to in the normal manner in due course.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the information provided in tax returns by claimants of section 23 type tax relief is not sufficiently detailed to provide the number of properties benefiting from that scheme.  The only relevant information available relates to 2,429 claims of section 23 type relief on the 2008 income tax returns, the latest available. These claims relate to properties for which tax relief was not previously claimed and exclude any claims made in an earlier year where these were subsequently carried forward into 2008 as unabsorbed losses.  The corresponding numbers of claims for the tax years 2003 to 2007, where 2003 is the earliest year for which this information is available, were 1,952, 3,578, 4,126, 4,132 and 2,919 respectively.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that they are not yet in a position to provide data in respect of the number of claimants for 2009, as all tax returns for that year have not yet been processed.  The measures relating to Section 23 relief outlined in the National Recovery Plan and announced in the Budget were the subject of legal advice.  It is proposed that an impact assessment will be undertaken into the effects of the phased abolition of the property-based measures and the &ldquo;guillotine&rdquo; provision in advance of the 2014 deadline to identify any significantly anomalous effects of the proposed changes.</P>

        <Quest> the contributions made to the European Union in each year since 2008; the level of contributions, if any, expected to be made in 2011 and 2012; if any discussions have been held regarding the suspension of these contributions during the period of the EU-International Monetary Fund programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Budget is a charge on the Central Fund under the European Communities legislation. It is a requirement of our membership of the Union through the Treaties and related legislation.  As the contribution is an obligation of EU membership, there are provisions for sanction of a Member State that does not fulfil these obligations.  There have not been any discussions held regarding the suspension of these contributions.</P>
        <P>It should be remembered that Ireland has been a net recipient of over &euro;40 billion from the EU Budget since 1973 and we expect to remain a net recipient until at least towards the end of the current Multi-annual Financial Framework period 2007-2013.  Ireland has been required to make Budget contributions since joining the EU, regardless of our position as a net beneficiary of EU funding.</P>
        <P>The level of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Budget is determined by the Financial Framework, the annual EU Budget negotiation between the Ecofin (Budget) Council and the European Parliament and our economic performance relative to other Member States.  The Financial Framework provides the overall context and ceilings for the given multi-annual financial period, the annual budget procedure determines the level of spending in any one year for each EU measure, and this is funded by Member States through the provision of the Union&rsquo;s Own Resources.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU Budget amounted to &euro;1,587 million in 2008, &euro;1,486 in 2009, and &euro;1,352 million in 2010. For 2011 it is currently estimated that our contribution will amount to &euro;1,365 million, although this will depend on a number of factors including actual budget implementation.  For 2012 our budget contribution will again depend on a number of factors including the spending level agreed through the annual budget negotiation, actual budget implementation and the economic performance of Member States.  Based on current expectations, our 2012 contribution is estimated at &euro;1,475 million.</P>

        <Quest> the amount that would be raised by reducing capital gains tax exemption thresholds by 50% for group A and 50% for group B; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am assuming the Deputy is referring to the tax-free thresholds for Capital Acquisitions Tax.  Assuming the enactment of the changes to these thresholds announced in the 2011 Budget I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year gains to the Exchequer from reducing the Group A and Group B <Col N="649"/>thresholds for Capital Acquisitions Tax by the stated amounts would be of the order of &euro;50 million and &euro;29 million respectively.  These estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2009.  </P>
        <P>The Group C threshold is currently half of the Group B threshold, so reducing the Group B threshold by 50% would make the Group B and Group C thresholds the same amount.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of the changes, which could lead to a lesser, or in some circumstances, greater than expected impact on Exchequer yield.  In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property, is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that lower paid workers who hold a medical card and were exempt from paying the income levy and health levy will now have to pay the universal social charge and will no longer be exempt resulting in some cases in a reduction of &euro;81 per week in their take home pay which represents up to a 16% pay cut; if he will take the appropriate action to restore the exemption; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that having an entitlement to a medical card will not exempt an individual from the Universal Social Charge (USC).  However, it should be noted that payments from the Department of Social Protection such as job seeker&rsquo;s benefit, job seeker&rsquo;s allowance and the contributory and non-contributory State pension will be exempt from the USC.  Therefore, the Universal Social Charge will apply to the income or portion of the income of a medical card holder to the extent that it is not a payment from the Department of Social Protection.  Furthermore, the legislation provides that where an individual&rsquo;s total annual income which is chargeable to the USC, is below &euro;4,004 in a year of assessment, the USC would not apply.  In addition, those who are over 70 will not be liable to the higher rate of 7%.  </P>
        <P>I should point out that based on the information provided; the level of earnings would have to amount to approximately &euro;70,000 per annum to experience a reduction in net pay of &euro;81 per week solely in respect of the Universal Social Charge.  This level of earnings represents more than double the average industrial wage.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that these concessions protect those on low incomes and those in receipt of payments from the Department of Social Protection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Prize Bond scheme has been running since March 1957. Prize Bonds are part of the range of State Savings products offered by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to personal savers.  All Prize Bond money is placed directly with the Irish State and forms part of the National Debt under the management of the NTMA. The repayment of Prize Bond money and cash prizes is a direct unconditional obligation of Ireland.  Prior to 1989 the Prize Bond Scheme was operated by the Bank of Ireland on behalf of the Minister for Finance. In 1989 the Minister for Finance awarded the contract to operate the Prize Bond scheme to the Prize Bond Company Limited,  a joint venture between An Post,<i></i>a state owned company, and FEXCO, for 10 years.</P>
        <P>In 1990 the NTMA was established and took over responsibility for the running of the Prize Bond scheme. However, it is more efficient for the NTMA to subcontract the detailed day-to-day operations.</P>
        <P>When the 1989 contract expired in 1999, the NTMA held a competitive tender and a new contract was awarded to the Prize Bond Company for 10 years. Following another competitive tender in 2009 the current contract was awarded to the Prize Bond Company and this contract will expire at the end of 2019.</P>
        <P>The Prize Bond Company subcontracts sales and marketing of Prize Bonds, accounting and the conduct of the Prize Bond draws to An Post and administration functions, such as  purchase and repayment processing and maintenance of the customer database, to FEXCO.</P>
        <P>Customers can purchase Prize Bonds through a number of channels including by telephone, by direct postal application, on-line or at any post office. Prize Bonds are priced at &euro;6.25 each subject to a minimum purchase of &euro;25. No discounts are given to Prize Bond purchasers.  Customers can seek repayment of their Prize Bonds at any time after an initial period of three months. The amount of the repayment will always be the original purchase value.</P>
        <P>Customers do not earn interest on their Prize Bonds. In place of interest every Bond is entered into a weekly Prize Bond draw. The number and value of prizes is calculated based on a percentage of the total sum of the outstanding Prize Bonds on the last day of the previous month. This rate, set by the NTMA and approved by the Minister for Finance, is currently 3%. Around 7,000 cash prizes are awarded each week.  A &euro;1 million prize is awarded in the last weekly draw of every month and the top prize in all the other weekly draws is &euro;20,000.</P>
        <P>The total number of prizes in 2010 was 299,000 with a value of &euro;35.9 million.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of the prizes won by Prize Bonds over 25 years old and 50 years old in 2010 was as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />9,482 prizes with a total value of &euro;1,742,000 were won by Prize Bonds between 25 and 50 years old.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />867 prizes with a total value of &euro;66,000 were won by Prize Bonds greater than 50 years old.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Company makes every effort to notify winners and publishes an annual list of the unclaimed prize bond numbers. There is also a facility on the website<i> www.StateSavings.ie  </i> to check if Prize Bonds have won prizes. A prize is deemed unclaimed if it has not been claimed within six months of the draw date. Any unclaimed prizes remain on deposit in a Post Office Savings Bank account under the management of the NTMA until claimed by the owner, who is entitled to the prize in full plus the deposit interest earned (which is subject to DIRT).</P>
        <P>The value of unclaimed prizes at 31 December 2010 was &euro;1.7million.</P><Col N="651"/>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 102, 104 and 106 together. </P>
        <P>I should point out that the phased abolition of property-based tax reliefs announced in the recent Budget relates to both residential and non-residential property.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available on the tax relief allowable for residential property related tax schemes is based on claims for section 23 type relief in 2008 personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers. These claims relate to properties for which tax relief was not previously claimed and exclude any claims made in an earlier year where these were subsequently carried forward into 2008 as unabsorbed losses. On this basis the ultimate cost to the Exchequer of the relief associated with these claims is estimated at &euro;74.7 million and was claimed by 2,429 taxpayers.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).</P>
        <P>The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2008 in the case of individuals. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the other detailed information requested by the Deputy in regard to the numbers who claimed tax relief against different types of income and the levels of incomes and claims involved, is not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; records.</P>
        <P>I am advised by Revenue that they are not yet in a position to provide data in respect of the number of claimants for 2009, as all tax returns for that year have not yet been processed.</P>
        <P>The measures relating to property-based &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; tax reliefs announced in the Budget are in line with our commitment in the Joint Programme for Government to end unnecessary tax reliefs where possible.  The structure of these property-based schemes has resulted in substantial ongoing legacy costs to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I have sought to adopt a pragmatic and balanced approach and provide for an orderly winding down of these schemes to reduce and eliminate the remaining cost to the Exchequer over the period of the National Recovery Plan.</P>
        <P>The measures announced in the Budget are targeted solely at passive investors and will restrict the use of and carry forward of capital allowances and limit Section 23 relief to income from the individual Section 23 property.</P>
        <P>The changes to section 23-type reliefs, which are contained in Financial Resolution No. 20 are broadly as follows.</P>
        <P>Firstly, for chargeable periods ending on or after 1 January 2011, section 23-type relief will be restricted to set-off against rental income only from the section 23 property itself.  Up until now this set-off could be against all rental income in that year.</P>
        <P>Secondly, unused section 23-type relief previously available for carry forward beyond the 10 year &ldquo;normal life&rdquo; of the relief will be lost.</P><Col N="653"/>
        <P>Thirdly, where a person sells a section 23 property within the 10 year period at any time on or after 1 January 2011, the new owner will get no section 23 relief.</P>
        <P>Fourthly, for unused section 23 properties that are, as yet, unsold, the relevant 10 year period for these properties would normally begin once the property is sold and let under a qualifying lease.  The Budget change provided that where any of these properties have yet to commence qualifying leases as of 30 June 2011, the 10-year period will commence on that day.</P>
        <P>The conditions relating to the sale of section 23 properties remain unchanged insofar as where a property is sold within the 10 year relevant period the seller continues to be subject to a clawback of relief already given.</P>
        <P>I also announced in the Budget that a guillotine will be introduced to terminate all unclaimed and unused capital allowances, arising after, or carried forward from 2014 as well as unused section 23 relief carried forward from 2014.</P>
        <P>However, in advance of this an impact assessment will be undertaken into the effects of the phased abolition of the property-based measures and the guillotine provision. This guillotine provision, which is intended to take effect at end 2014, will be provided for in future legislation. The arrangements for the impact assessment, and any consultation mechanisms involved have yet to be made.</P>
        <P>The measures apply to all schemes involving accelerated capital allowances and tax incentive schemes relating to rented residential accommodation (section 23 type relief).</P>
        <P>The National Recovery Plan outlines the projected savings related to these property based relief measures over the period of the Plan.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from examination of claims relating to property based incentive schemes, residential and non-residential, in personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for 2008, approximately one quarter of the relief was claimed by individuals with not more than &euro;50,000 gross rental income.  If a similar proportion is assumed to apply in respect of the Budget proposal for phased abolition of property-based tax &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; reliefs it would result in a quarter of the expected Exchequer yield from that measure being forgone if investors with no more than &euro;50,000 annual rental income were exempted.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> if he will clarify the situation regarding changes made in the Finance Act 2009 limiting to 75% from 100% the bank interest which could be deducted from rental income returns; if the commencement date for same can be given; the reason it applied to residential landlords only and not commercial profits operators; the way this is being checked by the Revenue Commissioners since many small investors who do their own tax returns would not be aware of the changes; if these changes have made some bank loans for investment look reckless; if such loans that might have to be written down can be quantified; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of tax relief investors can claim on the interest for mortgages and loans on residential rental properties was reduced to 75% of the interest accrued from 7th April 2009 under Section 5 of the Finance Act 2009.   Applying the reduction in relief to rents from commercial properties would have provided some additional revenue to the Exchequer.  However, the mechanisms for rent levels inherent in the commercial sector could have resulted in rents increasing in certain cases if the relief was reduced.  Therefore, on balance, in view of the fact that many small and medium firms are faced with difficult trading conditions at present, it was decided to maintain the status quo for the time being.       </P><Col N="654"/>
        <P>The Deputy also asked for information relating to the changes and tax returns. Taxpayers who are in receipt of rental income must submit their annual returns of income under the self-assessment system, unless the amount of rental income is small, in which case the tax is in general collected under the PAYE system. Under the self-assessment system, a return of income may be selected for audit to ensure, inter alia, that the income on the return is correctly calculated. Where self-assessment does not apply, the return of income is processed by the local Revenue office when it is received. Such returns may be subject to examination to ensure, for example, that there are no computational errors and any resultant adjustments are made where necessary.</P>
        <P>Information on the 75% interest limit is available from a number of sources on the Revenue website, www.revenue.ie. For example, A Revenue Guide to Rental Income &mdash; IT 70, the Rental Income section under Income Tax and Part 4.8.6 of the Income Tax Capital Gains Tax and Corporation Tax Manual deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query on loans I do not have information to hand.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In order to broaden the tax base, a number of reliefs and exemptions have been abolished as follows:</P>

       <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Relief from Stamp Duty on new houses under 125 sq metres;</P><Col N="655"/>

      <P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />Site to child relief.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Although the First Time Buyer exemption from Stamp Duty was abolished from 8 December 2010, a transitional measure was put in place for cases where the changes would increase the Stamp Duty payable on the transaction.  Stamp Duty can be paid under the old rates, if this would result in a lower liability, where a binding contract to purchase a property was in place before 8 December 2010 and the instrument is executed before 1 July 2011.  Therefore, if the case to which the Deputy refers satisfies these conditions, First Time Buyer relief may still be claimed.</P>

	<P>I am informed that NAMA proposes to increase the number of its staff to 150 from the original staffing target of 100 which has now been achieved. This is due to the fact that the Board of NAMA has decided that a larger number of debtors should be managed directly by the Agency rather than by the participating institutions. In particular, the Agency wishes to manage closely the performance of debtors with exposures of &euro;75m or more. This will mean that the largest 170 debtors will be managed directly by NAMA; their aggregate debt amounts to about &euro;58 billion, which is over 80% of the debt acquired by NAMA to date.  The 50% increase in staff is expected to have a corresponding impact on the salary costs originally budgeted for 2011 by NAMA and outlined in its Business Plan.</P>

The HSE is prepared to work closely with Jack &amp; Jill to ensure that no child is hospitalised for want of adequate home support, provided by Jack and Jill or the HSE. However, if a child needs hospital care, the HSE will provide this. The Health Service Executive will continue to fund Jack &amp; Jill in 2011 on the same basis as in 2010, subject to any overall resources limitations that may arise for all providers in the disability sector generally, but it is not in a position to provide additional funding for the Foundation to compensate for the drop in its private fund-raising income.</P>

	<P>In early November 2010 I announced that the Government had decided to approve a voluntary early retirement (VER) scheme and a voluntary redundancy (VR) scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes was to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.  </P>
        <P>The VER and VR schemes were open to employees in the management and administrative staff and general support staff categories. The exact grades covered by the two schemes were set out in detail in the relevant Circular (Circular 7/2010).  The schemes were not targeted at those providing front-line services.</P>
        <P>The most recent detailed information available from the HSE indicates that 2,003 individuals have departed from the health service under the schemes; 641 in respect of the voluntary early retirement scheme and 1,362 in respect of the voluntary redundancy scheme.  However, there may be minor adjustments to the numbers as outstanding queries are finalised.  Of the total, 1,409 were HSE employees while the balance (594) were employed in voluntary hospitals, disability organisations etc. 876 individuals employed in the HSE availed of the voluntary redundancy scheme.</P>
        <P>I understand from the most recent information from the HSE that the once off cost in 2010 of both schemes was in the region of &euro;100m and the likely savings are expected to be in the region of &euro;50m to &euro;70m annually.  The HSE is currently collating definitive information in relation to the costs of these schemes.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>

	<P>The entitlement of an individual to a Health Amendment (HAA) Card and services under the Health (Amendment) Act, l996 now rests with the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Chief Executive Officer is bound by the definition of eligibility inserted in the Health (Amendment) Act 2006 by section 6 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006, which requires a positive diagnostic test for applications received after the specified date of 20th June 2006.  </P>
        <P>In respect of persons who made an application before that date, the Chief Executive Officer is still obliged to satisfy himself that the applicant was infected with Hepatitis C.  In that regard, I have asked the HSE to take account of any relevant decision of the Hepatitis C &amp; HIV Compensation Tribunal on the basis that the Tribunal arrives at its decisions after careful consideration of expert testimony.</P>
        <P>I have given a great deal of consideration to the issue of women who have neither a positive test result nor a positive Tribunal decision in their favour and I am very sympathetic to the women in question.  While this cohort of women who have tested negative for Hepatitis C has had, and may continue to have, a variety of symptoms, there is no scientific proof that the symptoms are specific evidence of Hepatitis C infection.  Some symptoms of Hepatitis C, such as fatigue, fibromyalgia and depression are common conditions that occur in the general population. It is estimated that up to16,000 women were exposed to potentially infectious batches of Anti-D and approximately 1,000 of these people were infected with Hepatitis C.  I have to take into account the rationale which led to the clarification of eligibility requirements in 2006 and accordingly, I do not envisage a change in the current eligibility requirements.</P>
        <P>I should point out that the women in question are entitled to apply for a regular medical card.  Application forms for a medical card are available from the HSE&rsquo;s local health offices.  The HSE has discretion to award a regular medical card to a person whose income is over the financial guidelines, where the HSE decides that the financial burden of medical or other exceptional circumstances would cause undue hardship.</P>

	<P>Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located hospital projects at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St. James&rsquo;s, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project agreements have been signed and planning permission has been granted for the first four of these projects.  </P>
        <P>The Connolly and Tallaght Hospital projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process. The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  A core principle underlying the co-location initiative is that the private sector should bear all normal business risks. It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant <Col N="660"/>Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.   The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects. There is a requirement on each of the successful bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.     The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.</P>
        <P>My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the detailed operational information that he has sought.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 to 134, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="661"/>
        <P>The waiting times for patients attending emergency departments in many hospitals during the first week of January were unacceptable and I very much regret the delays that patients experienced.</P>
        <P>I met with the HSE this week to discuss the situation and to review its plans for ensuring that this situation does not recur.  The HSE has assured me that it will take all possible steps to improve waiting times in emergency departments, so that all patients are assessed, treated and discharged or admitted without unnecessary delay.</P>
        <P>The HSE has taken specific steps to cope with the increase in activity that is normally experienced at this time of year.  These include curtailing elective surgery and opening beds which are normally closed for seasonal reasons.  Other actions taken by hospitals include increasing the number of ward rounds to ensure that any patients who are ready to go home are discharged, with support as necessary from community-based services.</P>
        <P>Hospitals are also ensuring that discharges are carried out early in the morning and over the weekend to make beds available for patients being admitted through their emergency departments.  In addition, the HSE is working to have senior clinical decision makers and diagnostic services speedily available for emergency department needs.  The HSE has also provided for increased GP out-of-hours services through the expansion of the GP co-ops.</P>
        <P>The key to addressing the difficulties in emergency departments is to deal with the issue across the entire hospital.  I have asked the HSE to ensure that minimising waiting times for patient in emergency departments, and the use of trolleys, is accorded top priority.</P>

	<P>Under the Health Act 2007, statutory responsibility is given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for inspecting and registering categories of designated centre, including nursing homes for older people. Section 43 of the Act provides for the appointment by the Authority of persons known as Inspectors of Social Services, and referred to in the Act as &ldquo;inspectors&rdquo;, to assist the Chief Inspector in the performance of her functions. The 46 inspectors referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question were appointed in accordance with Section 26 of the Heath Act, 2007, as required under Section 43 of that Act.</P>
        <P>The academic qualifications and previous work experience of individuals of the 46 inspectors is broad and varied. The professional disciplines which these inspectors have come from include nursing/health professional, social work and environmental health.  The inspectors have numerous and broad ranging academic qualifications including diplomas and degrees with, for example, 21 inspectors holding masters degrees across a range of disciplines. Many of the academic programmes completed by inspectors have elements relating to the care and welfare of older people. Furthermore, all inspectors have successfully completed a comprehensive training programme in all areas relevant to the regulation and inspection of designated centres for older people.</P>
        <P>I am fully satisfied that the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Office of the Chief Inspector, including the officials and inspectors therein, are carrying out their legal functions and duties in accordance with the Health Act, 2007.</P>

	<P>The immediate and the ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) relating to accommodation, medical and social needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991. </P>
        <P>Where children are identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment contained in the Implementation Plan on the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009, the Health Service Executive has phased out the hostel type of care arrangement for separated children seeking asylum  with the two remaining hostels that provided accommodation to separated children closing  on 31 December 2010.  A new process has been put in place by the HSE, which aims to ensure that all newly arriving children under 12 years will be placed in a foster care placement.  Newly arrived children over the age of 12 years will be placed in one of the four intake residential units for up to at most four weeks, where a preliminary assessment of the child and their needs will be carried out by a social worker in conjunction with qualified residential social care staff.  This assessment will inform the most appropriate care option, and determine if the child will need additional supports/links.</P>
        <P>The HSE has developed a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.  The HSE appointed a senior manager with responsibility for managing these changes and developments on a full time basis.</P>
        <P>The number of unaccompanied children seeking asylum who were placed into the care of the HSE is a service matter and has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>Third-party motor insurance is required by law for the use of all mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place in this country.  Motor insurance is provided by private companies in an open and competitive market where consumer interests can exert influence by seeking quotes and comparing costs before purchasing.  Insurance companies are regulated by the Financial Regulator.</P><Col N="664"/>
        <P>Motor insurance companies in Ireland insure vehicle drivers rather than vehicles. This enables them to calculate the risks associated with specific drivers and thereby price the insurance premium accordingly.  The factors taken into account when calculating the risk include the age, gender and driving experience of the driver, the engine size of the vehicle and its usage, together with the address at which the vehicle is based.  This system also enables a specific driver to establish a no-claims status over a number of years.  It is always advisable for both mature and young drivers to shop around and take advantage of the competition within the market when seeking new insurance or renewing an existing policy.</P>
        <P>Ireland recognises driving licences from a number of other jurisdictions and allows for them to be exchanged for Irish licences.  Unfortunately, this does not include licences from the United States, as the multiplicity of licensing criteria in the different American States would make that impracticable.  However, last year I introduced the Road Traffic (Licensing of Learner Drivers)(Certificates of Competency)(Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 509 of 2010), which removed from foreign licence holders the requirement to wait six months from receiving a learner&rsquo;s permit before they apply for a certificate of competency.</P>
        <P>I have no proposals to amend the policy on these matters and it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in issues relating to specific quotations for individual motor insurance policies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The information requested by the Deputy is set out in Tables 1 and 2.  Table 1 lists the appointments I have made to State boards and bodies in the period from 22 November 2010 to date.  The fees payable to board members are determined by the Government and are published in the annual accounts of the bodies concerned.  In some cases, board members have voluntarily declined to accept fee payments.  I made those appointments on the basis of appointees having the necessary skills, competencies and experience to contribute effectively to the work of the boards.</P>
        <P>Table 2 provides details of the existing and anticipated vacancies in the period ending 24 March 2011.  I will give due consideration to filling any particular vacancy as and when that vacancy arises and taking account of the particular circumstances prevailing at the time.  The Advisory Council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation has been dissolved as the Commission for Taxi Regulation has been subsumed into the National Transport Authority.  A new Advisory Council will be established but I am not yet in a position to give a timeframe.</P>

	<P>As stated in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question No. 1101 of 29 September 2010, a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person concerned was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in April 2008.</P><Col N="668"/>
        <P>The application is being processed in the normal way with a view to establishing whether the applicants meet the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision in due course.</P>

        <P>Arising from the refusal of her IBC/05 renewal application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the first named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 23 June 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the first named person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the first named person concerned.</P>
        <P>The second named person concerned, the son of the first named person concerned, arrived in the State in January 2005 and has remained in that State without permission since that date.  In accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), he was informed, by letter dated 10 December 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him.</P>
        <P>Representations have been received on his behalf and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the second named person concerned.</P>
        <P>I should also remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>As stated previously in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s previous PQ No. 150 of 25 November 2010, the information contained in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question does not tally with the information contained in the file of the person concerned.  Specifically, my Department&rsquo;s records show that the person concerned had her first interaction with my Department on the date she lodged her asylum application i.e. on 26 August 2008.  She did, however, claim on that occasion to have arrived in this State on 10 January 2005, however, no documentary evidence has been produced that would support that contention.</P>
        <P>In any event, the person concerned applied for asylum on 26 August 2008 and, in accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), she was entitled to remain in the State until her application for asylum was decided.  Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 10 February 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).</P>
        <P>The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and this application will be considered first.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that all cases are considered on their individual merits and this will also apply in the case referred to by the Deputy.  Equally, as stated already, all representations submitted for consideration will be carefully considered before a final decision is taken.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States remains an important priority for this Government.  The Government is also committed to working with our friends in Congress to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral visa arrangements with the US through the establishment of a two year renewable E-3 visa facility.  My Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, has continued to work proactively on the issue with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, including since the Congressional elections held on 2 November.  </P>
        <P>The Government is encouraged by President Obama&rsquo;s continued commitment to resolving this issue &mdash; a view he earlier shared when the Taoiseach and I met him in Washington in March of last year. President Obama has since reiterated that commitment on a number of occasions.  However, the outcome of the Congressional elections on 2 November presents significant new political challenges for immigration reform legislation.  The failure of efforts to pass the limited DREAM Bill at the end of 2010 highlights the difficulties involved in passing any immigration legislation in the period ahead.</P>
        <P>Senior officials of my Department had talks in Washington in late November, on the issue of Irish immigration to the US.  They discussed the issue of the undocumented, the conditions <Col N="677"/>in which Irish citizens are held prior to deportation, the operation of the existing working holiday visa programmes and possibilities for the political agreement on the immigration issues following the 2 November elections in the US.  The membership of the relevant congressional committees is being finalised and President Obama will make his State of the Union address on January 25th, when the administration&rsquo;s policy priorities are expected to be also outlined.  Our Embassy in Washington is meeting with newly appointed officials and senior members of the relevant congressional committees on matters related to the undocumented and the E-3 type visa.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead.  Since 2006, the Government has provided a total support of $325,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and in September of this year, I met with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres and the Irish Lobby for Immigration reform to discuss the prospects for reform.  I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation.  I would urge anybody who might be tempted to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of their plight.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no record of a valid redundancy claim on the Redundancy Payments System in respect of the individual in question.  It is normal practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.

	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the average waiting time for an appeal dealt with by way of a summary decision is 27.4 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing is 45.6 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</P><Col N="679"/>
        <P>In addition to the provision of extra staff, more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.

A project to improve the business processes in the office was also undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.  As a result of all of these initiatives, a total of 17,499 appeals were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2010 in comparison to 10,027 for 2009.

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Pensions Framework which the Government published in March 2010 aims to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.  Pension coverage is a key element in the delivery of an adequate pension in retirement.  The State pension is the fundamental basis for our pension system.  The Government will seek to maintain the value of the State pension at 35 per cent of average <Col N="680"/>earnings.  In addition, the State will also continue to promote private pensions by supporting people, through the tax system, to take charge of their own retirement needs.  </P>
        <P>At present only 50% of workers have a private pension, with low levels of coverage among those on moderate to middle incomes a particular concern.  While the State pension is expected to provide sufficient income for the lowest paid workers, most people will have a significant gap if they do not have extra private pension provision.  I must also stress that good pensions cost money so it is important that the level of contributions made by individuals to their pension plan is sufficient to provide the level of income they desire in retirement.</P>
        <P>Inertia and procrastination are among the main reasons why many people do not take out private pensions.  A key element of the Framework is the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system which provides a way of overcoming this problem.  Employees, aged 22 or over, earning above a certain income threshold will be automatically enrolled into this new scheme, with the employee, their employer and the State all making contributions.  Those employees already in a more favourable occupational pension scheme will not be enrolled.  For those who are included in the scheme, contributions will only be paid on earnings above a certain minimum level and below a certain maximum.  The level of these thresholds will be decided closer to the implementation date and they will be set in such a way as to ensure that the scheme focuses on those on low and middle incomes.</P>
        <P>An implementation group chaired by my Department, was established in May 2010 to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms announced in the Framework into operation.  The implementation phase is expected to take three to five years.  The implementation group is cognisant of the current and emerging economic conditions and will conduct extensive consultation on the many aspects of the framework before presenting final options to Government for decision.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2011, includes provisions which will facilitate the introduction in 2011 of a Partial Capacity Benefit scheme. </P>
        <P>The scheme will provide an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive an income support payment.  It recognises that the current structure of the welfare system, which categorises people only as &lsquo;fit to work&rsquo; or &lsquo;unfit to work&rsquo;, does not reflect the reality for many existing welfare customers.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be open to people who are in receipt of Invalidity Pension (IP) or who have been in receipt of Illness Benefit (IB) for a minimum of six months.  Participation in the scheme will be voluntary and the scheme is designed in particular to respond to the needs of people who currently seek to avail of &lsquo;exemptions&rsquo; in order to take up employment opportunities.   The limitations on hours worked which apply under the existing &lsquo;exemptions&rsquo; arrangements will not apply to the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the legislation and the forthcoming consequent regulations, it is envisaged that IP and IB customers who wish to avail of employment opportunities will be required to undertake a partial capacity assessment by a Medical Assessor.  On the basis of this assessment of their employment capacity, their personal-rate payment may be adjusted.  Any reduction in payment rates will be applied to the personal rate only and increases paid in respect of qualified adults and/or children will not be affected.</P>
        <P>Prior to the commencement of the scheme, it will be necessary to introduce Regulations to provide for a number of aspects of the scheme, including the specific manner in which partial capacity will be determined.  In addition, it will be necessary to provide training to the Department&rsquo;s Medical Assessors in order to ensure the consistent application of these Regulations.  Other operational measures, notably in relation to the development of the necessary Information Technology systems to cater for the scheme as well as the preparation of guidelines, are also now being addressed by the Department, with a view to introducing the scheme at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>The provision and maintenance of public lighting is the responsibility of local authorities.  Prior to January 2010, ESB Contracts Ltd carried out the maintenance of such lighting on behalf of the generality of local authorities.  Following a public procurement process Airtricity acquired this business from that date.  However, as a transitional arrangement local authorities entered into a one year contract with the new service provider, while exploring the full range of options for the maintenance of public lighting.  It is understood that at present most local authorities remain in contract with the aforementioned service provider, while some others are pursuing alternative arrangements. In the meantime, my Department is continuing to liaise with the County/City Managers Association in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>A Commission on the Private Rented Sector was established by my Department in July 1999 to examine the working of the landlord and tenant relationship in respect of residential tenancies in the private rented sector and to make such recommendations, including changes to the law, as the Commission considered proper in order to:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />improve the security of tenure of tenants in the occupation of their dwellings,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />maintain a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />increase investment in, and the supply of, residential accommodation for renting, including the removal of any identified constraints to the development of the sector.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">The Commission reported in July 2000 and a majority of its recommendations, including that a statutory Board to be called the Private Residential Tenancies Board be established to deal with, inter alia, disputes between residential tenants and landlords, was ultimately accepted and given statutory effect by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The PRTB has been formally established since September 2004, and its principal functions are in the areas of:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The registration of private rental tenancies;</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private rental sector.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Board is an independent statutory body I have no function in its operational matters. However, dispute resolution statistics are published as part of the annual report of the PRTB and are available on their website at www.prtb.ie  . While those statistics indicate an ongoing improvement in case processing times it is acknowledged that, partly as a consequence of the Board&rsquo;s success in ensuring registration compliance, and the resulting large workloads arising, processing times for dispute resolution are not yet optimal.</P>
        <P>In November 2009, I announced the key outcomes of a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which I had initiated in order to consider whether the Act best supported the PRTB&rsquo;s key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.  These outcomes have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act, reducing delays and achieving additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of its functions. Full details in relation to the background to the review, the associated terms of reference and the outcomes of the review are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at www.environ.ie  .  An especially salient outcome is the recommendation that a statutory objective of 6 months be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications.</P>
        <P>I am of the view that, while further operational efficiencies can still be achieved, the PRTB provides an inexpensive route to dispute resolution for parties to private residential tenancies and I do not believe that this process could be dealt with more speedily by any other forum.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the General Scheme of the Bill setting out the detailed proposals arising in the context of the review of the Act will be submitted to Government early this year. Publication of the Bill thereafter will depend on the time subsequently required for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>
        <P>It is intended that the Scheme of the Bill will address the non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy. The payment of rent to the landlord as provided for under the tenancy concerned on the date it falls due for payment is a critical obligation of all tenants.</P>

        <P>Under the rationalisation of State Agencies the NBA is due to be wound up over the course of 2011.  A new Housing Agency, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency <Col N="689"/>(established on an administrative basis last year), will require statutory underpinning.  The primary legislation establishing that Agency will also facilitate the closure of the NBA. The Board is an interim Board and has been appointed to oversee the parallel tasks of the closure of the NBA and establishing the new Agency. The interim board is made up of 8 members, 4 of whom have been reappointed from the previous NBA Board.  The 4 new appointments consist of 2 Civil Servants, a local authority official and 1 other.  The previous NBA Board had 12 members, 9 of whom were paid fees.  Under the new arrangements, only 3 appointees are in receipt of fees.  All of the appointments were made on 30 November 2010 and are effective from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.</P>

Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State &mdash; in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court <Col N="691"/>are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</P>

	<P>Local authority annual rates on valuation (ARVs) are adopted as part of the annual budgetary process of local authorities.  Local authorities are required by regulation to hold their annual budget meeting within a prescribed period.  The prescribed period for County Councils ends on 13 January and for City, Borough and rating Town Councils on 15 January.  As the annual budgetary process is still underway, my Department does not yet have information from all local authorities on the annual rates on valuation for 2011.</P>
        <P>As of 12 January 2011, my Department had received copies of 12 adopted budgets containing ARVs in respect of 2011.  This information is set out in table 1.</P>
        <P>The 34 county and city councils are responsible for setting charges for water and waste-water services and are not required to notify my Department of the charges that they set.  However, my Department collects information periodically on the level of charges. Again, as the annual budgetary process has not yet been completed in respect of 2011, I do not have information in respect of water charges for this year. The information regarding the charge per cubic metre (equivalent to 1,000 litres) for water services set by local authorities for 2010 is set out in table 2.</P>

	<P>An application under 2010 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2010.  The 50% advance payment, under the Single Payment Scheme which issued on 18 October 2010, was on the basis of the land cleared at that stage, as lands declared required digitising.</P>
        <P>Balancing payments under the scheme, which commenced 1 December, would, in normal circumstances, be confined to those whose applications are fully processed, specifically, where all digitising is finalised. However, following consultation with the EU Commission, agreement was reached whereby, in addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the digitised land confirmed otherwise eligible.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to say that, because of this change, many farmers, including the person named, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, have received an interim balancing payment.</P>
        <P>The outstanding digitising of the land parcels in question has recently been finalised, which will allow the file of the person named be further processed, with a view to the outstanding balancing payments issuing shortly, under both the Single Payment Scheme and REPS.</P>

        <P>This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility inspection. During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection a discrepancy was found with parcel P11922092 requiring amendments to the boundary. The claimed area for the Single Payment Scheme of 21.12ha was reduced to 20.04ha. When tolerance was taken into account this area was decreased to 20.02ha. As the total entitlements held are 21.12 and the difference between the area claimed and the area found is under 3% and under 2ha the area put forward for payment is 20.02ha.</P>

	<P>The Government has recently approved the drafting of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2010.  The Bill proposes to amend, consolidate and update legislation in the area of animal health and welfare, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals and to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals is properly protected. In addition the new Bill proposes to increase both the powers of authorised officers and the level of penalties to be imposed with fines being proportionate to the offence. There will also be provisions for powers of intervention where an animal is deemed to be at risk of being welfare compromised and the Bill will also address such issues as the prevention of unnecessary suffering of animals and abandonment of animals.</P>
        <P>The Heads of the Bill have been submitted for drafting to the Office of the Parliamentary Council.</P>

        <P>The backlog in the processing of new and renewal licence applications largely arises because the majority of areas for which the licences are sought are designated Special Areas of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and/or Special Protection Areas under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 sites).</P>
        <P>In the case of aquaculture sites located within Natura 2000 areas the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in conjunction with the Marine Institute and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is engaged in a comprehensive programme to gather the necessary baseline data appropriate to the conservation objectives of these areas.  This process is ongoing and significant progress has been made.  This comprehensive data collection programme, together with the setting of appropriate conservation objectives by the NPWS, will enable all new, renewal and review applications to be appropriately assessed for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives.  This work represents a significant financial, administrative and scientific investment by the State in resolving this issue.  The Appropriate Assessment of aquaculture applications will be dealt with on a bay-by-bay basis.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year I launched the three-year, &euro;54 million Grassland Sheep Scheme, availing of the unused Single Payment funds. During the CAP Health Check negotiations, I had as one of my high priorities getting access to these CAP funds and, immediately it became clear this had been achieved, I identified the sheep sector as one that was vulnerable and in need of specific supports.  I am confident that this Scheme, which focuses on those flocks with breeding ewes, will maintain the breeding flock and will act as a real incentive to farmers anxious to maintain their production levels, which are essential for the future of a viable sheep industry in this country<i>.</i></P>
        <P>The supply of lambs is a key and fundamental element underpinning the sheep and lamb processing industry.  This is a hugely valuable export-orientated part of the Irish agri-food sector, supplying a high-value product to consumer markets throughout Europe.  The industry is worth around &euro;250 million to the Irish economy and over two thirds of the product is exported. Irish sheep farmers are facing significant production and demand pressures at present, though Ireland is not alone in this regard.  To maintain a viable industry, we must arrest the decline in reducing flock numbers, income pressures and producers leaving the sector.  I believe that this Grassland Sheep Scheme will achieve these aims and will provide a much needed and very valuable income support to an important and vulnerable sector<i>.</i></P><Col N="698"/>
        <P>While it had been my intention that payments under the Scheme would commence in early December, as the EU Commission raised some technical questions regarding payments to sheep farmers under EU Pillar 1 and Pillar 11 Schemes, including the Grassland Sheep Scheme, it has not yet been possible to do so. My officials have responded in detail to the Commission and there are ongoing discussions between both parties. I am seeking an early conclusion to these discussions, with the intention of payments under the Scheme issuing as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

	<P>An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named (Kilkenny herd-owner) on 20 April 2010. During processing of the application, one land parcel was found to be dual-claimed with another Scheme applicant and, following correspondence, the person named confirmed that he was not entitled to declare this parcel. Consequently, the parcel was rejected and the appropriate reduction penalty applied, as per the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme. The balancing payment, which issued on 1 December, was calculated on this basis.</P>

	<P>I assume the question relates specifically to amending the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; under the Industrial Relations Act 1990.</P>
        <P>Access to the employment dispute settling bodies under the Industrial Relations Acts is governed by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in Section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Workers not included within this definition are normally covered by separate schemes of Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>
        <P>Section 23(1)(e) of the 1990 Act excludes, inter alia, &ldquo;an officer of a vocational education committee&rdquo; from this definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo;. Arising from an agreement between management and union sides to abolish the existing Conciliation and Arbitration machinery for vocational educational committee officers and to bring them within the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is proposed to amend the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; to include such officers, with the exception of teachers, within the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Act.  An amendment to this effect is included in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The question of an amendment to the Industrial Relations Acts to provide for the inclusion of persons employed in the civil service in the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; may arise in future in the context of ongoing discussions between civil service management and unions in relation to possible changes in arrangements under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme. These discussions would be a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>In common with all areas of the public service, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will operate with reduced funding for 2011. The gross 2011 Estimate for Defence and Army Pensions combined is &euro;933m, an overall reduction of 4% on the 2010 Estimate. Defence spending at &euro;725m, including capital, will be reduced by &euro;30m or 4%.    The administrative efficiencies of &euro;3m in 2011, as outlined in Budget 2011, will be achieved chiefly through reduced employee numbers and related costs. </P>

	<P Just="Left">There is currently a total of 732 civilian employees. It is anticipated that there will be 700 civilian employees by the end of this year with estimated savings of &euro;700,000 accruing in 2011 as a result of the reduction in employee numbers. Civilian employees are based at various military installations in every Brigade area.</P>

	<P>In common with all areas of the public service, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will operate with reduced funding for 2011. The gross 2011 Estimate for Defence and Army Pensions combined is &euro;933m, an overall reduction of 4% on the 2010 Estimate. Defence spending at &euro;725m, including capital, will be reduced by &euro;30m or 4%.    The cost of overseas allowances in a given year is principally a factor of the number of personnel serving overseas and the time spent overseas. In this regard, while there was a significant reduction in participation in overseas peacekeeping in 2010, and thus in the expenditure on overseas allowances, this was driven mainly by the unexpected withdrawal from Chad.  </P>
        <P>On 14 December 2010 the Government approved the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces, as part of a joint Finnish/Irish battalion to UNIFIL. Discussions will commence with the UN and with Finland on finalising the composition of the contingent and the deployment schedule.  Thereafter, D&aacute;il approval will be sought for the mission. This will complete the Triple Lock mechanism of UN, Government and D&aacute;il approval before deploying members of the Defence Forces overseas.</P>
        <P>The overall provision in Subhead C of the Defence Vote, which provides for Permanent Defence Force allowances, including overseas allowances, has been reduced to &euro;43.6m in 2011. There will be sufficient funds in the Defence Budget to meet the cost of the proposed deployment to Lebanon in 2011 and the cost of existing overseas missions.</P>
        <P>Ireland is currently contributing 128 Defence Forces personnel to 11 different missions throughout the world.  The main overseas mission in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed is the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina with 43 personnel. Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be drawn down this year as the mission continues to transition to a training and support mission. Once deployment to UNIFIL takes place it is expected that the total overseas deployment at that stage will amount to just over 500. This is a very significant contribution in the context of the reduced resources available and reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to international peacekeeping and to the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Apart from the proposed deployment to Lebanon, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time and there are no such requests on hand.  </P>

	<P>There is no provision in Defence Force Regulations that entitles members of the Defence Forces to spectacles if required. However there is a provision in General Routine Order 43/1955 which allows for one pair of spectacles to be issued free to any non-commissioned officer or private of the Defence Forces who suffers from defective vision subject to certain conditions.</P>
