	<P Just="Left">The decision of the Government to close the embassy to the Holy See is, I believe, a mistake.  It is a wrong choice diplomatically, politically and economically and it certainly will not add to Ireland&rsquo;s position in the world.  The saving involved could have been found quite easily by making other adjustments within the &euro;150 million overhead Vote of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste himself said that this decision was taken because the Vatican or the Holy See has no economic importance.  When has Ireland decided that issues such as human rights, Third World aid, freedom of religion, the environment, disarmament or democracy, are no longer important and that everything is just a matter of economic gain?  It is interesting to note that in taking this decision, the T&aacute;naiste is going against what is happening in other countries.  Britain, Australia and Russia, have all chosen to upgrade their diplomatic missions to the Holy See while we are deciding to take away the resident ambassador.</P>
        <P>The Vatican is a major player in world diplomacy.  The T&aacute;naiste said last July that the Holy See has one of the largest diplomatic corps in the world, making the Vatican an important listening post and crossroads on a range of global, social, political and international issues of interest to Ireland.  What has changed in the meantime to change the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s opinion?  It adds nothing to our international reputation to be closing down missions when what we could be doing, as did the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessors, is ensuring that efficiencies are made in other ways.</P><Col N="2"/>
        <P>Is it the Government&rsquo;s intention to reverse the decision regarding the Vatican and the other two missions involved and to find savings within the Department&rsquo;s Vote in other ways?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I also said at that time and throughout the summer that the Government has been conducting a comprehensive review of expenditure across all Departments.  As part of this exercise, I reviewed the diplomatic service and the diplomatic missions and I decided to recommend the closure of three resident missions and the Government agreed to this recommendation.  These are the missions in the Holy See, in Teheran and in Timor Leste.  I regret it is necessary to close any missions and I would hope that in the course of time, as the country recovers, that we will be able to return to the question of whether we should have resident embassies in those locations.  However, at this time, it is not the Government&rsquo;s intention to reverse the decision and that decision will stand.</P>
        <P>This country will continue to have diplomatic relations with the Holy See.  We intend to appoint an ambassador to the Holy See who will be a senior diplomat located in Dublin and who will service the Holy See directly from Dublin.  In respect of the other two missions, it is our intention to accredit an ambassador in a neighbouring country to Teheran and to have the ambassador in Singapore service Timor Leste.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste say exactly how much money will be saved by the withdrawal of the resident ambassador to the Holy See?  Were there no other options to make what in total is a savings of approximately &euro;1 million &mdash; &euro;1.2 million &mdash; out of &euro;150 million spent in overheads in the Department?  Will the T&aacute;naiste not agree that the &euro;500 million expenditure on Irish Aid is very important and that much of this funding goes to sub-Saharan Africa, where the church, for example, is involved in 25% of the health care providers and where 12 million young children attend church schools?  In that connection, does he not agree that our contribution to Irish Aid is very important?  Does he not believe that a connection with an organisation that has 1.3 billion people or 17% of the population of the world as adherents, which has 220,000 parishes throughout the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is an important place for us to be in terms of the issues I have raised such as human rights, disarmament, the environment, etc?</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste not find it extraordinary that we have managed to fund this residency over all the years when we were a much poorer country and that he has to make this decision now?  I do not believe it was made for money reasons because I do not believe he could not have found the money elsewhere within the Vote.</P>

	<P>Did Opus Dei prepare the question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The total savings are in the order of &euro;1.2 million.  I acknowledge and I agree with the Deputy that it is important to maintain diplomatic relations with the Holy See&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and diplomatic relations are being maintained with the Holy See.</P>
        <P>I also agree with the Deputy that it is important to respect the position of the Catholic Church in this State and that is the reason when the Government made the decision to close the embassy in the Holy See, I communicated that decision personally and immediately to both Cardinal Brady and Archbishop Martin.  I agree that on issues of human rights and the envir<Col N="3"/>onment and a whole range of areas it is important for this country to be actively involved.  This is why we will continue our engagement in the multilateral organisations which are established by the United Nations and other bodies for the conduct of those matters.  We will work with the Holy See through those agencies.</P>
        <P>Similarly, our aid programme is not channelled through the Holy See or any other state but is channelled in a bilateral way by the State and, in a number of cases, through multilateral agencies.  That is why, in our review of the embassies, we believed it important to maintain our embassy network, especially in those countries in which we have a significant aid programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Later today the Government is set to announce the slashing of a further 14,500 staff from the public service.  Has the T&aacute;naiste, or the Government, given any consideration to the impact these cuts will have on frontline services which, as we speak, are already under immense pressure?  Has the T&aacute;naiste considered that his agenda, rather than delivering public service reform, will create a public service slum in this State?</P>
        <P>When the T&aacute;naiste came into office he pledged that the choices his Government would make would be fair.  What we have seen is, on the one hand, 14,500 jobs to go, adding to the 450,000 people on the dole and, on the other hand, another senior civil servant about to walk away with a pension of &euro;114,000 and a lump sum of &euro;204,000.  Where is the fairness in that?</P>
        <P>We have already seen the scandal in which more than &euro;8 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money goes to the pensions of former Ministers, many of whom, such as the former leader of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party, Dick Spring, are still in employment.  We see the cronyism of the last Government continue.  Twenty people with affiliations to Fine Gael or the Labour Party have been appointed to State boards since the Government took office.  Five of the six judges appointed by Government on the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s watch have political affiliations to Fine Gael or the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Not to yours, anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>At the same time, the Government refuses to call for accountability at the very highest levels of the Civil Service and insists in continuing with the appointment of the outgoing Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Kevin Cardiff, to the European Court of Auditors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s party has gone so far as to ask one of its elected officials to be silent in her criticism of that matter.  How does the T&aacute;naiste square that circle?  Public service reform is not about slashing numbers in the service.  More important, what has the T&aacute;naiste to say to citizens who rely on public services and who do not, at this time, receive the services they require?  What will the slashing of further resources from those services mean for them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McDonald asked whether the Government had considered the impact of the reforms to frontline services which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, will announce today.  Yes, we have.</P>
        <P>Her second question asked how we could square that circle.  I will tell her how.  This Government believes in public services.  We need good, efficient and well-run public services in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why we are undertaking to reform our public services.  Those reforms will be announced later today by the Minister.  They will involve a reduction in the number of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why it is so wrong for the Deputy to come to this House and name individual public servants who do not have the opportunity or the privilege she has of responding to those allegations.</P>

	<P>Heads down, now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That shows disrespect for our civil servants and I ask the Deputy to desist from doing this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Do you want to talk about it among yourselves?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, believe in public services and have the utmost respect for public servants.  I also believe in the accountability of public services and the Civil Service at the highest leadership levels.  I put the matter of his proposed appointment to the European Court of Auditors directly to the outgoing Secretary General from the Department of Finance, and he answered my question although the answers were not very convincing.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste cannot run away from the issue of high-level accountability if he is serious about reform.  That is a fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>You would not know much about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It might fit the T&aacute;naiste better to demonstrate respect to the ordinary citizens of this State who rely on public services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have a question, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Those public services require to be staffed adequately.  The T&aacute;naiste told me he has considered the consequences of the loss of a further 14,500 jobs.  Those consequences will be diminished services that may be less efficient and may cause more hardship for citizens.  How can a quality service be delivered to our people when there is to be such an exodus from the service?  The Government&rsquo;s mantra has been &ldquo;doing more with less&rdquo; but if there are not adequate staffing levels it cannot deliver the service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>In the first place, there will be an adequate staffing level.  I reiterate, the quality of the service to be delivered to the public has been at the centre of decisions on re-organisation and reform of our public services made by the Government and which will be announced later.</P>
        <P>I do not believe that even Deputy McDonald would argue there is no need to reform our public services, in part for the reasons she stated.  We need to have a more efficient public <Col N="5"/>service that delivers value for money and has accountability.  We need change.  Public services and the demands of the public for services change over time.  There comes a time, therefore, when it is necessary to change the way in which public services are delivered and to change the institutional arrangements provided for them, along with the number and nature of the agencies in place for providing public services.  All of that forms part of the package of reforms  the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will announce later today.  That is being done so that we can deliver better and more cost effective services to our public.</P>
        <P>We also need accountability.  We will have a considerably improved accountability.  I reiterate, we must respect our public servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>We do respect them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Our public servants do a good job.  They have been the subject of ballyragging for far too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste remember when he used to sit over there?  Is that memory obliterated for him?  Unbelievable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;sometimes in the media.  The Deputy cannot point to a single occasion during the time I sat on those benches when I attacked public servants,  individually or generally.  I respect public servants and the work they do.  Members of this House should also show that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Walking away with a big pension is a rare form of ballyragging.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>What we need is a better, more efficient and focused public service and that is the nature of the reforms the Minister will announce today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the very important issue of intercountry adoption and the urgent need for our Government to improve the situation, in particular as it relates to Ethiopia.  Before I get into the detail of my questions, I would like to commend and thank all of our adoptive parents for their supportive and valuable contributions to the lives of children.  In particular, I thank the 300 Irish families that are dealing with the specific matter I am raising this morning.  Will the T&aacute;naiste, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, support intercountry adoptive parents?  I refer particularly to the 300 families I have mentioned but also to other potential adoptive parents.  The T&aacute;naiste is probably aware that there are 5 million orphans in Ethiopia, which has a huge population of 80 million.  Just 3,031 Ethiopian orphans are involved in intercountry adoptions.  The direct connection with Ireland is that 300 of them are being adopted by Irish families.  Will the T&aacute;naiste support these families as a matter of priority?  Will he revisit and implement further the Hague Convention on the protection of children?  Will he push the issue at Government level?  Will he take steps to ensure the adoption authority is authorised to commence negotiations with the Ethiopian authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is that I am working with adoptive parents and families that are seeking to adopt children through the intercountry adoption method.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I have been working on this matter for some time.  In the course of my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I regularly raise this subject with the authorities from other countries where this issue arises.  When I recently visited Russia, for example, I discussed the difficulties that are arising with regard to intercountry adoptions from Russia with the foreign minister there.  We will pursue the Ethiopian issue that <Col N="6"/>the Deputy has raised.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, has been pursuing the issue of intercountry adoptions with African countries.  We will pursue the issue.  As Deputy McGrath is aware, complex issues arise in some of these cases.  The legislation and the regulations that apply here in relation to adoption and child custody can sometimes be quite different from those in the countries from which these children are being adopted.  Difficulties and delays can arise when efforts are being made to square that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his response and for the work that is being done with Russia.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to further develop Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with Ethiopia.  We have a long history of connections with that country, including adoptive connections over the past 20 years.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that Irish people who were approved for adoption prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act 2010 are continuing to effect Ethiopian adoptions that are carried out to the Hague standards?  In other words, the children involved in these adoptions are very safe.  People in countries like the USA and Sweden are continuing to adopt from Ethiopia.  Why can Ireland not assist these families?  I take the point that complex issues arise in this context.  The USA and Sweden are getting on with the job of resolving these complex child safety issues.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware that there has never been any controversy surrounding Ethiopian adoptions?  Can he verify, as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, that parents will not be in a position to adopt a second child if we do not act over the next few months?  I ask the T&aacute;naiste not to close the door to adoption from Ethiopia.  These families are very concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the adoption arrangements have to comply with the Hague Convention.  The arrangements that apply in individual countries have to be consistent with the Hague conditions and arrangements.  I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by adoptive parents.  I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I, as well as our respective Departments, will work to resolve these difficulties.</P>

	<P>More than 60,000 people work in the community and voluntary sector and they do great work in their local communities.  However, they have a problem.  Last week I met representatives of the Meath community forum and they told me that the cost of doing audits every year is eating into their limited funds.  I understand the companies Bill will be brought forward and that there will be provisions in it to deal with the issue of audit requirements.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect to see the Bill in the House and will it include issues in regard to audit requirements for voluntary companies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The companies Bill is a major piece of legislation and of consolidation work.  I think there are approximately 1,200 heads for that Bill.  The expectation is that it will be <Col N="10"/>brought forward around the middle of next year.  I agree with Deputy Hannigan about the excellent work being done by the 60,000 people who work in the community and voluntary sector.  I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to look at that issue.</P>

	<P>Yesterday a press release slipped out of the Department of Finance extending the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme which, to most people and Members, is the bank guarantee scheme.  Will there be an opportunity for the Labour Party Deputies, in particular, to discuss this measure over the coming weeks as it was a very significant announcement by the Government but which was made by way of press release?  Could we have a debate over the coming weeks to discuss the bank guarantee scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>Currently, 200,000 people in this State are working for wages of approximately &euro;18,000 per annum and have been doing so for the past six months without a legislative floor to prevent downward pressure on their wages and the rates.  We have been promised replacement legislation for the joint labour committees for the past number of months.  Given that the passage of my legislation through the committee process has slowed on the promise of this new legislation, will the T&aacute;naiste tell us when it will be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is very conscious of the extent to which 200,000 employees in the State are legally exposed as a result of the decision of the High Court to strike down the system of joint labour committees and the employment regulation orders that previously governed their wages.  That is why the Government has decided to bring in legislation to provide the legal protection those workers need.  That legislation is being prepared as a matter of priority and it is hoped it will be published this session.</P>

	<P>What is the extent of progress on the preparation of the European Communities (amendment) Bill to amend the 1972 European Communities Act, the education and training boards Bill and the planning and development (foreshore) Bill, all of which are of general importance and will have a considerable impact?</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Communities (amendment) Bill is being prepared in my Department and I hope to have it brought forward before the end of this year.

	<P>We are all aware that the social welfare safety net in this country is under huge strain at the moment.  One of the holes in the net is an idiosyncracy whereby self-employed people get either very little or nothing when they lose their jobs or their companies close.  Like other Deputies, I have constituents in Wicklow and east Carlow whose businesses have folded but who are getting nothing from the State.  They do not get the dole or what PAYE workers get and they are struggling to find money to buy food for their children.  They are in an extraordinarily vulnerable situation.  Does the Government intend to address this in the upcoming finance Bill or social welfare Bill?  If it is in the social welfare Bill, when might we expect to see it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is more appropriate to a parliamentary question.  Is there promised legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social Protection has a commission which is examining a range of issues, including that raised by the Deputy.  I am not sure when it is due to report but a programme of reform has been undertaken by the Minister and this matter is part of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, legislation has been introduced in the other House to deal with the problems faced by sub-contractors who have failed to be paid for work in several important State contracts, etc, which is, in turn, causing great hardship to families across the country.  What assurances can the T&aacute;naiste give us that the legislation will be introduced in the House this term?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, is working on the legislation in question.  My understanding is he wants to introduce it in the House this side of Christmas, if possible.  It must be borne in mind, however, that there are scheduling issues between now and Christmas because of the budget and legislation which will arise from it.</P>

    <Title>Review of Serious Incidents including Deaths of Children in Care: Statements</Title>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>In January 2010, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, published Guidance for the HSE for the Review of Serious Incidents including Deaths of Children in Care.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the HIQA guidance, last year, the Health Service Executive, HSE, established a national review panel to undertake these reviews.  Dr. Helen Buckley, senior lecturer and research fellow at the school of social work and social policy in Trinity College Dublin, was appointed as chair.  There are 20 ordinary members on the panel, 18 of whom are external to the HSE.</P>
        <P>While the national review panel has been established under the auspices of the HSE, it remains, and this is important, functionally independent, making findings of fact and producing reports that are objective and independent of the HSE.</P>
        <P>On 18 October, the HSE published the 2010 annual report and on the same day the HSE also published six individual panel reviews of deaths and serious incidents involving children.  I thank Dr. Buckley and all who have been involved in these reports.</P>
        <P>The annual report we are discussing covers March through December of last year, 2010.  During the period from March to December 2010, 30 cases were referred to the panel by the HSE.  These comprise 22 deaths and eight serious incidents.  Of the 22 deaths, six of the people concerned died from natural causes; four died from drug overdose; four died as a result of suicide; four died in road traffic accidents; two died in homicides; and two died in accidents other than road traffic accidents.</P>
        <P>The annual report notes that two of the 30 deaths related to children in care at the time of the incident.  Cases known to the child protection service, but not involving care, accounted for a majority of notifications.</P>
        <P>The annual report comments that the criteria set out by the HIQA are &ldquo;broad by international standards&rdquo;.  In England serious case reviews are undertaken in the form of local inquiries into the death or serious injury of a child where abuse or neglect is known or suspected to be a factor.  In Northern Ireland cases are considered for review where abuse, including sexual abuse, or neglect is a factor.  The report comments that, in Ireland, all accidental deaths and deaths by natural causes, as well as serious incidents, must be reviewed even where there is no suggestion of parental or professional wrong-doing.</P>
        <P>In addition to the annual report, the HSE also published six individual review reports concerning four deaths and two serious incidents involving young people.  Three deaths were by natural causes and one was following an accident.  The two serious incidents also concerned accidents.  None of the subjects of the reports was in care at the time of the incident, however, one of the accident victims, who was over 18 years of age, was still living with foster parents at the time.  All were known to the HSE child protection services.</P>
        <P>In summary, of the reviews presented, in no case was an action or inaction on the part of the HSE child and family services found to be directly linked to the incident or death of a child.  In a number of cases, good practice, in sometimes difficult circumstances, is particularly remarked on.</P>
        <P>The death of every child is a tragedy and I offer every sympathy to the families whose children were reported upon by this review panel.  The publication of this review and the other review reports are difficult for the families involved, and we must continue to do our utmost to ensure that learning is applied while protecting the privacy of families.</P>
        <P>A primary purpose of the review is to establish if any action or inaction by the State&rsquo;s children and family services contributed in any way to these events.  The findings of the review <Col N="17"/>process are designed to strengthen services for children and promote learning in the system in order to improve professional practice and protect children even more.</P>
        <P>The individual reviews make recommendations with regard to the standardisation of assessment processes, the need for alternative methods for dealing with high reporting rates in some areas so as to ensure proper screen and diversion of referrals to the most appropriate &ldquo;track&rdquo; and the need for early, strategic and multidisciplinary intervention where domestic violence is a risk factor for children and families.</P>
        <P>The review also makes a number of recommendations with respect to interdisciplinary and inter-agency action in meeting the needs of some children and their families, including on shared assessment between services and the need for a shared support between hospitals, GPs and community based services for young people, including maternity hospitals in the case of young and vulnerable mothers.  Deputies will be familiar with that as we have discussed on a number of occasions in this House the need for inter-agency work, sharing of information and working together in the interests of families and children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>This is not the first report with such recommendations on improving our State&rsquo;s child protection and care services, and it will not be the last.</P>
        <P>I will soon receive the report of the Independent Review Group on Child Deaths compiled by Norah Gibbons and Geoffrey Shannon.  This report will, in effect, represent a retrospective examination of the cases of children and young people who died in the preceding decade, from January 2000 to April 2010, and I am sure there will be many lessons to be learned from that report also.  These reports are important, in particular as they help to highlight the intense pressures under which Ireland&rsquo;s children and family services must operate.</P>
        <P>There will likely be over 25,000 referrals to social work child protection teams across the State in 2011.  As of August 2011 there were 6,215 children in the care of the State. This figure has increased steadily over the past number of years &mdash; up by 900 in just over three years.</P>
        <P>We are lucky in Ireland that we have so many foster parents willing to look after many of our children.  We have very high rates of care.  The vast majority of children in our care are being cared for by foster parents.</P>
        <P>The many challenges facing the child protection services are not helped by the very significant financial difficulties faced by the HSE child and family services this year and in the past number of years, not to mention significant staffing pressures, be it replacement of staff on maternity leave or the filling of vacancies, but it is not the social workers on the front line who  bear the blame.  We have services staffed with good people who are committed to delivering a different, better life for Irish children.</P>
        <P>There are good news stories.  For example, nearly 99% of all children in residential care now have an allocated social worker with 96% having a written care plan, but there are simply not enough good news stories, mainly because our care system traditionally has been under-funded, under-resourced and under-attended for more than a decade, to which many of the reports amply testify.</P>
        <P>My Department has only been operating for a number of months but in that time my officials and I have made significant inroads into getting to the bottom of the suite of systemic problems and failings that beset our child protection and social work systems.</P>
        <P>The information that will be uncovered by my Department is likely to be unsettling.  I am seeing again and again hard-working, dedicated front line professionals stymied by a broken system which has not put Children First.</P><Col N="18"/>
        <P>Having worked in this area as a social worker, both in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, I know there is nothing more frustrating for a social worker than to call upon the system to help a child or a family only to discover the system is incapable or unwilling to answer the call.</P>
        <P>We will not immediately fix this problem.  The deficit I have inherited is too great to instantly repair.  I have said many times inside and outside this House that while I am very proud to be the State&rsquo;s first senior Minister for Children my one regret is that the Ministry was not created ten years earlier because ten years ago we had the resources to solve these problems quickly and definitively.  The money spent on one vanity project could have changed the lives of many children and families.  These resources are no longer available but the problems to be solved remain and have grown.  Where previous Administrations could buy solutions, this Government will have to build them.  This will require us to create savings and efficiencies, redeploy resources, find new ways of doing things and examine with intense focus everything we do.  While this will take time, it must be done and we have started the process.</P>
        <P>In July, I launched the new Children First national guidance for the protection and welfare of children.  In addition, I have received Government approval to bring forward legislation to put Children First on a statutory basis to ensure, as far as possible, compliance by all organisations working with children, including statutory, private, community and voluntary bodies.  This is highly relevant to the reviews under discussion.  Work is proceeding on this complex legislation and I hope shortly to be in a position to publish the heads of the Bill.  The introduction of legislation has been discussed for years and was a key recommendation of the Ryan report implementation plan.  Whereas the previous Government failed to act on this matter, it is being acted upon under my Ministry.</P>
        <P>I have also initiated an interdepartmental framework to oversee the consistent nationwide implementation of the Children First guidelines.  My Department recently launched the new child protection and welfare practice handbook and held four regional meetings with front-line staff offering a cascading programme of training for Health Service Executive professionals at all levels.  The programme is being rolled out with joint training with garda&iacute;.</P>
        <P>Many of the recommendations of the individual reviews issued last month, in particular those with respect to co-ordination and sharing of information, will be addressed through the consistent implementation of the Children First guidelines.  I discussed previously the recruitment of additional social workers as part of the Ryan report implementation plan.  While the number of staff is important, unless the system is fit for purpose and service delivery models work properly, we will continue to fail our nation&rsquo;s children.</P>
        <P>I am committed to building a new architecture for child welfare and protection and integrated family support services.  Certain key principles must underpin this new architecture and were highlighted in the recommendations of the national review panel.  As the reviews repeatedly illustrate, consistency of practice is required in child protection and welfare services, as is better local management and prioritisation of casework.  We also need a greater focus on prevention and early intervention to support families in crisis and prevent manageable welfare cases from becoming more serious protection cases.  Much better financial discipline is required in the management of our services as this has not been provided by the HSE in recent years.  We also need reliable and real time data on our social work and care services to inform proper evidence based planning and resource allocation.  I have expressed previously in the House how shocked I was at the lack of national data pertaining to many of the issues raised by Deputies with regard to child care protection services, adoption and fostering.  Much greater inter-agency collaboration is required, in particular between care services and youth justice.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>Central to this new architecture will be the delivery of the new child and family support agency, as committed to in the programme for Government.  In September, I established a transition task force to advise on and oversee the establishment of the new agency.  In the interim, it is my intention, working with my colleague, the Minister for Health, to establish a shadow child and family programme in the HSE in 2012.  This will provide for a dedicated management structure and budget for children and family services.  Management of these services will be led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the national director, who has a close working relationship with me and my Department.</P>
        <P>As indicated, the national review panel&rsquo;s annual report highlighted that the criteria for the cases to be reviewed are broad by international standards.  This is an important point to note.</P>
        <P>According to the report, &ldquo;the NRP is concerned that the HIQA guidance places virtually impossible obligations on it.  The combination of timelines, detail required and unanticipated volume of notifications presents difficulties for the NRP that were never intended.&rdquo;  The report suggests ways in which the process of reviewing serious incidents and child deaths could be improved.  Given that this is a new process, it is not surprising that the review panel remarked on the nature of the process and challenges in putting into operation the HIQA guidance.  I am concerned about the capacity issues identified by the panel.  I recently met with HIQA and asked that it review the content of the report and its recommendations.  HIQA has agreed to review the guidance and is engaging actively with the national review panel and HSE children and family services in this regard.  These are matters which will be considered by HIQA in the first instance and by my officials in the context of related policy and legislative developments which are in train.</P>
        <P>The independent chairperson, Dr. Helen Buckley, notes in her introduction to the annual report that &ldquo;as knowledge about child harm and the means of addressing it have expanded, so also have expectations about the capacity of the services to keep children safe&rdquo;.  We must never assume that the existence of a child protection service is a panacea which absolves society of its responsibility to be vigilant.  Reading the report and reviews, it is clear that responsibility for child protection extends to everyone.  As we have repeatedly highlighted, while professionals working on the front line have an additional obligation in respect of what action and intervention they take in response to issues that are brought to their attention, everyone in society has a role to play in child protection.  As a society, we must continue to recognise and be on the lookout for the many untoward influences and dangers waiting to insinuate themselves into children&rsquo;s lives.  The Government must also continue to strive to enhance all services that have child protection and welfare as their ultimate aim.  The work of the national review panel and HSE, the change management programme under way and the HIQA review of the panel and the report I will receive shortly into deaths of children in care over a ten year period will help to achieve this objective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlieMcConalogue"><NameTxt>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and Whip&rsquo;s office for facilitating my request to hold a debate following the publication of the national review panel&rsquo;s report three weeks ago.  I commend Professor Helen Buckley on the work she and the national review panel did in addressing the cases highlighted in the report.  I also compliment the work done since the establishment of her office on introducing procedures to address this important issue.  The national review panel was established following concerns raised in respect of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s child protection service and the lack of transparency regarding child deaths.  In parallel with the establishment of the panel, an independent review by Mr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Nora Gibbons proceeded into deaths of children in the preceding ten years.  This review and the ongoing work of the national review panel will be critical in assessing what has gone wrong with the child protection services and, unfortunately, investigating serious incidents and <Col N="20"/>deaths to ensure an audit is done to determine how each of the children affected was treated by the child protection services and to know precisely what lessons can be learned from each incident, with a view to improving the services provided to all children.</P>
        <P>The report by the national review panel highlighted a number of deficiencies in the child protection system, including several breaches of the Children First guidelines, inadequate supervision of practices in the Health Service Executive and family services in a number of cases and the absence of a standardised method of assessing the needs of children and young people who come to the attention of social services.  The report also exposed the need for specialist training for social workers to improve investigative skills and assist in engaging with difficult to reach families.  It also highlighted the need to develop additional protocols for children who abscond from care and the need to provide after care support as children make the transition to adulthood.  Worryingly, the report states the national review panel&rsquo;s workload is virtually impossible to carry out in full owing to the number and breadth of matters it must investigate.  These cases are not files and piles of paper but represent a child death or serious incident.  It has been reported that the panel was asked to review 51 cases, including 35 deaths, since its establishment in March 2010.  It is imperative that the panel is given the resources to deal with those cases which come before it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has asked HIQA to look into this and into the scope of those cases being examined by the national review panel.  I urge her to ensure that HIQA promptly conducts its assessment of the national review panel&rsquo;s terms of reference, and should additional resources and appropriate changes to the terms of reference be required, I urge her to act on them immediately.  Given the poor record of the State in monitoring child deaths and serious incidents over the years, we should ensure that, as of today, we will not repeat the mistakes of the past.  The incidents where the system fails children should be examined immediately and remedies should be put in place where appropriate.</P>
        <P>There is no doubting the importance of creating a full Cabinet position for the issue of children and youth services.  I welcome the fact that this has occurred.  It has followed progressive steps made in recent years, starting with the decision to establish the position of Minister of State with responsibility for children, followed by the decision to elevate the position to a super junior Ministry.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children could attend Cabinet meetings, albeit not be a full voting member.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to put Children First on a statutory basis and I know efforts to bring forward that legislation are ongoing.  However, we have recently gone backwards in some respects in the management of this brief.  It was unfortunate that commitments given by political parties before the election on the timing of a children&rsquo;s rights referendum were reneged upon once those parties entered the Government.  There is now a commitment to hold the referendum next year.  Unlike the Labour Party and Fine Gael, I will not put too much pressure on demands for a specific date.  However, I urge the Minister to continue working with that.  It was very unfortunate that one of the Government&rsquo;s first actions was to renege on a commitment to bring that forward to the presidential election date.</P>
        <P>One of the lessons from the presidential election and the two referenda held on the same day is the need to ensure that full consultation with the public takes place.  Engagement with the public is crucial in terms of ensuring the success of any referendum proposal.  When we come to set a date for the children&rsquo;s rights referendum, which will hopefully take place next year, it is important that it should be on its own and not held in conjunction with a referendum on abolishing the Seanad, as has been suggested.  It will be a historic move by the State to improve the rights of the child and child protection issues.  These issues have been highlighted by the child review panel, while the independent review panel set up by Geoffrey Shannon and <Col N="21"/>Norah Gibbons will undoubtedly show that we have failed in the past as well.  It is important that this referendum is held on its own and given priority by all involved when we try to pass it next year.</P>
        <P>The other key issue we have neglected in recent months is the situation on social workers in the system.  Professor Helen Buckley&rsquo;s report shows that social workers are the core of the child protection system.  I note the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that the 60 social workers to be employed in 2011, as part of the Ryan report recommendations, will be in their posts by the end of the year.  However, when assessing the current number of social workers in the system, I feel we have gone backwards since the Government entered office.  As of 31 September, there were 2,429 whole-time equivalent social workers being employed by the State.  On 1 January, that number was 2,432, which is slightly more.  This shows that we have gone backwards since the start of the year.  We now have a recruitment freeze and cannot replace social workers who go on maternity leave, nor can we replace temporary posts.  I have also sought information from the Department and the HSE about the replacement of those who have been retiring.  Temporary posts are there to replace people who are sick, on career breaks or whatever.  As these contracts expire, they are not being renewed, and this means that one fewer social worker is being employed.  This is putting additional strain on social worker offices across the country.  I have been hearing at first hand examples of how offices are coming under massive pressure as a result.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister to remove the recruitment pause on maternity leave, temporary leave and temporary posts for social workers.  By not doing that, we are regressing instead of progressing.  In many respects, it makes a fallacy of highlighting the fact that we are due to employ 60 additional recruitment workers.  If we look at how many are working daily in the system, we may be seeing fewer workers.  I know it is not easy due to the financial situation, but it is crucially important that we continue to resource properly our system for social workers.  This will be especially important in light of the legislation being brought forward on mandatory reporting, which will lead to additional pressures in the system as well.</P>
        <P>I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to bring in a uniform system for dealing with reports across the country.  However, it is not sufficient.  It also needs to be resourced.  I have expressed concerns to her before about moving immediately to mandatory reporting without first having assessed what resource implications that might mean.  It is certainly an issue.</P>
        <P>Along with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I attended the pre-budget submission made by Focus Ireland yesterday.  The meeting also focused on the issue of mandatory aftercare for children leaving the care system.  I urge the Minister to remember that for children leaving the system who have depended on the State for services and protection, our duty of care does not end once they reach the age of 18.  It was disappointing &mdash; this view has been eloquently expressed in the past by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in &mdash; that the Government did not provide for mandatory aftercare in the Child Care (Amendment) Act, which was one of the first Bills brought through the House by the Minister.  I urge the Minister to implement this.  We all need to work together to ensure that, as a State, we improve our record in that regard.</P>
        <P>Once again I thank the Minister and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving time to this important issue and assure the Minister of my co-operation in dealing with the challenges we know are coming down the track, particularly that of the referendum, on which we will work together next year.</P>

It is not so long since many Members of this House spoke on the recommendations of the Ryan report.  There have been, as we know, numerous statements on child protection and various HSE reports.  Yet the reality <Col N="22"/>for most children in the care of the State or in need of child protection services is that little has changed.</P>
        <P>As I stand here this morning, there is an overwhelming sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>.  While we were speaking on the Cloyne report, in which the State as well as the church had questions to answer, it emerged that there was a case in Donegal in which a school had continued to employ a man convicted of sexually assaulting a young male despite the Garda having expressing concern on the matter.  We welcomed the appointment of a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Government&rsquo;s expressed commitment to reforming child protection services.  These are important developments of which I have been most supportive, but the Minister knows that on their own they are not enough.  They provide a framework for action.  The Minister will understand that as Opposition voices, we have to press for action.  I believe it is the Minister&rsquo;s wish also that we will see action following her appointment and the establishment of her Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has been <i>in situ</i> since March.  The national vetting bureau Bill has not yet been published.  We are still waiting for the establishment of the long-promised child welfare and protection agency.  The Minister has indicated in recent responses to oral questions what is happening at the moment, but we have yet to see the fruits of her efforts.  If it is the case that the delay is being caused by the Government&rsquo;s wrestling with the internal mechanisms and senior figures of the HSE, it is essential that the Minister comes clean and tells us this.  The child welfare and protection agency must be established without further delay and, once it is established, it is imperative that it is resourced according to need.</P>
        <P>There are still 60 social worker posts to be filled.  Even at that level, social workers will still be under-resourced.  This kind of wing-and-a-prayer approach to child protection will only lead to more reports of Baby G-type cases.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  While we all understand that there are financial constraints on the Government, this cannot be an excuse in the area of child protection.  There are choices to be made and it is up to the Government to make those choices.  We have placed great faith in the Minister&rsquo;s ability to argue her corner in seeking a share of the Exchequer cake for the coming year.</P>
        <P>For example, in October, it was revealed by the heads of NAMA to the Committee of Public Accounts that up to 120 developers are being paid directly by NAMA, with two of them getting &euro;200,000 per annum.  It is staggering.  NAMA&rsquo;s own chief executive is receiving over &euro;400,000 in salary payments, and who knows what the rest of the NAMA management are earning.  If there is money in the State to make such payments, there is money to pay the salaries of social workers and to resource them appropriately.  It is a question of prioritising and recognising what is fundamentally important, and child protection must be at the top of the list, especially in view of the sad and sorry record of child protection mechanisms and supports in the State and on behalf of the State historically and right up to the present time.  If the Government can afford to pay its special advisers &euro;130,000 a year, then it can afford to pay the necessary social workers.  In this context, it is reprehensible to blame financial constraints for inaction in resourcing child protection structures.  There are still outstanding recommendations from various reports for new procedures which we are waiting to see implemented.  These procedures are of no use unless they are implemented.</P>
        <P>Last month, while we were hearing of the monstrous NAMA salaries, we also heard of 35 deaths and 16 serious incidents since March last year involving children in the care of the HSE or who were known to that organisation.  I note that the Minister&rsquo;s contribution referred specifically to the period March to December 2010, but these are the figures that were revealed at that time from March of last year to October of this year.  These are children who died from drugs, suicide or road accidents.  We do not know how many of these children should not have <Col N="23"/>died because the State was meant to be in the place of their parents or because it should have intervened earlier or helped the families from which those children came.  I acknowledge that the figures tell us only a very small part of the story, but they are absolutely shocking.</P>
        <P>None of us wishes to stand here in six months&rsquo; time, least of all the Minister herself, to speak on the deaths of more children in State care.  What is it going to take for the Government &mdash; I am not pressing the Minister individually &mdash; to actually implement the changes that are needed to make State care a safe place for children?  That is the point we must reach.  What will it take for the Government to make the HSE more accountable?  Social workers are under-resourced and clearly overburdened.  I have spoken directly with those at the coalface and I must say they are doing heroic work despite all the difficulties they must contend with.  It is unacceptable for the HSE to respond to the death of a child by saying &ldquo;Well, that was a key learning point&rdquo;.  We have had too many key learning points.  It is up to this Government to change this.  Furthermore, I am calling on the Government to ensure that child services are protected in this forthcoming budget.  That will be a critical indicator of what lies ahead.</P>
        <P>Children should not, and cannot, shoulder the burden of the financial mismanagement of this State.</P>
        <P>We know who was responsible for that.  Socially and economically penalising children is far from cherishing the children of the nation equally, as the Proclamation envisaged.  Certainly, it does not represent the State demonstrating a commitment to ensure the best interests of the child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I echo the calls concerning child protection made by Barnardos in its pre-budget submission launched this week and I commend the efforts of those involved.  As a previous speaker stated, it is high time the Government held the referendum to enshrine children&rsquo;s rights in the Constitution.  Children&rsquo;s rights are too limited in the Constitution.  I call on the Government and in particular the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide an explanation.  The public deserves an explanation outlining why there is such an inordinate delay in publishing a referendum Bill.  It is not good enough to hang it all on the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and claim that this, that and the other must be examined and measured in terms of its impact.  After all this time and as we head toward the second anniversary of the publication of the third report of the all-party committee we are due an explanation of the position rather than vague responses to the effect that the matter is continuing under consideration.  I hope the Minister will respond and arrange to have a detailed explanation provided to Members.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party supported wholeheartedly the draft wording for a constitutional amendment as set out in the final report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, of which I and the Minister were members.  It is not unreasonable of me to ask what has changed since those involved took up the responsibility of ministerial office and Government.  We and the public have a right to know and I hope this information will be forthcoming soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the forthcoming budget it is imperative that the Family Support Agency is resourced to invest in preventative and early intervention measures.  Early intervention will aid child protection most.  Also, there should be an immediate roll out of a State-wide out-of-hours care service.  I still hear of cases of children being presented to Garda stations in the dead of night.  Homeless children are taken into care under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991, rather than being given the full range of support services they are entitled to under section 4 of the same Act.  This is not the outworking of the commitment to child protection that the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, gave while he was running for election in February.  There are still children leaving care and not receiving adequate after care services.  As a matter of urgency the Govern<Col N="24"/>ment must resource and implement the national after care policy.  I take this opportunity to endorse fully the Focus Ireland campaign for a statutory right to after care, something for which I have argued consistently in recent years.  This involves a statutory right to after care for young people leaving care and young people experiencing homelessness.  As Focus Ireland has asserted, everyone has a right to a place they can call home.  This applies not least to young people who have been in State care upon attaining their 18th year when they face all the challenges that life brings at that time and in the transition from childhood to adulthood.</P>
        <P>It is also essential that the Government moves to establish the EU missing children&rsquo;s hotline in this State.  It is already operational in 16 member states and I see no good reason why it has not been set up here yet.  I commend the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, on campaigning on this issue for years and I am disappointed that the Government has not heeded its calls to date.  This, alongside the placing of the Children First protection guidelines on a statutory footing, mandatory reporting and a fully resourced social work system, is something that the children of this island cannot do without.</P>
        <P>We must be frank and honest about this: the State has an abysmal record when it comes to child protection and this must change.  Children have a right to be protected and I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald&rsquo;s, initiative in this regard.  But this is not solely the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, as I have stated.  A joined-up, holistic approach is required, involving the Ministers for Finance; Justice and Equality; Education and Skills; Environment, Community and Local Government; Health; and Social Protection, all of whom have a role to play.  This should be realised by each of the Ministers involved and by others I may have overlooked.  I urge the Minister to proceed in this regard.  She has our wholehearted support in working towards a response from Government and that is from whence any response must come.  I urge all those involved to act fully and generously in the best interests of the children of this island whatever transpires in the time leading up to the next general election.  If we can put in place a major improvement in the situation relating to child protection and children in need and in care in this State, even if there is nothing else, it will be a powerful legacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the fact that we are having this debate.  I commend the national review panel on completing this report and on examining this most serious of issues.  While I have some points to make which challenge or criticise the Government&rsquo;s action in respect of child protection, I have no doubt about the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to it.  In her speech, the Minister was frank in stating she is trying to do her best but that she is labouring under the financial circumstances and constraints with which the State is faced.  This is the real issue.  With the best will in the world, the Minister can and will try to do her best to improve standards of child protection.  However, unless there is backing, support and resources for doing so and unless these are connected to addressing the many factors, including societal and economic factors which contribute to the problems facing children, it is difficult to see how one could make headway.</P>
        <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s remarks were important.  The starting point for discussing this issue is to recognise the absolutely abysmal failure of the State to protect children from abuse, neglect and poverty over a long period.  It is an incredible indictment not so much of this Government, but of previous successive Governments that despite report, outcry and scandal relating to the abuse and neglect of children and the failure of the State to discharge its responsibility to children, we do not yet have the legislative protection necessary for our children nor do we have the resources and services necessary to protect children to the degree to which they should be protected.  If that is the general historical situation the report, dealing with a short period between March and December 2010, is shocking.</P><Col N="25"/>
        <P>I do not know all of the circumstances but I find it shocking that one child who is known to the HSE and public services dies every month from a drug overdose, suicide or homicide.  I do not know the circumstances of the other deaths but those facts are bad enough.  It is a continuation of the failure of the State to look after our children.</P>
        <P>It goes beyond the children who were known to the HSE or services.  In the debate on the Private Members&rsquo; motion tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan last week there was a general acknowledgement that report after report confirmed mental health problems, suicide, drug and alcohol problems have risen dramatically over the past few years.  While they are all complex issues which have multifactorial influences, clearly there is a strong connection, as all reports and studies suggest, between those issues and the effects of the recession, austerity, unemployment, poverty and social dislocation in our society.  Those problems disproportionately impact on children.</P>
        <P>This week Barnardos indicated 40,000 more children are now living in consistent poverty, bringing the total figure to 90,000.  That is appalling.  The most vulnerable in our society are suffering from the impact of the economic crisis and austerity, for which they have no responsibility, visited upon them by the Government, IMF and EU.  The failure of the State could not be more serious.  What the Minister can do about that is limited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unless we address the unemployment crisis we will not solve the problems of, poverty, which in most cases is related to unemployment, and housing.  Housing is a factor in almost all the cases of distressed situations I come across involving children and families.  Current policies will make the situation worse.  Local authorities are abandoning their responsibility to provide housing for people and outsourcing it to other bodies.  The anecdotal evidence in my constituency of what that means is becoming apparent.</P>
        <P>I received a telephone call this morning from a vulnerable woman with three young children.  She is living in a property owned by the council but run by a voluntary agency.  Nobody knows who is responsible for the property.  It flooded and all the fuses began to spark, creating a major fire hazard.  She telephoned the council which told her it has nothing to do with it and that she should contact the agency, which placed her in emergency accommodation.  A day later when the sockets began to fume and smoke she called the fire brigade which indicated the situation was serious and that she should have been removed from the property immediately.  Nobody knows who is responsible.  She has a history of vulnerability; I will not go into her personal details.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Minister is aware, there are many other examples where it is difficult to determine who is responsible for what, everybody says they do not have the resources to deal with problems and the buck is passed.  I do not see how we can resolve any of these problems without resources.  We are losing social workers because of the embargo.  Family counsellors, therapists and multidisciplinary teams are needed to deal with difficult and complex situations and the underlying problems of poverty and unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Finian McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this very important debate on child protection and the urgent need to put child safety and the protection of children at the top of the political agenda.  This issue is far bigger than party politics and I urge all Deputies to unite and support all the recommendations of the Ryan report, the annual report of the national review panel on serious incidents, including the deaths of children in care, and all the voluntary and community organisations which support the rights of children.  That should be the theme of the debate today and so far it seems to be going in that direction. </P><Col N="26"/>
        <P>Child safety and quality child protection are the most important issues in this debate.  The next most important element is having quality, interested, caring and committed staff.  We can discuss legislation and reports but if the right people are not doing the right job the problem will not be solved, something which has been an issue in the past and with which I will deal later.</P>
        <P>It is not just about getting university points and recruiting highly academic people into social work positions.  We need the right people with high professional standards at the front line of child care and protection services.  I say that as a person who worked for 26 or 27 years in the north inner city on the front line of child care.  I saw teachers, social workers, juvenile liaison officers and female garda&iacute; at work.  The right people at the right time can save a lot of children and lives.  However we do not need people who want to have a trendy career.  They should get out of the sector.</P>
        <P>When it comes down to saving and protecting a child I would prefer to have one good foster family than an institutional care situation.  The children in stable families in foster care who attended my school were the best survivors.  Every day was a very sad day for those in institutional care.  A boy of seven years of age left school every day with tears in his eyes, which was heart-rending.  It is important that we say that in the debate today.</P>
        <P>We have to deal with resources and referendums but the first issue is front-line staff.  I understand approximately 6,250 young people are currently in care, an increase of 900 over the past couple of years.  It is a frightening statistic.  That is the bad news.  The good news is that many children in care live with outstanding foster families and receive stability, love, warmth, energy and affection which is saving them from ending up in Mountjoy Prison in the future.  Such a system saves the taxpayer money.  We have to put our hearts and minds into the psychology of the child in care.</P>
        <P>I ask all Deputies to imagine how they would feel if they ended up in a care situation at five, six or seven years of age.  I taught and worked with some of these children.  When one sees the sadness in their eyes and their desire for warmth, affection and stability, it is heartbreaking.  On the other hand, it is hugely encouraging to observe the turnaround when they receive the care they require.  Early intervention is key if we are to make a change in these children&rsquo;s lives.  Strong family support in foster homes and strong adoptive families provide the stability that is needed to save these children.  An issue that has not yet been raised in the debate today is that of children with disabilities in care.  These young people are doubly vulnerable in terms of their care needs and in regard to the risk of exploitation.  Parents who have adopted or fostered a child with a disability are patriots &mdash; exponents of child protection patriotism &mdash; who deserve our thanks and commendation.</P>
        <P>At this stage, I am becoming frustrated and annoyed with all of the various reports that have been commissioned.  I encourage the Minister to get on with the job.  She is well versed in the issues to be addressed and there is cross-party support for many aspects of her vision.  We do not need any more reports; it is now time for action to safeguard the welfare of the 6,000 children in State care.  We must get the right people in place and ensure best practice is being implemented.</P>
        <P>The Minister said earlier that almost 99% of children in residential care have now been allocated a social worker, with 96% having a written care plan.  That is welcome progress.  However, it is not merely a numbers game; it is about the quality of staff working on the front line.  The same applies in respect of other caring professions, including nursing and teaching.  It should not be all about educational qualifications and points obtained.  We must ensure that all staff working with children at risk not only have the qualifications but also the personal qualities that make them suitable to do the job.</P><Col N="27"/>
        <P>In light of revelations in recent years, it is trendy to have a go at the church.  The church has certainly failed on the issue of child protection, but so too has the State.  It is not often acknowledged in this House that people working on the front line of child protection have also failed.  I do not accept what is sometimes claimed in the newspapers, namely, that people did not know what was going on.  It must be acknowledged that front line care staff have made mistakes.  There was a failure on the part of the church, the State and the staff working on the front line of child protection.</P>
        <P>This is an important debate.  I wish the Minister well and look forward to her delivering on her commitments in the next 12 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  There are few issues more important than child protection.  In that regard, I strongly welcome the creation of the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which is reflective of the priority afforded to child welfare issues by the Government.  Unfortunately, we are all aware that over many years this issue was not given the importance it should have been and certainly was not enforced as it should have been.  We are seeing the effects of that now.</P>
        <P>I speak as somebody who has worked for the past four years with children and young people in a youth organisation in Galway city.  One of the most pressing issues I encountered in working with these young people relates to Garda vetting.  We have many upstanding people with fine qualities working with young people, but the Garda vetting process leads to great frustration among those who wish to help in any way they can.  We must ensure the process works more effectively in order to avoid situations where people are waiting months to secure Garda clearance.  Unfortunately, we have seen situations where, by the time people are cleared to work with young people, they may already have left the organisation having been unable to do the job they wished to do.  To clarify, I am not suggesting that we take any shortcuts when it comes to Garda vetting procedures.  However, considering the pressure on many organisations, most of which depend to a great extent on volunteers to continue their work, it is imperative that we resolve this issue.</P>
        <P>The Children First national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children are excellent.  I have received training on those guidelines in the course of my work.  The problem is that they are not being universally implemented across all organisations in the State.  I do not mean to suggest that certain groups are not doing the proper training; they absolutely are.  However, there must be a more uniform approach.  This should involve a requirement on all staff to participate in refresher training on a two to three-year basis.  One never knows when one will need to use the training.  Working with young people involves awareness of abuse, whether physical or emotional, and one can only acquire the skills to deal with that if one is sufficiently trained.  A child who has not eaten for several days may seem happy and healthy, but that amounts to a form of abuse.  Only staff who are both experienced and well trained will pick up on that.</P>
        <P>Children First must be rolled out across all agencies and staff, and it must be done on a consistent basis over a period of two to three years in order to ensure people working with youth organisations can do their job as well as possible.  There are many organisations doing fantastic work, all of which have one common goal, namely, to take care of young people and help them to develop.  However, the multi-agency approach is not working as it was intended to do.  Unfortunately, due to funding cutbacks, some organisations are competing for certain strands of funding rather than working together.  It is in those circumstances that children and <Col N="28"/>young people fall through the cracks.  I acknowledge that there are confidentiality issues, but if we are serious about providing young people with the care they need and deserve, there must be an effective multi-agency approach.  This should focus on co-operation between agencies on a case-by-case basis, with staff working together to devise the most appropriate plan of care for individual children.</P>
        <P>I welcome the priority afforded to child protection issues through the creation of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I commend the Minister on the great work she is doing.  While funding cuts will make her make her job more difficult, she is the right person for the role.  I encourage her to continue to work with agencies and groups in communities throughout the State.  They are the people with the expertise and experience and who best understand what needs to be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterFitzpatrick"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the annual report of the National Review Panel for Serious Incidents and Child Deaths.  The panel was established in June last year to review deaths and serious incidents experienced by children in State care or known to the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s children and family services.</P>
        <P>To put this report and the role of the national review panel in context, it is worth examining how and why the body was established.  The panel was formed as a direct result of the publication of the Ryan report in 2009, which provided a painful account of the terrible wrongs inflicted upon children who were placed in State care in the past.  The then Government accepted the report in full and, under the auspices of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, an implementation plan was published in July 2009.  This plan contained several recommendations, one of which was that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, should develop guidance to the HSE on the review of serious incidents, including deaths of children in care.</P>
        <P>In January 2010 HIQA published a guidance document which required that the HSE establish a panel of appropriately skilled professionals, both internal and external, to review cases under specified criteria.  One critical aspect of HIQA&rsquo;s guidance was that an independent chairman and deputy chairman be appointed.  In addition, professionals from a range of disciplines were to be appointed for their professional expertise.  As a consequence, the national review panel was established in June 2010, with Dr. Helen Buckley, senior lecturer and research fellow at the school of social work and social policy in Trinity College, Dublin, appointed as chairman.  Other panel members were inducted and protocols established.  Thus the core function of the national review panel of conducting reviews effectively commenced in August 2010, and here in our possession is its first annual report.  Before reviewing the annual report it is important that one key element be emphasised, which is that the national review panel remains independent from the HSE.  This should not be underestimated, as herein lies one of its main strengths.  Even though the NRP was formed under the auspices of the HSE, it has independent legal advisers and liaises directly with the HIQA on its work.  Thus we are now in a position to review the first annual report.  Those reading the report should be aware of the challenges faced by any panel establishing a new programme of work.  The initial phases can be time consuming, due to the establishment of hierarchies, reporting structures, protocols, etc.  Anyone familiar with establishing a committee or panel, etc., could relate to this.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Ryan report and the report of the Commission of Investigation into the Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin, commonly known as the Murphy report, in 2009 created considerable public and political concern about the treatment of vulnerable children and the need for transparency and accountability.  This highlighted the inadequacy of the system as <Col N="29"/>prior to the national review panel there was no standardised or systematic way of reviewing serious incidents, including the deaths of children in care.</P>
        <P>Whereas much of the public and political attention over the past two years has focused upon the deaths of children in care, the criteria set out by the HIQA are much broader.  These expanded criteria have led to a vastly increased workload and schedule for the panel.  These broader terms have the potential to lead in certain instances to duplication and an array of similar conclusions and recommendations.  The HIQA criteria are broad by comparison with international criteria and perhaps need to be re-examined in order to achieve more effective results and learning outcomes from the panel.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, the broad criteria have resulted in a large number of cases requiring review.  Original estimates in the HIQA guidance suggested that there were likely to be two deaths and up to five serious incidents for national review per annum.  In reality, during the nine months in which this guidance applied in 2010, some 22 deaths and eight serious incidents were notified to the national review panel.  This discrepancy naturally led to greatly increased workloads and assessments for the panel.  In addition, from an early stage it became clear that the timelines imposed in the HIQA guidance were unworkable, as evidenced by the requirement that reviews be commenced within one month of a death or serious incident and completed within four months.  When one considers the need for medical evidence such as post-mortem results and coroners&rsquo; reports, it is clear that these timeframes are unworkable.  These aspects constitute a significant challenge for the NRP if it is to comply with the HIQA timelines.</P>
        <P>Another area where the panel has experienced difficulties is in the format required for reports initiated by the HIQA.  The HIQA requires information of such detail that it would be extremely difficult to retain individuals&rsquo; anonymity, for the purpose of publication.  Herein lies the anomaly &mdash; the excessive detail required for publication versus trying to conceal the identities of individuals and families.</P>
        <P>Due to the excessively high numbers of notifications the national review panel was faced with capacity issues from inception.  As a result, with agreement from the HIQA a priority system was established.  The benefit of this system was that appropriate consideration could be apportioned to the higher priority cases and those with most learning outcomes.  I welcome this common sense approach and it is heartening to see agreement being reached so easily.  Furthermore, the report contains an analysis section which examines the first year under numerous headings including, causes of deaths, gender, age, geography etc.  These can be useful, particularly when viewed with future reports, as careful analysis should highlight particularly vulnerable categories.</P>
        <P>It is evident that the panel was inhibited in its results owing to unrealistic expectations regarding child deaths and was also confined with the excessively broad reporting criteria.  Resources and time were used establishing both the panel and an office.  As a result the report, although an annual report, in effect does not have a full year&rsquo;s activities on which to comment.</P>
        <P>A particular area of concern already identified relates to the anonymity of the children and young people concerned.  The NRP is fearful that this anonymity cannot be guaranteed in cases where they have already been aired in the national media.  This area needs particular consideration if a careful balance is to be achieved between its obligations for public accountability and the rights and wishes of the families concerned.</P>
        <P>The NRP is concerned that the HIQA guidance places virtually impossible guidelines upon it.  The combination of timelines, detail required and the unanticipated volume of notifications presents difficulties for the NRP that were never intended.  Therefore the NRP considers that the current guidance requires considerable and urgent redrafting in order to be more reflective of the time required to produce reports and the complexities surrounding their completion <Col N="30"/>and publication.  I echo these concerns which are justified and I would welcome a review of certain procedures.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2010 the NRP had 12 cases under review with a further six cases awaiting review.  With such a large and unanticipated volume of cases the question must be raised at this early juncture whether it is necessary or even beneficial for every case to be reviewed.  The report asks whether it would be possible for the chair of the NRP to select representative cases from which maximum learning can be extracted.  I so not see why this request should not be considered.</P>
        <P>The welfare and safety of children, in particular vulnerable children, is a matter of considerable public concern and with ample justification.  It is important therefore that the business of child protection work is made transparent so that its complexities can be understood and confidence in the system can be maintained.  In addition, it should remain to the forefront that the aim of the review process is to promote learning from cases where children have died or experienced events which are likely to have serious consequences for them.  It is equally important to recognise and promote examples of good practice, something that can often be overlooked in an overzealous desire to find bad practice.</P>
        <P>I welcome this initial report from the national review panel but as previously mentioned it should be viewed in context.  The national review panel is now firmly established and operating to standardised protocols.  As a result it will be next year before a complete and proper 12-month analysis can be conducted.  Nonetheless, the first report of the panel is a welcome addition.  It conveys great objectivity while seeking further improvement to the quality of its delivery and service.  In these times for our nation, that is something to be cherished.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for acquiescing to Deputy McConalogue&rsquo;s call for a debate on the matter.  When Professor Buckley introduced the panel&rsquo;s report on the deaths of children in care, it was striking that she said she felt the panel was not adequately resourced to deal with all cases, which is of concern.  The Government has now been in office since February.  We were all heartened by the Government&rsquo;s commitment to children by awarding a full ministry to the area.  This would have indicated a total commitment to children.</P>
        <P>However, I am concerned at the HSE&rsquo;s inaction in appointing social workers.  Vulnerable children must be afforded every possible protection.  Based on the Ryan report and this review, the most imperative proposal was the one which highlighted the need for more social workers so that social workers could be applied to each individual child in care.</P>
        <P>Replies to recent parliamentary questions noted that 2,432 social workers were working within the HSE.  On 30 September we had 2,429, a reduction of three.  The Ryan report recommended 270 new staff.  To be fair to the previous Government, it appointed 200.  The Government was supposed to appoint 60 this year and ten next year.  It is very disappointing that those appointments have not taken place.  When we think of children in care and the State&rsquo;s role in that regard we think, unfortunately, of decades past when, it could be argued, the State abdicated its responsibilities, resulting in great pain and strain for everyone concerned.  We now have available to us the expertise which points to the ways, means and methods by which we as parliamentarians and legislators can provide a service and facilities that seek to protect the most vulnerable in society.  The most vulnerable in society are no doubt children in care, whom, if nothing else, the Government, when it engages with a view to prioritising funding across a <Col N="31"/>wide range of Departments, needs to seek to protect.  The Government established a senior Ministry for children last March.  Is it imperative that the future protection of vulnerable children is prioritised.  There is no excuse whatsoever that in a year when &euro;6 billion was taken out of the national spending power of this State, 200 social workers were not, as recommended in the Ryan report, put in place and that there was in this area an embargo on recruitment or replacement of staff on maternity or sick leave.  Despite all we know and all the expertise in this regard, which has been put into the public domain, there have been only four appointments in this area.  The Minister needs to address this issue with her Cabinet colleagues in the context of the upcoming budget.  It would be commendable if the Minister were to do so.</P>
        <P>On the proposed children&rsquo;s rights referendum, the Government on assuming office stated that this referendum would be held in conjunction with the presidential election.  However, that did not happen.  The Taoiseach has given a commitment that it will be held next year in conjunction with a referendum on the Seanad.  If the Government learned nothing else from its recent loss at the polls, it should have learned that a referendum such as this needs to be afforded the expertise and relevance it deserves and should be held on its own and not with any other referendum, irrespective of what that referendum that is, least of all a referendum on the Seanad.</P>
        <P>On the new child and family services agency, I understand a task force has been put in place to consider how this might be established.  It is hoped that the Minister can honour her commitment in this regard and bring forward proposals in that area.  Apart from speaking about the recommendations contained in the report of Professor Buckley, I wanted to highlight in this debate the stance of Fianna F&aacute;il Party in relation to the recruitment of social workers.  As I said, vulnerable children are the weakest in our society.  It is imperative the Government follows on from the appointments made by the previous Government and brings forth the funding required to appoint additional social workers so as to ensure the most vulnerable in our society are protected.  I do not suggest that this in its entirety is the answer to all that is wrong in this area.  There are much broader issues involved.  However, as a hard and fast means it is the best we can do in the immediate future.  It is hoped the Minister will impress upon her colleagues at the Cabinet table the need to appoint personnel in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this important report.  I was glad the request by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party spokesperson, Deputy McConalogue, to have this important issue brought before the House was acceded to by the Minister and Government.</P>
        <P>On Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the forthcoming referendum on children&rsquo;s rights, the Minister will recall that I, when Minister with responsibility for children, put to Cabinet the proposal to establish the all-party Oireachtas committee.  The Minister, in her capacity at that time as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, was an active and constructive member of that committee which did exemplary work under the chairmanship of former Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke.  I commend Members from all sides who participated in that committee.  The late Deputy Brian Lenihan as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I, as Minister with responsibility for children, were members of that committee which set about its work in a thorough, professional and constructive manner.  I believe that if the Minister were in a position to make a personal comment it would be to agree with Deputies McConalogue, Cowen and I that the children&rsquo;s rights referendum should be held on its own.  It is an important issue.  I left a committee meeting early to come to the House to endorse the comments of Deputies McConalogue and Cowen in appealing to the Government to ensure the children&rsquo;s rights referendum is a stand-alone referendum.  There are complex issues involved.  Those complex issues were teased out in great detail by the all-party committee.</P><Col N="32"/>
        <P>The role of the all-party Oireachtas committee was to deepen consensus in the Oireachtas in relation to the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill published in March 2007.  I appeal to the Minister to use her influence at Cabinet to ensure the children&rsquo;s rights referendum is put before the people as soon as possible.  We all know that pre-election promises have been abandoned by the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  However, post-election the Taoiseach gave a commitment that the children&rsquo;s rights referendum would be held along with the presidential election, which did not happen.  I appeal to the Minister to use her influence to ensure that the children&rsquo;s rights referendum is held as early as possible in 2012 and that it is the only matter put before the electorate on that occasion.  The issues involved are complex and deserve discussion and debate in society that will not be muddled with issues which might pertain to other referenda proposals.  We are all aware of the short shrift which the Government&rsquo;s proposal on the Oireachtas inquiries received.  That referendum was badly handled by the Government.  We do not want a repeat of that on this particular issue.  It is important there is all-party Oireachtas agreement prior to the referendum being put before the people.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy McConalogue, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the additional social worker appointments are made as quickly as possible.  The HSE stated some time ago, as did the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, that there was no impediment to those appointments being made.  It is important those new positions are filled as soon as possible.  The eminent Dr. Helen Buckley stated in her report that pressure on front line services resulted in their being unable to respond quickly to many child welfare referrals.  This highlights the need to have those extra personnel in place as soon as possible.  I am sure the Minister will agree that she is fortunate to have people of the status, competence and commitment of Dr. Buckley, Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons, and many others outside the public service, playing a leading role in dealing with children&rsquo;s issues.  When they speak they do so with great authority, competence and status and have the respect of the overall community.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister is in the process of putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing.  It is hoped the Minister is taking into account the comments of the Irish Association of Social Workers who have expressed some unease about the proposed standardised system being designed by the HSE to transform social workers&rsquo; handling of child protection issues.   As the Minister will be aware, the experience in other countries has been that the introduction of mandatory reporting has led to a significant increase in the number of reports and this puts significant pressure on social workers.  The key issue is how to avoid vexatious claims and baseless allegations.  We do not want the system to be clogged up with vexatious claims while genuine complaints may not be afforded the time or the resources they require.  This is a very complex issue and I wish the Minister and her officials well in devising the protocols and the <i>modus operandi</i> for dealing with these issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I presume an audit of resources and an examination of international practice will be required.  I hope the Minister can draw on the best international practice for mandatory reporting.  The proper procedures and protocols are crucial before those guidelines become mandatory.</P>
        <P>The report highlighted several breaches of the Children First guidelines, including, inadequate supervision of practices in the HSE and the family services and the absence of a standardised method of assessing the needs of children and young people who come to the attention of social services.  It is important that protocols are adequate and appropriate and that everybody in the system, regardless of whether in Ulster, Connacht, Leinster or Munster, are working to the same standards.  The report also referred to the need for specialised training for social workers in order to improve their investigative skills and to assist in engaging with families who are difficult to reach.  These are very important issues and I hope they can be dealt with in a robust and constructive manner.</P><Col N="33"/>
        <P>I understand a working group is in place to advance the proposal for a new agency.  In cases where personnel are deployed to another agency, there is always the danger of a vacuum or <i>lacuna</i> being created which can be a concern to personnel.  The structures need to be right and they need to be put in place as rapidly as possible.  Oftentimes, unnecessary concerns can set in, along with a lack of enthusiasm, if a workforce is unsure about the particular reconfiguration and delivery of services.  I hope the Minister and the Department can put in place the new agency as rapidly as possible and that it will have adequate protocols and resources to deal with the very important issue of protecting children.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for facilitating this debate.  This new Government recognises the need to protect and care for children and it has created a specific Department under the competent stewardship of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.  No death of a child in care is acceptable but such deaths occur.  We have to focus on understanding the underlying reasons for such deaths.  I was astonished when I saw the figure of 6,215 children who are in care and this figure is an increase of 900 in three years.  A crowd of 6,000 people would fill a lot of Kildare Street, for example.  While I accept that many people are more competent than me to speak on this issue, I will address this aspect of the report.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on addressing the problem by focusing on understanding the issues and then by addressing them in a coherent fashion.  I am a scientist and we are trained to lay out the facts and then figure out how to deal with them.  It is very important to deal with a situation in a systematic fashion because a haphazard approach does not work.  The Minister is correct when she says there is no quick fix to this legacy issue.  However, we must ensure that each step forward is a step in the right direction.  People are always looking for quick fixes and it is probably as a result of the Celtic tiger era when everything was quick; people had to earn money fast and the lifestyle was fast.  The fact that there was a deterioration in lifestyles as a result is another issue.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I agree the State is not perfect and never has been and there have been failures.  However, the new architecture for child welfare and protection and integrated family support services, is a great step forward.  I refer to the six core principles set out by the Minister in her contribution.  There must be a consistency of practice which should not be different from Cork to Donegal.  Local management will be responsible for prioritising cases and this means that cases are less likely to slip through the net, so to speak.  There must be an emphasis on prevention and early intervention.  Financial discipline is crucial to ensure that resources are used to best advantage.  Reliable and real-time data is vital in order to make coherent and correct decisions.  Inter-agency collaboration will ensure that people communicate with each other and will allow for better use of facilities.  We are all aware of the failures of the State in this regard and these are being addressed.</P>
        <P>I am a parent and I ask why so many children, a total of 6,215, are in care.  I ask what are the underlying reasons for children being in care in such numbers.  Why is the family structure breaking down at an alarming rate?  It may be factors such as alcohol abuse, mental health issues, drug use or financial distress.  People in financial distress make decisions under stress.  Personal responsibility must be taken into account.  I suggest that funding be directed towards developing parenting skills.  No parent is given a book of answers when it comes to rearing a child and every child is different even when all reared together.  However, it must be noted that some children are under-fed while others are over-fed.  In my view, nutrition needs to be emphasised.  Home economics was a school subject which needs to be reintroduced to the school curriculum and it should be a mandatory subject.  Food affordability will be an issue as <Col N="34"/>food inflation increases.  We do not want children going to school hungry nor children going to school obese.  Both extremes are damaging.  Families are feeding children with high carbohydrate and high fat diets.  There is a lack of understanding of health issues.  Feeding children a diet which will lead them to an early grave is irresponsible and the State must ensure this issue can be addressed.</P>
        <P>When people have children they have responsibility both to them and to their State.  The question is how we, as a State, can encourage people to rear their children and to show respect.  I am a member of a school board of management and can report that teachers do a great job in this regard.  They spot vulnerable children at an early age, intervene and help them.  Sometimes all that is needed is a small intervention.</P>
        <P>I refer, too, to foster parents.  Their funding should be kept as it is and protected.  These people are very sincere and decent and do considerable work that must be recognised.  Other payments may be attacked but funding for foster parents should never be touched because it goes to the children.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well in her job.  I admire her open-mindedness and her progressive approach.  This is a very serious issue and it is good to see the State is taking it seriously.  Although we will not have success overnight each step we make in this regard is a step in the right direction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  For many years lip service has been paid to the need to recognise the needs of children, especially those who may be vulnerable.  My colleague, Deputy Barry, very correctly addressed a number of related issues.  He referred in particular to the large number of children in care of one kind or another.  There is another cohort of people who perhaps should be in care and would be better off if they were, even if only for a short time or a period of respite.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred to the degree to which and the speed with which the services can respond to a situation before it becomes an emergency.  That is important.  As Deputy Barry noted, schools do very important work in this area.  Teachers can spot sensitive issues and deal with them.  However, school can be a challenging place for children who are vulnerable, given the extent to which bullying goes on in certain schools.  That is the responsibility of another Department and the Minister for Education and Skills comments on it regularly.</P>
        <P>It has been brought to our attention on numerous occasions in recent years that this problem seems to be happening to a greater extent now.  It seems to have a more sinister theme because of the use of modern technology, the Internet, or whatever means.  This area needs to be identified and monitored to a much greater extent than it has been and measures must be put in place to discourage such approaches.  Children can be very cruel to one another, as all of us know.  There is a need to reassure in a meaningful and supportive way those who may be vulnerable.without necessarily imposing statutory interventions.  One can operate using gentle persuasions, at least in the initial stages.</P>
        <P>In my experience as a public representative I have often noticed the reluctance on the part of institutions, for example, the HSE or any relevant authority, to take much account of points made by public representatives.  I have said as much to the Minister.  These people have regular daily interaction with the public, they meet parents and children and look at them face to face.  The number of times public representatives have spotted issues that have not come to the attention of the authorities is enormous.  If all the Members of this House were to consider this aspect of the situation as a starting point they would find it very informative.</P><Col N="35"/>
        <P>We need a better system that would kick into action immediately a matter is brought to the attention of the authorities, whereupon certain people would assume responsibility and take action.  How often have we heard of situations where something that is not desirable has happened even though there had been a prior report?  The reported situation may seem correct or well grounded but if it comes to the attention of a public representative or to any member of the public, that person or representative has a moral duty to do something about the situation.  Of course, there must be regard to the rights of the individual concerned and to the concept of innocence until proven otherwise.  There are particularly sensitive households where there may be problems that do not ordinarily and readily present themselves in a public fashion.  In such cases it is very important that an intervention be made.</P>
        <P>My colleague made reference to contributory causes.  Sadly, these were present during the good times, the boom years.  Ironically and unfortunately, the availability of too much money was a factor.  It was not the case that social welfare payments were greater then than they are now but there was too much money around.  Very often the people in question were not in receipt of any social welfare payments, good, bad or indifferent, but money was available in quantity.  There were continuous and obvious indications throughout that period that a great deal of money, over and above what was required in any given households, was available.  In a situation like that, obviously  problems will arise &mdash; and did.</P>
        <P>In my time in this House I have come across people, mothers and children, sleeping in the open air.  They are from both the settled and the Traveller communities.  That is a sad, harsh reality.  As time goes on and the economic situation becomes tighter this situation will become worse.  It is a very sad reflection on our society that this should happen at all.  During the Celtic tiger years there was less camaraderie and less emphasis on interaction of a voluntary nature.  Ultimately, we became a rather smug society, avaricious in many ways.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this debate to the House and for emphasising the importance of her office.  We, too, need to recognise that as we move into the future, whether we like it or not we will be judged on the way we treat those who are vulnerable in our society &mdash; the very young and the very old.  That is a matter for another discussion at another time and we will deal with it when the time comes.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate and thank the Minister for remaining in the House throughout.  Too often Ministers come for the opening round of speaking slots and then must leave, for whatever reason.  It is commendable that this Minister has been present for every contributor&rsquo;s speech.</P>
        <P>Last week when the D&aacute;il schedule was published and speaking slots allocated the matter was to be child protection.  Only today I found out we were to speak on the actual report.  The report warrants debate in the House and I welcome that development.</P>
        <P>The report deals with 35 deaths and 16 serious incidents since March 2010 involving children in the care of the HSE, otherwise known to the organisation.  Causes were suicide, drug overdoses, road traffic accidents.  It made for very disturbing reading.  However shocking those tragedies are for us who read the report this pales into insignificance when compared to the devastation experienced by the families of those children.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, the report received very little coverage from the media.  I do not know the reason for this, perhaps we have seen so many reports on child protection throughout the years that the media have become immune to the subject.  That is a sad reflection, not only on the media but on us as a society.  Most of the coverage amounted to no more than opinion pieces saying how terrible and awful it was and asking what should be done about it, without really <Col N="36"/>addressing the core of the issue, which is that child protection services in this State are systematically flawed, are under-resourced and lack the robustness required of a system that is responsible for the safety and welfare of children.</P>
        <P>The review panel was established on foot of a recommendation in the Ryan report.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the establishment of the panel.  The HIQA guidance document that set out which incidents should be examined was so broad that it led to the work of the review panel being hindered in many ways.  That is not to say we would change any of the cases that fell under the remit of the review panel.  It is absolutely essential for there to be transparency in all of these cases.  All deaths of children who were in care or known to the HSE, all cases of abuse involving death and all deaths involving children in aftercare services must be kept within the remit of the review panel.</P>
        <P>The remit of the panel is so broad that additional resources are required.  It must be able to conduct its business adequately within a timeframe that is conducive to getting to the root causes of deaths.  It has to be able to identify where mistakes were made.  An unfortunate result of the criteria set out in the HIQA guidelines is that a substantial number of cases need to be examined.  The panel has to commence an incident review within four months and a death review within one month.  That is a very short timeframe given that the panel is dealing with such a large volume of cases.  It is for that reason that the child protection structures need to be adequately resourced.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whether we provide more funding so that the panel can operate at the required level, or increase the number of people who are examining these cases, the timeframes are simply too short and need to be addressed.  The review panel said in the report that the timeframes are unworkable.  It is clear that the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Health need to take this on board and examine it.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will consider the need to re-examine the guidelines that are in place.</P>
        <P>It is important for the Government to commit to resourcing and implementing changes that address the high number of cases that social workers have to deal with.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is doing her best in poor financial circumstances.  It is not just her responsibility, however.  The blame for cases of HSE child protection services failing to protect children does not lie squarely at the Minister&rsquo;s feet.  As I have said, she is doing a difficult job under significant financial constraints.  Her Cabinet colleagues are also responsible for ensuring the proper funding is in place to allow the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to do the job it needs to do.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister for Finance, who is holding the purse strings, to keep this area in mind when he is making budgetary decisions on the public expenditure of the HSE and the Department of Health.  It has to be acknowledged that, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said this morning, children are unfortunately bearing the burden of the economic catastrophe we are experiencing.  We constantly hear about children who are being taken into care.  Substantial numbers of children are being placed in care.  In some cases, that is happening not because of the inability of their parents or families to look after them, or because of a risk of abuse, but because their families simply cannot afford to raise them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As previous speakers have said, some children in this State go to school hungry every single day.  That is not the fault of their parents &mdash; it is the fault of the State for not providing services or resources to ensure it does not happen.  When children enter the foster care system, there is an irregular pattern to their appointments with social workers.  We need to address that.  There is a long and sad history of separated children who are seeking asylum in this State being <Col N="37"/>placed in inappropriate hostel accommodation before going missing from the system.  As a State, we have never been fully accountable for these children.</P>
        <P>I urge the Government to ensure the resources that are needed are provided.  The number of social workers should be increased, if possible.  The Government should make family-friendly budgetary decisions that ensure children can stay with their families.  State care is not a good place for children in Ireland.  The Government has an opportunity to make it better.  I am sure it has the support of all parties in this House in its efforts.  As I have said, the Cabinet as a whole needs to take responsibility for this issue.  The Minister for Finance needs to ensure adequate resources are given to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs so that children can be put first.</P>

The Minister has perhaps the most important job in the Cabinet.  For many people, she has become a signal of change and of a new start.  Children have been put first by the Government and the State.  It is important that a new Department is dedicated to children and youth affairs.  The Minister was correct when she said it would have been better if this had been done ten years ago.  The millions, if not billions, of euro that were spent on vanity projects could have been used more wisely.  Hindsight is a great thing.</P>
        <P>When parliamentarians are appointed to the Cabinet, they receive a seal of office from the Uachtar&aacute;n and accept responsibility for their portfolios.  Sadly, the State has been negligent in fulfilling many of its responsibilities.  I say that as a Member of this House who has been involved with children for a long time.  I have worked as a teacher and have been involved in Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  It is important, as stated in Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, that we all recognise our responsibilities, obligations and duties.  That is important for people who are involved with children at all levels, including parents, social workers, teachers, youth club workers and GAA trainers.</P>
        <P>I commend Deputy O&rsquo;Brien on his fine speech.  I disagree with part of what he said about one matter.  It is probably a bone of contention that will get me in a bit of trouble.  An element of abdication of responsibility is creeping into and permeating Irish society.  It is not correct to say that parents are not at fault in some cases.  They are sometimes at fault.  It should be possible for a person to say he or she is unable to be a parent.  As a State, we should be able to help such people out.  Vulnerable young women, in particular, have been let down by a State that has failed to assist them in the rearing of their children.</P>
        <P>One of the great tragedies of the world today is our failure to put children first.  We have not put children first.  Young people require assistance, help, leadership and understanding in their most formative years.  They need to be listened to, guided and brought along.  Those of us who studied psychology know that children engage in imitative behaviour.  Children imitate what they see and hear.  We have an obligation, a duty and a responsibility to look after them.</P>
        <P>The Children First guidelines state that no child should be shattered by abuse.  Sadly, that is not the case.  Look at one of the greatest universities in the world, Penn State in America.  It has a college football programme which brings in millions of dollars each year but it has been mired in controversy this week because it allowed &mdash; I had better be careful because I am not in full possession of the facts and only know what I have read and heard &mdash; the lure of the dollar to influence decisions in regard child protection.</P>
        <P>It is appalling that young children are shattered by abuse.  During August I wrote a piece in the <i>Evening Echo</i> on the Cloyne report.  I included a line in it, which I think was important, that for the first time ever, I knew one of the abused and one of the abusers.  It was an appalling position in which to be.  That young person who was abused will never forget it.  It saddens me <Col N="38"/>that we lived in a society in which we did not put the safety and protection of our children to the fore.  Hillary Clinton was right &mdash; this is where I agree with Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien &mdash; that it takes a village, a community, society, institutions, parents and grandparents to raise young people.  Deputy O&rsquo;Brien was also right when he spoke about the issue of fostering.  We have outstanding foster parents in our communities.  They reach out and bring the most vulnerable young people who need them the most into their homes.  Fostering must play a greater role.</P>
        <P>I have known the Minister for a long time and admire her as a person and as a Minister.  I am very happy she is in this Department because this debate is important.  To me, she is the most important Minister in Cabinet.  This is about the deaths of young people.  As the Minister said, any death is a tragedy but when it happens to young people in the care of the State, it is appalling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the establishment of the national review panel and the publication of the report.  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech today and her remarks prior to today.  She said there is a regime change and a willingness to make a difference and that there will be no abdication of responsibility.  She spoke about a stringent approach and I very much welcome the fact we are more stringent than the United Kingdom.  We have no reason not to be.</P>
        <P>It is important we have joined up thinking.  I do not know the answer to this but I hope the Minister will address it in her concluding remarks.  I hope we have joined up thinking between the Departments of Justice and Equality, Education and Skills, Social Protection, Health and the Minister&rsquo;s Department and that a lead is taken.  For too long, there was a culture of indecision, passing the buck and of not accepting responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I go back to that key word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  The State can no longer say it is not responsible and that it was someone else&rsquo;s job.  The reality is that the buck stops with of us, which is the way it should be.  There must be joined up thinking because as the Minister said, there are 6,215 young people in the care of the State.</P>
        <P>To go back to the Children First guidelines and striking a proper balance between protecting children and respecting the rights and needs of parents, carers and families, where there is conflict, the welfare of children must come first.  That is why the Minister has my full support in taking her time with the children&rsquo;s referendum.  Travel safely and slowly.  The Irish phrase, taisteal go mall, is very appropriate here.  There is no need to rush a referendum.  We all accept there is a compelling need to have one but we must take our time to ensure we get the result we want, which is guaranteeing the protection and the welfare of children.  If that requires time, I will support the Minister all the way because it is imperative that the rights of the child are taken seriously and that we understand the approach to be taken.  I might not be correct in saying that but it is important we take our time.</P>
        <P>A recent referendum was defeated.  Some people in the Opposition were waiting to snipe at the Government and to vote against it.  There were others in the wings who came in with a red herring.  This referendum is far too important to play politics with it.  It is about the most vulnerable children in our society.</P>
        <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; a lot in her speech.  It is a grandiose word which I like because it covers a multitude.  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien referred to resources.  The Minister said there was approval for additional social workers which is necessary as it is critical that there is an adequate number of social workers.  However, resources are not everything.  It cannot all be about resources and allocation of same because as the Minister said, there will be more than 25,000 referrals to social work child protection teams in 2011.  That is a huge figure and why I go back to the following fundamental point.  Given that the Minister accepts <Col N="39"/>we have limited resources, there is a compelling need to have joined up thinking across all the Departments, institutions and organisations.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact the Minister said that 99% of all children in residential care have an allocated social worker, with 96% having a written care plan.  We all accept it should be 100%.  A written care plan is a key component and is important because it gives an identity and a sense of individualism to the person.  We are talking about people here.  These are not figures but people who we need to protect and look after.  We have a responsibility to do that.</P>
        <P>I refer to the multidisciplinary team approach to child abuse and neglect.  If we are to make progress and achieve results, that multidisciplinary team must report and be answerable to somebody.  It is not about buying a solution or publishing grandiose plans with PowerPoint presentations in glossy brochures.  Those of us who work at the coalface of community and society either as teachers or volunteers understand those families which are struggling.  We must offer the child who feels unprotected or unloved more than hope or platitudes in a guideline.</P>
        <P>The GAA was one of the first organisations to introduce child protection.  It did so at a time when such measures were not so widespread.  I was involved in the implementation of this child protection code.  Now, thankfully every club and county board has a child protection officer.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has my full support in her difficult job.  However, she will make change happen.  I believe in 25 years when the history of this period in politics is written, she will be seen as the driver of transformation in child protection measures.  This report cannot be left on a shelf gathering dust but must be built upon.  At the same time, after the recent referendum on Oireachtas inquires, we must get the children&rsquo;s rights amendment to the Constitution right.  Taisteal go mall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have to take issue with Deputy Buttimer as one of those who opposed the referendum on Oireachtas inquiries.  We were not sniping but had grave and serious reservations about the effect Oireachtas inquiries could have on a person&rsquo;s good name.  We just wanted to express those.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaureenOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but that was the context in which it happened.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien, being informed this morning that we were to debate an actual report rather than child protection generally was disappointing as I would have liked to have had more time to prepare.</P>
        <P>The report investigated the deaths of children in care, including deaths by natural causes, the deaths of children known to the child protection system, the deaths of young adults up to 21 years of age who were in the care of the Health Service Executive prior to their 18th birthday, in cases where confirmed or suspected abuse involved the death of or a serious injury to a child known to the HSE and serious incidents involving a child in care or known to the child protection service.  This list is an appalling vista.  Each of these deaths is regrettable and had to be investigated.</P>
        <P>I am also conscious of those who died while in the care of the State in residential institutions and the Magdalene laundries.  It is important to identify weaknesses in policy and practice.  Vulnerable young people can become involved with a variety of services.  All too often, because there are so many services involved, these young people can get lost between them all.  It is important there is one key worker in charge of all of this to ensure no child falls through the gaps.</P><Col N="40"/>
        <P>It is important the State acknowledges blame if it has contributed to any of the cases in question.  The Minister claimed child protection is complex and challenging.  I do not entirely agree with this.  It would not be complex if the child were put at the centre of the care model.  I know of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to this issue and acknowledge the work she has already done with the interdepartmental group, the publication of the Children First guidelines and the child protection welfare practice handbook and the meetings she has held with various agencies and groups.  Her background in social work helps in this.</P>
        <P>The line &ldquo;That changed some childish day to tragedy&rdquo; in W. B. Yeats&rsquo;s &ldquo;Among School Children&rdquo; always struck me because no child&rsquo;s day should end up in tragedy.  It is up to parents, society, schools and those social workers, probation officers, garda&iacute; and youth workers, who through their work come in contact with children, to ensure children&rsquo;s rights are respected.  The Government and Parliament also have a role to play in this regard and it is vital children&rsquo;s rights are inserted into the Constitution.  That is all paperwork as it were, however.</P>
        <P>Childhood should be a time of happiness and joy, a time of exploring and learning about boundaries.  It should be a time when the adults in the lives of children offer support and guidance.  All of this must contribute to the child&rsquo;s sense of self-esteem and self worth.  If we get this right, the child will be able to move into adulthood, taking his or her place in society.  It is most unfortunate this does not happen for significant numbers of children.</P>
        <P>Many teachers, when they encounter a child for the first time in junior infants, have a good idea what road the child will take because of family and socio-economic background.  Every child must have the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential.  To achieve this, areas such as housing, schools, play and leisure activities must be involved.  In the home, a child must feel protected and safe.  We know this is not the case for all children.  The State must play a more proactive role in providing safeguards and supports in such cases.</P>
        <P>I know many dedicated social workers committed to the young people in their care.  However, there are serious gaps in the service.  Social workers need to be involved more in preventive strategies with families, in improving parental capacity and so reduce the risk of harm or abuse to children.  It is vital early intervention is developed to avoid cases escalating and becoming a crisis management.  With over 6,000 children in care, the biggest scandal is the lack of out-of-hours social services.</P>
        <P>Due to these gaps, more children and teenagers are ending up in the juvenile justice system.  Serious concerns have been expressed that boys of 16 and 17 years of age are still detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, an environment not suitable to their needs as pointed out by the Irish Penal Reform Trust and many of the chaplains working in the Prison Service.  At a briefing yesterday, the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, said the very fact that children were being incarcerated in a prison is a serious contravention of international human rights standards.  If resources were put into prevention, no child would end up in prison.  The Inspector of Prisons noted in 2009 that 25% of the juvenile population in St. Patrick&rsquo;s requested to be held in protection, fearing for their own safety.  While 16 and 17 year olds do not consider themselves as children, they still are legally.  Those detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s should not be detained there.  We know the type of skills they will learn in prison which will only have them back there in the future.  We also know the significant number of people from certain areas in Dublin, some of which I represent, who are in and out of prison.</P>
        <P>Schooling is not a level playing field.  Schooling and education should further and enhance equality, not contribute to inequality.  As both a teacher and through my involvement in voluntary youth work since the 1960s, I know how preventive measures can work.  Getting children and young people into clubs, sporting organisations, art, music and drama, much of which is <Col N="41"/>organised by volunteers, is very important to their development.  The young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, which is now based in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, is a great initiative introduced ten years ago, making moneys available for capital projects, services and programmes.  I chaired the group for north inner city Dublin.  It was aimed at those most at risk of drug abuse and drug misuse.  It provided many examples of great engagement with young people giving them opportunities to develop their talents and have fun while ensuring they were not involved in anti-social behaviour.  In recent budgets, funding for many of these groups and clubs has been cut, leaving many in a precarious position, however.  These are the groups working directly with young people to keep them out of the system this very report investigated.  We have Garda diversion projects, the juvenile liaison officer system, case management of those coming to the attention of the law, and the Breaking the Cycle programmes.  There is much good work going on directly with young people, and it is making a difference.</P>
        <P>There are groups of young people who are particularly vulnerable, and the homeless are one of those groups.  Serious child protection issues arise and there is a need for the youth homelessness strategy to be replaced.  I suggest asking somebody like Peter McVerry for his input in that particular area.</P>
        <P>Regarding migrant children, in Dublin&rsquo;s inner city there are very good youth projects working with unaccompanied minors but we have a complex immigration-residency-asylum system and we need a more efficient system of citizenship applications within a reasonable time.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight again those children who have gone missing, some of them from State care.</P>
        <P>On the removal of separated children to direct provision centres once they turn 18, I had some examples of that in a particular school.  The young migrant children had completed fifth year but because they turned 18 they were moved out of the school and out of Dublin.  I met the officials but they were not prepared to look at the individual.  It was a system but no system will work unless we take the individual into account.</P>
        <P>Regarding Traveller children, I know there are difficulties in this area because my own school was involved with Traveller education and there are no easy answers on that issue.</P>
        <P>In terms of young people who turn to drugs and alcohol misuse and become addicted, on Monday night I attended one of the inner city projects, Soilse, where young men and women, some teenagers and some slightly older, were being awarded certificates because they had come through detox, recovery, rehabilitation and residential group work.  Every one of those young people was in a positive place because the project was there to support them.  The money for that project is saving the State far more than if those young people had continued on the addiction road.  What struck me about them is that all of them wanted to give something back, and they wanted to do that with other young people.</P>
        <P>We discussed previously the missing children hotline.  We are one of the countries in Europe which has not put that in place.  We know that the first 24 hours are crucial to safely recovering missing children and having a common helpline in member states of the European Union would speed up that vital response.</P>
        <P>Regarding young people suffering homophobic bullying, we have a great organisation in Dublin Central called BeLonG To which is doing tremendous work with gay, lesbian and transgender young people.</P>
        <P>The media coverage of young people was alluded to earlier.  Hallowe&rsquo;en is a problematic time for young people.  Where I live in East Wall we had a terrific programme and one of the events was a parade which involved more than 800 people walking through the streets on Hallowe&rsquo;en night.  The Garda referred to the fact that there was no trouble at the parade but <Col N="42"/>the media, most inappropriately, insisted on carrying stories involving the area which gave a completely different impression.  There was no coverage of the positive events that went on organised by young people with the youth leaders for young people.</P>
        <P>This morning we had a group in for the cross-party mental health group, Unilink, organised by Deputy Simon Harris.  That is a group of people in third level working with vulnerable students who they want to retain in the system, and we were all impressed by the work they were doing.  It was to do with the way they saw an issue.  They did not wait for the State to do anything but got involved themselves.  There are many examples of that going on because sometimes the State gets caught up in the bureaucracy and the people get lost in that.</P>
        <P>We talk about our assets, money, economics etc. but our most valuable asset is our children and they must be protected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonHarris"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, possibly with Deputy Feighan.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to these statements on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the first annual report of the national review panel on serious incidents including the death of children in care.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs acknowledged that debating these issues of reports arising from times when the State and other institutions failed to protect children must be extremely painful and difficult for families affected.  However, I hope they can take some comfort in the knowledge that at least as a State we are now facing up to the neglect of the past, acknowledging the mistakes that have taken place and trying to move forward and ensuring that never again will we live in a country where child protection issues are brushed under the mat and not discussed.</P>
        <P>What this raft of reports has done to the Irish psyche and the psyche of many parents across this country is damage their belief in the State.  The job the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, this Government, this Oireachtas and the broader State is charged with is restoring trust and confidence in any of the services to do with child protection.  That is a crucial point.</P>
        <P>For as long as I can remember politics in this country has been dominated by the economy.  In the boom years we were assessing the wealth of this nation in terms of the number of sun holidays the average family could take, the year of the car or cars in the driveway and the amount of money in one&rsquo;s bank account.  We measured our national wealth in crude economic terms alone while at the same time many issues regarding child protection were ignored and the voices of children silenced at a time when this country had more money than sense.  As we set about now rebuilding our economy we must remember and place at the forefront of all public discourse that repairing our economy is not an end in itself but merely a means to an end.  It is a method of ensuring that as a nation we have the means to invest in our most important asset, our children, who are this country&rsquo;s future.  We saw millions, and probably billions, of euro squandered and lost, something to which my colleague, Deputy Buttimer, alluded earlier.  E-voting, the Bertie bowl and PPARS are just some of the words that ring in the ears of citizens when they consider the mistakes of the past.</P>
        <P>One can only reflect, and someone in the position of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, must reflect on this regularly, on how those public funds could have been put to much better use.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s legacy and any time there appears to be any type of difficulty, figures or reports she comes in for robust criticism from the Opposition, particularly from the previous Government.  That criticism is superficial and hypocritical at best.  At a time when this country was wealthy action was not taken.  The Minister has achieved more in the past eight months <Col N="43"/>while this country is in receivership &mdash; effectively in the ownership of the IMF and the ECB &mdash; than others achieved in 14 years and it is important to put that on the record of this House.</P>
        <P>The Minister is now leading the first ever Cabinet level Department specifically and exclusively charged with children and their interests, needs and safety.  That sends out an important message about this country, this Government and our ethos and attitude towards children.</P>
        <P>Much has happened to date and one of the most important things, in terms of sending out a message that there is a new regime in charge and that we are taking a different approach to this area, is when the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, made the decision to personally chair the group implementing the recommendations from the Ryan report.  We all remember the widespread and rightful anger, hurt and upset upon the publication of the Ryan report but it is very easy for that anger to dissipate as time passes.  What is much more important and responsible is for somebody to politically take charge, chair the committee and take personal and political responsibility for action.  That would be a new departure.</P>
        <P>It is also important to note that the two pilot projects on out of hours services in both Donegal and Cork are now in place.  I hope they continue, that the referendum is progressing and that much work is being done behind the scenes on that.  The Minister has acted on those issues and that gives me the confidence, as a Government Deputy, to believe she will act on the recommendations of this annual report also.  The recommendations refer to the standardisation of assessment and inter-agency work and much of the Minister&rsquo;s legislative agenda and putting those on a statutory footing will go some way towards meeting those recommendations.</P>
        <P>Great praise must be given to Dr. Buckley and her colleagues who carried out this piece of work.  The T&aacute;naiste made a comment not long ago in Government Buildings when launching the review of various public sector bodies about the vilification of public servants in the past by the previous Government.  This report tells us that in many cases good practice was being followed.  There were good, decent people doing their very best in very difficult circumstances and they were let down by a lack of inter-agency co-operation, a lack of information sharing and a lack of standardisation in the way problems were dealt with, received and reported.  There are good people working in the area of child protection and that must be acknowledged because now more than ever we need the morale of those people to be high.  We need them to put their shoulder to the wheel and I am confident they will do that.  It is important that we do not personally vilify people who have been professionally charged.  There is an accountability issue but the problems in the area of child protection go much wider than any individual.</P>
        <P>We hear a great deal about red herrings when it comes to child protection, and the seal of the confessional was one of those.  As a Government and an Oireachtas I urge that we debunk every red herring thrown at us.  We have seen in the past the way referenda can be defeated.  We should make sure that when the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights is put before the people we debunk all the myths.  There is no evidence to suggest that children&rsquo;s rights counteract parental rights.  We should be able to secure broad political and societal support for a referendum on children&rsquo;s rights and I hope we do so.  I concur with colleagues that it is vital the referendum is held as a matter of urgency but it should not be held one moment before the proper wording has been agreed.  We will not have a second chance, as was the case with previous referendums.  The Minister is seeking an important constitutional change and will only have one go at securing it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Clearly, the Minister and her Department will uncover more examples of neglect and State failure.  They would probably not be doing their job if they did not find more such cases.  For a long time, such failures were brushed under the carpet, concealed and not talked about.  I expect we will go through a difficult period in which we will learn of more cases that disgust <Col N="44"/>and appal us.  We should be encouraged and enthused, however, given that the issue if finally being addressed.</P>
        <P>I will pick up on a point made by Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan on the Ombudsman for Children because we need to learn an important lesson in this regard.  A small group of children still does not have access to the services of the Ombudsman for Children.  The Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Quinn, have stated in the Chamber and in reply to written parliamentary questions that they will examine the possibility of extending the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to vulnerable children who interact with the National Council for Special Education.  The inability of the Ombudsman for Children to interact with children detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is another bizarre anomaly.  I ask the Minister to have her officials examine this issue, which has been flagged by the Ombudsman for Children and should be rectified.</P>
        <P>This is an exciting time in politics because children and youth affairs is finally being prioritised.  This area is no longer covered by a super junior Ministry or committee chairmanship but by a Cabinet level Minister who sits alongside all other senior Ministers.  I concur with Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien that it is crucial that the Minister is given the resources and supports in Cabinet to fulfil her role.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to establish the Department is an indication of the importance he attaches to it.  I wish the Minister well and thank her for her work to date.  It is essential that we proceed with the legislative changes required and the referendum on children&rsquo;s rights as quickly as possible.  I hope the quick action taken by the Minister and the political accountability she has shown in the past eight months are enhanced, maintained and encouraged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the wide range of comments made in the course of the debate and the acknowledgement by many Deputies of the importance not only of the issue before us but also the broader issue of child protection and the need to develop services and provide the resources required in this area.  I also note their concern that children should be placed centre stage and resources must be allocated to ensure we deliver the type of integrated services that are required.</P>
        <P>Clearly, there are major legacy issues in the area of child protection, which has been underfunded, under-resourced, under-attended and, in recent years, cut back.  Moreover, information on child protection has lacked consistency.  I am shocked by much of what I am uncovering in respect of the lack of data about the state of child protection services.  A systemic audit of the services is being carried out and I will publish data and bring them to the attention of Deputies as I receive them.  It is important that we carry out a serious examination of child protection services and the serious challenges faced by those on the front line.</P>
        <P>I will not be able to repair the deficit in children&rsquo;s services overnight.  While this task will take time to complete, I am confident that the building blocks are beginning to be put in place to ensure we have a child protection service of which we can be proud.  I await a number of further reports.  I will shortly receive a report on child deaths over the past ten years and the HSE audit of the church dioceses will also be presented shortly, as will a number of other reports.  These will paint a disturbing picture and present a major challenge.</P>
        <P>As I noted, the area of child protection has been underfunded.  Serious cutbacks were imposed on the services last year.  The provision for child protection services in the HSE was underfunded and continues to show a serious deficit.  Proper provision has not been made for this area over the years and funding provisions have been absorbed into other areas.  All of this makes for a highly challenging scenario.</P><Col N="45"/>
        <P>Deputies raised a wide range of issues.  In response to Deputy Harris&rsquo;s point on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, I will ask my officials to examine the issue.  I am concerned that 16 and 17 year old children remain in the institution.  While I do not have budgetary provision for moving the young people in question elsewhere, the Government remains committed to delivering such a change in its lifetime.  I am discussing this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who understands its seriousness and the need for decisions to be taken.</P>
        <P>Deputies spoke of the range of factors which affect children, many of which were referred to in the national review panel report.  Young children experiencing poverty is clearly a pressure while the most common form of abuse is neglect.  Many families are presenting to the child and family services.</P>
        <P>The children&rsquo;s referendum will be held in 2012.  It is important to note that all lobbying groups and specialist agencies in the area of child protection supported my decision to take time to get the wording right and ensure people understand the reasons the referendum is necessary.  If anything, recent developments have reinforced the need for members of the public to understand the reasons for referendums and their nuances and implications.  Only then will they support the children&rsquo;s referendum.  I look forward to working with all those who spoke on the issue and receiving cross-party support when we publish the referendum wording.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A number of Deputies referred to the number of social workers.  By the end of 2011, an additional 60 social workers will be in place, all of which are new and extra posts.  It is important to note that we have maintained social worker numbers in the face of extraordinary financial pressures.  I pay tribute to the work of Mr. Gordon Jeyes who is under great pressure regarding the filling of new social worker posts.  I confirm that the HSE national director is filling vacancies.  Many members of the HSE social work service have gone on maternity leave in the past year and many of the subsequent vacancies have been filled despite the significant financial pressures facing the HSE.  I would like to have more resources to build social work teams but the financial pressures on the HSE and child and family protection services are severe.  Budgets are contracting at a time of significant additional cost pressures arising from the courts demanding more specialist care for children and increasing costs in the guardian <i>ad litem</i> system.  I reiterate that I regret some of these issues were not addressed more comprehensively when more money was available.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies referred to after care.  In the past year, aftercare workers have been allocated to approximately 1,000 young people and a new aftercare policy has been introduced which will make a difference.  We must provide continuous care as opposed to aftercare because that is what young people who have been in care need.  There is significant new awareness of this issue and a commitment to providing this type of care in the HSE.</P>
        <P>It is unrealistic for Deputies to ask the reason the child and family support agency has not yet been established.  It will take some time to make the transition from the Health Service Executive.  A task force is examining the transition and we are disaggregating the work of the child and family services in the HSE and creating a new budget line.  In the coming year a shadow agency will start to operate in the HSE and the new agency will be in place by January 2013.</P>
        <P>There is serious work to be done on the transfer of staff.  Several Deputies spoke about this challenge and gave support to those staff, and I will certainly take their points on board.</P>
        <P>There has been much progress.  Deputies who talk about going backwards are not appreciating the rate of change and the amount of change that has taken place.  We have set up a cross-departmental working group to deal with the implementation of Children First.  I am now chairing the Ryan implementation group.  The progress report of the implementation group <Col N="46"/>was placed before the House in July.  Many Deputies raised the question of an out-of-hours service.  We now have two pilot projects in Cork and Donegal.  We now have an implementation group to oversee the roll-out of a national out of hours service.  Many other initiatives have taken place.  The Garda vetting Bill will be in place over the next few months.  There has been much progress, but the challenge is enormous.</P>
        <P>I want to thank all the Deputies who spoke on this report today.  HIQA is examining the report and its officials will discuss whether the terms of reference should be changed for examining the deaths of children who have been in contact with the HSE or who are in care.  I will ensure that this work is done promptly, so that we can take on board the recommendations made by Professor Helen Buckley, who produced the report in the first place.</P>
        <P>I also thank the Deputies for the range of issues they raised today, and I look forward to further debates on this important area of child protection and welfare.</P>

    <Title>Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill 2011: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is inadequate to deal with the problem that it attempts to address.  It is fundamentally dictated more by free market ideology, and the addiction of the troika to that free market ideology, than it is by any serious attempt to grapple with our real problems with health care provision in Ireland.  This Bill is essentially trying to create a free market in GP services, with the implication that this will solve our problems with providing health care for people.  I fundamentally disagree with that.</P>
        <P>There is a manpower problem with the provision of GP services.  The demand for GPs is expected to rise over the coming years, given a rising and ageing population.  Compared with other OECD countries, we have a low proportion of GPs relative to the population.  I think we have 0.6 GPs per thousand people in Ireland which, according to a recent study carried out by the Competition Authority, is low when compared with continental countries.  We certainly need to expand the number of GPs.  It might appear a benign and uncontroversial intention to expand the number, access and choice of GPs by removing restrictions on which GPs are allowed to see medical card holders, but the Bill suggests that this must be done by creating a free market.  I have a fundamental problem with free markets, especially in health services.  I do not see the provision of health care to human beings in those terms.  It is not about creating markets.  I do not think there is any strong evidence to suggest that by creating a free market in GP services, the number of GPs will be increased or access to them will improve.</P>
        <P>What is necessary is what the Government promised in its programme for Government, namely, free GP care provided by a system other than one where people have to pay.  In so far as there may be disincentives for GPs, the problem for ordinary people in going to GPs these days is that they have to pay at all.  Many people who do not have access to medical cards just do not go to the doctor.  It is a budgetary decision.  With the worsening economic conditions, with higher levels of unemployment and with the pressure on people&rsquo;s wages as a result of the austerity programmes being implemented by this Government and the previous Government at the behest of the troika, more people just do not go to the doctor or have to think twice about doing so.  For those who are just over the threshold for medical cards, going to the doctor is a serious budgetary decision.  That is the problem that must be tackled, but creating a free market in GP services is not the answer.  It just reflects the false ideological belief that if competition is created in GP services or in the provision of any service, this will lower prices.  I would like to see some hard evidence of that, because I do not think there is any.</P><Col N="47"/>
        <P>When is the free GP care plan going to be introduced?  That is what we need, so that everybody has access to GP services and it will not be a budgetary consideration.  They will go to a doctor because they need to see one, and will not have to question whether they can afford it.  I suspect that the focus of this legislation on creating a market, moving away from a planned approach to the provision of health services, reflects the longer term plan of the Government to deliver universal health provision and cover.  The Government sees this provision as being carried out by private health insurance companies.  Again, it is the obsession with the private sector as the means to deliver health services, which to my mind are just too important to be left to for-profit companies.  A sector in which competition for profit is the main dynamic is not designed to deliver a service that people should get as a matter of right and not because somebody can make a profit from it.  It is linked to that thinking, which is mistaken.  There should be a national health service, with GPs employed directly by this service on public general practice contracts.  A planned approach is required; we should sit down and work out how many GPs we need and where we need them, then employ those GPs.  That would also deal with another problem people are facing, which is overcharging by GPs.  We have a scandalous situation in which people are in some cases being charged &euro;70 to see a GP.  There may be arguments about rents in particular areas or the staff they must employ, but when there is such a wide variation, with some GPs charging &euro;35 and others charging &euro;70, it seems that someone is profiteering on the back of this situation.</P>
        <P>The Minister thinks competition will be the way to deal with it &mdash; that is what is implied in the legislation &mdash; but I do not agree.  The way to deal with it is through a single public-service GP contract under which the Department of Health decides how many GPs we need based on population trends and current service shortfalls and then employs the GPs we need, funded through progressive central taxation.  That means we must bite the bullet that this Government, and the authorities in Europe who are obsessed with neo-liberal market ideology, do not want to bite.  There must be an option of increasing taxes on wealth and having a genuinely progressive tax system in which a wealthy minority, who have essentially escaped making a contribution to our society and to the provision of services, are forced to pay their fair share through higher rates of income tax.  That is what we need if we are to fund a proper health service and ensure that everybody gets health care as a right.  If we did that, we might also make some contribution towards dealing with the crisis in our hospitals and accident and emergency departments.  The disincentive for people to see their GPs due to the punitive cost of doing so means their conditions worsen unnecessarily because they do not receive early intervention.  They wait until they are really sick and then present at accident and emergency units, which cannot cope with them.</P>
        <P>We need to break with the fixation with market solutions, particularly in an area as vital as health care, which should be a right for all our citizens.  This is even more of an urgent priority now, given that financial and economic constraints resulting from the recession and austerity measures mean it is even more difficult for people to access the health care they need.  We need a different approach which involves the establishment of a national health service funded through progressive taxation and a planned system under which the State employs doctors to provide GP services.  That is how we will keep our doctors.  If they do not have to depend on the ups and downs of markets to sustain a practice, they are more likely to stay here.  They will be employed by the State because it has an obligation to provide health care to its citizens.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>Since there is no speaker from Fianna F&aacute;il in the Chamber, I call on Deputy Dara Murphy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I must admit I got a fright a minute ago when I heard the Deputy opposite calling for the establishment of a contract <Col N="48"/>between GPs and the State, even though we are here to speak about the contract that already exists, which we are seeking to amend.  I am not exactly sure what he was talking about but, as the French would say, <i>plus &ccedil;a change</i> &mdash; nothing changes there.</P>
        <P>The Health (Provision of General Practitioner Services) Bill will enable a wider range of registered medical practitioners to provide medical services to eligible persons under the existing contract, the GMS scheme, and provide for the necessary modifications and related matters.  If one takes a very narrow view, it is correct to say that there is a commitment under the EU-IMF programme we have inherited that various measures will be established by the Government.  However, we must also acknowledge that, by virtue of the fact that we functioned without a Government for many of the last 14 years &mdash; before February of this year &mdash; much of what the Government is now putting in place is purely down to good governance rather than to some albatross that has been unfairly placed around our necks by a third party that is interfering unnecessarily with our affairs.</P>
        <P>I spoke last week on a similar issue, that of competition in the energy supply sector.  Again, this was one of the projects we committed to undertake during the third quarter as part of our programme.  It must be acknowledged that, while we are working through the programme, it is nonsensical and irrational to suggest that every element, or even most elements, of the EU-IMF programme are to the disadvantage of our country.  In fact, the contrary is the case.</P>
        <P>The Minister is here with us.  Primary care and GP provision are in many ways the areas of the health service that have functioned best to date.  People all over the country interact with their general practitioners and have good relationships with them.  Thankfully, for most people, the main area in which we engage with health services is through our general practitioners.  They, their staff and their surgeries are a resource that needs to be developed and used, not just for saving money &mdash; though I believe they are a significant benefit to the State &mdash; but because they provide a far superior way for patients to engage with their doctors.  I call on the GP groups and medical organisations to embrace the great work the Minister has done to date in encouraging far greater use of general practitioners and the primary care model.  I take this opportunity to welcome the announcement in the recent capital budget of the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to the development of the primary care model &mdash; especially, to be parochial, in my own area of the north side of Cork city &mdash; and I urge the Minister to continue on this very good path.</P>
        <P>A consultant in emergency medicine pointed out to me that 85% of the people who come to his accident and emergency department are what he refers to as ambulatory &mdash; in other words, they walk in and walk out.  He suggested that many of them need not be there at all.  By virtue of the purpose of accident and emergency units people who present with a greater degree of medical distress must be treated first and no one could dispute this.</P>
        <P>However, we must continue to encourage people to bypass, where possible, the feeling that they should go to an accident and emergency unit.  To do so, we must continue to reform and improve the system under which general practitioners provide their services.  This is the main provision of the Bill.  At present GPs only obtain general medical services, GMS, contracts in restricted circumstances, for example, where a vacancy arises through retirement, resignation, where the death of a GMS doctor occurs or where a new GMS panel is created in response to a specific, identified need for an additional doctor in a given area.  However, given the current lack of growth in population in most of the country this is unlikely to arise much.</P>
        <P>The Bill will open up access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.  There will be no limits of contractors and this should be welcomed.  There is a point to the effect that medical services should not be viewed in a cold, economic, mercenary or competitive <Col N="49"/>business environment.  However, at the same time people who are qualified in the same fashion as other medical practitioners and who have contracts should be entitled to a reasonable expectation that they will be able to provide the services for which they have been trained, by virtue of the significant cost the State has invested in them and the significant costs and time they have invested in becoming qualified.</P>
        <P>Another issue arises which has been brought to my attention by general practitioners.  This is somewhat of a digression but it is a medical issue.  There is a social cost in our society related to general practice and how those involved engage with it.  The area of alcohol abuse and how it is damaging the health and wealth of the people may need some regulation from the Government.  I have long held the view that we should increase the permitted age for the consumption of alcoholic spirits in our country to 21 years.  I do not include beer and wine in this proposal.  There are significant social costs from the practice and it has changed from my time, when people would drink pints and ease in to what is accepted as a part of our drinking culture.  However, now there is too much consumption of spirits.  While the American model of prohibition of any alcohol consumption up to the age of 21 years is going too far, there is a strong case for some measures.  I urge the Minister to examine the issue.  There is a case to be made whereby people would not be allowed to drink more damaging spirits until they have more experience in the matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome this important initiative in the development of our community based health care services.  I welcome the commitment to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors.  I represent a constituency with both urban and significant rural areas with many houses and families spread out over a wide geographical area.  I am keen to ensure that all residents in my constituency and throughout the country will be able to access the same standard of care.  We cannot allow a situation to arise whereby rural residents are deprived of the same standard of care as their urban peers due to urban areas being seen as more profitable.  I compliment the Minister on following up on the Fine Gael general election manifesto and on his strong support to date for primary care medicine in Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughtonJnr"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that what Deputy Murphy was saying?</P>
        <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on this important Bill which will allow suitably qualified GPs to treat private patients along with patients holding full medical cards and doctor visit cards.  There are many positive aspects to the Bill.  It encourages competition and, hopefully, it will drive down the cost of a GP visit for families.  It will facilitate newly-qualified GPs to stay in Ireland and it will hopefully allow many GPs to establish practices in the regional towns throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is a sad reflection on the previous Government that such legislation has only come about following prompting through the EU-IMF programme of commitments to remove restrictions to sheltered sectors and I commend the Minister on the speed with which this legislation is being enacted and the fact that this is another pre-election promise delivered upon.</P><Col N="50"/>
        <P>In the past, younger, properly qualified GPs were unable to set up GP practices because of the rules which restricted GPs wishing to treat public patients.  That situation prevented many young, highly-qualified and highly-trained GPs from obtaining a GMS contract early in their careers and many opted to work abroad as a result.  Those who did set up business were restricted to private practise and given the downturn in the economy in recent years, many of their patients found themselves to be eligible for medical cards and could not continue to be treated by their family doctor of many years.  When the Bill is enacted, new GMS contract holders will be free to establish their practice in the location of their choice and existing contract holders will also have the opportunity to move with the prior approval of the HSE.</P>
        <P>GPs are a vital cog in the wheel of the health service.  Without enough GPs, more pressure will be brought to bear on emergency departments, many of which are already under significant pressure with an increase in the volume of patients.  Increased pressure in emergency departments puts pressure on the entire hospital service.</P>
        <P>One major benefit of the Bill is that it removes the barriers in place previously in terms of setting up a general practice.  The number of GPs holding GMS contracts has been rising steadily but there are currently approximately 2,800 registered GPs practising in Ireland, a low ratio compared to our European counterparts.  Ireland will face a severe manpower shortage in general practitioners in the near future.  Up to one third of GPs are expected to retire in the next ten years and survey results show that by 2020 almost 30% of female GPs and 5% of male GPs will be working part-time.  Steps have been taken to address this problem, including a doubling of the intake of medical students and an increase the number of GP training places from 120 to 157.</P>
        <P>One major aspect of the Bill is the fact that it creates competition among GPs and this should benefit many hard-pressed families throughout Ireland.  One quarter of the population have no health care cover, either through medical card or private insurance and one half of this number have made no GP visits in the past year.  Costs are keeping many people away from their GP.  In addition, many families are excluded from the medical card system because the assessment of self-employed people may relate to years when their income was a good deal higher than it is at present.</P>
        <P>Despite the recession, there has been little downward movement in terms of prices charged by GPs.  A fee of &euro;45 appears to be at the lower end of the scale, with some city practices charging &euro;70 per visit.  This is the case at a time when OECD statistics indicate that GPs here are paid more than their counterparts in the United Kingdom, Germany, France or Sweden.  Since 1 June dentists have been obliged to display prices for their services publicly.  This requirement should be extended to GPs.  The obligation to display prices, along with dental tourism, has seen significant reductions in the prices charged for dental consultations.  A survey by the National Consumer Agency last year showed that 50% of GPs display their prices.  While price is not the only consideration when it comes to choosing a GP, in these times it is an important consideration for many families.  People should consider visiting sites such as <i>whatclinic.com</i>, a database of doctors, including prices where available.</P>
        <P>The Bill is to be welcomed.  It will give medical card and GP visit card patients a wider choice of GPs.  It will encourage young GPs to remain in Ireland and it will encourage much-needed competition among our doctors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekKeating"><NameTxt>Deputy Derek Keating</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I raise the issue of medical card cover for a patient who is retired and residing in the greater Dublin area but who, for example, has family in Cork, Galway or Donegal.  Such a person may decide to stay with a family member for several weeks, for example, in the case of their going on holiday to the <Col N="51"/>family home in these areas.  It is important that the medical card cover he or she has for his or her GP in Dublin should cover him or her if he or she needs to see a GP in the locality where he or she is visiting and staying for a short period.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed by the HSE.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to deal with the anomalies of the GMS and GP relationship.  I hope he will agree it is extremely worrying that a quarter of the population has no health care cover either through a medical card or a private health insurance policy.  There is also evidence to show a significant proportion of the population do not visit their GP or access a GP service because of the cost of such a visit, something which was demonstrated very clearly on television last night.</P>
        <P>I welcome the principles of this Bill.  However, I have concerns.  They are based on the fact that our medical service should not be monitored just because of costs to the patient or client.  Like our education system, we should have universal medical cover available to every citizen as a right.  I welcome this move but health care is not a business.  It is much more important than that and, as has been said many times in this House by many Ministers and other Deputies, we do not live in an economy.  We live in a society, a community where the welfare of every citizen should be to the fore in all our actions.</P>
        <P>Another point I want to draw attention to is the manpower problem regarding doctors graduating and the GP service generally.  This has been touched on already but it warrants more attention.  I understand in 2005 some 315 graduates qualified in medicine and this figure is expected to increase to 651 by 2014.  The number of GP training places will increase from 120 to 157 this year.</P>
        <P>I raise this point because the reality is that in some parts of Dublin there are waiting lists to access the services of a GP.  In my constituency, Dublin Mid West, it is very difficult to access a new GP.  I am aware of the plans to open the new primary care centre in Cherry Orchard Hospital in the new year and I am aware of the effect it will have when new contracts are offered to GPs covering the Palmerstown area.</P>
        <P>It is essential that this Bill is successful in addressing the major issues in our health system at the current time.  As the Minister is aware, it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to move the direction away from the hospital back to the community using the primary care system as the main focus of health provision for families and individuals.  Hospitals are the centres for illness.  GPs and primary care centres should be the centres of medical management.  A central component of the primary care system is the GP.  It is simply unacceptable that our accident and emergency departments have been acting as a filtering service because of the lack of and availability of GPs in our community.</P>
        <P>Another essential point that needs to be highlighted is the fact that the Irish population will rise to over 5 million by 2020, which is a little over eight years away.  Given that our dependent elderly are encouraged to visit their GPs more and more to anticipate the onset of illness, particularly coming up to the winter months, it is essential that our GP service is capable of taking on the task of providing a primary health service in the community, which is the Government&rsquo;s policy.  I am aware that some GP clinics are not accessible by wheelchairs or those with mobility problems.  This, too, needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Bill will go a long way to addressing many of the issues I have raised.  I am fully supportive of the provision in the Bill to remove the restrictions on GPs treating public patients.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s view on the role of HIQA and what its role will be in regard to standards of service provision by GPs.  Another important issue is whether there will be a requirement for GPs to publish their fees. something which is required by dentists, solicitors and other professions.</P><Col N="52"/>
        <P>The current cost of visiting a GP ranges from &euro;35 to &euro;80 depending on the area in which the practice is based.  Earlier this year the Competition Authority stated this issue was a major impediment for patients who are reluctant to visit their GP at the early stages of the onset of an illness because of the high costs involved.</P>
        <P>The difficulty I have with raising this matter is that I do not want to see the health service treated like a business and, although there is an issue around value for money and standards, this is why HIQA should have a role to play in services, cost, quality and the standards practised by GPs.</P>
        <P>There are many wonderful GPs who have given a lifetime of service over the years.  They are wonderful men and women who have treated their patients with respect, kindness and professionalism, and have done a tremendous job.  Society has changed and continues to change.</P>
        <P>The availability of information on the Internet has been a challenge for many GPs.  Difficulties were raised this week about obesity in children and referring to GPs will be central in dealing with this matter.  Other issues such as infectious diseases, GPs dealing with people who are terminally ill and visiting homes at the weekend are all things we need to recognise.  We need to thank our GPs who provide such a wonderful service.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  When it is enacted it will mean that if suitably qualified GPs decide to set up practice, not alone will they be able to treat private patients from day one, but will also be able to treat patients holding GP visit cards and full medical cards.  As I have said, the programme for Government provides for significant strengthening of primary care services to deliver universal primary care with the removal of cost as a barrier to access for patients.  This is the key to deliver a universal, community-based equitable health service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Deputy Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill today and thank the Minister for introducing it to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>As of the beginning of October, 1,701,951 people in Ireland have medical cards.  A further 128,292 people are entitled to a GP visit card.  The <i>Irish Examiner </i>revealed recently that 214,165 more people became eligible for medical and GP visit-only cards across the country between January 2010 and May 2011.  This means 39% of the population is now entitled to State-funded financial health support, up from 34% at the start of 2010.</P>
        <P>There are anecdotal suggestions that GP visits have fallen between 15% and 30% in recent years.  This, sadly, does not mean that people are suddenly getting healthier and fewer people require GP services.  In reality, it is a stark reminder that for many people financial concerns take precedence over getting better.  It is simple but true.  Access to health care should be based on health need, not income.  People should not have to make a choice between going to a GP and having enough money to get through the rest of the week.  I commend the Minister on introducing universal health care.</P>
        <P>The GMS scheme currently provides free GP visits to public patients throughout the State and covers one third of the population.  When the GMS scheme was introduced, public patients were treated alongside private patients and could only choose a GP from among those registered with the scheme.  This resulted in a limited pool of GPs available for public patients.  Medical card and GP visit card holders should not have to face this restriction in choosing a GP.  This legislation removes the current restrictions, allowing public patients greater freedom in choosing which GP they wish to see.  Opening the sector to competition will offer a far better choice and better prices for patients.</P>
        <P>While the Bill serves to implement an undertaking in the memorandum of understanding with the troika, its provisions are timely and much needed in any case.  In other words, the IMF <Col N="53"/>demand for greater competition in so-called sheltered sectors, such as GP services, is a welcome requirement.  As it stands, patients can expect to pay anything between &euro;45 and &euro;70 for a quick GP visit.  Increased competition among medical practitioners, as provided for in the Bill, will mean medical card and GP visit card holders will have a greater choice of GPs.  Any doctor who wishes to obtain a GMS contract will be free to do so.  This will encourage young GPs to remain in the country and perhaps encourage some who have left to return.</P>
        <P>These changes are in line with the Competition Authority&rsquo;s July 2010 report on GMS practitioners, which recommended that access to GMS contracts be opened up to all qualified GPs.  The report noted that decisions to award the GMS contract in an area should not have to take account of the viability of GP practices already operating in an area.  GPs in possession of GMS contracts should be free to set up in, or move to, a location of their choice.  While only a small section of GPs has benefited from the GMS contract in its current form, we should bear in mind that much of the money is spent on overall upkeep of GP practice and on hiring staff.  This change in legislation should not demonise GPs currently operating the scheme.  Moreover, the amount of money allocated to GPs under the GMS contract has been decreased.  This may have a negative effect on GPs who operate in disadvantaged areas and thus have a greater dependence on public patients.</P>
        <P>The arrival of new GP practices will benefit patients in the form of greater choice and reduced charges.  This will give young GPs the opportunity to set up wherever they wish.  Newly qualified GPs deserve the opportunity to set up practice in Ireland at a time when there has never been a greater need for their services.  There are currently some 2,800 registered GPs practising in Ireland, representing a ratio of 0.6 GPs per 1,000 population.  Recent reports from F&Aacute;S and the ESRI make clear that Ireland is facing a manpower shortage in general practice in the near future.  This Bill will afford medical card and GP visit card patients a greater choice, ensure that any suitably qualified doctor who wishes to obtain a GMS contract will be free to do so, and encourage young GPs to remain in Ireland.  It will have a positive outcome for both patients and GPs.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation.  I commend him on his work in this and other areas, including the roll-out of the primary care strategy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="HeatherHumphreys"><NameTxt>Deputy Heather Humphreys</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Its objective is to remove restrictions on general practitioners entering the medical card market.  Given that there are approximately 1.7 million medical card holders in Ireland, any changes to the current system will have a broad-ranging impact.  The agreement with the EU and the IMF provides for legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors by the end of the third quarter in 2011.  In effect, this legislation is a response to that requirement in respect of general practitioner services.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the general medical services scheme.  This will in turn open access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.  Medical cards and GP visit cards are an absolute necessity for those on low incomes.  Under the proposed changes to the GMS contract system, card holders will be provided with greater access to GP services.  These changes will mean better choice and quality of service for all patients and increased value for money for consumers.</P>
        <P>Under the current arrangement, the level of competition between GP practices in certain areas is limited.  There are only three routes for entry into the GMS scheme: first, where a vacancy arises due to death, retirement or resignation; second, where it is identified that there is a need for an additional doctor in an area and; third, where a GMS doctor obtains approval from the Health Service Executive for the creation of an assistant within his or her practice. <Col N="54"/> In addition, the HSE is required to take account of the potential viability of a new GMS practice in the context of existing GP practices in the area.</P>
        <P>The changes proposed in the Bill mean there will be no limit on the number of contractors and all new GMS doctors will be free to establish their practice in the location of their choice.  It is important that the establishment of practices should be monitored by the Department.  While increased competition is a healthy development, there should be an element of caution applied.  We do not want a situation where doctors will only set up practice in urban areas where there is a higher population density.  It is important that rural areas should be covered adequately.  In my constituency, for example, County Monaghan has one of the lowest ratios of GP per head of population.  With that in mind, there should be incentives for GPs to set up practice in areas which currently have limited services.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised in regard to the potential effects of these provisions on the doctor-patient relationship.  In particular, there has been reference to the potential for this approach to promote &ldquo;consumer-driven medicine&rdquo; whereby patients will chop and change between different GPs, which will ultimately have a negative impact on the level of care they receive.  These are genuine concerns and it is important that they be addressed.</P>
        <P>The Bill includes a provision whereby, once established, any contract holder who wishes to move location will be able to do so only with the prior approval of the HSE.  I welcome this provision as it is designed to ensure continuity of care.  Many patients, particularly elderly people, become accustomed to their local doctor and find it extremely difficult to engage with a new practitioner.  Once established in a local community, it important that doctors do not leave without good cause.</P>
        <P>One of the key objectives of the Bill is to encourage young GPs to remain in Ireland and to establish their practices here.  The large number of young, talented people in the medical profession who have been leaving Ireland to seek work elsewhere has been well documented in recent years.  These people, in whom the State is investing, receive their education in Ireland only to depart once they have completed their studies.  We need to do all within our power to ensure that these people remain in Ireland as these are the exact types of people who will ultimately help to improve the health services in this country.  We cannot continue to simply educate our young doctors for export.</P>
        <P>As well as being a requirement of the EU-IMF programme, the Bill also addresses a number of recommendations set out in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s 2011 report on general medical practitioners.  In this respect, I note that the Competition Authority has responded very positively to the publication of the Bill, describing it as &ldquo;great news for everyone who goes to a GP&rdquo;.  While I largely concur with those sentiments, I think it is also important to point out that GP practices are not like convenience stores.  The local GP represents an integral part of any community and in that respect there should be clear distinctions between quantity, cost and quality in respect of GP practices when compared with other industries.</P>
        <P>I agree that an increase in competition is healthy, however, as with any other enterprise the ultimate goal should always be to encourage better services and in this instance better quality of care for patients.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on introducing it.  I have no doubt it will have a very positive impact for the patient.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyMcLoughlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which in effect will allow qualified general practitioners to treat public patients as part of the GMS.  The restrictive practice of this area was identified by the IMF-EU agreement with Ireland, to increase competition among sheltered professions by the third quarter in 2011.  A number of <Col N="55"/>provisions in the Bill will benefit the State, the patient and ultimately ensure the sector is more competitive.</P>
        <P>The HSE can enter into a contract for the provision of services to GMS patients with any suitably qualified and vocationally trained GP.  A medical practitioner, who holds a GMS contract on foot of the 2009 interim entry provisions, will be entitled to accept on to his or her list any patients nominating him or her as their doctor of choice.  The viability of existing GP practices in an area will no longer be a factor in awarding GMS contracts.  The Bill when enacted will encourage competition among GPs at a time when private patients have considerably less money at their disposal.</P>
        <P>In my constituency for example fees for GPs&rsquo; charges range from &euro;45 to &euro;55 and these charges have not decreased since 2007 at the height of the boom when almost all charges have been reduced and when many public services paid for by the people have reduced significantly.  The time has come to introduce competition into this service to allow the market dictate price.  The Competition Authority recently stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The changes to the system for GPs treating medical card holders announced by the Minister for Health Dr James O&rsquo;Reilly yesterday are good news for patients.  These changes will impact on all patients, medical card holders and those who pay the full cost of visiting a GP.</P>
        <P LI="1">Last year the Competition Authority called for exactly these changes to this system.  In a report published in July 2010 the Competition Authority highlighted the fact that competition between GP practices and access to GP services were limited by elements of the medical card system.  We recommended a number of changes which will lead to greater access to GP services and better choice and quality of service for all patients.  They will also lead to increased value for money for consumers, the State and ultimately taxpayers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The chairman of the Competition Authority, Declan Purcell, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Not only will patients have more GP services available in their area, it should also stimulate competition between GPs, which up until now has not been as robust as it could have been.  It also means that young Irish GPs can now set up practices here in Ireland, where there is a chronic shortage of doctors, instead of having to emigrate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government decision to fulfil a commitment to abolish all restrictions on entry into the general medical card scheme will open up the market and provide the general public and in particular the fee-paying patient with a clear choice and the possibility of a reduced cost, which is welcome when according to statistics 23% of the public do not have either a medical card or private medical insurance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To be balanced on this debate it is worth noting that many GPs provide a fantastic service in their particular catchment areas with a vast secretarial back-up and the provision of a staff nurse.  These practices are exemplary in their professionalism and the service they give the patient.  It is noted that all of these services are paid for out of whatever the GP earns from the GMS.  I am sure that doctors who are providing that level of service with competitive charges will continue to flourish when this Bill hopefully becomes law.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister on the speed in bringing this legislation before the House.  Many commentators are quick to point out the Minister&rsquo;s past association with his profession&rsquo;s association, the IMO, as a lobby group for GPs, but clearly this is the first Minister who has taken on the issue of opening up the sector to competition and in doing so has perhaps opened the way for major consumer savings on GP costs especially for middle-income families who do not <Col N="56"/>have access to a medical card and for that I thank the Minister and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the speakers who contributed.  I know this is an important issue for all Deputies in the House and, indeed, for all our citizens.  I will address some of the specific issues raised in my response.  The Bill provides for the elimination of restrictions on GPs wishing to obtain contracts to treat public patients under the General Medical Services Scheme by opening up access to GMS contracts to all fully qualified and vocationally trained GPs.  This new legislation will allow many young, highly qualified and trained GPs, who were previously prevented from obtaining a GMS contract early in their careers, to apply for contracts now.  The consequence of this was often that many of these highly trained, skilled, bright and energetic people left our shores, some never to return.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kelleher and a number of other Deputies mentioned an ongoing shortage of qualified and trained GPs.  In this regard, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE have reached an agreement on an assessment tool for evaluating GPs currently working in the Irish health service, but who do not meet the criteria set down in the GMS contract as currently construed.  This practice-based assessment model will facilitate the implementation of appropriate fast-track training for doctors who have extensive experience in Irish general practice, but lack some component of training making them ineligible for specialist registration.</P>
        <P>Prior to this, doctors in this position had no option other than to commence a four-year GP training programme, as no other training options were available.  This was clearly grossly inefficient and not the best use of their time as these experienced doctors had often previously covered many aspects of the training.  The purpose of this scheme is to develop a practice-based assessment model as an alternative route to GP specialist registration and it should considerably shorten the time to completion.</P>
        <P>In addition to this and following on from the recommendations of the 2010 joint committee report, &ldquo;Primary Medical Care in the Community&rdquo;, to which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in alluded, the number of GP training places was increased from 120 per annum to 157 per annum on 1 July 2010, following collaboration between the Irish College of General Practitioners and the HSE.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that the number of GP contract holders has increased from 2,098 in 2006 to 2,279 in October 2011, an increase of 8.63%.  Under the interim entry arrangement in 2009, an additional 124 doctors entered the GMS.  The Bill will result in a further increase in the number of GPs available to the registered population.  During the coming year I want to explore with the Irish College of General Practitioners how we might expand training further and increase the number of GPs.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Deputy Kelleher also mentioned the importance of health promotion, the work of nurses in the primary care setting and the danger of friction within services owing to cross-over of work.  Primary care teams by their nature involve different professionals working in a team environment for the good of the patient.  There is evidence that the various professionals have already been working well together in a team environment.  I take this opportunity to remind people that one of our guiding principles is that a patient be treated at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.  In that regard, much of the work currently being done by general practitioners can be done by practice nurses.  This would free up general practitioners for other areas of activity.  The recent move to allow 800 well trained pharmacists to deliver flu vaccines to adults is another development in this area which will free up general practitioner time.  I expect this co-operation to further improve as the primary care team model becomes an integrated part of our health services.</P><Col N="57"/>
        <P>Health promotion initiatives already form the basis of many innovative projects carried out by primary care teams, including falls prevention programmes, mental health initiatives, smoking cessation projects and so on.  The Government is committed to prevention and fully subscribes to the principle that prevention is better than cure.</P>
        <P>Regarding the provision of adequate GP out-of-hours cover and the impact this Bill may have on out-of-hours services, GPs are, as part of their contract, obliged to have in place suitable arrangements to ensure they, or their deputies, can be contacted during out-of-hours periods.  In many instances, it is the relevant GP co-operative that provides this cover and there is no reason the introduction of this Bill should have a negative impact on the operation of GP co-operatives.  It should in many ways support and enhance a co-operative&rsquo;s ability to deliver as GPs will now be far more fully involved and remunerated for GMS and non-GMS patients.</P>
        <P>Some 90% of the population have access to GP out-of-hours services in 14 centres nationally, in all HSE regions and in at least part of every county.  In 2009, the service dealt with 931,905 calls and with 924,000 calls in 2010.  More than 2,000 GPs provide services in the co-operatives  There were 706,995 contacts with the GP out-of-hours services up to the end of September 2011, an increase of 55,641 or 8.5% on the same period last year.  Some 58% of contacts to date in 2011 resulted in attendance at a treatment centre and a further 10% resulted in home visits.  I trust these figures give some encouragement to Deputy Luke &ldquo;Ming&rdquo; Flanagan, who indicated that home visits are a thing of the past.</P>
        <P>I would like at this point to express my regret that no Member of the Opposition has seen fit to come to the House for completion of Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
        <P>On the issue of GP shortages, mechanisms for encouraging GPs to set up practices in rural and urban disadvantaged areas will be considered in the context of the review of the GMS contract.  In general, GPs who have established panels in urban or rural areas are unlikely to want to move to other areas where they would have to rebuild a GMS panel from scratch.  In addition, the rural practice allowance is available, subject to certain criteria, to encourage GPs to establish in rural areas.  This allowance will remain available to GPs meeting those criteria who get a contract under this Bill.  More than 190 GPs are currently in receipt of this allowance.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputies Kelleher, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Healy, Crowe and others raised concerns about shortages of GPs in certain areas.  Tallaght was mentioned in this context.  I spoke about the situation in Tallaght in my opening speech.  In general, GPs starting up in practice want to work out of well equipped modern premises and so are less likely to start off in a single practice.  Setting up a modern practice involves considerable investment.  Also given the current downturn, GPs are less likely to take on assistants and partners.  This applies to many areas, not only Tallaght.  I envisage that this Bill will increase the likelihood that GP numbers will increase in locations like Tallaght which has a significant medical card population.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to announce that a new GP out-of-hours co-operative opened in Tallaght Hospital on 1 November.  This service will serve the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas. There are 40 GPs in this co-operative.</P>
        <P>It is well recognised that we have low GP numbers per population in this country.  The expansion of GP training places to 157 per year will go some way to addressing this imbalance.  As I stated, we will continue to strive to increase that number.  The removal of restrictions on GMS entry may not solve all the problems in relation to GP numbers.  Infrastructure remains an issue in disadvantaged areas.  If, following the introduction of this legislation, this remains an issue, I will be happy, when a new GMS contract is being developed, to consider the need for incentives to encourage GPs to locate and practice in disadvantaged areas.  While the Bill allows for GPs to set up anywhere they choose, there are many additional supports given to GPs which will be used selectively to encourage their presence in rural and urban deprived <Col N="58"/>areas.  In other words, we will not allow a situation whereby five GP practices can set up on Grafton Street and be supported by the State.  That will not happen.</P>
        <P>Members will be aware that the programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract, with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract will also focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary primary care teams.  The preparation of the revised GMS contract will be advanced by officials of my Department and the HSE.  There will be a full consultation process with relevant stakeholders.  Along with the Minister of State for primary care,  Deputy Shortall, I will oversee the work of the officials.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question in regard to the study entitled &ldquo;A Model of Demand for and Supply of General Practitioner and Practice Nurse Services in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, commissioned by my Department which commenced last month, the purpose of this study is to inform the programme for the implementation of universal primary care which will progressively extend access to GP care without fees in accordance with the programme for Government commitment.  The implementation programme requires the development of a model of demand for the supply of GP and practice nurse care to facilitate workforce planning so that the supply of care by GPs and practice nurses meets patients&rsquo; need for care.  The study will address a number of elements,  including an estimation of current utilisation rates of GP and practice nurse services, including a breakdown by geographical area to the degree that is supported by the available data; a projection of the effect on utilisation-demand for GP and practice nurse services of demographic change, including population ageing and epidemiological trends; an assessment of any mismatch between demand and supply and a sensitivity analysis assessing the effect on matching demand and supply of adopting alternative demographic and epidemiological assumptions.</P>
        <P>The study, which will be completed by the end of the year, will identify gaps in areas and provide a model whereby the HSE can monitor ongoing trends.  I will be in a position to consider the findings of the study as soon as possible thereafter.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, the policies of this Government will be evidence-based.  We seek to have that information available to us so that we can target the areas in need of more GP and practice nurse services.</P>
        <P>Deputy Healy raised the issue of medical card eligibility.  Under the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme, medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of GP services.  The GP visit card was introduced in 2005 as a graduated benefit to ensure people on moderate to low incomes, in particular parents of young children who do not qualify for a medical card, would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Applications for medical cards are considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage-rent, child care and travel to work.  Medical expenses are also taken into account.  Applicants whose weekly income is derived solely from social welfare or HSE allowances and payments are granted a medical card.  Where an applicant&rsquo;s income is over the guideline limits, he-she may still qualify for a medical card if his-her personal circumstances cause undue financial hardship.  I recently instructed the PCRS to put together a group of medical people to examine the issue of discretionary medical cards, a role previously that of CEOs of the health boards.  Given they are no longer in place this matter needed to be reviewed.  The group is currently operational and is reviewing discretionary medical cards and the requirement for same.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>As of 1 October 2011, approximately 1.7 million people held medical cards and 128,000 held GP visit cards, giving almost 40% of the population free access to GP services under the GMS scheme.  Approximately &euro;2 billion is spent on the provision of medical card services annually.  This represents the highest level of coverage for GP services under the GMS scheme at any time since the 1980s.</P>
        
        <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the issue of capping consultation fees charged by general practitioners to private patients.  Such fees are a matter of private contract between the clinicians and the patients.  While I have no role in relation to such fees, I would expect clinicians to have regard to the overall economic situation in setting their fees.  I have anecdotal knowledge that many GPs have reduced their fees in cases of hardship.  The issue of the disparity between the setting of some fees was referred to and some of those fees seem very high, in my view.  An explanation for a variation would have something to do with the overheads, for instance, where a GP may have invested in new premises while others operate rent free in health board premises.  One would expect and hope that those GPs would charge lower fees as the cost base is lower.</P>
        <P>During the course of the debate, several Deputies expressed concern that GPs do not advertise their fees.  Up to 2009, the Medical Council&rsquo;s guide to professional conduct and ethics for registered medical professionals, placed advertising restrictions on new GPs, whereby they were only allowed to advertise their arrival in an area by way of newspaper notices.  Other methods of advertising, including notification of prices, were not permitted.  These restrictions have not been included in the Medical Council&rsquo;s 2009 guide and  GPs are now free to advertise their services and prices.  While GPs are not obliged to display their fees, the Medical Council&rsquo;s guide to professional conduct and ethics states that the fees charged should be appropriate to the service provided and that patients should be informed of the likely costs before the consultation and treatment commences.</P>
        <P>Other issues were raised in the course of the debate by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett.  He maintained that we are considering a free market.  This is not a free market approach but rather an initiative to allow young, and sometimes not so young, doctors who are suitably qualified, to set up in practice and to treat both medical card and private patients.  Other speakers referred to the proposal for free GP care.  This was Fine Gael policy prior to the election and it is Government policy now that there will be free GP care during the life of this D&aacute;il.  We will start early next year with the long-term illness card holders receiving free GP care and the scheme will be extended.</P>
        <P>I have a particular interest in the role of HIQA and while in opposition I called for HIQA to have a role in inspecting primary care premises.  The agency has a major job of work as regards inspections and the inspection of primary care premises will be coming under its remit during the life of this Government.</P>
        <P>Others have complimented the GP service on what it delivers.  Primary care and general practice has delivered for the people of Ireland.  It has been remarked that even though two separate methods exist and there are public patients and private patients, no two-tier system has evolved, unlike in the hospital sector.  For this alone, GPs should be commended.</P>
        <P>We wish to see more work carried out in general practice and a different approach to care and a greater emphasis on prevention and the care of those with chronic illness.  A new GP contract will include all these provisions.  This contract will allow for an enhanced cost-effective <Col N="60"/>care for patients with better outcomes for patients and greater job satisfaction for those involved in primary care.</P>
        <P>I am confident that this legislation will contribute to the commitment in the programme for Government.  It will encourage more young GPs to remain in Ireland and to establish their practices here and it will make it more attractive for GPs to move here from overseas.  It will also encourage competition among GPs at a time when many fee-paying patients have less money at their disposal.  To quote the Taoiseach before he was elected, this Government does not want to see a situation where a young mother has to decide whether she can afford to bring her sick child to the doctor and risk not paying the ESB bill at the end of the month.</P>
        <P>This Bill will provide that medical card and GP-visit card patients will have a wider choice of GPs under the GMS scheme and it will also ensure that private patients of new contract-holders who may subsequently qualify for a medical card or a GP-visit card, will not be forced to endure the trauma of changing from a doctor with whom they have established a relationship.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that this issue has been selected for debate.  I bring to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, an alarming situation regarding NAMA which came to light recently, namely, its practice of paying the country&rsquo;s most indebted developers enormous sums of money on an annual basis.  This is unacceptable at a time when the country is effectively in receivership and we should be building up confidence in our State institutions.</P>
        <P>At a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, I asked the chairman of NAMA how many developers are being paid by the agency on an annual basis and what is the maximum salary ceiling for developers engaged with the NAMA process.  I was informed that two separate developers are being paid &euro;200,000 per annum by the agency and that between 110 and 120 other developers are in receipt of between &euro;70,000 and &euro;100,000 per annum.  In addition some of them may be on commission.</P>
        <P>In effect, this means that two of the country&rsquo;s most indebted developers are being paid almost as much as the Taoiseach, receiving five times the average industrial wage.  NAMA was created as a result of the mismanagement of the economy but this brings the entire process into disrepute as we approach a very difficult budget.  How can we expect the public to have any confidence in a system which generously rewards developers to such an extent, given what they have done to this country?</P>
        <P>In the case of the two developers on the maximum salary of &euro;200,000, their remuneration is at the level of the cap on public sector pay.  It is reasonable to assume that if that cap had not been introduced by this Government under the aegis of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, these developers might have been earning in excess of that sum.</P>
        <P>The chairman of NAMA argued that the agency was reluctant to pay this sum but the decision was made by the board to arrive at that conclusion.  I do not accept that and believe that no reasonable, thinking person would share that view.  In this context, I call on the Minister for Finance to review the NAMA legislation in order that he, rather than the board of NAMA, would have power to set the payment rate for developers.</P>
        <P>Following the revelation by the chairman of NAMA at the Committee of Public Accounts, I wrote to NAMA with a number of questions seeking clarity.  First, I asked the names of the developers who are in receipt of &euro;200,000 and the names of their respective companies.  Second, I asked for a list of the property portfolios they had in their possession prior to being taken over by NAMA.  Third, I asked the extent of each developer&rsquo;s liabilities engaged by the NAMA process; and fourth, the extent of the repayment of those liabilities to date.</P>
        <P>In response I was told the information I sought in regard to individual debtors was not available because data protection law and constraints imposed on it by the NAMA legislation would not allow that to be the case.  I was also informed that a change in the law would be required to enable NAMA to disclose this information.  As I understand it, essentially NAMA is a commercial organisation which operates in the open market.  This brings its own difficulties and sensitivities.  It is of the utmost importance, however, that the agency be subjected to even more rigorous parliamentary scrutiny in the interests of transparency and accountability.</P>
        <P>This very week, under the Freedom of Information Act this House released information to journalists who had sought figures in regard to expenditure on constituency offices by Members.  Rightly, that information was made available.  Contrast that transparency and the absolute lack <Col N="62"/>of it in this case.  There is a huge difference.  I call the Minister for Finance to review the section of the NAMA Act which prohibits the agency from disclosing information about individual debtors.  This is about transparency and accountability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McCarthy for raising this very important matter.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated in the Seanad some time ago, he does not propose to change the NAMA legislation at this stage.</P>
        <P>NAMA has advised that in agreeing business plans with debtors, it normally looks for a reduction of 50% to 75% in overall costs and that any remuneration paid to debtors comes from this much reduced budget.  I am very much aware of the concerns about the remuneration packages that certain NAMA debtors are being allowed to take from the overheads figure agreed by NAMA.  However, unpalatable as this may seem, I can accept the assurances from NAMA there really is no better alternative if we wish to ensure the maximum return is made to the Irish taxpayer.  In recent weeks, the chairman of NAMA has made this point to both the Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>The chairman further stated he would love to be able to tell Deputies that the agency could refuse to deal with all 850 developers, throw them out and get someone else to run the businesses.  However, he made it clear that while this would be a very popular decision, it would not make commercial sense because, regardless of what they had done, the developers were the people in place who knew their own businesses.</P>
        <P>NAMA has informed me that, in general, employing an external asset manager to manage the assets would cost significantly more than the cost of retaining the original debtor.  The chief executive officer of NAMA recently stated that the cost of an external manager would range in the region of 1.5% of the asset value per annum.  He pointed out that on an asset of &euro;100 million value, one could pay &euro;150,000 to a private sector individual to manage it but one might be able to get a debtor to do it for &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000.  According to NAMA, the majority of debtor remuneration packages fall into the &euro;70,000 to &euro;100,000 range, including all benefits-in-kind.  However, in the two cases the Deputy alluded to, the debtors&rsquo; remuneration package authorised by NAMA as part of the budget for overheads is &euro;200,000.  I am aware that &euro;200,000 is an extraordinary amount of money for most of us.  The lower figure of &euro;75,000 is an amount that many people would love to earn.  However, the figures are driven by the need to maximise value for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I am informed by NAMA that these packages generate a much better return to the taxpayer than the option of enforcement and the employment of asset managers for considerably large portfolios of assets.  Several billion euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money could be at stake.  NAMA is required to get the best return by having the person it believes is best placed to help it to achieve its returns.  In many of these cases, the alternative would be to pay exorbitant rates of up to &euro;180 per hour to receivers who could take a long time to work out the assets.  Using this figure, a 40-hour week would amount to over &euro;7,000 in fees per week.  NAMA assures me that it drives as hard a bargain as it possibly can, or as is practical, on behalf of the taxpayer with developers whose loans it controls.  The reality is that if developers do not have an incentive to work with NAMA, they are most unlikely to engage with NAMA and the agency will be forced to foreclose through the appointment of receivers.  In that case the return to NAMA, and as a consequence the taxpayer, would likely be significantly reduced.  The fact that NAMA has had to take enforcement action in 91 cases shows that many developers consider NAMA&rsquo;s terms and conditions to be too onerous.  It also shows that NAMA is not soft on developers and is looking to impose tough conditions.  NAMA has assured the Minister for Finance that <Col N="63"/>it will continue to make decisions about working with developers or taking enforcement actions on a case-by-case basis, in line with its commercial mandate.  The objective of the incentive is to get the debtor working, not so much for himself but for the taxpayer and for NAMA.  Although this is difficult to accept &mdash; I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s remarks in that respect &mdash; in the view of NAMA it is the most appropriate means of achieving its objectives as an organisation at this time.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am giving this matter the attention I feel it deserves.  We are talking about an organ of the State.  There is a moral requirement on NAMA to act in the interests of the taxpayer.  The revelation that NAMA is paying huge sums of money to developers makes it difficult for ordinary people who think reasonably to accept or have any faith in the NAMA process.  Like everybody else in this House, I understand the mess this Government has inherited.  There is a huge sense of irony &mdash; it is almost an injustice &mdash; in the fact that some of those who got us into this mess are being paid so much money.  When I asked at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts why this is happening, I was told the people in question managed multi-billion euro property portfolios.  Surely the portfolios in question were mismanaged.  It is difficult for ordinary working people to be expected to shoulder the pain that next month&rsquo;s budget will inevitably inflict on them when this kind of thing is going on.  I ask, in the interests of fairness, that we keep this matter under constant review.  It is almost unthinkable that our national Parliament has no jurisdiction over the ability of a board of an organ of the State to make decisions on salary levels.  I urge the Minister and the Government to keep this matter under review.  I will revisit it in the new year.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for his constructive suggestions about keeping this matter under review.  I have been informed by the Minister for Finance and the Government generally that this matter is being kept under constant review.  Many Deputies, including Deputy McCarthy&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Costello, have rightly put on the record of this House the necessity to have greater parliamentary engagement or scrutiny of the operation of NAMA.  The chairman of NAMA and other officials from that body have been before the relevant committees of this House.  The Government will consider any proposal which would make that process of scrutiny more comprehensive.  We can work on that within the terms of the existing legislation or outside those terms.  The Government intends to examine this matter again to determine whether greater parliamentary scrutiny is possible.  Such engagement is needed to ensure people understand the reasons this is happening.  In this case, it is the lesser of two evils.  The view is that it is cheaper in the long run to use these people as part of the system and pay them for this purpose.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that if there is some movement in the property market, the taxpayer will make some returns on these assets.  We are open to considering the possibility of greater parliamentary scrutiny of the task and operation of NAMA.  If Deputy McCarthy or any other Deputy would like to put concrete proposals to the Government, they will be entertained and their proposals examined in the most constructive way possible.</P>

	<P>I would like to speak about the banking crisis and the latest reports from Europe.  The French and the Spanish are paying more for their bonds today than they <Col N="64"/>were yesterday.  The sooner we acknowledge that things will not continue as they have been, the better it will be for ourselves.  If the reports are true, I commend the Taoiseach for challenging Mrs. Merkel yesterday.  If the Germans do not agree that the ECB should become a lender of last resort, there is no doubt that we will be staring the end of the euro as we know it in the face.  It will be difficult to sustain it in its present manner.  Very few economists of any stature in Europe see a bright future for it.  It seems that if we do not accept the German model, we will end up in the second zone of Europe &mdash; that is the best case scenario &mdash; or else we will see the break-up of the EU.  The Government seriously needs to think about the &euro;1.25 billion we are supposed to give to more unsecured bondholders on 25 January next.  The goalposts are moving in Europe every day.  The Government does not need me to tell it what it could do with that money.  It would be manna from heaven for Irish society at this stage of the game.  Many areas are screaming out for assistance.  That &euro;1.25 billion would go a long way towards alleviating some of the misery that is being inflicted on many of the more vulnerable people in our society.</P>
        <P>The European project was originally based on the idea of Europe as a family of nations.  That is really not the case anymore.  It is not feasible for us to think we can be like Germany.  Our costs will always be higher than those of the Germans.  There are 80 million of them.  It is hard for us to match them for productivity.  I do not see how we can play in the same league.  Initially, the whole notion underpinning the eurozone was that the bigger countries would carry the weaker ones with them.  That is not really happening anymore.  There is a lack of real labour market mobility.  Europe&rsquo;s mechanisms for shifting resources from rich parts of the eurozone to poor parts of it are inadequate.  The high cost we are paying for that is the economic failure that has transpired.  The youth unemployment rate in Spain is 50% and in Greece is 40%.  We have our own difficulties, with 450,000 people unemployed.  That figure is probably going to increase.  I will conclude by quoting from an article by Larry Elliott in last Monday&rsquo;s <i>The Guardian</i>, which summed it up very nicely:</P>
        <P LI="1">So much political capital has been invested in the euro project that it is perfectly understandable that policy makers have been desperately trying to buy time until they can piece together a fiscal union to buttress monetary union.  There are a number of problems with this idea: it would take time Europe doesn&rsquo;t have to organise; it would involve the weaker countries being dictated to by the strong in an even more direct way than they are at present; it would involve not just years but decades of austerity, and it would mean ignoring the seemingly obvious conclusion that monetary union is &mdash; and always was &mdash; rotten economics.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Larry Elliott is a serious economic commentator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to state clearly that there is nothing to suggest from yesterday&rsquo;s meeting between the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel, or from any statement or utterance made by Chancellor Merkel, that she is unreceptive to the plight of Europe&rsquo;s smaller nations.  She, along with the European Heads of State, is working to resolve the crisis in the eurozone.  I would draw a distinction between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, now named IRBC, and the other covered institutions.  No consideration is being given to burden sharing with senior bondholders in any of the other covered institutions.</P>
        <P>In regard to the repayment of unguaranteed unsecured senior debt, it has always been the Minister&rsquo;s position that, given the significant cost of IBRC to the State and the taxpayer, there should be a sharing of the burden of debt with bondholders.  To avoid such repayments, the most logical option would have been to put the bank into administration.  This option was <Col N="65"/>available to the previous Administration but instead, it put the taxpayer on the line for the liabilities of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>If we were to suspend payments to creditors in Anglo Irish Bank, this would have a significant impact on both the bank and, ultimately, the State because it is a totally guaranteed and a nationalised bank.  This senior debt, unsecured as it is, is an obligation of the bank.  If the bank does not meet such obligations, it would lead to a default and following that, most likely, insolvency.  Insolvency would result in a significant increase in the cost to the State to resolve Anglo Irish Bank, or IBRC as it is now known.</P>
        <P>After the Minister&rsquo;s recent meeting with the previous European Central Bank President, Mr. Trichet, and Commissioner Rehn, our European partners expressed strong reservations about burden sharing with senior bondholders in IBRC.  Mr. Trichet voiced his opinion that he was against such actions for two reasons.  First, private sector involvement carries very significant contagion risk and may be inconsistent with encouraging private investors to return to markets.  Second, he said Ireland had done particularly well over the summer.  He mentioned the narrowing of bond spreads and he said he felt that anything to do with senior debt burden sharing might knock the confidence of the market in the absolute commitment of the Government to once again take its place in normally functioning markets and, as a result, bond yields could widen again and we might lose the ground we had gained over the past number of months.</P>
        <P>Mr. Trichet&rsquo;s views were echoed by Commissioner Rehn.  The positive international commentary on Ireland has been created by the Government&rsquo;s successful renegotiation of the memorandum of understanding, the introduction of the jobs initiative, the sizeable reduction of the interest rate on the EU-IMF programme and the reduction in the cost of the banks to the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The value of support, present and future, we receive from our European partners far outweighs any short-term gain from imposing burden sharing on these bonds in the face of European opposition to such a move.  For example, &euro;110 billion of funding is provided by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland to the Irish banks at a cost below which they could borrow in the market.  This is in addition to the &euro;85 billion set out in the programme with the troika.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, as the Minister and the Government have made it perfectly clear, we still have unfinished business with our partners to find the most cost-effective way of resolving IBRC over the long term.  The Government&rsquo;s aim is to ensure that the overall cost of resolving the bank&rsquo;s debt and the costs of resolving the difficulties in the banking sector generally are kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>Discussions have commenced with the relevant authorities at a technical level but, as yet, there is no indication of a successful outcome.  The Minister will consider the future repayment of maturing bonds in the bank in this context and in terms of what is best for the overall position of the State.</P>
        <P>I draw to Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s attention and that of all Members the motion approved by this House last week and to indicate that nothing has changed in the meantime to alter our position and that of this House.  Among other things, the motion acknowledged that the Government should not act unilaterally in regard to the repayment of unguaranteed senior debt and should have regard to the views of our partners who are providing the requisite funding for the financial institutions; acknowledged that the Government is working with our partners in the EU and IMF to address the situation and is actively involved in discussions with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State; and affirmed that the approach being pursued by the Government is, given the situation with which it has been presented with by the former Administration, the optimum approach which will produce the best medium to long-term outcome for the State and the Irish taxpayer.</P>

	<P>Yes, it is and it is getting even more difficult.  I do not accept we have turned any corners.  From my experience of the domestic economy, things are getting more rather than less difficult.  People have less money in their pockets when they walk through the doors of most retail units in this country.</P>
        <P>I understand we have become financially very dependent on the ECB and the EU because we agreed to bail out the banks, lock, stock and barrel.  I am not saying it is all this Government&rsquo;s responsibility but I do not believe what is happening is very fair.</P>
        <P>We are prepared to borrow crazy money to rescue the financial institutions but we will not even conceive of the idea of borrowing crazy money to invest.  I understand it is very difficult given that we are already borrowing too much and that we are in a very difficult place.  However, I do not accept that things will continue as they are and that it is fair for us to part with &euro;1.25 billion.  The Minister said it would upset the apple cart but I do not accept that he would be throwing the baby out with the bath water.  I do not believe Europe will pull the plug if we refuse to pay unsecured bondholders in order to take a little bit better care of the less privileged in our society who are suffering dearly.</P>
        <P>This would not be a draconian measure.  This country has obeyed so many of the rules and adhered to the obligations of Europe that it would not be so draconian for us to withhold this money.  It is legally possible.</P>

	<P>The best way to ensure some security for the most marginalised in this society is if we can meet the bills of our social protection system.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The only way we can resolve that issue is if we get our public finances into a sustainable position.  The way to do that and to get through these difficult years is to work with those international partners who are providing &euro;85 billion so that we can get through this difficult period because we are not in the markets.  The ECB is keeping the Irish bank afloat to the tune of &euro;110 billion.</P>
        <P>Deputy Wallace knows this and I put it to him that it is not just the responsibility of this Government to get us through this appalling mess, which we will get through, but it is the responsibility of every Member of this House to be realistic and to be honest with the public about the scale of the challenges we face and how we will get to that better place.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that the only way we can get to that better place is by taking a step-by-step approach to those negotiations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government can point to some success.  Does it need to do more?  Of course it does.  Much is being done in bilaterally, quietly and distinctly but nonetheless winning the argument.  The only way for this country to show to our international funders that there is a future for it is to ensure we make that progress.  I look for the Deputy&rsquo;s support and that of the Government in attempting to do that because it is the only way we will get to a better place.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom an cheist seo a ard&uacute;.  I thank the Minister for Education and Skills, <Col N="67"/>Deputy Quinn, for coming into the House to address this matter.  It is not just appreciated by myself but the people I represent that he is engaging with us on this level.</P>
        <P>Like other towns across the country, the population of the greater Clonakilty area has grown over the past decade.  Similarly, it will face challenges in acquiring the necessary infrastructure to meet the educational needs of future generations.  Clonakilty Community College was designed and built to accommodate 400 students but now has over 600 students enrolled.  The school has a shortage of science laboratories and a critical lack of other facilities which would lend themselves to good teaching practices.  Along with the health and safety implications of this aspect of overcrowding, the school relies on an old vocational building at the other end of the town to accommodate overflow classes which means students must traverse the very busy town centre to get to classes at the different sites in all sorts of weather.  This also poses difficulties to school management when timetabling classes.</P>
        <P>An extension to the college has been promised for the past ten years.  Just ahead of the 2002 general election, the appointment of a design team for an extension to the college was announced with great fanfare by then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Joe Walsh.  The promise was repeated again before the 2007 general election with the same ministerial letter confirming the appointment of a design team doing the rounds.  As of yet, however, nothing has materialised.</P>
        <P>While the extension is on a list of schools building projects for progression in 2011, I have not been able to ascertain any real movement from the Department.  Will the Minister give some political assistance to progress this important project?  Being a realist, I accept the Department has a limited capital works budget of &euro;440 million for next year while the Minister has 180 individual requests on his desk for schools building projects.  However, Clonakilty Community College, its students, their parents and staff deserve better after a decade of false promises and disappointment.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister engage with his officials to progress this overdue extension to accommodate future generations of students in the greater Clonakilty area?  Five similar projects in County Cork have been devolved to Cork County Vocational Education Committee already this year, all of which are progressing satisfactorily.  Will the Minister consider such a move in this case to facilitate it moving on to the design stage?</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the current position of the application for major capital funding from Clonakilty Community College.  Unfortunately, the culture of promises for schools building projects is corrupted.  Pledges going back to the 2002 general election and reiterated in 2007 have confused many communities.  One of my objectives is to provide absolute clarity on all projects in early January 2012.  If there is bad news, so be it.  We need clarity rather than obfuscation which only misleads people and generates hopes which are later dashed.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Skills forecasts an increase of over 25,000 post-primary pupils by the start of the 2018 school year.  This cohort will continue to grow until 2024 at least.  In the first quarter of this year 19,950 babies were born, the highest number of births since the quarterly series began in 1960.  The demographic challenge is enormous.  To meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the delivery of new schools together with extension projects will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  We must ensure every child born this morning will be looking into a schoolyard, not into a field, several years from now.</P><Col N="68"/>
        <P>Clonakilty Community College applied for major capital funding for an extension.  The application was assessed and assigned a band 2.4 rating.  Under the Department&rsquo;s assessment process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  A building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.</P>
        <P>The school&rsquo;s extension project was included in the announcement by the then Minister for Education and Skills January 2011 &mdash; we knew what we were heading into then &mdash; which stated, &ldquo;where briefs will be formulated in 2011 and the process of appointing a design team will commence&rdquo;.  This is the third time the college has been told a design team would be appointed.</P>
        <P>In this regard, it is intended to review with the school the long-term pupil enrolment.  The plans for the school also envisage the provision of accommodation for an all-Irish unit.  The next step will involve a site visit by the Department&rsquo;s technical staff which is envisaged to take place in the coming weeks.  The Deputy may update me on this when he responds.  Following the visit, a schedule of accommodation for the school will be drawn up.  When this process has been completed, the appointment of a design team can commence.</P>
        <P>We have no choice but to respond as a matter of urgency to the increasing cohort of school-going children.  Without making any commitment on this matter, I can only see this project advancing if Deputy Jim Daly&rsquo;s community can demonstrate a long-term pupil enrolment in the area.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s response and forthright attitude to dealing with it up front.  I will take on the challenge of engaging with departmental officials and the Minister to prove the college&rsquo;s case.  I acknowledge the efforts of the college&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; association which lobbied extensively for this building project.  It has been bitterly disappointed in the past.  I am not proud as a politician of how the parents&rsquo; hopes have been dashed.  It is no wonder politicians have a bad name.  I also commend the school&rsquo;s management, current and former principal and the staff who have put much time and effort into getting this project progressed.</P>
        <P>A site visit has not yet taken place.  I will get back to the Minister and his officials about the demographics for this project and continue to engage constructively to progress it.</P>

It should not be taken that this will happen in this case.  However, it must be recognised the VECs are performing excellent work in this area.  The Taoiseach has commented previously on the role of the old Army barracks in Monaghan town.

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to raise this important topical issue, namely, the need for the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide a detailed breakdown of the projected savings to his Department arising from the announcement of the closure of Columb Barracks, Mullingar, County Westmeath, which will be difficult to rationalise in light of the loss to the local economy, the disruption to Army personnel and their families and the elimination of an integral part of the culture and heritage of the town of Mullingar.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>To make any sense of the closure of Columb Barracks, Mullingar it is necessary to be fully informed of the thinking behind it.  I am aware that two issues have driven this decision &mdash; financial savings and the need to redeploy Army personnel.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Shatter, if he can provide a detailed breakdown of the projected savings to be realised.  It is necessary to equate those with the potential economic losses to the town of Mullingar and the devastation that will be caused to Army personnel and their wives, families and friends.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember that the barracks has been an integral part of the community of Mullingar since 1814.  The heritage and cultural aspects of such closures tend to be overlooked in the rush for financial savings but they are a vital part of the equation, and in many ways they are the key.  As the barracks in Mullingar is listed as a historical site it cannot be sold on and will be left lying idle and allowed to fall into disrepair if an alternative use is not found.</P><P>I am very concerned about the provisions of such an alternative use for Columb Barracks.  In this respect, the Minister has assured me that he is committed to expediting such a provision and I have every confidence in his word as he has already done his best to make provision in regard to Connolly Barracks, Longford.  In fact, he more than met his commitment in terms of seeking an urgent reappraisal of the value of that site which would be very suitable as an educational facility or campus.</P>
        <P>In terms of Columb Barracks, I am not convinced that the case of a financial saving has been proven.  Not only is the demand for building land at an all-time low, but the site cannot be sold and therefore I presume the cost effectiveness of the decision relates solely to overheads such as salaries, maintenance etc.</P>
        <P>While closing the barracks as an operational defence unit may be projected to make some savings the question is whether that will be enough overall to justify tearing the heart out of a rural town and impacting on the economic profile both in the short and long term.  It has been argued that the personnel from the barracks will more than likely remain in the area but that can neither be guaranteed nor is it a complete justification.</P>
        <P>That brings me to another point that is worrying me about the closure not only of Columb Barracks but of the 14 barracks that have closed throughout the country since 1998.  The fact that the latest closures should be enforced before the publication of the Green Paper on the Defence Forces is of concern to me and to the people of Mullingar.</P>
        <P>The Minister has assured this House that he believes the current strength of the Defence Forces should be maintained.  That is reassuring given that some people are assuming the closure of these barracks will lead to a reduction in personnel.  It is my belief that there could be a small increase in numbers and I would be grateful for clarification on that from the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Bannon who I know is very concerned about this particular issue.  As the House is aware, on Tuesday, 15 November the Government approved a proposal from me to proceed with a further phase of consolidation of Defence Forces personnel into fewer locations with the closure of four barracks, Clonmel, Mullingar, Cavan and Castlebar.  It is proposed to have the personnel transferred and the barracks closed no later than Friday, 30 March next.</P>
        <P>The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective in the ongoing defence modernisation programme in order to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>In these difficult times the closures will enhance the flexibility available to the Defence Forces in the use of their resources, both human and financial.  I am especially concerned to protect the strength of the Defence Forces being also mindful of the difficult economic situation <Col N="70"/>facing the country.  The numbers are currently just below 9,500 and I am anxious to ensure that Defence Forces numbers are maintained at approximately 9,500 both this year and in future years.</P>
        <P>While the major objectives of the closures is to release as many personnel as possible for operational duties, annual savings in respect of utilities, security duty allowances and maintenance will also arise.  This will amount to approximately &euro;1.3 million per annum in respect of the four closures.</P>
        <P>In addition to the cost of utilities each barracks requires a security detail and additional further personnel are tied up on purely administrative duties connected to the management of the particular barracks.  Because maintaining barrack security requires around the clock cover, a much larger pool of personnel is required.  Therefore, several hundred additional man years will become available for operational duties.  At a minimum, the value of this efficiency gain will comfortably exceed &euro;5 million per year.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks, as the Deputy is aware, I have met with individual Members of the Oireachtas and a delegation from Mullingar as well as delegations from Clonmel and Cavan.  I have reflected carefully and at length on the sincere and genuine concerns raised by the delegation who put forward very strongly held views as to why the barracks in Mullingar and the other two barracks should be retained.  I wish to acknowledge the sincerity and courtesy with which these views were conveyed.</P>
        <P>It is appreciated and understood that the consolidation proposals may result in a level of hardship on some personnel and both staff of the Department and the military authorities will take into account the personal circumstances of those stationed at the locations concerned including Mullingar.  Generally speaking, people will be expected to transfer with their unit to the new location.  However, requests for transfers to units in other locations will be examined on a case-by-case basis having regard to the availability of vacancies.</P>
        <P>The military authorities have agreed to provide a transport service between Mullingar and Athlone if required. This will be for an initial period to allow the transfer to be effected.  Briefings will be held in all barracks including Mullingar.  The purpose of these briefings is to give precise details of the change of station allowance scheme and to address any concerns that may arise.  Essentially, this scheme provides for the payment of certain allowances to personnel who are permanently transferred to a new station and who meet certain conditions.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Government decision I have asked my Department to enter into discussions with other Departments, local authorities and State agencies regarding the possible purchase of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.</P>
        <P>As I stated earlier, I am conscious of the hardship this decision may impose on some personnel and their families and I can assure the House that it was not a decision that was taken lightly.  However, because of the appalling economic legacy inherited by this Government from its predecessor difficult decisions have to be taken affecting all areas of society.  The current proposals are in the best interests of the Defence Forces and that must be my priority.  Maintaining the numbers in the Defence Forces to ensure they can maximise their capabilities to the benefit of the community in both domestic and international duties is central.</P>
        <P>There is no question of the barracks being left idle and let fall into disrepair.  As Deputy Bannon knows, since becoming Minister I have been actively engaged in seeking a means of dealing with Connolly Barracks, Longford, which has been revalued.  As a consequence of an engagement between my Department and the local council I am optimistic that in the not too distant future arrangements will be made to the benefit of all with regard to that barracks.</P><Col N="71"/>
        <P>The legacy of barracks in this country does not derive from any strategic decision ever made by our Defence Forces.  They derive from the view of the British authorities when we were a colony as to where barracks should be located to keep down the rebellious Irish.  We will have 14 barracks in the country when the four barracks in question are closed.  I hope these decisions will be to the benefit of the Defence Forces and to the community generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Deputy James Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I emphasise, however, that I am not convinced that the case for savings has been proved.  I have been informed today by a number of Army wives of a disturbing development in the matter concerning Columb Barracks.  It has been brought to my attention that troops from Mullingar are being moved into the old FCA quarters in Athlone, which is a condemned building.  It has been further claimed that troops will have to collect their weapons in Athlone and bring them under escort to rented premises in Mullingar for training purposes.  This journey will be undertaken twice per day.  Surely this is ludicrous in terms of cost and efficiency.  Is the information provided to me true?  There is great anger and frustration among people in Mullingar and the wider community about the closure of Mullingar barracks which has been an integral part of the community since 1814.  I am as disappointed as everyone else about what has taken place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Bannon knows, no one will lose his or her job as a consequence of these changes.  The jobs will be retained and I hope and believe the families concerned will continue to reside in Mullingar.  The Mullingar economy should continue to benefit from the income received by the troops in Mullingar from the work they do in the Defence Forces.  I know the Deputy and his constituency colleague, Deputy McFadden, have been very concerned about these developments.  I assure them I will do what I can to work with colleagues in the House and the local community, through the Department of Defence, to ensure matters are dealt with in a manner that is ultimately to the benefit of the community and a value is realised from the premises to the benefit of the Defence Forces, as has happened in the past, so that moneys can be reinvested in the Defence Forces to the benefit of all of those who currently serve in Mullingar.</P>
        <P>I am unaware of the issues the Deputy raised and will ensure I obtain information to respond to him on them.  I will write to the Deputy in that regard.  I look forward to working with him and his colleague, Deputy McFadden, in seeking to identify appropriate uses for the barracks and, I hope, appropriate purchasers for the site so that it becomes a dynamic centre of activity to the benefit of the local community.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together. </P>
        <P>The Government is fully alert to the sacrifices people must make and the need to lessen the impact of decisions on the vulnerable as much as possible.  The unfortunate reality is that Ireland is facing a budgetary crisis, which we must correct if we are to regain the ability to restore public services in the future.  Until we achieve this objective, difficult consolidation measures will be necessary.  The Government is determined to bring about this fiscal correction in a fair and proportionate manner, striking a balance between spending and taxation measures.  It is in the process of considering all of the options that have been developed and the detailed measures on which we decide will be announced in the first week of December.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government is committed to reforming our entire public service to provide better services to citizens and reduce administrative costs across the system.  Today, I launched a public service reform plan, with a range of specific and time bound commitments and a far-reaching programme of rationalising State agencies and quangos.  The efficiencies arising in this overall context will mitigate the impact on front line services of the regrettable expenditure reductions we must make.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the general response from the Minister.  I framed the question to elicit information on the impact on the most vulnerable people in our communities of announcements related to the comprehensive review of expenditure which I had hoped the Minister would make today.  Instead, he published a document on public sector reform.  My main concern with his proposals is the lack of management plan for maintaining front line services, namely, those provided by nurses, firemen, ambulance drivers, emergency medic technicians, garda&iacute; and so forth.  The Minister did not announce levels below which employment in these services would not be allowed to drop.  If all staff in a key area of a private sector company were leaving, the company would take measures to ensure the key service provided by the area in question was not wiped out.  The document published today does not state that the number of nurses, ambulance drivers and so forth will not be allowed to fall below a certain level.  Rather than having a crude cut in public sector numbers, public sector reform should be managed.  I am surprised the Minister announced public sector numbers would decline by 12,000, which is more than the figure agreed by the previous Government.</P>
        <P>I am concerned not only about social welfare rates but also the people who depend on front line services.  I welcome the decision taken by the Minister for Education and Skills on examination classes as it will allow teachers to remain in employment.  Similar decisions are needed in key areas such as nursing and the ambulance service.  The Government should provide a commitment that the number of staff in certain sectors will not fall below a certain level.  If, as is possible, 20,000 nurses were to decide to retire by next February, the country would not be able to cope.  I want the Government to produce a plan to prevent a scenario in which we do not have key front line staff when the current retirement regime comes to an end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is little in what Deputy Fleming said with which I do not fully agree.  It is the objective, as far as is practicable, to defend front line services.  We need to downsize our public services.  While I believe the numbers outlined can be achieved without impacting on the delivery of services, I will not pretend that this will not be a challenge.  It will mean we will have to have flexibility from staff within the confines of the Croke Park agree<Col N="73"/>ment.  Services must be delivered better, more efficiently and in different ways.  I have been engaging with public service unions in that regard virtually from the moment of my appointment and believe the objective can be met.</P>
        <P>In terms of the specifics, the Deputy referred to education and having a strategy to deal with the numbers of employees who may exit the public service by the end of February.  I have been cognisant of this matter from the beginning and I have had discussions with all my colleagues on the issue.  Each Department has a strategy to deal with contingencies.  For this reason, I asked that the Department be notified at least three months in advance in order that we can make preparations.   I hope this will happen.  We are very much in the business of managing the exit packages.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s point about having a floor on numbers, I will publish later today the employment control framework for each sector.  We will, therefore, know what is the baseline for garda&iacute;, Army personnel, civil servants and so forth across the public service.  Perhaps the frameworks can be examined in some detail in the relevant committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Deputy a moment to catch her breath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the Minister&rsquo;s concern about the issue I raised.  He made an issue of his decision to require staff to give three months&rsquo; notice to enable Departments to plan ahead.  However, when I tabled a parliamentary question asking whether this notice period formed part of terms of agreement, I discovered staff are not legally obliged to give three months&rsquo; notice.  The Minister engaged in something of a bluff when he gave the impression that staff would be required to give three months&rsquo; notice to enable him to plan ahead because we now realise there was no basis for claiming staff would do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health stated the other day that while the Health Service Executive employs 33% of public sector staff, it accounts for more than 40% of retirements.  I am concerned that this trend will continue.   I am expressing a concern which the Minister must be aware of, but I do not see anything from him to suggest how he will head it off.  I hope the answer is not more agency nurses and paying staff to retire and come back on an agency basis the following Monday morning, as has been known to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The plan for education that the Deputy approves of is exactly that.  People will be able to retire but stay in place until the exams.  There may be a need for such flexibility in other sectors.  I am open to that where it is needed.  The objective will to ensure that we protect services as far as possible.</P>
        <P>The Deputy fears that there might be a mass exodus from the health service.  We have long spoken about the layers of administration in the HSE.  I would not shed too many salty tears if many administrators left.  I have more of a difficulty if many front line staff left.  The idea behind asking for three months&rsquo; notice is so that we can put a handle on that.  The Deputy is dead right, and I said so at the time, that people are not contractually obliged to give notice.  However, I have asked people to give us notice.  Everybody in the public service has an interest in ensuring that the services they have spent their lives providing continue to be provided.  By and large, the indications are that people will give us decent notice to make those contingency plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm.  I got caught up in the finance committee.  It was all fascinating, so I am sorry about that.</P><Col N="74"/>
        <P>I would like to ask about the impact of the expenditure cuts on lower and middle income families.  I know the Minister is going to publish the comprehensive spending review.  I understand that it is a very detailed document.  I wonder about an impact assessment for those on fixed incomes, low incomes and so on.  How will the Government measure the impact of the upcoming cutbacks on people&rsquo;s spending power?</P>
        <P>I am sure I do not have to rehearse the statistics on things such as unemployment levels.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has published shocking figures showing the increase in the use of its services, not least in Dublin and Cork.  We currently have 161,000 family carers providing support for elderly, the unwell, and people with disabilities.  The Government has already cut the fuel allowance and the electricity and gas allowance.  The housing association Respond has noted that 14.1% of the population is at risk of poverty, while one in every eight mortgages is in distress.  That is a whistle-stop tour of the misery.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s preoccupation with balancing the books is not without reason.  We have just had a very interesting conversation at the finance committee with the new fiscal council.  That debate about what works best&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The council is looking for &euro;4.4 billion in cuts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>It has dispensed with that.  The argument was about expenditure cuts or taxation measures.  The evidence is not that measures on the expenditure side are most effective.  The Minister might dust down that analysis.  What way does he propose to protect low and middle income families?  What kind of an impact assessment has his Department carried out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to pretend for a minute that the adjustments the Government is required to take are anything we would want to do or anything that can be done in a painless way.  There is already an extraordinary degree of pain being endured by the people of Ireland, top to bottom.  We want to make the adjustments we have to make to get to the fiscal target of a 3% deficit by 2015 in the orderly way we have set out.  There are those who have argued that we should do this in one big bang, regardless of the social consequences.  We have negotiated with the funding troika to do this in an orderly way, not a painless way.  This means that in order to get to the stage post of an 8.6% deficit next year, we need to make adjustments of &euro;3.8 billion.</P>
        <P>The Deputy spoke about the balance between taxation and expenditure cuts.  My own party campaigned during the general election on the basis of a 50:50 ratio.  Fine Gael campaigned on the basis of a 75:25 ratio.  The balance in the medium-term fiscal statement will be in the order of a 60:40 ratio.  It is not that people love taxes, but we are very conscious of the impact of cuts on the living standards of ordinary people and on sucking money out of the economy, in terms of allowing a growth strategy as part of our economic strategy.  There cannot be just cuts and taxation.  There must also be a growth and jobs element and we are trying to preserve that.  These are difficult balances to strike.</P>
        <P>We will try to do this as fairly as possible.  We are worried about the impact across different sectors.  An impact on education might impact on the same family or individuals in social welfare or transport.  We are trying to get a cross-departmental impact assessment to see minimise the impact on the most vulnerable.</P>

        <Quest>  the discussions if any he has had with public service sectoral interests in the context of next year&rsquo;s budget; the impacts if any, that have been advised to them in terms of staff and budget reductions; the planned reductions in 2012 by sector; the way the reductions will be managed to ensure front line services are maintained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35353/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that some of the issues raised in her question relate to budgetary matters which will be addressed in December&rsquo;s budget.  I do not propose to pre-empt any decisions of the Government on the budget in my reply, nor have I done so in any discussions with public service sectoral interests, and I have met a cross-section of them.  However, the programme for Government provides for a reduction of public service employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010 and to reduce that number by a further 4,000 by 2015.</P>
        <P>The necessary reduction in public service numbers to meet the sustainable targets set is well under way and the number employed has fallen below 300,000 for the first time since 2006.  This process will also benefit from the anticipated number of retirements up to end of February 2012,  when the option available to public servants, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act, 2009, to retire on their pre-existing salaries expires.  However, I need hardly emphasise the immense challenge this reduction in numbers provides and will continue to provide for the public service in the coming years, particularly when the pressures on all public services are increasing at a time when the resources available to fund our public services have never been so stretched.  In order to protect front line services, the necessary reduction in numbers and resources will require a fundamental change to the way in which the Government and the public services operate.  I tried to outline that today and I look forward to explaining it to the committees in more detail later.</P>
        <P>To address current challenges and those that will inevitably arise in the coming years, I am confident that our public services and all of us as public servants will be flexible, adaptable and open to change as we go about our public work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>In asking this question, I was trying to visualise how these cuts will be delivered and managed sector by sector.  I believe that public service reform was needed long before the crash happened, and I think the Minister would agree with that.  One of the things that needs to be achieved is that we get the right people with the right skills in the right locations if we are to have such a major reduction in numbers.  If we end up rehiring people on a contract basis or an agency basis, this will defeat the purpose of the reform.  We get one chance at this.</P>
        <P>I produced a document on this and I will give a copy of it to the Minister later.  It is about this very point.  There are wide differences in the quality of public services, depending on where people live.  We have used this historic model, rather than looking at patterns of growth.  The areas that tend to do disproportionately poorly are those that are expanding and have a young demographic.  These have the greatest need for public services.  The point is made by the examples I have used.  I will pass these on to the Minister, for what it is worth.  Essentially, I am trying to get a sense of what kind of roadmap we have to make sure we target this kind of inequality of service provision while at the same time protecting front-line services in the context of the changes that are inevitably going to happen.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="76"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy makes a valid point, and I would be delighted to read her proposals in this regard.  One of the things I said today is that we do not have a monopoly of ideas on this side of the House.  This is a process, and we are open to ideas.  When I come to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I will make a full presentation on the timelines and the objectives that are being set out and how we are to achieve them, and any new ideas will be very welcome in that context.</P>
        <P>Two of the points made by the Deputy are really important.  One is the need for an integrated public service, because the current public service has grown like Topsy.  I have only had a really good birds-eye view of it from my new position in the last eight months, although I have been involved in public affairs for a long time.  One can see this by looking at any area of it.  For example, holiday arrangements vary from 22 days to 45 days, with people getting fair days or race days depending on where they are, and hours are operated differently.  To have an integrated public service with flexibility of movement within it is my objective, although it will take some time.  We are setting the pieces in place from now on, but to change what is in place is much more profound.  Ironically, the awfulness of a crisis gives one leverage to do things one probably could not have done in what one might call peacetime.  There is a major buy-in from the public service &mdash; I hope there will be &mdash; to allow the sort of profound changes the Deputy and I would like to see.</P>
        <P>The second important point made by the Deputy was about changing the emphasis &mdash; putting the focus on the citizen so he or she is in control.  For example, in the health service we want to deliver, the money will follow the patient.  People will not be arguing for this hospital or that hospital; the patient will decide where he or she wants to be treated, and the good hospitals will flourish while the public themselves will move away from those that are inefficient, have long waiting times or do not deliver high quality treatments.  That maxim should be followed in service delivery across all areas of the public service.  Access to information is also important.  We want better statistics to be available &mdash; a sort of reversal of the principle of freedom of information, so that people are not asking for information but we are actually pushing it out.  In this way we can provide a good snapshot of services and know where the best services are available.  This would not only allow the citizen to access the best services but also shame the ones that are not good.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on persons in State and semi-State employment who are earning more than &euro;250,000 per annum; and if he will introduce legislation under the Financial Emergency Measures Acts to eliminate this practice including current recipients.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government supports a strong policy of pay restraint within the public sector.  This is evidenced by the fact that immediately on assumption of office &mdash; on the night of their appointment &mdash; the Taoiseach, other members of the Government and a number of other office-holders voluntarily reduced their salary rates.  In addition, I immediately began the process of considering whether it would be appropriate to impose general pay ceilings across the public service and in respect of chief executive officer posts in commercial semi-<Col N="77"/>State companies where remuneration is subject to ministerial sanction.  This process culminated in the Government&rsquo;s decision of June last to introduce a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, and a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within commercial State companies.</P>
        <P>With regard to those office-holders whose pay rates are established in primary legislation and the Judiciary, and in light of the outcome of the recent referendum on the 29th amendment to the Constitution, new statutory provisions for the remuneration of judges, together with the necessary provisions to give legislative effect to the voluntary pay reductions for the Taoiseach and other office-holders, will be provided through a single dedicated enactment to be published shortly.  The Deputy will recall that I made such a provision in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill that we passed.  I will now take it out of that Act and present it to the D&aacute;il, I hope, for early enactment as a stand-alone Bill.</P>
        <P>Having given detailed consideration to the legal advice provided on potential legal and contractual issues arising from the imposition of an immediate reduction in the salaries of current incumbents whose salaries are in excess of the proposed ceilings, the Government concluded that the ceilings should apply only to new appointments to the relevant positions.  In introducing general pay ceilings for new appointees, the Government recognised, however, that in a small number of cases exceptions may be necessary.  Any such exceptions are subject to my prior approval as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  While no such exceptions have been made to date, the introduction of legislation imposing a statutory pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 would limit the scope of the Government and Ministers to respond quickly to exceptional circumstances involving a role of substantial importance in the public service or a commercial semi-State sector.  It is my view &mdash; I have considered this from the point of view of equity &mdash; that it is not practical to do what the Deputy suggests, although I would be minded to do so.</P>
        <P>I am aware that, notwithstanding recent initiatives by the Government, there remains a small number of individuals &mdash; 18 &mdash; who are in receipt of remuneration in excess of &euro;250,000 and whose remuneration is subject to ministerial sanction.  In addition, certain academic consultants at professorial level in the health and education sector are in receipt of remuneration of more than &euro;250,000 per annum.  There are no persons in either the Civil Service or local authorities with salaries above &euro;200,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the last point and I accept there is nobody earning more than &euro;200,000 in the Civil Service or local authorities.  The Minister mentioned that 18 people were receiving remuneration of more than &euro;250,000.  He might tell us the categories of people and the agencies involved.  He went on to mention some academics and medics.  Are they in addition to the 18 people mentioned first?  He might clarify that.</P>
        <P>What prompted my question is the fact &mdash; I do not wish to personalise this &mdash; that the chief executives of the ESB and the Dublin Airport Authority, along with hospital consultants, were not included in the previous arrangement, and we were told that they would be dealt with at an early stage.  That was last July, but there is no sign of this happening.  I would add to this the senior people at AIB, which is a completely State-owned company &mdash; I would not even call it a commercial semi-State, although it is a semi-State of some description &mdash; and those in the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Minister has unanimous support in this House to deal with this issue.  He would have unanimous support from the people of Ireland also.  Let one or two of them go to court if they are so minded; I think the Minister would have the support even of the Judiciary if it came to that.  That is why I mentioned legislation in my question.  This might have to be done under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public <Col N="78"/>Interest Act or some similar mechanism to give a legal backing to the measures taken.  I would support the Minister if he did all this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the Deputy and I have any difference of opinion on this.  It is a question of how we do it rather than what we do.  Of the 18 individuals I mentioned, one is a Member of the Oireachtas.  That confused me when I saw it; it is, of course, the President, who is a House of the Oireachtas in and of himself.  I should tell the House that the President has indicated to my Department that he wishes to undertake a voluntary pay reduction, and that has been put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that include his pension as a former Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer that separately.  I do not want to get into a discussion on the President, but the Deputy can be assured that the highest probity will attach itself to all his actions.</P>
        <P>Of the other members of the group of 18 I mentioned, seven are CEOs of commercial semi-State bodies, all of whom have taken a reduction, although their salaries are still over &euro;250,000.  The Deputy will recall the process I outlined.  I did not want simply to have a flat rate.  I took some stick when I said I did not want the CEO of Bord na gCon paid the same as the CEO of the ESB; there should be differences.  A process was undertaken by the previous Government called the Hay evaluation, which ranked pay grades in proportionate terms, and I have reduced these accordingly.</P>
        <P>Of the rest of the 18, one is the CEO of a non-commercial semi-State body, and the rest are the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Supreme Court judges.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will reconsider the programme for Government commitment to sell off commercial State assets taking into consideration that neither the IMF nor the EU have demanded the budgetary measure nor does the memorandum of understanding explicitly call for the privatisation of State assets.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35357/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position as understood by the Deputy is not correct.  While the programme for Government provides for the sale of non-strategic State assets to part fund investment in key networks of the economy under the NewERA programme, the disposal of State assets is also a requirement under the external funding programme agreed with the European institutions and the International Monetary Fund.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding governing the programme commits the Government to consider options for an ambitious programme of asset disposals, based on the programme for Government and the report of the review group on state assets and liabilities.  A draft programme of asset disposals must be prepared and submitted to the EU-IMF by end of this year for discussion with the troika in advance of final decisions being taken on the elements to be pursued.  A final decision on the programme to be pursued will be made by Government, taking into account the outcome of discussions with the troika on the amount of proceeds to be generated and also on the use to which these proceeds can be put.  However, at this point, I have no intention of reconsidering the programme for Government commitment in this area.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="79"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a great pity.  We have debated this matter before and I believe the Minister is making a great mistake and that his thinking is short term.  Should the Government proceed in these matters it will amount to a fire sale of valuable strategic assets.  I am consistently baffled that the Minister describes the disposal of a 10% share of the ESB as playing with a non-strategic asset.</P>
        <P>The Government has been invited to consider options.  No obligation has been placed on the Government in the memorandum of understanding.  Here is the thing &mdash; we met the troika and we put our concerns to them on this specific issue.  I put it to them directly, asking whether they were a part of a discussion or a decision making process in respect of the semi-State companies and the ESB in particular.  They informed me that they were not party to such a discussion and that it was not for them to advise, instruct or guide the Government on the matter.  They told me clearly that the decision was taken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party &mdash; by the Government &mdash; independently and irrespective of the troika.  For the purposes of clarity, will the Minister tell me who was right and who was wrong because I have conflicting versions of events now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unsure what the question is but I will tell the Deputy what happened.  The original memorandum of understanding signed by the previous Government in December 2010 contained the following commitment:</P>
        <P LI="1">Building on the forthcoming report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities...State authorities will consult with the Commission Services on the results of this assessment with a view to setting appropriate targets for the possible privatisation of state-owned assets.</P>
        <P FLI="0">When we met the troika, they demanded a quantum of &euro;5 billion.  This was the figure they discussed with us.  We refused to accept any quantum because the programme agreed between the two parties in government stated that we would seek to raise from the sale of State assets a sum of up to &euro;2 billion to re-invest in job creation in the next generation of State investments.  The Deputy is correct; the troika did not engage with us in terms of what we should sell.</P>
        <P>Bluntly, there is enough oversight of what we do already without inviting them to do more.  We examined the McCarthy report independently and called on every line Department to give us advices on it and my Department studied these.  The settled view of Government was to move away from what was agreed in the programme for Government, that is, to break up the ESB.  That was what the Commission had been pushing for us to do for a long time.  We are keen to keep the ESB as an integrated entity and instead sell a minority stakeholding.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to a percentage.  We have decided on no percentage yet.  We were discussing a quantum of money and it is invidious to start discussing the value of any percentage until we test the market.  I have no difficulty with the Deputy criticising me; I could get used to it.  However, she should wait until we do something.  The Deputy is inclined to criticise before the action.  It was suggested that we were not going to get the minimum wage reversed but then we did so.  Then it was suggested that we would not be able to reduce the interest rate but then we did so.  Let us see the &ldquo;when&rdquo; before we discuss fire sales.  There will be no fire sales.  Our commitment is only to sell State assets when the market conditions are right, when we can get a decent return for the State and when we can get good value.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  if he intends to review non-commercial State agency expenditure.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35187/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The comprehensive review of expenditure which has been carried out across all Departments in recent months has carefully examined all areas of Exchequer spending, including the funding provided by Departments to the non-commercial State bodies that operate under their aegis.  The comprehensive review of expenditure has been finalised and it is now informing the decisions that the Government is taking in the context of deciding the Estimates for next year and the years beyond.</P>
        <P>As a further part of the Government&rsquo;s reform plans, today I announced the Government&rsquo;s new target for further reductions in public sector numbers in the coming years.  We are now in the process of determining new staffing ceilings for each of the public services and these will be announced in the first week in December as part of the budget and Estimates.  A revised employment control framework, ECF, will be published at that time setting out the staff numbers ceiling for each Vote area, thus encompassing the individual Departments and their non-commercial agencies.</P>
        <P>In respect of State agencies, the Deputy will be aware that today I announced the Government&rsquo;s plans to reduce the number of such bodies.  The Government has demonstrated its commitment to reform and the pursuit of efficiencies by rationalising 48 bodies by the end of 2012 and by nominating a further 46 bodies for critical review by the end of June 2012.  This radical streamlining of State bodiesis a key deliverable of the Government&rsquo;s reform programme and will lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.</P>
        <P>The Government has also decided to: introduce &ldquo;sunset clauses&rdquo; when new bodies are created which will ensure that a new body will cease to exist after a predetermined date unless its mandate is specifically renewed; ensure that Departments regularly review the business case for all significant State bodies; and require that robust service level agreements are put in place as a matter of urgency by each Department with each of its State bodies.  The overriding imperative must remain the absolute requirement to achieve major savings in all areas of expenditure and to reduce staff numbers and administrative overheads.  This underscores the need to ensure that public services delivered by State bodies are done in the most cost-effective manner possible.</P>
        <P>Finally, the issue of shared services, which has the potential to transform the cost effectiveness of State bodies, is also being examined by my Department and I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for confirming in the previous answer that the decision on the ESB, whatever the percentage, was that of the Government alone and not the troika.  I have read the Minister&rsquo;s report.  Is the Minister seeking to introduce a cutback in terms of fees for board members for these State agencies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy referring to the stipend they get for being board members?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The Minister makes a general argument about increased efficiencies and cost savings but he has not detailed these anywhere.  I refer, for instance, to one of the decisions made, that is, the case of the Ombudsman for Children.  I wonder at the <Col N="81"/>wisdom of this given how central, sensitive and successful the office has been.  Is it wise to amalgamate even back office functions with another agency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Fees for board members have already been reduced.  The Deputy is probably aware of the controversy whereby I have also issued a directive to the effect that no public servant appointed to a board may be paid a fee.  The idea of one person, one fee and one payment should exist.</P>
        <P>With regard to the amalgamation it seems the back office supports for the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Ombudsman for Children will do no damage to the independence or robustness of the latter office.  It will simply make it more efficient and streamline the services.  It is similar to several other amalgamations and shared services arrangements and serves as a driver for change and reform.  We should be open to change and not simply think that something must have its own edifice.  Government Department should have shared human resources management, pensions arrangements and pay.  We do not need to duplicate such things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s last points.  Did he consult with the Ombudsman for Children in respect of the amalgamation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not go through the possibility with every agency.  I examined the possible amalgamations and they were fed out to Departments and observations were taken in.  In each area where there is an amalgamation, a subsumption or abolition proposed, the views of the parent Department would have been taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Only limited consultation with the actual agencies took place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the extent to which the Department consulted with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister not think that is a flaw?  The Minister is standing over this report. He has provided a list of amalgamations and so on. No rationale is provided in the report.  I am concerned that the Minister does not have, in his headed paper, an analysis and confirmation that a minimum of consultation happened with the agencies in question.  I am surprised he would stand over the report if consultation did not take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy would love to lead me into an area but I will not allow her to do that.  To put it bluntly, this is about efficiencies and savings.  One does not need to consult with every agency to determine if the State can get better back office support by amalgamating human resources management elsewhere.  I did not ask every Department if it was willing to have a common pay and pensions system.  Back office support does not require consultation.  The independence of the offices concerned will be fully vindicated.  The process of implementation will have to involve detailed consultation with all of the bodies and individuals concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is currently examining all options as regards the required consolidation in 2012, including the results of the comprehensive review of expenditure and the capital review and is steadfast in its determination to ensure the targets set out in the medium-term fiscal statement are met while prioritising programmes and projects that best support economic recovery.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the balance between current and capital expenditure, the State has made huge strides in closing our infrastructure gap over recent years.  For example, the national network of world-class motorways is now substantially complete and this progress allows us scope to scale back our capital allocation so that we can prioritise investment in the most high-growth, high-employment sectors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The frontloading of capital consolidation also creates the scope to implement the large-scale reforms on current expenditure that are required in the early years of the programme to ensure the impact of current consolidation on the most vulnerable in society is mitigated to the greatest extent possible, while still delivering on our commitments under the EU-IMF programme of financial support.</P>
        <P>We are continuing to fix the public finances and the banking system.  In addition, we are focusing our constrained resources and limited flexibility on supporting job creation in specific areas with the greatest potential for employment growth, as we have done in the jobs initiative.  Within the framework of the agreed consolidation, the Government is committed to promoting job creation and enhancing its labour market activation strategy to ensure the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, are in a position to take up jobs as soon as possible in our economy.</P>
        <P>Our aim is that every individual on the live register will have deeper and more regular engagement and support according to their needs and will be offered job search assistance with appropriate education, training or work experience opportunity to increase their employability and keep them close to the labour market.  To achieve this aim, next year a fundamental restructuring of the institutional framework for labour market activation is being put in place through the establishment of the national employment and entitlements service and the new further education and training authority.  More regular engagement with unemployed people through these new structures will bring our labour market activation strategy into line with best international practice.</P>

        <Quest>  further to <Col N="83"/>Parliamentary Questions Nos. 40 and 41 of 5 July 2011, the further progress that has been made regarding the roll-out of the revaluation programme to local authorities outside of Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[34427/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">As I explained in response to previous questions, the revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area where it was completed in 2007.  It has since been completed in the Fingal County Council area in 2009 and in D&uacute;n Laoghaire&mdash;Rathdown in 2010.  The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area was commenced in May this year, having been postponed for well over a year because of the volatility and conditions in the property market.  The Dublin city part of the programme will entail the valuation of approximately 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in 2013.</P>
        <P>It is intended to roll out the revaluation programme to other local authority areas shortly.  I understand the commissioner intends to make an order for revaluation of the Waterford City, Waterford County and Dungarvan Town Council areas before the end of the year.  He has also initiated formal consultations with Limerick City and Limerick County Council on the timing of revaluation in those areas.</P>
        <P>The commissioner, in consultation with officials from my Department, has been reviewing various proposals for modernising and streamlining the valuation process, including the appeal provisions, in the interests of both ratepayers and the local authorities.  He is conscious that progress has been slow and he is anxious to improve this.  For that reason, he has indicated that following this detailed examination he has concluded it may be feasible to introduce a self-assessment approach, accompanied by appropriate controls, and that it might be possible also to outsource some of the work.  As well as helping to speed up the national programme, an element of outsourcing, if it proves practicable, would allow comparison of the Valuation Office productivity and costs with those in the private sector.</P>
        <P>The enabling provisions to allow for these changes are included in proposals for amending legislation made to me by the commissioner which are being examined in Department.  A significant amount of work has already been undertaken and preliminary heads of a Bill have been drafted in conjunction with the Valuation Office and the Attorney General which I hope to bring to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>Preparatory work is continuing in drawing up the detailed schemes and, subject to the enactment of the legislation and availability of the necessary resources, I understand that the intention would be to initiate pilot revaluations in two local authority areas.  The Valuation Office is also looking at ways of speeding up the capture of data on properties throughout the country in advance of revaluation in particular areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response and welcome the progress that has been made.  I wish to impress upon him the urgent need for further progress in this area.  Will he comment on an issue that has been brought to my attention?  The average rates for hotel rooms in Cork are approximately &euro;3,000 per bedroom, whereas in some parts of Dublin some properties have already been revaluated and the rate is just over &euro;1,000.  Can the Minister comment on competitiveness in that area?</P>
        <P>Hotels in Cork are finding it difficult to compete in the face of such disparity in rates.  Many hotels and other businesses are experiencing this difficulty because valuations are so out of date.  Will the Minister take this issue on board as a matter of urgency?  Will he seek to push for a resolution as soon as possible, through outsourcing, self-assessment and the updating of <Col N="84"/>existing lists, to which he referred?  The revaluation commenced in 2005 but has only been completed in a small area of the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully appreciate what the Deputy is saying and I fully agree with him.  When I first looked at this issue I was dismayed at the slow pace of progress.  Part of the problem is that it is difficult to undertake any valuation when property prices are in total flux, as has been the case in recent years.  The competitiveness issue the Deputy has highlighted is a significant problem throughout the State.  That type of competitive imbalance on the basis of simple geography should not arise.</P>
        <P>Upon assuming office, I was concerned at the time envisaged for the completion of the full revaluation of the country which, if we did not make any changes, was scheduled to reach completion as late as 2018.  It is for this reason that I am introducing legislation and considering other measures such as self-valuation &mdash; with appropriate safeguards &mdash; and outsourcing.  I hope to be in a position to bring concrete proposals to Government this term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not mention the State&rsquo;s second city, Cork, and Cork county.  Can he give any indication as to when the revaluation might occur there?  It is important for the southern region that it be done as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>

The guidelines specify that all appointments of ministerial staff, including the pay and terms and conditions of employment, require the prior sanction of my Department.  Appointments from outside the Civil Service also require the sanction of the Taoiseach.

Each Minister of State may have a maximum of five staff in his or her private office, down from seven, and three staff in his or her constituency office, reduced from five.  Each Minister of State who is assigned to more than one Department may have a total of seven staff in his or her private office, down from nine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This marks a considerable reduction from the levels of staffing permitted under the previous Government, with the overall reduction in staff assigned to Ministers&rsquo; private and constituency offices being in the order of 25%.  Within these staffing limits a Minister or Minister of State may appoint one personal secretary and one personal assistant.  The personal secretary or per<Col N="85"/>sonal assistant may be assigned to the Minister&rsquo;s private office or constituency office at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
        <P>There has been one case in which I have sanctioned the appointment of a staff member, to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, at a rate above that set out in the guidelines.  This was done on an exceptional basis so that the individual did not suffer a loss of pay.  In a small number of cases I have allowed people to start on a higher point within the appropriate salary scale for personal secretary and personal assistant.  I have already provided the Deputy with full details regarding the appointment of special advisers in answers to recent parliamentary questions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This afternoon I announced several key developments in regard to public service reform, including the publication of the Government&rsquo;s public service reform plan which sets the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the public sector in the coming years.  At the heart of this reform agenda is a focus on five major commitments to change.  These include placing customer service at the core of everything we do; maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; radically reducing our costs to drive better value for money; leading, organising and working in new ways; and a strong focus on implementation and delivery.</P>
        <P>The plan, which has been circulated to all Deputies and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, outlines the priority actions and time lines for reform in a broad range of areas such as public service numbers, e-Government, customer service, shared services, procurement, business process improvement, public expenditure reform, agency rationalisation and so on.  Several actions in these and other areas are already under way.  The plan also focuses on actions to improve performance by organisations and individuals in order to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</P>
        <P>The reform plan sets out how implementation should be driven and monitored, including by the reform and delivery office which I have established in my Department.  It is planned to have an integrated approach to public service reform which will align a number of key elements, including the programme for Government, the comprehensive review of expenditure, delivery <Col N="86"/>of reform to front line services within individual sectors, co-ordinated delivery of key cross-cutting reforms and the public service agreement.</P>
        <P>My Department has been given a clear mandate to drive and enable public service reform and the focus now is on implementing the key reforms required.  In this context, the new reform and delivery office has a key role to facilitate, drive and support the reform programme.  The office is being led by a recently appointed programme director who is working closely with organisations across the public service with a view to enabling them to drive the delivery of reform at a local level, as well as lead on cross-cutting reform issues.</P>
        <P><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P>The challenging fiscal position which we face means that far-reaching reform of the public service is essential in order to ensure it is customer-focused, leaner, more efficient, better integrated and delivering maximum value for money.  Significant savings are already being made by this Government, not least in regard to public service numbers.  A reduction of 5,000 is expected this year, bringing the numbers to below 300,000 by the end of 2011.  By 2015, public service numbers are expected to have fallen by 37,500 since 2008, a reduction of almost 12%.  Once achieved, this will have reduced our gross pay bill by more than &euro;2.5 billion, or15%, since 2008.  The public service agreement implementation body today published a summary of progress on the implementation of the agreement in the last six months, which shows that good progress continues to be made in that regard.</P>
        <P>The comprehensive review of expenditure, CRE, has involved a root and branch examination of all areas of public spending in order to determine where resources can be moved from old spending lines to new priorities and how the business of Government can be delivered in new ways.  The outcome of the CRE, which has involved input from all Departments and their agencies, will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>The process of reform that is under way will create a public service of which we can be proud, building on Ireland&rsquo;s long tradition of service to the public and the State.  I look forward to engaging with the relevant Oireachtas committees in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply.  In regard to the monitoring of the ongoing programme, will he indicate the extent to which specific targets have been identified as being achievable within a specific timeframe and the degree to which this will be encouraged and supervised by the relevant section of the Department?  Will he also outline the degree to which those specific targets have been estimated to have a direct impact on the economic situation in terms of competitiveness over a specific period?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy makes a valid and important point regarding the key element of reform.  Like draining the River Shannon or restoring the Irish language, reform is often talked about.  However, the key criterion will be the delivery of our objectives in this regard.</P>
        <P>In the lead-up to the formation of the Government, both Fine Gael and the Labour Party undertook careful analyses of the imperative of reform.  Both parties came broadly to the same conclusion, namely, that we must have a Department and a Cabinet-ranked Minister with control of expenditure in order to drive reform.  That is why my Department was created.  Within the Department we have a political reform unit which will deal with issues such as the freedom of information legislation, register of lobbyists and all of the other important political efforts to bring about transparency.  In addition, we have the public service reform unit, which is led by a director who has worked largely in the private sector in bringing about change <Col N="87"/>management there.  We have set out a range of specific targets, described them and described the target date for their delivery.  These measures will ensure our plan is effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The centrepiece of the announcement today is a significant increase in the number of workers who will be taken out of the public service.  Is a serious analysis being done of the value for money of this measure in a context where agency or contract staff are often taking up the slack in the public service, Civil Service and local government?  I have a later question the answer to which I have not yet seen.  Do we know whether it is better for the Exchequer in terms of value for money and delivery of service if things are outsourced, done by agencies or contractors?  I do not believe there are any figures or evidence to back that up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to be able to agree with the Deputy &mdash; I very seldom can in this House.  I disagree with him on his first point.  Downsizing is the pivotal point in the announcement.  We need to downsize to achieve the payroll reductions we need.  I do not believe the Deputy would wish me to start cutting the pay rates of the vast bulk of public servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBoydBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.  The Minister should increase them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A tiny number have very significant pay, but the vast bulk have very ordinary pay.  In order to protect pay rates we need to reduce the numbers and do things differently and more efficiently.  The reform agenda is at the core of this, involving how to do things differently with smaller numbers.  The public service has risen to that challenge, by and large, and is doing things differently by managing the considerable downsizing that has happened since 2008.  Greater challenges will arise in the future.</P>
        <P>I agree entirely with the Deputy on agency staff.  There will be no savings in replacing pensionable full-time civil servants with agency staff.  There might be occasions when that will be necessary when there are pressure points.  By and large, we need to use the architecture ofthe Croke Park agreement to move people to fill the gaps and continue to provide a decent service.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest>  the type of Exchequer funded projects that the European Investment Bank and Council of Europe Bank have indicated they would be willing to fund.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[35190/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>In recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s current difficulties, both the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Bank have indicated their support for Ireland and indicated a willingness to offer loans directly to Ireland in respect of infrastructure projects.  The interest rate on these loans would be lower than those obtainable either in the bond market or from the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF.  The loans could be used to finance the traditional procurement of infrastructure projects or to finance an Exchequer capital contribution to PPPs.  Any moneys obtained would not represent additional funding for infrastructure projects but would simply displace more expensive sources of Exchequer financing.</P>
        <P>I understand the Council of Europe Bank would be willing to lend money for such projects as detention facilities, projects in the education and health sectors, Government buildings and environmental protection projects.  The European Investment Bank has been a significant investor in Ireland&rsquo;s PPP roads programme and has also made substantial investment in the <Col N="88"/>commercial semi-State energy sector.  The EIB has indicated that it would be willing to contemplate further applications for direct loans to the State to fund projects such as public transport, research and development, energy, environmental services and education.  For example, we may be seeking EIB assistance for the Luas Broombridge project, which I announced last week.  We continue to work with EIB on maintaining its engagement with PPPs.</P>
        <P>This morning, officials from my Department met representatives from European Investment Bank.  Deputy McDonald was a little breathless arriving here today.  I ran in from a meeting I had just left with the vice president of the European Investment Bank to discuss investment projects, two of which he signed off today relating to education and energy.  There are others on which I want to engage with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryLouMcDonald"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that answer.  I am glad that engagement is under way.  He is probably aware that we launched our pre-budget submission this week.  Broadband infrastructure is a very obvious absence from the Government&rsquo;s capital expenditure programme.  For the purposes of developing broadband and wind energy infrastructure, and as part of our capacity to provide stimulus for jobs, we encourage the Government to use every lever and explore every opportunity with the European Investment Bank and with any other international institution that can assist.  Earlier the Minister made the point that stimulus would be great but we simply cannot find the cash for it.  This underlines the point that there are partners who will provide money in a flexible manner and at good interest rates, which can facilitate investment in infrastructure such as broadband.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree entirely with the Deputy.  One of the areas I discussed with the vice president of the European Investment Bank, who has the wonderful name of Plutarchos Sakellaris, was that of wind energy and other alternative energy sources.  It has already invested in infrastructure and also wants to invest directly in wind farms, which was one of the matters we discussed this afternoon.</P>
        <P>On broadband infrastructure, I am anxious not to use scarce public moneys or even scarce borrowed moneys to displace commercial investment that is happening anyway.  A very significant capital investment in broadband is happening.  Deputy Wallace will know that Eircom has just made a very significant investment in Wexford, a town we both represent, which now has a very high level of broadband of 150 megabit.  That level of investment is happening across the country in different ways.  Satellite technology is being used.  I do not want to dislodge investment that is coming from the commercial companies in any event.  I have asked my colleague to investigate the significant amount of money put into MANs.  In Wexford very few people are using the MAN after a significant investment.  We need to ensure we do not just invest money for the sake of it and that we get real value for money and it drives jobs and investment.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 30 and 39 together.</P>
        <P>In April 2009, the then Minister for Finance requested the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to undertake a review of top-level public service pay, to take account of the changed budgetary and economic circumstances and developments in the private sector pay environment and by reference to pay rates for similar posts in the eurozone.  This review formed the basis for the reduction of the pay of the Taoiseach by 20% with effect from January 2010 and subsequently a cumulative reduction of 25% with effect from January 2011.</P>
        <P>The current Government considered that the reductions adopted did not go far enough and decided on its first day in office in March to reduce the salary of the Taoiseach further by adopting a cumulative reduction of almost 30% bringing the annual salary of the Taoiseach to &euro;200,000 in accordance with commitments in the party manifestos.  <i>Pro rata</i> reductions for Ministers and other officeholders were also adopted.  These reflect the Government&rsquo;s policy of salary reduction and restraint for higher earners in the public sector.</P>
        <P>More recently, in line with the decision to reduce the salary of the Taoiseach, Ministers and senior officeholders, the Government accepted my proposals to introduce a general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service, a general pay ceiling of &euro;250,000 for future appointments to CEO posts within commercial semi-State companies and a voluntary waiver system of up to 15% for current post holders who have salaries in excess of the relevant pay ceiling.</P><Col N="90"/>
        <P>Following the adoption by the people of the recent referendum on the remuneration of judges, I considered it more appropriate and expedient to provide for the new statutory provisions for the remuneration of judges together with the necessary legislative provisions giving effect to the administrative reductions applied to the Taoiseach and other senior officeholders through a single dedicated enactment rather than providing for the latter in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, the Second Stage of which this House has already passed.   Accordingly, as I indicated previously, it is my intention to delete the remuneration provisions from that Bill on Committee Stage and to incorporate them into a new Bill providing for the remuneration of judges and senior officeholders, which I intend to publish later this week.  This approach will ensure the statutory requirements on remuneration will secure early passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Since 1973, the personal remuneration of the President has been set in the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Act 1973 at the rate paid to the Chief Justice plus 10%.  Consistent with this legislation, the proposed new salary rate for the President of &euro;249,014 per annum equates to the proposed new rate for a future new entrant Chief Justice at &euro;226,376 plus 10%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Deputy Sean Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The latter part of the Minister&rsquo;s reply dealt with my specific question of why we are not proceeding with this matter under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, Second Stage of which has been already passed by this House.  That legislation is already before the Houses and could complete its passage through the Houses quickly.  I accept that the Minister wishes to deal with this issue separately as a result of the referendum and that he will shortly publish the relevant legislation.  Which legislation does the Minister expect will first complete its passage through the Houses?  Which is a priority for the Minister?  </P>
        <P>The single scheme pensions Bill only affects new entrants and will not result in any cost savings for 40 years.  Given that there is currently a moratorium in place this is not the most urgent legislation.  While we support early passage of that legislation the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011 deals with current salary rates.  Perhaps the Minister will set out the expected timescale for passage of the new Bill and will comment briefly on the reason the relevant provision is contained in it and if that was the correct way to go about this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The more appropriate vehicle is financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation which deals with judges in the same manner as every other public servant.  For correctness, I am happier that it be done on that basis rather than as part of unique legislation.  It will be part of general FEMPI legislation.  I am also taking the opportunity to statutorily reduce the pay of the Taoiseach and Ministers, currently being done on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>The Bill was approved by Government on Tuesday.  I hope to publish it tomorrow.  There is nothing controversial in the legislation and with the goodwill of Members opposite we will be able to ensure its passage through both Houses within a matter of days.  It is important that the extra provisions come into effect from 1 January next.  On the pensions Bill, there is a certain urgency about it in that as soon as it is enacted the provisions will apply.  The sooner it comes into force, the sooner it will apply.</P>

        <Quest>  in view of <Col N="91"/>the shortage of Exchequer funds at present the reason that he has not intervened to prevent unnecessary expenditure on the planning stages of projects which are unlikely to be completed during the life of this Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that we have had to significantly scale back and reprioritise public expenditure in order to meet the pressing need to restore our finances to a sustainable path.  As part of this, we undertook a major review of our capital programme.  We have had to focus on what we must do rather than what we would wish to do.  This has involved looking at projects in which we have already made considerable investment and evaluating whether it would be more cost effective to proceed or defer them until a later stage.  We intend that projects deferred will ultimately be delivered when public finances have been restored.</P>
        <P>It is important to ensure that capital programmes and projects are properly managed and rolled out.  This requires that public works are appropriately planned and delivered.  The guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure proposals in the public sector set out the steps that Departments and agencies need to take in planning for their capital projects. Departments must ensure that they undertake proper appraisal and planning and that costs in this regard are appropriately controlled.</P>
        <P>Last week, the Government announced the new capital envelopes for Departments for the period 2012-2016.  Departments are now engaged in reformulating their project delivery schedules and project planning processes in accordance with their new financial allocations.  In this context,  Departments are also carefully considering the range and scope of planning that are appropriate and justifiable to meet our likely infrastructure needs over the five year horizon and beyond.  Obviously, we must think beyond the five year horizon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that certain projects are no longer feasible and that it makes no sense for Government to go ahead with them.  One of those projects is the New Ross bypass which it was estimated would cost &euro;350 million.  It has been pretty obvious for some months that projects like this would not go ahead during the lifetime of this Government.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, made that quite clear.   I do not, therefore, understand the reason the Government allowed further money to be spent on the New Ross bypass, which might never be built.</P>
        <P>I contacted Wexford County Council and New Ross Town Council and was told that money was spent on this project this week, which amazes me.  If the Government had acted quickly enough the purchase of land for a bypass which we cannot afford to build could have been averted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Deputy that because we cannot afford it now it will never be built.  We have often been criticised in the past for not taking a long-term view of things.  By the time the M50 was built, it was too small.  While I am critical of the previous Government it did engage in some strategic thinking.  The motorway system was a good investment.  We need to complete parts of it.  For example, in relation to the M11, it makes no sense to build it 80% of the way and to leave the remaining section to Rosslare-Europort unbuilt.  While we will not be able to afford to do that in the foreseeable future &mdash; as I have told people directly &mdash; the dilemma is do we then allow people to build on the corridor required to complete it resulting in our having to in ten years time commence replanning and re-routing?  These are real dilemmas.  </P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>Similarly, the New Ross bypass is a worthy project but we might have to rethink the scale of it.  The Deputy made valid points during our debate yesterday on the public capital programme.  We need to tease out these issues in detail.  We cannot shut down long-term planning and confine our horizon to the next difficult five years.  This country will recover and will be in a position to invest again.  We should not foreclose on the opportunities to invest in infrastructure be it roads, schools and so on.  Public transport plans such as Metro North are feasible in the longer term.  They are just not affordable now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MickWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mick Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, made the sensible decision of not purchasing the land for the Oilgate project.  However, money was spent in the past few weeks on the purchase of land in New Ross at a time when money is scarce.

	<P Just="Left">My Department carried out an extensive review of the effectiveness of the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) during 2010 and 2011 and I am fully aware that there are serious deficiencies in how the system is being implemented in the Civil Service.  My Department has developed a comprehensive approach to the reform of PMDS and is working closely with Civil Service management and unions to deliver this reform. We are committed under the Croke Park agreement and the reform plan to strengthening performance management.</P>
        <P>Some of the key criticisms that emerged as part of our review of PMDS include:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the process is overly bureaucratic with an emphasis on form filling</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />there is a lack of consistency and fairness of standards for performance and ratings, with many staff getting a rating of 4 or 5 rating (ie perceived as too many high ratings)</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />there is a failure to deal with underperformance</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The review of PMDS established that low numbers of staff are being given a rating of 1 or 2 (1% of staff in 2010), in other words, very few staff have their performance rated as not satisfactory.  These statistics, taken with other feedback from the review, highlight that underperformance is not being managed effectively.  In response, my Department has taken the initiative and is working with HR units to strengthen management capability across the Civil Service.  Earlier this year my Department developed guidelines and training material on the &lsquo;management of underperformance&rsquo;.  Over 100 staff from HR units were trained on the new guidelines and related HR policies such as the disciplinary policy.  Departments are now expected to train their own line managers on the management of underperformance.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>My Department is currently working with management and unions in the Civil Service to secure agreement on a number of changes to PMDS on a phased basis.  As part of Phase 1 of the reform of PMDS, we undertook to:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />streamline PMDS to make it a more useful tool for managing performance</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />make managers accountable for the performance management of their staff</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />automate the PMDS process.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There has been considerable progress on these goals.  Agreement between management and unions was reached last week on a new simplified PMDS form which will streamline the process.  Guidelines on the new form have also been agreed.  My Department is preparing the roll-out of the new PMDS form to HR units for use during the 2012 PMDS cycle.</P>
        <P>Management accountability has also been strengthened.  From 2012 onwards a manager should not get a rating above 2 where they do not manage the performance of their staff effectively over the course of the year.</P>
        <P>The final step in Phase 1 will be the automation of the new PMDS.</P>
        <P>While the initial focus of the reform of PMDS has been on simplifying and streamlining the process, I accept that we need to do more.  Phase 2 changes to PMDS will be focused on looking at how the distribution of ratings across Civil Service Departments can be improved and how fairness and consistency across Departments can be strengthened.  We will be bringing forward proposals on how to address these issues in 2012.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to review the effectiveness of performance management and work with HR units across the Civil Service to strengthen management capability.</P>

        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his views on the fact that, from the outset he has been insisting that facilitating the creation of jobs is one of the Government's top priorities yet the capital spending programme published last week does little to support this claim; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 31 together. </P>
        <P>The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published by the Government on 4 November detailed the budgetary parameters for the next four years including the revised current and capital envelopes. The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement also set out and discussed the economic and fiscal projections for the period ahead that are consistent with those budgetary parameters.  As regards employment, the economy is expected to be creating jobs on a net basis by the end of next year, with the pace of hiring forecast to strengthen in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>In considering the Capital envelope and the Government&rsquo;s detailed Capital Review that I published last week, it is first necessary to realise that most of the economy&rsquo;s key infrastructural deficits have been addressed through a massive capital investment of about &euro;70bn over the last decade. In addition, the Budgetary situation requires spending to be prioritised and the Public Capital Programme to be scaled back.</P><Col N="95"/>
        <P>There will be direct employment benefits in the delivery of the infrastructure proposed in the Medium Term Capital Investment Framework.  However, the most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment.  The focus of the investment outlined in the plan is on creating the framework conditions in which the enterprise sector can thrive.</P>
        <P>The Review made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through funding agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  This funding can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. While the overall capital envelope for 2012 has been reduced, we have actually held the level of capital allocation for the enterprise sector relative to the preceding period.</P>
        <P>The State will be spending some &euro;17 billion over the next five years on activities throughout the country and this will help support employment in many key areas. It is important to note that less expensive re-fit, refurbishment, and up-grade works can be more labour-intensive than larger capital-intensive projects that have been deferred.</P>

        <askee>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to protect key front-line services such as health, garda&iacute; and fire services in order that they will not be decimated through early retirements; if he will prioritise protecting these services; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>In the first instance, it is part of the day to day function of Ministers and Senior Management of all Departments within their budgetary allocation to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements including the identifying of key posts, service levels and the deployment of internal staff resources. This process is informed by a wide range of factors relevant to a Department&rsquo;s operating environment, including assessment of service needs and the impact of population changes.</P>
        <P>Should a Department identify a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment the sanction of my Department must then be sought.  Exceptions to the Moratorium may be granted on the following basis:</P>
        <P LI="1">a) statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;</P>
        <P LI="1">b) where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU/international regulations and impact upon exports etc.;</P>
        <P LI="1">c) safety related posts &mdash; failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;</P>
        <P LI="1">d) specialist/technical posts to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;</P>
        <P LI="1">e) to ensure continuity of frontline services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Redeployment must be the primary mechanism to fill posts which have been approved.  In addition, in the case of the Education and Health Sector, a number of grades are exempted from the Moratorium in order to ensure that these vital services are maintained.</P>

	<P>Paragraph 1.16 of the Public Service, or Croke Park, agreement provides for an annual review of the sustainable savings generated from the implementation of the Agreement and of the agreements in each sector.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will recall, the Implementation Body for the Agreement conducted the first such review last May.  The Body&rsquo;s Report which was published last June reported that sustainable pay bill savings of &euro;289m had been achieved in the first year of the Agreement, March 2010 to March 2011.  It also reported that &ldquo;solid and measurable&rdquo; progress was being made on implementing the Action Plans in each sector, while pointing to certain issues that needed to be accelerated over the next reporting period.</P>
        <P>The next annual review of the Agreement is scheduled to take place in Spring 2012 and I expect that the Report arising from that review will be published in May or June next year.</P>
        <P>As an interim measure between annual reviews, the Implementation Body last month asked for a 6-monthly update from all sectors on the progress made in implementing sectoral Action Plans during the period April to September 2011.  The Body has been considering these reports in recent weeks and is today publishing on its website a summary of the progress reported in each sector.</P>

	<P>This Government has shown its determination to firmly address the serious long-term Exchequer affordability concerns which exist in relation to public service pensions.</P>
        <P>The Government has started the reform process. I have recently announced significant changes to the departure terms for new Secretaries General and other senior appointments made by TLAC.</P>
        <P>I also refer the Deputy to the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, currently before the House which will provide for a new career average single pension scheme for all new entrants to the public service. This is a measure that will significantly reduce costs to the taxpayer while at the same time ensuring that public servants and their dependants continue to have a reasonable income in retirement.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the pay reduction (and not the PSPR) will also reduce public service pensions coming into payment after the ending of the &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; (29 February 2012).</P>

        <P FLI="0">The savings associated with the PSPR are in the order of  &euro;100m in net public service pension expenditure of some &euro;2,700m in 2010. The reduction applies to about 130,000 former public servants and their survivors, including former Presidents, former Oireachtas members and retired members of the Judiciary.  Also these pensioner payments are, of course, subject to income tax as well as the Universal Social Charge.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request that I consider raising the current PSPR rates and bands, I can advise the Deputy that all aspects of Exchequer spending are under review in the context of the forthcoming Comprehensive Review of  Expenditure.  The Government will be deciding spending adjustments in the public interest and in the light of the need to achieve the required budgetary targets.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 27 together.</P>
        <P>The existing licence to operate the National Lottery is due to expire shortly and my Department has been actively examining how best to maximise the return on the extension of the licence for the benefit of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As an interim arrangement, the Government has decided to extend the current licence to mid-2013 in order to allow time for the holding of a competition for the awarding of a new licence. It has been the considered approach for some time that a competitive and transparent process is the best approach underpinning the issuance of a new licence and the precise arrangements for the competition are currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The expiry of the present licence to operate the National Lottery presents an opportunity for the State to review matters and to make sure that the structure of the new licence responds to our present and future needs.  This could be achieved through acquiring a significant upfront fee or payment for the new licence, while retaining a condition for significant annual revenues to continue to be allocated towards good causes.  It is the Government&rsquo;s desire to use the upfront payment to help fund the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>As I set out in my announcement on 10 November on the publication of the Capital Review, and again in this House yesterday in the Statements and debate on that Capital Programme, I will be bringing worked out proposals to Government in the New Year on how best we can approach this matter.</P>
        <P>The staff and management of An Post National Lottery Company do excellent work in managing and promoting the National Lottery.  They have played a key role in ensuring that the Lottery has been such a major success since its foundation in 1986.  The extension of the current licence to mid-2013 means that there are no immediate implications for the Company or its staff as a result of the Government&rsquo;s recent announcement regarding the next Lottery licence.</P>

	<P>The payment of a ministerial pension to former members of the Oireachtas who are employed by an EU institution or the State is in accordance with the rules of the relevant pension scheme.</P>
        <P>A number of reforms have been introduced in relation to Public Service pension entitlements.  The Deputy will be aware that under the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous <Col N="100"/>Provisions) Act 2004 ministerial pensions will not be payable to new Oireachtas members before 65 years of age.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009 ministerial pensions are no longer payable to sitting members of the Oireachtas following the recent elections, or to Members of the European Parliament following the next elections to the Parliament.</P>
        
        <P Just="Left">Public service pensions for former Ministers retiring after February 2012 will be reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts. I intend to publish very shortly the Bill which will set out the legislative basis for the additional reduction which the members of the new Government accepted on taking Office.  For those who retire before the end of February next, the Public Service Pension Reduction will apply.</P>
        <P>The Programme for Government commits the Government to further reforms in this whole area.  The Deputy will know that I have recently announced significant changes to the pension arrangements for future Secretaries General appointed under TLAC terms.  Furthermore, the new single pension scheme for the Public Service will, on its introduction, bring further significant changes to the pension arrangements of new entrants to the Public Service, including members of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 36 together. </P>
        <P>The Government is committed to compliance with the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (The Croke Park Agreement). In an Appendix to the Agreement on service delivery options, it is recognised that some new or existing services will be provided on an outsourced basis. The Appendix provides that, in advance of a decision being taken by management to proceed with outsourcing of an existing service, an evaluation will be undertaken with a view to determining whether the service can continue to be carried out in-house through service changes, having regard among other things to overall cost, quality of service, effectiveness and the public interest. In the event that management decide to proceed with outsourcing, commitments are given in relation to ongoing consultation with staff representatives and to job security and protection of employment terms of existing staff.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s overall objective is to ensure that the cost of delivering public services is reduced further and that the public service becomes leaner, better integrated, more efficient and more effective. I am happy that the terms of the Appendix to the Croke Park Agreement will allow for efficient and effective delivery of public services, either directly or on an outsourced basis, while ensuring the concerns of public servants affected are taken into account.</P>
        <P>This afternoon, I announced details of the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan which provides the basis for delivering comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service.  It includes delivering actions across a range of issues including shared services, procurement, eGovernment and organisational reform.  It also addresses the identification and evaluation of opportunities for external service delivery of non-core processes or services in line with the commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>In relation to major State capital projects, reflecting their scale and complexity, such projects typically require specialist advisory services. It may therefore be necessary for Departments to procure the services of private contractors cognisant of their particular expertise which their public service counterparts may not possess. Such a decision would however be subject to each Department&rsquo;s budgetary constraints, with private contractors engaged on fixed price contracts, following a competitive tendering process, addressing a specified scope of services.</P>
        <P>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s role in relation to capital investment projects is to set the overall capital investment framework and the basic principles to be observed for the appraisal, assessment, procurement and evaluation of projects.  Every Government Department, Office and Agency is responsible for the roll out and delivery of projects in the capital programmes in the most cost effective way and in accordance with the principles and rules set out by my Department.</P>

	<P>There is a process of significant reform of public service pensions.</P>
        <P>I have recently introduced the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, currently before the House.  It will provide for a new single pension scheme for all new entrants to the public service. This is an initiative that will significantly reduce costs to the taxpayer while at the same time ensuring that public servants and their dependants continue to have a reasonable income in retirement.</P>
        <P>The new single scheme will provide for the calculation of pensions on the basis of &ldquo;career average&rdquo; earnings<b> &mdash; </b>   this is a change from the current position where pension is based on &ldquo;final salary&rdquo;. This is considered a fairer and more equitable system and one which is progressive in application, i.e. it affects the pension paid to those who have high earnings especially in late career (e.g. a civil servant promoted to top management later in their career) more than the pension for those who may have a relatively &lsquo;flat&rsquo; career progression (e.g. nurses, teachers).The new scheme will also link pension increases to CPI (and not pay as is currently the case).</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pension-related deduction (PRD) was legislated for in 2009, saving &euro;1 billion a year on the public service pay-bill and, with effect from the start of this year, public service pensions themselves were reduced by 4% on average, by way of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  The PSPR is a progressively structured reduction applied to public service pensions.  It consists of an exemption for the first &euro;12,000 of annual pension along with a set of increasing rates of reduction applied to higher income bands as follows:</P>

	<P>I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  In general, SMEs&rsquo; flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements can be advantageous in competing for local contracts. Current guidelines from my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.</P>
        <P>The guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &euro;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />less use of &ldquo;restrictive&rdquo; tendering procedures and greater use of &ldquo;open&rdquo; tendering;</P>
       <P><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />the needs and possibilities for small businesses to compete and supply to be taken into account when setting up panels/framework arrangements;</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />encouragement of small companies to combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Measures such as these should increase the opportunities for SMEs to compete for public contracts and will reduce the up-front administration burden for them.  The Government continues to review the situation in regard to SME participation in public procurement and where consistent with achieving value-for-money, probity and transparency, will seek to address any further issues that might be identified.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, under the EU/IMF Programme, the Government is committed to considering options for an ambitious programme of asset disposals, based on the Programme for Government and the report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities, and to preparing a draft programme of asset disposals in this context to be discussed with the Troika in advance of taking final decisions on the programme to be pursued.  As a signal of its intent in this regard, <Col N="105"/>the Government has decided that it is prepared to dispose of a minority stake in ESB and has also agreed to consider the potential for further asset sales. Two inter-departmental groups have been established to progress these issues and are due to report back to Government in December 2011 in order that a programme of asset disposals can be finalised for discussion with the Troika by end 2011.</P>

As the Deputy is no doubt aware Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size of the public service pay bill. While the pay and pension payments of nearly 31,000 Local Authority employees are not funded directly from the Exchequer they are nonetheless a major cost factor and must be closely monitored.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is coordinating the collection of information on local authority payroll and superannuation costs on a quarterly basis. This information is provided to my Department. Over the last number of years, enhanced numbers monitoring systems and multi-annual employment frameworks have been put in place. These arrangements will be strengthened to ensure that effect is given to Government decisions on public service numbers and will aid Local Authorities in planning future staffing levels and costs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This afternoon I announced a number of key developments in the Government&rsquo;s programme for public service reform including a detailed action oriented Public Service Reform Plan which sets the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service.  This Government knows that all citizens and all stakeholders expect a modern Public Service to continually improve and deliver services faster, better and more cost effectively.  Innovation, flexibility and the delivery of streamlined services must be at the heart of a reformed Public Service.  Ireland has a long and proud tradition of service to the public and the State, and we must build on that to make it easier for citizens to access services and engage with Government.</P>
        <P>The Plan, which was published today and is available on my Department&rsquo;s website, outlines the priority actions for reform in a broad range of areas such as business process improvement, eGovernment, customer service, shared services, procurement, public expenditure reform, etc. and a number of actions in these and other areas are already underway.   It also focuses on actions to improve performance by organisations and individuals to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</P>
        <P>The Plan sets out how implementation should be driven and monitored including by the establishment of a dedicated Reform and Delivery Office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. We are taking an integrated approach to Public Service Reform which will align a number of key elements including the Programme for Government, the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, delivery of reform to frontline services within individual sectors, co-ordinated delivery of key cross-cutting reforms and the Public Service Agreement.  Consultation with all stakeholders will be an important aspect of our approach to reform.  As outlined in today&rsquo;s Government Statement on Public Service Reform, we will improve communications <Col N="107"/>and engagement with customers, by greater utilisation of the Customer Charter initiative, customer satisfaction surveys and other feedback channels.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also wish to be aware that as part of the call for submissions from the public under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE), a number of submissions that relate to Public Service Reform were received and these have informed our approach to reform.   Additionally a number of submissions were separately received from various reform and change management organisations, some of whom have made tailored presentations to relevant officials.  All relevant contributions are being carefully considered in our ongoing work.</P>

	<P>The occurrence of Ragwort is an issue countrywide. The Phoenix Park at over 1700 acres can never be kept completely free of this plant which is endemic to all parts of Ireland and no comparable area is ragwort free. However, the Phoenix Park has an active programme of treatment in place for a number of years which involves the physical removal of ragwort by hand, the application of an organic herbicide and trials have recently been conducted in the Park with a new product to the market which is showing promising results.</P>

	<P>Section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides for tax relief for expenditure incurred on the repair, maintenance or restoration of approved buildings or gardens.  For a building or garden to be approved it must:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull66" />be a building or garden which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, as determined by the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The most recent year for which the necessary detailed statistical information is available is 2009.

The Finance Act 2010 introduced changes to the scheme such that from the 2010 tax year passive investors would no longer qualify for the relief. At that time it was estimated that this measure would eventually reduce the cost of the scheme to &euro;3 million per annum.</P>

        <P>The funds to be sourced from the EU in the course of the Programme include an estimated &euro;4.8 billion of bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark.  Under the bilateral agreement with the UK, worth a total value of Stg&pound;3.2 billion (&euro;3.8 billion, based on the conversion rates prevailing in November 2010, is the assumed value in the table above), the funds are to be disbursed in eight equal tranches with the first one having occurred in October 2011.

        <P Just="Left">The overall interest rate excluding fees, adjustments and negative carry on loans drawn down to date, is 3.55%. The interest rate on undrawn amounts will depend on the cost of funds to the EFSF and EFSM in the capital markets at the time of drawdown and this cannot be quantified as it depends on future capital market conditions. There is no interest rate margin on either EFSF or EFSM loans at this point. There is a Guarantee Commitment Fee for the EFSF Guarantor Countries of 0.10% per annum. The margin which was prepaid by Ireland on its EFSF loan drawn in February 2011 will be the subject of a rebate in July 2016, when the bond issued to raise funds for the loan is redeemed. Repayments on EFSF and EFSM loans are bullet and are made on the maturity dates shown in Table 1 where the structure of IMF repayments is also explained. In relation to IMF loans, the interest rate on undrawn amounts will depend on the hedged variable Special Drawing Rights interest rate and quota reform timing.</P>
        <P>The NTMA estimates that interest payment savings as a result of interest rate margin reductions on the EFSF and EFSM and UK Bilateral (subject to confirmation)  loans over the course of the 7.5 years originally agreed as the weighted average life of the programme will be over &euro;9 billion. The expected impact of quota change in the IMF may bring this figure to over &euro;10 billion. This amount represents the expected cash savings, which is the appropriate measure in considering the benefit to the future budgetary position.</P>

	<P>It is assumed that the imposition of a cap of &euro;35,000 as mentioned in the question would have the effect of withdrawing the tax exemption from all qualifying income in excess of &euro;35,000.  The full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the tax year 2009, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, is approximately &euro;0.6 million.  However, this figure does not take account of the application of the high earner&rsquo;s restriction to the exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists and thus the actual yield could be significantly lower.  The restriction was originally provided for in Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Finance Act 2010.  Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of &euro;125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of &euro;80,000 or more.  Those subject to the full restriction will pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and levies.</P>
        <P>In addition, it must be stressed that this estimate assumes no significant behavioural change on the part of the affected taxpayers. Moreover, the application of income tax to this income source could also lead to additional claims being made for expenses and allowances by persons currently exempt.</P>

        <Quest> the revenue that would be raised from reducing the annual earnings limit along with age related percentage limits for maximum tax relievable contributions for pension purposes from &euro;115,000 to &euro;100,000 and &euro;80,000 respectively. </Quest>

	<P>The current annual earnings cap of &euro;115,000 acts, in conjunction with age-related percentage limits of annual earnings, to put a ceiling on the annual amount of tax relief an individual taxpayer can obtain on employee or personal pension contributions.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer arising from reducing the earnings cap to &euro;100,000 and &euro;80,000 is currently estimated to be of the order of &euro;30 million and &euro;95 million respectively.  These figures are provisional and subject to revision. </P>
        <P>A breakdown of the figures by reference to income levels is available only in respect of the tax relief for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and to the extent that these contributions are included in the personal tax returns of tax payers.  With regard to occupational pension schemes (schemes set up by employers), the figures in respect of employee contributions are available only in aggregate form.  Information on such contributions is not captured in such a way as to make it possible to associate contributions with individual income levels.  For that reason the estimated yield to the Exchequer in respect of these contributions is extremely tentative.  The estimated yield is based on assuming that tax relief which would be affected by the changes mentioned in the question is currently allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and at the maximum age-<Col N="114"/>related percentage limit of earnings. The figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer yield in respect of those taxpayers.</P>

	<P>The high earner&rsquo;s restriction for individuals on high incomes, who make significant use of certain specified tax reliefs, was announced in Budget 2006 and came into effect from 1 January 2007.   The restriction works by limiting the total amount of specified reliefs that a high income individual can use to reduce his or her tax liability in any one tax year.  Prior to the introduction of this restriction, such individuals, by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, had been able to reduce their tax liability to very low levels or to zero.</P>
        <P>The restriction, as introduced, was designed to ensure that individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;500,000 paid an effective rate of tax of approximately 20% on that income.  That objective was achieved in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  Where adjusted income was between &euro;250,000 and &euro;500,000, a tapering system ensured that there was a graduated introduction of the restriction, with the effective rate of tax increasing towards 20% as adjusted income increased towards &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>In Budget 2010, changes to the restriction from the 2010 tax year were announced.  Those individuals with adjusted income exceeding &euro;400,000 will, as a result, now pay an effective income tax rate of approximately 30% on that income, while individuals will now become subject to the restriction and the associated taper, where adjusted income is &euro;125,000 or greater and where they claim &euro;80,000 or more in specified reliefs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 77 together. </P>
        <P>Section 836 of the Taxes Consolidation Act provides for a tax deduction under section 114 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in respect of the cost of maintaining a second residence where, arising out of the performance of his or her duties, a Minister or a Minister of State is obliged to maintain that second residence in addition to his or her main residence</P>
        <P>The allowance can be claimed for the annual mortgage/home loan interest actually paid on any loan taken out to purchase the second residence.  In addition, Ministers are entitled to an allowance for the actual vouched costs expended in maintaining the second residence.  The allowance is confined to office holders who represent constituencies outside the Dublin area and is known as the dual abode allowance.</P>
        <P>The residence in respect of which the dual abode allowance can be claimed is the office holder&rsquo;s second residence.  The dual abode allowance cannot be claimed in respect of the office holder&rsquo;s main residence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the cost to the Exchequer of the dual abode allowance for the tax years 2008 and 2009 is &euro;74,770 and &euro;74,996 respectively.   The figures for 2010 are not yet available as Returns of Income for 2010 are in the process of being submitted and processed.</P>
        <P>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a breakdown between rent received from residential property and other types of property is not sought or provided in tax returns.  However based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the year 2009, the latest year for which this information is available, and making certain assumptions about the data it is estimated that the revenue that would be raised from reducing the level at which individuals can claim interest repayments against tax for residential rental properties from 75% to 60% could be in the region of &euro;75m.  Rental income of companies is returned as net of interest on borrowings the figures for interest are not separately distinguished in corporate tax returns.  There is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the cost of reducing the tax relief involved could be provided.</P>
        <P>The estimated cost of 2009 residential interest relief is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers. This figure is subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11.  This return is the source of the figure provided in this reply in respect of individuals.</P>
        <P>The level at which interest repayments can be claimed against tax for residential rental properties was reduced from 100% to 75% in section 5 of the Finance Act 2009.</P>
        <P>There is no specific proposal in the Programme for Government to decrease the amount of interest on borrowings that can be offset against rental income for tax purposes, however, as a matter of course all such taxation measures and reliefs are considered in the context of the budgetary process.</P>

        <Quest> the revenue that would be raised from reducing the CAT category A threshold to &euro;300,000 and &euro;30,000 for all other categories; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The current group tax free threshold amounts for Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) are: &euro;332,084 for group A (gifts/inheritances from parents to children), &euro;33,208 for group B (gifts/inheritances from grandparents to grandchildren, from uncles/aunts to nieces/nephews, and between siblings) and &euro;16,604 for group C (all other gifts/inheritances).  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the additional yield from reducing the thresholds for CAT to &euro;300,000 for Group A and &euro;30,000 for Group B, as compared with the current thresholds, is estimated to be of the order of &euro;13 million.</P>
        <P>The proposed group C threshold of &euro;30,000 is higher than the current threshold.  Implementing the proposed threshold would give rise to an Exchequer cost, not a yield, estimated to be of the order of &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>The net effect of changing the thresholds as outlined in the question is therefore estimated to be an additional yield of &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>All estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2010. Revenue do not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net.  The estimates are also based on the rate of CAT remaining at 25%.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact of the suggested changes, which could lead to a less than expected result from a change to the tax base. In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets which are currently occurring in the economy.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest> the revenue that would be raised from increasing the rate of imputed withdrawals from approved retirement funds greater than &euro;3 million to 7.5%; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35330/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to an increase in the percentage deemed distribution rate of  5% that currently applies to approved retirement funds (ARFs) to 7.5% where the value of the assets in the ARFs exceed &euro;3 million.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise.  There is therefore no basis on which a definitive estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. </P>
        <P>As an exercise that might provide some indication of the scale of the additional tax yield involved, data made available to my Department from private sector sources provides a breakdown of ARFs by value in respect of a number of providers representing an estimated 40% of the ARF market.</P>
        <P>Out of a total value of some &euro;2.4 billion in ARFs under management by these providers where the average ARF value was just over &euro;127,000, the total value of those ARFs representing individual funds of over &euro;3m was &euro;66 million.  Based on a very rough extrapolation of this figure to arrive at a broad potential estimate for the total value of ARFs with assets in excess of &euro;3 million, generally, the estimated additional tax yield from applying an increased imputed distribution of 7.5% to such ARFs would be less than &euro;2 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the deemed or imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of <Col N="118"/>income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative.  The measure, in itself, does not give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs, which are taxed in the normal way.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as information on the value of the gain arising from the disposal of a site to a child is not required in Capital Gains Tax returns, there is no dedicated basis for separately identifying the yield that would arise from a rate of 75% of the tax that would be charged if there were no relief on such disposals.  However, on the basis of indicative information on the relevant tax returns, it is unlikely that the yield from the Capital Gains Tax element of the question would exceed &euro;1 million in a full year.  The Stamp Duty relief on the transfer of a site to a child was abolished in Budget 2011 with effect from 8 December 2010.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Noonan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the recent Jobs Initiative, I announced the abolition of the charge to employer PRSI on all share based remuneration that was introduced in Budget 2011. The employee PRSI charge and the universal social charge will continue to apply.  At Budget time, it was estimated that the charge to employer PRSI would yield approximately &euro;9.5 million in 2011 and &euro;17.7 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>As the charge was never intended to apply to share based remuneration that was subject to written agreement entered into before 1 January 2011, the 2011 figure was significantly over-estimated. Due to the nature of written agreements for share based remuneration, the full year yield from the imposition of the PRSI charges would not accrue until 2015 at the earliest.  The estimated yield from the abolition of the employer PRSI exemption on share based remuneration would be approximately &euro;2 million in the first year and would rise to approximately &euro;17.7 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>In addition, it must be stressed that these estimates assume no significant behavioural changes on the part of the remuneration practices of employers. Indeed, the removal of the exemption would impose additional costs on employers and could potentially deter companies from making investments and locating jobs in Ireland.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2011, a charge to PRSI and the universal social charge (USC) on share based remuneration was announced.  In the recent Jobs Initiative, I announced the abolition of the charge to employer PRSI. The employee PRSI charge and the USC will continue to apply.</P>
        <P>At Budget time, it was estimated that the charge to employer and employee PRSI on save-as-you-earn schemes would yield approximately &euro;0.3 million in a full year. Based on this figure, ending the exemption from employer PRSI would yield approximately &euro;220,000 in a full year.</P>

	<P>In general, students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance for a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  Subject to the conditions of the student grant scheme, grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level. The objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one qualification at each level of study.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to change the current arrangements.  Any such proposal would have to be considered in light of existing resources and other competing demands in the education sector.  However, the students to which the Deputy refers may be eligible for tax relief for their tuition fees.  Details in relation to this are available on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, all schools are required to have in place a Code of Behaviour and this code must be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines of the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The NEWB guidelines were issued to schools in 2008 and make it clear that each school must have policies to prevent or address bullying and harassment and schools must make clear in their code of behaviour that bullying is unacceptable. The guidelines further state that as well as making explicit that bullying is prohibited in the school, and having an anti-bullying policy, the code of behaviour should indicate what action the school will take in relation to alleged breaches of the school&rsquo;s bullying policy.</P>
        <P>Every school therefore must have in place a policy, within the framework of the school&rsquo;s overall school code of behaviour, which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and prop<Col N="124"/>erly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</P>
        <P>My Department has issued Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</P>
        <P>As a further aid to post-primary schools my Department published in 2007 a template that can be used by post-primary schools in developing an anti-bullying policy. The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it also takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying. The Deputy will also be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. Other measures in place include the Webwise Internet Safety Initiative, the EU Safer Internet Programme campaign and the establishment of the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) which is currently working with over 80 post-primary schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</P>
        <P>Individual schools have autonomy to determine whether they wish to supplement or support the school&rsquo;s work in the area of anti-bullying with other external resources/materials as appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The procedure for Members of the Oireachtas to waive all or part of their salary entitlements is facilitated under Section 483 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 which provides for a gift of the amount concerned to be made to the Minister for Finance for use for any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided. There are currently 36 members of the Oireachtas who are availing of the waiver facility. This number includes those members affected by the Government Decision on taking office in March 2011 to reduce the salaries of An Taoiseach, Ministers and other senior Office holders. These reductions have been applied on an administrative basis pending passage of the necessary legislation giving statutory effect to the reductions.  This legislation will be published shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 104, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The existing licence to operate the National Lottery is due to expire shortly and my Department has been actively examining how best to maximise the return on the next licence for the benefit of the people.  As an interim arrangement, the Government has decided to extend the current licence to mid-2013 in order to allow time for the holding of a competition for the award of a new licence. It has been the considered approach for some time that a competitive and transparent process is the best approach underpinning the issuance of a new licence and the precise arrangements for the competition are currently under consideration.</P>
        <P>The expiry of the present licence to operate the National Lottery presents an opportunity for the State to review matters and to make sure that the structure of the new licence responds to our present and future needs.  This could be achieved through acquiring a significant upfront fee or payment for the new licence, while retaining a condition for significant annual revenues to continue to be allocated towards good causes.  It is the Government&rsquo;s desire to use the upfront payment to help fund the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P>As I set out in my announcement on 10 November on the publication of the Capital Review, and again in this House yesterday in the Statements and debate on that Capital Programme, I will be bringing worked out proposals to Government in the New Year on how best we can approach this matter.</P><Col N="127"/>
        <P>At present, it is too early in the process to comment in detail on the structure of a new licence arrangement, the legislation needed, the expected future financial performance of the Lottery or the range of games that a future licence holder might offer.</P>

        <Quest> the policy measures he intends to put in place in tandem with the Department of Finance to tackle the competing budget components of significant expenditure cuts and the continuing decline in tax revenues arising from the current and previous Government&rsquo;s austerity programmes. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35358/11]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><TitleTxt>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Firstly, I would point out to the Deputy that tax revenues in the period to end-October are significantly ahead of the corresponding period last year by approximately &euro;2 billion or an increase of 8%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards the composition of consolidation, the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published on 4 November set out the aggregate fiscal consolidation path on which the Government has decided, including the tax/spend mix over the period 2012 to 2015. Our approach balances the need to narrow the deficit with the need to support the emerging economic recovery. It is vital that the State continues to show the seriousness of its intent to tackle the deficit in the public finances. The adjustment required to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP over the four-year period to 2015 cannot be achieved by exclusive reliance on either tax increases or expenditure cuts. I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Finance and indeed the whole of Government on these matters. We are guided by the lessons from our past as well as the experience of other countries. The specific measures to bring about the required adjustments are being considered by the Government and our decisions will be set out in detail in the first week of December.</P>

	<P>The Local Loans Fund, of which the Small Dwelling Act forms part, raised its finance from general Exchequer borrowings in 1984 and was not sourced on the open markets. </P>
        <P>Any reduction in the interest rate on repayments from Local Authorities to the Local Loans Fund would bear a cost to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>The National Procurement Service (NPS), under its responsibility for e-Procurement, has been tasked with supporting procurement-related savings across the public service.  An area with potential for achieving savings for buyers and suppliers in the whole procure-to-pay process is the widespread adoption of electronic invoicing for public sector bodies and for business to business transactions in Ireland.</P>
        <P>At the request of the European Commission a <i>National Multi-Stakeholder Forum on eInvoicing</i>   was established by the NPS on 30 May 2011.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>The aim of the European Commission is to have all member states using e-invoicing by 2020.  Following the initiation and evaluation of pilot projects, Ireland may be in a position to have e-invoicing rolled out towards the end of 2013.</P>
        <P>In terms of savings achievable through the widespread adoption of e-Invoicing, research at a European level has shown that:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Currently, the lack of basic interoperability between trading partners in the supply chain is costing up to &euro;60 per trade between them i.e. &euro;60 per invoice (Source: School of Management, Politecnico di Milano).</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />On the invoicing process alone this equates to &euro;40 billion loss per annum in the EU.</P>
        <P FLI="0">There is no centrally held information in regard to the administrative cost of processing invoices in each department and there is no accurate assessment of the potential savings associated with the introduction of e-invoicing. However, on the basis of European studies, Ireland as a whole could save between &euro;240-400 million over a 6-year period following the roll out of e-invoicing. There is a European initiative in relation to e-invoicing which aims to have all member states using it in the public and private sectors by 2020. In that context, and at the request of the European Commission, a <i>National Multi-Stakeholder Forum on invoicing</i>   was established by the National Procurement Service on 30 May 2011.</P>
        <P>In examining the potential for the implementation of electronic invoicing, the NPS has met with a number of public sector bodies which are considering implementing this technology, or which have already commenced pilot projects.  The NPS has also met with a number of service providers in the marketplace and looked at the implementation in other EU Member states (Denmark) and has been in contact with the European Commission in relation to the current projects under way in this area.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for line Departments to manage their expenditure within their allocations and in line with the sanction arrangements issued by my Department.</P>
        <P>The end-October Exchequer returns show that capital expenditure by line Departments is running at about 12% behind profile overall so far this year.  However, a variance of between 10 and 12% at this stage is not unusual.  Based on information supplied by Departments, there may be some small underspends in a number of areas but I expect most areas to be on profile at year end.</P>

	<P>The National Lottery was established in 1986 and its legislative basis is the National Lottery Act of that year. <Col N="146"/> An Post was awarded the first ten year licence to operate the National Lottery in 1986 and it established a subsidiary company, An Post National Lottery Company, for this purpose.  The first licence was originally due to expire in 1996 but in 1993 the then Minister for Finance issued a new licence which ran from 1994 until 2000 and was subsequently extended to the end of 2001.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance held a competition for a new licence between 1999 and 2001.  This competition consisted of two stages.  The first stage commenced with the publication of a notice in the national press in July 1999 seeking expressions of interest from interested parties. Three applications were received and all three applicants were subsequently deemed suitable to participate in the second and substantive stage of the competition.  Two of these applicants subsequently withdrew leaving the existing licence holder, An Post National Lottery Company, as the sole remaining applicant.  The licence was awarded to An Post National Lottery Company in June 2001 with the final licence being signed on behalf of the Minister for Finance in December 2001.  This new licence commenced on 1 January 2002 and was due to expire at the end of 2008.  It was subsequently extended until the end 2011.</P>
        <P>The Government recently announced that the licence is to be extended by a further eighteen months, until the end of June 2013, to allow for the holding of a competition for a new licence.  The precise arrangements for this competition are currently under consideration and I expect to be in a position to bring a proposal to Government early in 2012.</P>
        <P>The current licence was drawn up pursuant to the provisions of the National Lottery Act 1986.  It is operated by An Post National Lottery Company on a cost recovery basis and in return for an annual management fee which is paid to An Post.  The management fee may not exceed &euro;2.993 million.  The licence provides a regulatory framework for the holding of the Lottery by the Company and covers areas such as advertisement, security, equipment and systems, and payments by the Company to the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115, 119 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>As indicated to the Deputy in a similar PQ on 11 October, the Public Service Reform agenda has been pursued both centrally and by individual public bodies for many years, and there have been many notable achievements in this regard.   However, it is clear that significant Public Service reforms are required to meet the challenges we face and the Programme for Government sets out a range of commitments in this regard.  I do not wish to single out any Department as having shown the greatest potential for reform as all Ministers and Departments clearly have a key role to play.  It is clear that we need a particular focus on the large sectors such as Health, Education, Local Government and Justice.</P>
        <P>It would be very time consuming to break down the progress made on a year by year basis, but certain key developments stand out.</P>
        <P>Under the Strategic Management Initiative of the mid 1990s, a series of changes were introduced in areas such as Human Resource Management and the Performance Management and Development System, Quality Customer Service and the creation of Customer Service Charters, better financial management, regulatory reform (particularly the introduction of Regularly Impact Analysis), Strategy Statements and Output Statements, and initiatives to improve openness and transparency.</P>
        <P>More recently, the OECD Review of the Irish Public Service, commenced in 2006 and published in 2008, benchmarked the Public Service in Ireland against other comparable countries, and made recommendations as to the future direction of public service reform. On foot of the OECD Review, the Transforming Public Services programme was launched in November 2008 and set out an agenda for transformation across the Public Service.</P>
        <P>During 2010, the Public Service Agreement was concluded with the public service unions and includes a significant number of commitments to Public Service reform.  The first review by the Implementation Body set up under the Agreement has since concluded that solid and measurable progress is being made in its implementation and a summary of progress for the most recent reporting period, April to September 2011, was published by the Body earlier today, which again outlines welcome progress.</P>
        <P>We have now entered a new phase of Public Service reform.  We are committed to a major fiscal consolidation to reduce our deficit to a level of 8.6% of GDP in 2012 and to below 3% of GDP by 2015.  Future economic growth will only come from a solid and sustainable fiscal position and far reaching Public Service Reform is central to this.  It is in this context that, this afternoon, I announced a number of key developments in the Government&rsquo;s Public Service reform programme including a detailed action oriented Public Service Reform Plan which provides the basis for delivering comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service, and which addresses many of the commitments in the Programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Plan is available on my Department&rsquo;s website and has been circulated to all Deputies, and outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform in a broad range of areas such as public service numbers, business process improvement, eGovernment and customer service, shared services, procurement, public expenditure reform, etc. and a number of actions in these and other areas are already underway.   It also focuses on actions to improve performance by organisations and individuals to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy as we work our way through our current difficulties.  I look forward to working with all stakeholders, <Col N="149"/>including Oireachtas Committees, as we undertake the most ambitious and important programme of Public Service reform since the foundation of the State. </P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for Government made a commitment to conduct a comprehensive review of expenditure (CRE) to examine all areas of public spending and to assess effectiveness of spending programmes and value for money.</P>
        <P>The results of the Review process, including a comprehensive set of decision options and an assessment of the cost effectiveness of all expenditure programmes, are now being considered by Government in the context of framing decisions on the Budget and Estimates for 2012 and subsequent years.  The high-level outcomes of the CRE along with the multi-annual expenditure ceilings for each Department for 2012-2015 and the Budget Estimates for 2012 will be announced in the first week of December.</P>
        <P>In addition, as one element of the Public Service Reform Plan that I am announcing today, my Department is currently undertaking a major review and strengthening of the Value-for-Money (VFM) framework so that it is more effective in facilitating Departments in allocating scarce resources across competing priorities, and eliminating waste and inefficiency.  I will be announcing further details of this initiative in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Overall, the CRE process coupled with the VFM reforms outlined will be instrumental in ensuring, insofar as possible, that the Government gets value for money in all public expenditure.</P>

	<P>As outlined today in the announcement of the Public Sector Reform Programme, the Government is committed to delivering better value in the public sector in order to reduce the deficit and protect front-line services.</P>
        <P>Numbers reduction will be a driver for public service wide reform. This includes reforms to the manner in which front-line and back office services are delivered across the public service. Staffing resources will be refocused on delivering priority services and programmes as set out in the Programme for Government and non-priority programmes and services will be rationalised, outsourced or indeed eliminated.  There is scope for re-deploying resources which managers must seek to use.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of years, enhanced numbers monitoring systems and multi-annual employment frameworks have been put in place. These arrangements will be strengthened to ensure that effect is given to Government decisions on public service numbers and will aid <Col N="151"/>public bodies in adjusting to future staffing levels without sacrificing services. It is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within necessarily reduced resources.</P>
        <P>In order to protect crucial services exceptions to the Moratorium may be granted for cases in the following limited circumstances:</P>
        <P LI="1">a) statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;</P>
        <P LI="1">b) where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU/international regulations and impact upon exports etc.;</P>
        <P LI="1">c) safety related posts &mdash; failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;</P>
        <P LI="1">d) specialist/technical posts to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;</P>
        <P LI="1">e) to ensure continuity of front-line services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In addition, in the case of the Health Sector a number of grades are exempted from the Moratorium in order to ensure that these vital services are maintained.</P>

	<P>The Medium Term Fiscal Statement, published on 4 November, reiterated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to reducing the deficit to below 3 per cent of GDP by 2015 and set out the year-by-year path that we are following to achieve this. It is vital that the State continues to show the seriousness of its intent to tackle the deficit in the public finances. Moving towards a balanced budgetary position is a key condition for restoring confidence, returning the economy to a path of sustained growth and supporting job creation. Through continuing to deliver upon our targets we can limit the risks of contagion, continue to rebuild confidence in this economy and return to a path of solid growth.  This will result in Ireland regaining access to market funding at reasonable rates.</P>

	<P>Given the magnitude of the adjustment required to meet our obligations of reducing the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015, we have had to significantly scale back and reprioritise public expenditure in order to meet the terms of the Programme of Financial Support.  A full and thorough evaluation of both Capital and Current expenditure has been carried out along with the development of the Public Service Reform programme. The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement published on 4 November set out the year-by-year targets to which the Government is now committed for taxation and for expenditure, both Current and Capital.  We are satisfied that these targets represent the best balance for the Irish economy and society.  The precise measures by which we will deliver on these targets for 2012 will be set out with the publication of the Budget and Estimates in the first week of December.</P>

	<P>The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) monitors business cost and competitiveness issues facing the Irish economy and offers recommendations on policy actions required to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s position in these areas.  The NCC&rsquo;s 2011 report on the &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland&rdquo;, which was published last June, notes that between February 2002 and April 2008, Ireland experienced a 31% loss in cost competitiveness based on Harmonised Competitiveness Indicators.  Since 2008, Ireland has regained some of its lost competitiveness. However, deeper structural improvements are necessary to ensure that costs do not rise again as the economy recovers.</P>
        <P>Improving our cost competitiveness is a key to creating the right environment to support job creation.  The Costs of Doing Business report analyses Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness across five key business inputs: Labour costs, Property costs, Utility costs, Business and Professional Services costs and Indirect business costs such as consumer prices.  The 2011 report made a number of recommendations in relation to each of these areas.  I have brought these recommendations to the attention of my Ministerial colleagues in Government and I will continue to work with them to identify further actions that can be taken to improve our competitiveness, reduce costs to business and remove obstacles to employment creation.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council also publishes, each year, &ldquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Competitiveness Challenge&rdquo;, which outlines the main challenges to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the policy responses required to meet them.   The 2011 report will be submitted to the Government in the coming weeks for consideration.  I have asked the NCC to ensure that the report focuses on specific actionable proposals that will drive Ireland&rsquo;s continued economic recovery.</P>

Once a suitable scheme design has been finalised and approved by the Government, there will then be a further Request for Tender published at the end of November to select an operator to allow for the roll out of the scheme over the coming months.</P>
        <P>In parallel with the work taking place on the design of the Scheme, the Department is preparing primary legislation to make the necessary statutory provision for such a scheme.</P>
        <P>The Scheme will provide a level of guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs.</P>
        <P>This Scheme will be closely targeted at commercially viable, well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services which can demonstrate repayment capacity for the additional credit facilities but which cannot secure credit facilities due to the following two market failures:</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities or,</P>
        <P><Miles com="bull66" />Growth / expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Government&rsquo;s commitment will be for an initial period of one year.  Specific performance criteria will be set down that allow for review and revision of the scheme at the end of that initial period before any commitment to a roll-over of the scheme for subsequent years. The temporary partial credit guarantee scheme will complement the Government plans on the restructuring and recapitalisation of the banking system which seek to secure an adequate flow of credit into the economy to support economic recovery.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 130 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>The Labour Court recommended in July 2008 that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by F&Aacute;S.  Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from F&Aacute;S, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of &euro;3m with retrospective costs of the order of at least &euro;30m.   The Deputy should also note that F&Aacute;S is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was F&Aacute;S a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.</P>

	<P>Defined benefit (DB) pension schemes are a very important element of pension provision in Ireland and we want them to survive for the future.   While pension schemes are voluntary and a matter for negotiation between employers and employees, a strong regulatory structure is also needed to protect members.   It <Col N="155"/>is in that context that I recently announced changes to the funding standard as part of a package of measures including sovereign annuities. </P>
        <P>The existing Funding Standard (amended to give credit for the purchase of sovereign annuities or bonds) will be restored for a three year period.   The Funding Standard will be reformed and member&rsquo; security strengthened by requiring DB pension schemes to hold a risk reserve as a protection against future volatility in the financial markets.   Ultimately, schemes will need to be able to meet the requirements of the new Funding Standard in 11 years (by approximately 2022).  There will also be changes to the way in which pension scheme accrued benefits are re-valued and the priority given to pensions in a wind-up situation.</P>
        <P>The Pensions Board expect to publish updated guidance by the end of the year.  The updated guidelines will take account of the changes I announced and will inform trustees of schemes which are not in compliance with the Funding Standard of the dates by which recovery plans must be submitted to the Pensions Board.   As the first such date will be no earlier than 1 July 2012, I am satisfied that trustees will have substantial time to prepare their proposals.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, recovery plans submitted to The Pensions Board by 12 noon Friday 16 December 2011 will continue to be considered by the Board under the current funding standard and guidance.</P>

	<P>Payment of illness benefit to the person concerned was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an examination by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  An appeal was registered on 20 October 2011 and the Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that, in accordance with statutory requirements, the Department was asked for the documentation in the case and the Deciding Officer&rsquo;s comments on the grounds of the appeal.  In that context, an examination by another Medical Assessor will be carried out.  The person concerned will be notified when arrangements for the examination have been completed.

        <P>Shared Ownership is a scheme which was aimed at people who could not afford to purchase their home at the initial stage. The applicant acquires a minimum share of 40% of the cost of the house and pays rent to the local authority for the remainder called the Council&rsquo;s Equity.   Ownership of the property is shared by the local authority and the applicant. The applicant pays a mortgage on their share of the property and also pays rent to the local authority for the other part. In general the granting of a shared ownership lease requires the applicant not to assign, sub-let or otherwise part with or share possession of the property or any part thereof without the prior consent in writing of the local authority.</P>
        <P>I understand from the question that the shared owner in this case wishes to rent out the house to a rent supplement supported tenant and pass this money onto the local authority in the form of the shared owner&rsquo;s rental payment under the terms of the shared ownership scheme. This would not be an appropriate use of public monies given that one of the conditions of the rent supplement scheme is that it is not payable to a housing authority which is what is effectively being proposed in this case.</P>

	<P>The figures you request in respect of carer&rsquo;s allowance are as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">In 2010, 16,629 new carer&rsquo;s allowance claims were processed and 6,972 (or just under42%) were refused in the year. 10,497 new claims were processed to the end of September 2011, of which 3,921 (or just over 37%) were refused. These figures relate to the initial decision made on each application.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that 2,969 carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals were received in 2010 and that 1,838 carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals were received between 1 January 2011 and 31 October 2011.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">During 2010 a total 2,154 appeals were concluded, of which 1,215 (56%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.  The relevant figures for 2011 (to end October) are 2,602 appeals concluded, of which 1,288 (49.5%) had a successful outcome.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">While roughly 52.5% of the combined totals (2,503) had a successful outcome for appellants, over half of these decisions (1,283) were in fact revised decisions made by deciding officers in carer&rsquo;s allowance section, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose primarily as a result of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the initial decision on his/her claim.  In such cases an appeals officer&rsquo;s decision was not necessary.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Of the 1,459 carer&rsquo;s appeals determined by appeals officers in 2010, 520 were allowed or partially allowed (35.64%).  In 2011, the relevant number allowed by appeals officers was 700 (just under 35%).</P>

        <P LI="1" el="0">These figures relate to the initial decision made on each application.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that 180 carer&rsquo;s benefit appeals were received in 2010 and 140 carer&rsquo;s benefit appeals have been received in 2011 (to 31 October 2011).</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">During 2010 a total 178 appeals were determined of which 98 (55%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.  The relevant figures for 2011 are 146 appeals determined, of which 100 (68.49%) had a successful outcome.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">While roughly 61% of the combined totals (324) had a successful outcome for appellants, 131 of these decisions (40.43%) were in fact revised decisions made by deciding officers in the carer&rsquo;s benefit section of the Department, who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his/her claim.  In such cases an appeals officers&rsquo;s decision was not necessary.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Of the 109 carer&rsquo;s benefit appeals determined by appeals officers in 2010, 29 were allowed or partially allowed (26.61%), while in 2011 the relevant number allowed or partially allowed by appeals officers was 38 (45.24%).</P>

	<P>Telecommunications services in Ireland including broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  ComReg&rsquo;s website <i>www.callcosts.ie</i> provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Cork </P>
        <P>In line with State Aid rules, the Government can only intervene in cases where the market has failed to deliver and the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is an example of such an intervention.  The roll out of the NBS network was completed in October 2010 and broadband services are now available to persons with a fixed residence or fixed business in each of the 1,028 designated electoral divisions (EDs) of the NBS Coverage Area, including the 96 EDs <Col N="163"/>covered in County Cork.  Bandon town, County Cork, could not be covered by the NBS, as it was deemed to already have a basic broadband service.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s other intervention, namely the Rural Broadband Scheme, which will be rolled out next year, is aimed at making broadband services available to individual unserved premises in rural non-NBS areas.  This could include individual premises in the Bandon region.</P>
        <P>The advances in the provision of private sector broadband alongside the completion of the roll-out phase of the NBS and the individual connections likely to feature in the Rural Broadband Scheme, means that Ireland will reach the EU Commission&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Agenda for Europe&rdquo; target of having basic broadband available to everybody in advance of the 2013 deadline.</P>
        <P>The Government accepts that the widespread availability of high speed broadband is a key requirement in delivering future economic and social development.  With basic broadband services now available across Ireland, the challenge now is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.</P>
        <P>Under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.</P>
        <P>In June of this year I established the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce, which I chair and which also comprises the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and the CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  The purpose of the Taskforce is to discuss the optimal policy environment required to facilitate the investment in and provision of high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce, and four Working Groups reporting to it, are considering issues such as appropriate targets in terms of speed and service, potential barriers to investment, spectrum policy issues and possible demand stimulation measures aimed at increasing overall Internet usage.</P>
        <P>The Taskforce is scheduled to complete its work next month and I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals to Government in early 2012 aimed at ensuring the timely investment in next generation high speed broadband across Ireland.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if he or legislation prevents local authorities from reducing the interest rate of 12.5% charged on loans drawn down under the Small Dwellings Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Phil Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The applicable interest rate paid by local authority borrowers on fixed rates is set by reference to prevailing fixed interest rates at the time of loan draw down. While there is no legislative provision that prevents local authorities from reducing these rates, the rates were contractually fixed at the time of drawdown and they remain so. Charging a new rate would not be possible without a new mortgage agreement. However, this would affect only the borrowers&rsquo; cost of funds. The local authority&rsquo;s cost of funds would remain at the higher rate as fixed in the 1980s. This would impose significant ongoing costs on local authorities when resources are already under considerable pressure and when the borrowers in question are already permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties (of up to <Col N="164"/>six months interest or more), applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages.</P>
        <P>The loans in respect of which interest rates in excess of 10% apply were issued by local authorities prior to 1991 and reflect the long-term costs of the funds to the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) and the Local Loans Fund prevailing at the time these loans were advanced. Rates were fixed for the life of the loan (generally 25-30 years). The introduction of variable interest rates for local authority mortgages provided borrowers with increased flexibility and choice.</P>
        <P>The standing policy position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans, following review in consultation with the Department of Finance, has been that a State subsidy to reduce such interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together. </P>
        <P>The EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland commits the Government to the introduction of a property tax for 2012. The Programme reflects the need, in the context of the State&rsquo;s overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.</P>
        <P>In light of the complex issues involved, a property tax, requiring a comprehensive property valuation system, would take time to introduce and accordingly, to meet the requirements in the EU/IMF Programme, the Government has decided to introduce a household charge in 2012. The household charge is an interim measure and proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that there are some 1.6 million residential properties potentially liable to the household charge.  As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise &euro;160 million annually.</P>
        <P>From information provided by the Department of Social Protection, there were 372,827 persons in receipt of the job seekers allowance and the job seekers benefit at 30 October 2011.  There are no data available on the number of such persons who are homeowners and it is therefore not possible to provide the figure requested.</P>
        <P>The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the details of the range of exemptions and waivers which will apply. The legislation will be published and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.</P>

	<P>The Programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, whereby service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service. This system is known as franchise bidding.</P>
        <P>A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011. A large number of responses were received, including many from the waste collection industry which raise points similar to those mentioned in the correspondence referred to, such as the potentially adverse impact of franchise bidding on waste collection firms and the benefits of ongoing competition in the current system of side-by-side competition. Other responses point to the possible significant savings for householders and the potential for improved environmental outcomes if franchise bidding were to be introduced. I intend to publish all of the responses received on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</P>
        <P>The responses are currently being examined and I intend to conclude examination of the issue before the end of the year. All policy proposals will be carefully considered by Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the current campaign regarding timed-out students, that is, overseas students whose seven year student visa has run out; his plans to introduce a special immigration stamp rather than the current provision of a six month extension stamp; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Equality</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The &lsquo;New Immigration Regime for Full Time Non-EEA Students&rsquo; was published in September 2010 and has been in operation since 1 January 2011.  The New Regime introduced maximum periods for residence in the State on a student permission and provided for a differentiated approach between &ldquo;Degree Programme&rdquo; courses and those at the &ldquo;Language or Non-Degree Programme&rdquo; level.  In facilitating the transition to the New Regime, I understand that more than 3200 queries, from students, colleges and other stakeholders have been answered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service since the beginning of this year.</P>
        <P>Existing students who exceed the new seven year time limit are regarded as &ldquo;timed-out&rdquo; students.  However, to ensure a smooth transition to the New Regime, special transitional arrangements were made available to those students already in the State.  For example, all students were permitted to complete any course they had commenced prior to the introduction of the new rules.  Students who finish an honours degree course (or higher) are permitted to remain in Ireland for a further year during which they can work, engage in internship or, if they wish to stay for a longer period, seek an employment permit.</P>
        <P>As a special concession, &ldquo;timed out students&rdquo; were entitled to a six month extension of their immigration permission to allow those students to address their immigration status in the State.  During the six month concession period, &ldquo;timed out students&rdquo; can work full time and can apply for an employment permit or green card without having to return to their country of origin.   The availability of this six month concession expired on 30 September 2011.  However, a further 3 month extension is available to relevant students, whose permission expires between 1 October and 31 December 2011 in order to permit them to finalise their status in the State.</P>
        <P>While I am keeping the situation under review, I am satisfied that significant measures have been put in place to ensure that non-EEA students resident in Ireland prior to 1 January 2011 have been treated fairly with the introduction of the New Regime.  The transitional measures provide ample opportunity for students to seek an alternative permission to be in the State.</P>

	<P>I am aware that there have been proposals of this nature and of course my Department will give due consideration to the issue.   However great caution should be exercised before embarking on such a project.  A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  </P>
        <P>At EU level,  the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008, made specific commitments &ldquo;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&rdquo;.   While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among the Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual case.</P>
        <P>Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there is a Garda recruitment panel currently in place consisting of applicants selected by the Public Appointments Service as part of a 2008 recruitment campaign.  However, no offers of employment have been made to applicants since the introduction of the public service moratorium on recruitment in 2009.</P>
        <P>The moratorium on recruitment remains in place in furtherance of the objective, set in the context of the agreement with the EU and the IMF, to reduce the numbers of public servants.  While successful applicants on this panel currently remain eligible to be offered positions as trainee Garda&iacute;, the lifetime of the panel, and the position of applicants on it, will be kept under review in the light of when Garda recruitment might recommence.</P>

	<P>In relation to Parliamentary Question Number 202 of 20/10/2011, referred to by the Deputy, there was an error in that reply in relation to the date that the person arrived in the State. The individual concerned entered the State on 02/08/2002 and claimed asylum. His application for asylum was refused by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and this decision was upheld on appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>His case was then considered in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and under Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. A Deportation Order was made against the individual concerned on 28/06/04. Since that date, the individual concerned has remained in the State in breach of his Deportation Order. In the interim, he has <Col N="173"/>applied for a right to apply for Subsidiary Protection, which was refused on 23/02/2009 and has also applied to have the Deportation Order against him revoked, which was refused on 28/10/2009.</P>
        <P>The current position is as set out in the replies to Parliamentary Questions number 215 of 07/07/2011 and number 680 of 14/09/2011. The position is unchanged since the latter reply, set out below.</P>
        <P LI="1"><i>I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question No. 215 of 7th July, 2011. The position is unchanged since then.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy is the subject of a  Deportation Order, following a comprehensive and thorough examination of his asylum claim and of his application to remain temporarily in the State. He has been evading his deportation since 3 November 2009 and should he come to the notice of the Garda authorities, he would be liable to arrest and detention. He should, therefore, present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau without any further delay.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>As a general matter of policy, it would be logistically inconsistent to reward persons who have failed a very fair and comprehensive asylum process, and who have thereafter proceeded to evade their deportation for several years, by granting such persons residency in the State.</i></P>
        <P LI="1"><i>I should</i><b><i> </i></b>  <i>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

	<P>The persons concerned, a husband and wife, entered the State on 27th July, 2004, the husband on student conditions and his wife as his dependant, and they were granted permission to remain in the State on those bases until 10th May, 2007.  They were subsequently granted extensions of their respective permissions to remain up to 13th January, 2010, to enable a prospective employer to apply for a Work Permit on behalf of the husband. My Department&rsquo;s records indicate that his efforts to obtain a Work Permit at that time were unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>Given that the persons concerned had no legal basis to remain in the State beyond 13th May, 2010, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), they were notified, by separate letters dated 16th June, 2011, of the proposal to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.</P>
        <P>The position in the State of the persons concerned now falls to be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.

	<P>Part of the information sought by the Deputy is set out in the attached tabular statement. Rents are reviewed on a regular basis and amounts are determined by a number of factors, including size, location and quality of the facility. Information regarding the specific rents paid in respect of each premises is commercially sensitive and I cannot therefore provide this information. However the amounts of rent payable in 2011 range from approx &euro;60 to approx &euro;13,300 for the year. </P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, on Tuesday, 15 November the Government approved a proposal from me to proceed with a further phase of consolidation of Defence Force personnel into fewer locations with the closure of four barracks. The barracks being closed are Kickham Barracks Clonmel, Columb Barracks Mullingar, O&rsquo;Neill Barracks Cavan and Castlebar Barracks. It is proposed to have the personnel transferred and the barracks closed down no later than Friday, 30 March 2012.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Government&rsquo;s decision is to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces by removing the burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations.</P>
        <P>The consolidation of the Defence Forces Formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the ongoing Defence modernisation programme in order to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces and has been recommended in many reports over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>As in the case of previous barrack consolidation programmes the proceeds from the sale of the barracks will be used to fund the upgrading of Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure. Since 1998 a total of ten barracks have been closed under two barrack consolidation programmes.  To-date a total &euro;85 million has been realised from the disposal of six of these barracks and part of another.</P>
        <P>In recent weeks I have met with individual members of the Oireachtas and a delegation from the Cavan area. I have reflected carefully and at length on the sincere and genuine concerns raised by the delegation who put forward very strongly held views as to why the barracks should be retained. I wish to acknowledge the sincerity and courtesy with which these views were conveyed. However, I am obliged to take a broader view and must consider the overall needs and organisation of the Defence Forces not just for today but in the years ahead. It is in that context that the consolidation of the Defence Forces into a smaller number of locations is being addressed.  I am especially concerned to protect the strength of the Defence Forces being also mindful of the difficult economic situation facing the country.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Government decision I have asked my Department to enter into discussions with other Government Departments, Local Authorities and State Agencies regarding the possible purchase of the properties to benefit the local community as a whole but with particular emphasis on job creation measures.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Noxious Weeds Act 1936, as amended,  provides for the control of the spread of six noxious weeds, namely, Thistle, Ragwort, Dock, Common Barberry, Male Wild Hop Plant and the Wild Oat. </P>
        <P>Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds.  The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction.</P>
        <P>While the last prosecution under the Act was taken in 1988, the Department actively seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act by issuing Notices to Destroy in all instances where it is becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds.</P>
        <P>A total of 26 such Notices were issued in 2010 with a further 35 having been issued to date in 2011. These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by Department Field Officers or on receipt of complaints made by the public.</P>
        <P>Follow-up action may be undertaken by my officials with the land owner to ensure that the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the Notice to Destroy. In all such instances, my officials have at their disposal the option of initiating  proceedings under the Noxious Weeds Act against a landowner who fails to comply with such an instruction.</P>
        <P>Additionally, under the EU Single Farm Payment Scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross compliance measures of the scheme.  Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements. In the years 2009, 2010 and 2011 penalties under the Single Payment were applied to 27, 31 and 46 farmers, respectively, for failure to take appropriate measures to prevent the proliferation of noxious weeds.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Act 2010, commenced on 1 November 2010.  This coincided with Ireland&rsquo;s formal ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and inter-country adoption.  The regulatory framework governing adoption has been strengthened in an attempt to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at every step throughout the adoption process.  With effect from 1 November 2010, inter-country adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010.  The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.  It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions.</P>
        <P>As provided for in Section 72 of the Adoption Act, 2010, the Authority may establish administrative arrangements concerning the processing of applications with other Hague countries in relation to inter-country adoptions.  The Authority has already travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities; advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries.  The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and get up to date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries.  AAI delegations will shortly travel to Mexico and the United States to discuss possible administrative agreements.  It is envisaged that the AAI will visit Vietnam in the near future as that country has recently ratified the Hague Convention and entry into force of the Convention is 1 February 2012.  The Authority has also commenced a review of the adoption laws of Lithuania, Panama, Kenya and Kazakhstan as prospective countries for adoption into Ireland, and said it would look at other Hague countries as appropriate.</P><Col N="189"/>
        <P>As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in inter-country adoption, the Adoption Authority have indicated that their first priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with non-contracting states is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010 which states that &ldquo;the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.&rdquo;  Ethiopia, as it is not a signatory of Hague, is covered by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010.  Ireland has no bilateral agreement with non Hague countries</P>

Therefore, the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption will enter into force for Vietnam on 1 February 2012.  Preliminary discussions have taken place regarding official visits and exchange of information between Ireland and Vietnam with a view to putting in place administrative arrangements under Section 72 of the 2010 Act.</P>
        <P><i>Non-Hague Countries</i></P>
        <P>As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in inter-country adoption, the Adoption Authority have indicated that their current priority is to reach agreements on arrangements with other countries that have ratified the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with non-contracting states is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010 which states that &ldquo;the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The situation in relation to Russia is complex.  My Department is currently in discussion with the AAI on the appropriateness and feasibility of exploratory discussions with the Russians authorities concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State.  It is envisaged that Irish officials will visit Moscow in December on this matter.</P>
        <P>Ethiopia, as it is not a signatory of Hague, is also covered by Section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010.  Ireland currently has no bilateral agreement with non Hague countries.</P>
        <P><i>Resources</i></P>
        <P>The issue of resources, staffing and funding for the AAI is a matter of continuous review by my Department.  However,  as the Deputy will be aware, there are currently significant ongoing constraints on public expenditure to which the Adoption Authority is subject, including the Employment Control Frameworks which provide for progressive and permanent reductions in the numbers employed across the public service.  The Authority has submitted specific proposals relating to staffing and these are currently under review by my Department.  In addition, the post of CEO of the Authority has been advertised and I expect will be filled shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><TitleTxt>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Under EU telecoms rules agreed in 2009, the 116000 number is reserved in all EU member states for a missing children hotline.  In a recent debate on this issue in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, on 12th October last, I gave a commitment to work with relevant Departments and agencies to establish this Hotline in Ireland in 2012.  I also announced my intention to establish a cross-sectoral Project Team to include representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The final nominee to the project team has just been received and the team is now in a position to commence its work. </P>
        <P>In June 2011, ComReg, who have responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland, sought expressions of interest to run the Hotline and no substantive responses were received.  However; I am aware of and have met with Irish NGOs who may be interested, but their estimated costings vary significantly.  The Project Team will examine how best to operate the Hotline, in the context of  the demand for the service, and to establish the extent to which services, including Garda and victim support services, which are already in existence and receiving Government funding, can be mobilised to meet Ireland&rsquo;s commitments in relation to the Hotline.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want to emphasise that the investigation of a child&rsquo;s disappearance is the responsibility of the Garda.  Their structures in this regard include not only the local garda&iacute;, who will have primary responsibility for the investigation, but also the Missing Persons Bureau.  It is of paramount importance that any arrangements which are put in place to establish the 116000 Hotline in Ireland do not compromise the requirement that the first and most important contact to be made, is to notify the Garda of the fact that a child is missing, so the investigation can commence without delay.  However the implementation of a dedicated missing children hotline is intended to provide a further level of support in such situations.</P>

Based on current availability of Crisis Pregnancy and Post Termination Counselling hours in the Galway area, the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme would not see a requirement for funding any additional hours at this juncture.  There is no evidence that further services are required and services locations are well placed to respond to existing need.</P>

	<P>I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies &mdash; mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals have been instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they have no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  Where they fail to do so, the NTPF will source the necessary treatments elsewhere and an appropriate budgetary adjustment will be made.</P>
        <P>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised me that expenditure on health services for people with a disability in 2011 will be approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  Special consideration was given to disability and mental health in Budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the allocation for the two sectors.  The relatively lower reduction of 1.8%, compared to other areas of the health budget that saw reductions of up to 5%, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups and should help to ensure that existing services are maintained and that priority is given to the delivery of frontline services.  </P>
        <P>I recognise and appreciate the valuable contribution that Prosper Fingal makes to the provision of services to individuals with intellectual disabilities in North Dublin through a range of community-based day, respite, and residential services on behalf of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has advised that Prosper Fingal will receive approximately &euro;6.55 million in funding from them in 2011.  Taking the reduction in the overall HSE disability budget for 2011 into account, the HSE was asked to manage the additional resources and engage with service providers including Prosper Fingal, to ensure that existing support needs, and demands for additional places and supports, are managed effectively within the overall allocation.</P>
<P><i>Budget 2012</i></P>
        <P>With regard to the level of funding for the Disability sector next year, this is being considered as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Estimates process for 2012 which is currently underway. Deliberations on the expenditure allocations for 2012 are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  As you are aware, the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.</P>
<P><i>Value for Money &amp; Policy Review of Disability Services</i></P>
        <P>A major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect.  It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review.  The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding of &euro;1.5 billion provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that the Deputy wishes to understand the rationale behind the closure of Abbeyleix Community Nursing Unit. The Unit provides continuing care, day care and respite services to people in Laois/Offaly and bordering areas of Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary and Kildare.  The Health Service Executive has advised that the reducing funding allocation being experienced across all HSE services, together with staff losses as a result of the Public Sector Moratorium, combined with the anticipated losses of staff between now and the end of the year make it essential that it now moves to consolidate the overall provision of long stay care within the Dublin Mid- Leinster Region.</P>
        <P>An inspection report published by HIQA in February 2011 concluded that the ratio of staff to residents at the Abbeyleix Unit was not adequate to meet the needs of the mainly maximum dependency residents.  It also noted that the building is old and has a number of multi occupancy bedrooms which do not meet the requirements of the National Standards.  Taking all these factors together, the HSE took the decision to proceed with the closure of Abbeyleix CNU.  It will continue to consult and communicate with residents families, staff, public representatives and key people in the wider community including Friends of the Hospital, Age Action, and local GPs, clergy and garda&iacute;.  It is intended that the residents will be transferred to public units where appropriate, and that the remaining residents will be transferred to private nursing homes.  Staff from Abbeyleix CNU will be transferred to reopen closed beds and/or prevent the closure of other public beds resulting from moratorium losses in the area.</P>
        <P>In relation to the other services provided at Abbeyleix CNU, I can confirm that the day care services will continue to cater for the needs of the 90 clients &mdash; approximately 24 per day &mdash; who use the service, and there are plans to further enhance this service in the future.  Respite service for the current 8 clients will continue; however, it is intended that this service will transfer to a private provider following consultation with the families concerned.  I can also assure the House that the Primary Care Centre located on the grounds of the facility will also continue in line with the HSE Primary Care Strategy.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy wishes to examine the documentation relating to this decision, the proper channel for this is through a request under the Freedom of Information Act and he should contact the Freedom of Information Unit of the Department or alternatively the HSE.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has advised me that expenditure on health services for people with a disability in 2011 will be approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  Special consideration was given to disability and mental health in Budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the allocation for the two sectors.  The relatively lower reduction of 1.8%, compared to other areas of the health budget that saw reductions of up to 5%, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups and should help to ensure that existing services are maintained and that priority is given to the delivery of frontline services.  </P>
        <P>I recognise and appreciate the valuable contribution that St. Michael&rsquo;s House makes to the provision of services to individuals with intellectual disabilities in Dublin and Navan through a range of community-based day, respite, and residential services on behalf of the Health Service Executive.  The HSE has advised that St. Michael&rsquo;s House will receive approximately &euro;72 million in funding from them in 2011.  Taking the reduction in the overall HSE disability budget <Col N="198"/>for 2011 into account, the HSE was asked to manage the additional resources and engage with service providers including St. Michael&rsquo;s House, to ensure that existing support needs, and demands for additional places and supports, are managed effectively within the overall allocation.</P>
        <P><i>Budget 2012</i></P>
        <P>With regard to the level of funding for the Disability sector next year, this is being considered as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and Estimates process for 2012 which is currently underway. Deliberations on the expenditure allocations for 2012 are likely to continue up until Budget time and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  As you are aware, the very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management across all areas of expenditure.</P>
        <P><i>Value for Money &amp; Policy Review of Disability Services</i></P>
        <P>A major priority for the Government in the coming months will be to finalise the current Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services to ensure that existing funding for people with disabilities is spent to best effect. It is now more important than ever that large scale spending programmes of this nature are subject to detailed periodic review. The VFM Efficiency and Effectiveness Review will make recommendations that will ensure that the very substantial funding of &euro;1.5 billion provided to the specialist disability health sector is used to maximum benefit for persons with disability, having regard to overall resource constraints which affect all sectors at this time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 to 246, inclusive, together. </P>
        <P>Arising from the St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement, the Irish Government gave a commitment to co-fund the construction of the A5 through Northern Ireland to Derry thus improving access to Letterkenny and North Donegal. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to a contribution of &pound;400 million for investment in roads infrastructure in Northern Ireland was included in a joint infrastructure investment package announced in March 2007 by the British and Irish Governments in the lead up to the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
        <P>Drawdown of funding is based on the achievement of agreed project milestones as reported by the Cross-Border Roads Steering Group leading to approval by the North South Ministerial Council. The A5 project milestone and payment schedule was formally approved by the NSMC Plenary in January 2011.  To date  funding of &pound;19 million (sterling) has been paid by the Irish Government towards the planning of the project with a further &pound;3 million (sterling) due to be paid in 2012 in relation to the completion of the Public Inquiry on the project. </P>
        <P>It had been envisaged, subject to the outcome of the planning process, that the balance of the Irish Government&rsquo;s contribution would have been paid over the period 2013 to 2016 accord<Col N="201"/>ing as specified milestones were achieved during the construction phase of the project. However, it is important to stress that no provision was made by the outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il led Government  within either the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010-2016 or the Four Year Plan for this project beyond the payments already made and the payments due in 2012.</P>
        <P>Following an extensive Capital Investment Review conducted in 2011 by this Government and having regard to the current economic position which the Deputy will appreciate was inherited from the previous Fianna F&aacute;il led Government, it has proved necessary to defer the funding commitment to the A5.</P>
        <P>In early November, in advance of the announcement of the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin, and I met with our Northern Ireland Ministerial counterparts, Sammy Wilson MP MLA and Danny Kennedy  MLA to discuss the position in relation to the A5 project.  This matter will be discussed further at the North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting which is being held tomorrow.</P>

	<P>As referred to within my answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions yesterday, contributions towards the A5 roads project of &pound;25m will be made in 2015 and a further &pound;25m in 2016 subject to the agreement at the North South Ministerial Council. This will be met from the Government&rsquo;s unallocated reserves and not from the vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</P>
        <P>I would remind the Deputy that the previous Fianna F&aacute;il led Government made no provision to meet the costs of the A5 post 2012 in either the Four Year Plan or the Infrastructure Investment Priorities Plan 2010 to 2016.</P>
        <P>With regard to what can be achieved by this funding, this will be discussed at tomorrow&rsquo;s North South Ministerial Council Plenary meeting and follow-up by the relevant authorities thereafter.  I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of this discussion. </P>

	<P>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.  </P>
