      <P>No, Sir.  It is not agreed. Let me first of all say that I am over 20 years in this House and the only Taoiseach that has shown frequent discourtesy to you, Sir, and to this House by arriving late is Deputy Reynolds.  He is the only one who turns up late.  That is discourteous to you, Sir, and to the rest of the House.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste, when challenged, would not get up and say anything. He just grumbled away.  He is a cardboard hero.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke yesterday on other legislation and used the words &ldquo;if he gets the co-operation of the House&rdquo;. The Taoiseach cannot expect the co-operation of this party and this House if he continues to guillotine both Committee Stages and Report Stages of measures.  There are over 40 amendments to this Housing Bill and an hour and a half to deal with them; that is about a minute and a half to two minutes to deal with each one.  We are not agreeing to No. 20 being taken in this manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of housing is at the top of the agenda of every local authority.  It is nothing short of disgraceful that we would guillotine this Bill at Report and Final Stages and deal with it in a matter of a couple of hours.  We indicated that to the Government Whip last week.  It is nothing short of disgraceful that we have come to the end of the term and a range of Bills are rushed through this House without proper consideration. We would like to oppose the taking of the Housing Bill in this way.</P>

      <P>I also am opposing the guillotining of this Bill.  There are 38 sections in it.  Only two of those sections were dealt with on Committee Stage and we are now expected to deal with the Report Stage in about an hour and a half. <Col N="5" /> We have reached the position now where the guillotine has become the parliamentary norm; it should be the exception. The House needs to seriously look at how it is doing its business.  We cannot <Col N="6" /> continue to deal with serious legislation in this offhand way.</P>

      <P>In relation to the deferral of Vote 40 in the event of a division being called, as a result of discussions at Committee of Procedure and Privileges yesterday on next Wednesday's sitting I would ask that that matter be deferred so that the Whips can discuss it rather than agree to the last section, the deferral of the vote.  I think we can reach accommodation on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to state how pleased we are on this side of the House that a way forward has been found for Strand Two of the Northern Ireland talks.  The urgency with which these talks should be addressed and their importance was underlined by the hideous murders of three young men last night, with another three families being deprived of a wage earner.</P>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach outline the arrangement of legislation for next week given that he will be away on Thursday and Friday, there will be an Adjournment debate and the Committee of Procedure and Privileges have decided that the House adjourn after the President's address to the Houses next week?  Can the Taoiseach say what other business will be taken next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barry in relation to the violent murders in the North of Ireland.  I am sure they are deplored by everybody in this House and we unequivocally condemn them.  In relation to next week's business, the arrangement for Wednesday is a matter for discussion between the Whips and I will not anticipate what agreement they may arrive at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if, arising from his remark in the House yesterday with regard to the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, it is proposed to take all Stages of that Bill next week and, if <Col N="10" /> so, if he will ensure that adequate time will be given to debate it.  It is an urgent Bill and I think there would be general agreement that it should be taken next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for discussion by the Whips.  I hope that Deputy De Rossa, in line with Deputy McCartan, who held up the Bill yesterday and said it could be produced and discussed in five minutes, takes a similar approach to the passing of the Bill in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 21, after &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including any flat or apartment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some of the definitions in the Bill are not as clear as they should be.  The definition of a house includes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith and &ldquo;housing&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly;</P>
    <P>Elsewhere the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is, &ldquo;a dwelling owned by a local authority&rdquo;. That definition is not what ordinary people understand &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; to mean. In my amendment I am seeking to clarify the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; and make it absolutely clear that where a house is divided into two or more separate parts, each flat or apartment for the purposes of this Bill will be deemed to be a separate house.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that that is covered, but I am not satisfied it is.  If we want every house to have an indoor toilet and bathroom the amendment I propose could be very significant. It could mean that people in flats and apartments would have a right to running water, a toilet and bathroom in the flat or apartment.  Under the definition as it stands that may not be the case. My amendment does not detract from the Bill and the Minister should accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 12, after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as specified in paragraphs (a) and (c) to (j) of section 9 (2) of the Act of 1988&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment so that the Bill, perhaps in a Schedule, would contain a list of the persons who would qualify for the shared ownership scheme and also a list of people entitled to local authority housing as set out in the housing Act of 1988.  The list in that Bill seemed to cover most of the people at whom the shared ownership scheme is targeted.  This Bill does not refer to the important section of the community which the local authority will have to deal with in regard to housing. It would be useful to indicate to local authorities the people who might benefit from shared ownership, those who are entitled to it.  We should prioritise the people for whom this benefit is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3, which provides for the housing authority shared ownership system, was drafted with a view to having detailed operational matters determined by way of regulations to be made by the Minister.  Such regulations will enable housing authorities to grant shared ownership leases to those for whom the system is currently intended, for example, tenants and tenant purchasers of local authority housing, persons included on the housing waiting list and other persons in need of housing with a household income of less than £12,000 per annum, as well as to such other class or classes of persons that may be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 3 would be to confine the shared ownership scheme to those included on the housing list only.  It would take away the flexibility that is intended and prevent local authority tenants, tenant purchasers and other persons not on the housing waiting lists, availing of the scheme.  The same <Col N="15" /> argument applies in the case of amendment No. 5 to section 4 which provides for the shared ownership subsidy.  If accepted, the amendment would leave the section totally inflexible and prevent persons for whom the shared ownership system was intended from availing of the subsidy.  The broader approach is preferable.  The point made by Deputy Kavanagh is relevant to the extent that clearly the majority of people on the housing lists who live within the income limits may well be the ones who will be catered for to a greater degree.  We want to ensure that there is flexibility in the regulations for the local authority to take account of all situations that might arise. That has worked elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation is reasonable.  In this amendment I wanted to achieve priority for the people on the housing lists and the people regarded by the local authorities as being in most need of housing mainly due to a lack of houses for them.  The majority of people on waiting lists will not achieve occupancy or ownership of a house unless there is a drive to build more local authority houses.  Failing that, I wanted to ensure in this Bill that those people would have first call on any moneys provided and on any local authority priority schemes.  The Minister has told me that that will be the case when this Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 33, after &ldquo;house&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by the lessee&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the current procedures under which a tenant purchaser or somebody who owns a local authority house is required to obtain the consent of the local authority to sell the house.  Certainly, tenant purchasers are aware in most cases that if they wish to sell the house they are required to obtain the consent of the local authority. <Col N="16" /> However, a problem arises when the house has been sold two or three times and the local authority are still requiring the present owners of the house to apply to them for consent if they wish to sell the house.  I have come across some cases where the ownership of a local authority house has changed for the second or third time and the present owners bought the house under normal market conditions but when they wished to sell it they found at the very last moment that they required the consent of the local authority in order to do so.  In those cases, the people concerned felt very aggrieved because they made the very valid point that they had not bought the house from the local authority in the first place and therefore they did not see why they should have to get the consent of the local authority when they subsequently wished to sell the house.  The purpose of this amendment is to confine the requirement for consent to the lessee, in other words to the original tenant purchaser and not to have that requirement in the case of persons wishing to sell the house subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, it is not intended to continue with this restriction in the shared ownership scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate there are good reasons for requiring the person who is selling a former local authority house to seek the consent of the local authority before doing so.  First, it is very important to ensure that the person disposing of the house is not going to come back on to the local authority housing list, of which development we have had previous experience.  It would be ludicrous not to put some brakes on that.  Second, some local authority houses have potential for certain types of commercial development and people who have great resources at their disposal may wish to purchase these houses when they come on the market, and that would make it impossible for people with modest incomes, for whom these houses were intended, to acquire them.  For that reason, the requirement that the consent of the local authority must be obtained means that the local <Col N="17" /> authority has some say as to whether you, I or somebody else has the right to purchase the house.  If this provision did not exist, the market value of the property could be inflated and this would be disadvantageous as far as the management of local authority houses is concerned. These are the two essential points, but clearly once the annuity has been purchased and the time limits have expired the normal market conditions apply to local authority houses.  Gradually we will move towards that view. However as long as we have to subsidise these houses, as I have explained in the earlier debate, it is crucial that some management system operates to ensure that we serve the needs of people to the greatest possible extent.  However it is not intended that this restriction will apply to houses purchased under the new shared ownership scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>By and large, the Minister has clarified the matter and his statement certainly satisfies the intent of my amendment.  I fully accept there should be a requirement for the consent of the local authority when the tenant purchaser wishes to sell the house for the reasons the Minister has stated: the possibility that someone may reappear on the housing list or in circumstances where the house is being sold on very attractive terms.  It is quite in order that that should be the case.  When the houses are subsequently purchased at normal market value, the question of local authority consent becomes a bureaucratic condition which is not necessary.  I accept what the Minister has said and therefore I do not wish to press my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 8, to delete &ldquo;and the availability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In tabling this amendment I wish to draw <Col N="18" /> attention to the fact that water, sewerage and other services are not always available in isolated areas.  There are some very isolated houses in my constituency and if one had to wait for water and sewerage services to be installed before the local authority would consent to shared ownership under this scheme, the applicant might have to wait many years for these services to be provided.  I know in a place called Coniary in Avoca one would have to wait a very long time for these services.  Will the Minister explain why the phrase &ldquo;and the availability&rdquo; of such services is a requirement when there may be a very long delay before they are provided in certain isolated areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to be based on a misreading of paragraph (h) of section 4 (3), the purpose of which is to ensure that the subsidy is payable only for houses of an acceptable standard. It enables the Minister by regulation to lay down mimimum standards for houses in respect of which a subsidy may be paid.  This could relate to any works carried out to the house and its general state of repair and also allows a requirement that the house has adequate water, sewerage facilities or other services. I think Deputy Kavanagh would appreciate that having the power to manage these situations within the regulation takes account of the necessity to have these facilities in the house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite honestly, the Minister had prepared his reply before he listened to my contribution.  I made the point that there are isolated homes in very remote areas and while we all agree that they should have water and sewerage facilities, sometimes they are not available.  A person from the area may wish to purchase a house under the shared ownership scheme but the local authority will not allow them to do so because the house has not got proper facilities; the person has to wait until these facilities are installed and this could be a very long time.  I had hoped the Minister would accept the need for some <Col N="19" /> flexibility to take account of conditions pertaining in remote rural areas.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 21, after &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, extension&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to include the word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; in these sections because many of the houses which could be purchased under the scheme will have extensions.  I do not think one should regard an extension as an improvement.  In some cases the extension is often bigger than the house and for that reason the word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; should be accepted.  There may be some difficulty in defining whether an extension is an improvement. If the property is changed to allow extra dwelling accommodation, that could be regarded as an extension, while improvements might be regarded as changes to the shape and size of rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if I have covered all the areas involving the word &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;. I tabled this amendment because the word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; did not cover an extension to a house which may be necessary because of an increase in the size of a family or the possibility of having to accommodate an unmarried mother and her family or younger married members of the family who are unable to afford a <Col N="20" /> house.  These matters should be covered in this Bill and the Minister could improve it by using the word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some brief comments on the amendment.  I agree with what Deputy Kavanagh said. My concern is in regard to the maximum loan that is available for the provision of improvements or extensions to houses under the <i>Plan for Social Housing.</i>  This provision was to cater for housing applicants who wished to be housed by way of an extension being provided to the family home.  I have no doubt there are some applicants for whom that would be an attractive proposition.  However, the maximum finance available for this is £10,000 and I consider that totally unrealistic to provide an adequate extension. The minimum type of extension that one would require in circumstances like this would presumably involve a bedroom, a bathroom and some kitchen/living accommodation but such an extension cannot be provided for £10,000.  The Minister when replying should address that question.  The arrangements for extending dwellings will not work if the maximum loan available is confined to £10,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to check a legal matter and ensure this Bill is legally correct. I am not sure that I agree with Deputy Kavanagh's comments.  This section refers to &ldquo;works of improvements&rdquo;, and if we look at the definitions contained in section 1 we find that &ldquo;improvement works&rdquo; are defined but &ldquo;works of improvement&rdquo; are not.  Do these terms have the same meaning?  One would need to refer to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 where the definition of &ldquo;improvement works&rdquo; is set out.  Will the Minister clarify that in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the words &ldquo;works of improvement&rdquo; and &ldquo;improvement works&rdquo;, they have the same meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Gilmore's point <Col N="21" /> about local authority work in lieu of rehousing, the £10,000 loan figure is not sacrosanct.  It is set at the average limit which a local authority would be required to make these extensions.  However, in certain cases, if the local authority consider that loan inadequate the Bill provides that additional funds may be provided by way of a loan, subject to the Minister's consent.  There is some flexibility there.  It is important to remember that when trying to set limits a balance has to be struck; there may be certain cases where the costs will be higher and others which will be lower. A balance has to be struck and at the moment it is £10,000 with flexibility, following the Minister's consent, to allow a higher figure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh's amendment, is not necessary.  For the benefit of the House I will read the definition of &ldquo;improvement works&rdquo; in section 1 (1) of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979. The term is widely drawn and covers all possible eventualities that could be envisaged in the context of extensions. That subsection states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;improvement works&rdquo;, in relation to a house, includes the provision and installation of a private water supply or private sewerage facilities in the house and any works carried out to the house (whether for the purpose of extending, enlarging, improving, repairing or converting it) that, in the opinion of the Minister, are reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering the house more suitable for human habitation, but does not include decoration;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>That definition is inadequate in that it does not take account of the fact that there are now specific additions to houses that are known as extensions.  A wall can be extended, but an extension is the addition of extra rooms on to a house which can change the whole character of a house and would require planning permission if a large area is involved.  In order to build an extension one has to apply to a local authority for approval; one would not approach the planning section of a local <Col N="22" /> authority and say, I want to carry out an improvement to my house which involves an area of 6,000 sq. ft.  One would have to say, I am adding an extension to the house, and in Wicklow one would be questioned about the area involved.  As there is some amelioration in the plight of certain families by the addition of an extension rather than making an improvement, one would think that the concept would be accepted.  However, if the Minister considers that what he has said is adequate, though I do not agree with him, I will have to accept it.  It might be a good idea if the Minister would insert a new word in the Bill that would cover such a situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) rendering part of the house suitable for independent or semi-independent occupation by an aged person or aged persons sharing or proposing to share the house with relatives or other persons prescribed in regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, with others tabled on Committee Stage, addressed a key issue in the housing area, one which will grow <Col N="23" /> as the years go by, that is, housing for the elderly.  We cannot discuss the housing policy for the elderly in isolation without considering the impact of other Government rules and regulations on housing matters and, in particular, social welfare rules.</P>
    <P>At present an old person living alone is entitled to a living alone allowance and usually to a free television licence for a black and white set, an electricity allowance, free telephone rental and, perhaps, one or two other benefits.  If a family member goes to live with an elderly person living alone those benefits are lost to the elderly person.  Older people, therefore, resist taking members of their family in to live with them, even though in many cases the elderly person badly needs someone to live with and look after him or her.</P>
    <P>Apart from getting feeble, elderly people living alone are often frightened because of the crime problem yet the social welfare rules regarding living alone allowances frequently make them reluctant to take in members of their family who may be in need of housing or who may be taking up other local authority housing.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes the addition of a paragraph that would give the Minister a discretion to extend the provisions of section 5 so that work may be done by or on behalf of local authorities to assist in rendering part of a house suitable for independent or semi-independent living accommodation for an aged person who is sharing or proposing to share the rest of the house with close relatives or other persons prescribed in the regulations.</P>
    <P>This is one of a series of amendments designed to try to help old people who are living alone.  First, we should try to minimise the number of old people who ultimately have to seek accommodation in a hospital or a nursing home.  Second, the aim should be to relieve old people of fear by having others live with them and third, we hope to relieve them of loneliness. Fourth, it is hoped they will receive the kind of assistance and attention they need while retaining a modicum <Col N="24" /> of privacy and independence within their own home and also retaining the benefits that they would otherwise forego under social welfare rules.</P>
    <P>I should like to have more time to explore the whole question of care and housing for the elderly because, as any public representative knows, this is becoming a more acute issue.  I hope the Minister accepts this amendment which does not impose any duty on the Minister but merely gives him a discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell has outlined the benefits of adopting this amendment. I should like to point out that a double penalty could result from an elderly person going to live with someone else.  The elderly person could lose his or her benefits and the person or people with whom the elderly person went to live could also lose benefits.  From my experience of Cork Corporation, I know that many old people now living alone in three and four-bedroomed corporation houses would willingly release those houses to the local authority if there was some offer available to them that would make everyday living acceptable.  As Deputy Mitchell said, elderly people are prevented from moving out of a large house and going into a unit because of the social welfare rules.  If provision could be made so that elderly people could move into a granny flat, for example, attached to the home of one of their children, they would certainly move out. If this amendment is accepted the overall benefit to the Department would be enormous.</P>
      <P>Often due to family circumstances elderly people are forced into long term insitutional care when they can no longer cope for themselves.  In many cases that involves a cost to the State and to the family.  Acceptance of the amendment would result in accommodation for the elderly person in every sense of the word.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept the amendment which is full of commonsense.  The Minister, and his Department, would benefit from its provisions.</P>

      <P>The amendment <Col N="25" /> appears to have some merit in that it moves somewhat away from the provisions of the section.  It could bring in people who are not closely connected to the owner of the house being repaired.  I do not know whether Deputy Mitchell intended that those provided with accommodation as a result of the amendment would pay rent to the owner.  There is a danger after the local authority improving the house of the occupant making money out of it by renting it out.</P>

      <P>I broadly accept the Fine Gael amendment.  The purpose behind it is excellent.  We certainly need to cater as best we can for the needs of the elderly and to keep them within the family environment if that is what they and the family want.  I am not clear whether the amendment is needed to spell that out.  I hope the Minister will clarify the position.  I commend the spirit behind it.  Will the Minister accept the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can be satisfied that the section, as drafted, clearly allows for works, whether by way of extension or otherwise, to be carried out in order to cater for the circumstances envisaged by Deputy Mitchell and others.  An amendment on the lines suggested would be inadvisable since it would be construed as limiting in some way the broad thrust of section 5 (1) (c), which allows works to be done for the purpose of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of its occupants.  Clearly, if elderly relatives want to live in a part of a house independent of the other occupants the work necessary to achieve that is covered by the existing provision, as it <Col N="26" /> would render the house more suitable for the accommodation of its occupants.</P>
      <P>The provision as drafted is a broader measure.  It takes account of the circumstances envisaged by Deputy Mitchell and it also takes into account many other matters.  The purpose behind this section has been to try to meet in a much broader way the problems Deputy Mitchell outlined.  For the first time we must be in a much stronger position to try to provide for the housing circumstances he and others envisaged and, by extension to allow for independence for the aged if that is what they desire.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Housing Bill we cannot deal with the other points Deputy Mitchell made with regard to social welfare problems that can arise.  Suffice it to say such matters have to be considered in the light of the available finances. There is clearly a difference between the costs to be met relating to living on one's own and those of residing with one's family or relatives.  One must take account of the additional costs facing individuals when they live alone.  If we had the resources available to us from the taxpayer to meet all the situations everything would be fine but we must be responsible if there are anomalies in the area the Deputy is referring to.  We cannot deal with them in housing legislation. An instance of the way they might be dealt with is the carer's allowance which it is hoped to be able to improve in the future to take account of the services many families and individuals provide in looking after parents and older relatives in a very caring way.  This relieves the taxpayer of the burden of the people concerned being cared for in institutions and provides a much better way of meeting the needs of elderly people.  It is good that we can have a system which is broad enough to take account of the various aspects of that area.  There are people who like some independence, they can be catered for.  Others prefer to share facilities and they can be catered for, too. In the light of experience in the next couple of years we will see how the scheme is working and to what extent it will need to be improved or amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Deputy Mitchell's proposal is well intended but it is not necessary.  It would limit the broader scope of what is provided in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I hear the sort of reply the Minister is making I am frustrated at his attitude.  It is so <i>laissez faire.</i> Nothing the Minister has said impresses me or convinces me that the amendment should not be accepted.  The section as it stands refers to the occupants of a house, not to potential or future occupants in a possible sharing arrangement, whereas our amendment envisages such an arrangement.</P>
      <P>Second, it is far from clear from the section that there is any provision for what are known commonly as granny flats or for what we refer to in this amendment as independent or semi-independent groups.  Neither is there reference in any part of this Bill or in any other housing legislation I know of to such matters. We are trying to create the concept of encouraging or facilitating independence or semi-independence where that is desired by the aged person and by his or her relatives living in the same house.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about cost.  We are trying to save the Exchequer money.  It is clear to me, and I thought the Minister was persuaded earlier on this, that social welfare rules are jacking up housing demand and therefore housing costs thereby costing the State a fortune.  That does not relate just to old people living alone and reluctant to share because they would forfeit their allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention in passing the ridiculous rule whereby, because of the application of means testing, young people who are unemployed and living at home will not get unemployment assistance if their father is working.  I know of people of up to 33 years of age who are living at home, who have no income of their own but who are disqualified from unemployment assistance because of their parent's means.  What are such people to do?  They leave home, take a private flat and qualify for housing subsidy from the State, often £50 or £60 per week.  This does not come <Col N="28" /> out of the Department of the Environment budget, it comes from the health budget.  It is not, therefore, a transparent housing cost, but it is a housing cost and it is jacking up the cost of flats and causing a dearth of available flats for couples.  A couple with a child may try to rent a flat but cannot do so as a result of the available accommodation being taken up by so many single people leaving their parent's homes because of the circumstances I have outlined.  Not only then do they get the rent subsidy, they get unemployment assistance and a medical card, which combined, costs the State about £140 a week, whereas if we gave, say, 80 per cent of the unemployment assistance to the single person living at home we would save about £90 per week. Likewise the amendment before us would have the effect of saving the State money.</P>
    <P>If we had a scheme whereby tenants or tenant purchasers could return houses to local authorities in order to go back to live with aged parents the aged parent being provided with a granny flat in the house, or, if the aged person alternatively were to give back a house to the local authority and move in with a daughter or son whose home was provided with a granny flat for that purpose, the State would be saved a fortune. Elderly people living alone may be taking up a big house which they do not need any more and in which they feel unsafe and lonely.  In addition this may lead to all kinds of problems, illness, etc.  Frequently hypothermia is a factor in such cases.  That leads to increased hospitalisation and increased recourse to nursing homes, all of which cost the State a great deal of money.  Because, thank God, more elderly people are living longer the question of housing for the elderly is becoming a much bigger factor in our housing policy.  The amendment before the House seeking to provide what I call granny flats would be widely welcomed. I am bitterly disappointed that the Minister has not the good grace to accept even one decent amendment from the Opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11) In this section &ldquo;housing accommodation&rdquo; includes sites for caravans within the meaning of section 13 of the Act of 1988.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 gives local authorities wide powers to assist voluntary bodies in respect of the provision or management <Col N="30" /> of housing accommodation which would not at present include halting sites for travellers.  In deference to views expressed by Deputies, my amendment will extend the scope of that section to include these as a new category.  This would mean that a body providing halting sites could be considered for the full range of assistance local authorities are empowered to give under section 6, including loans, periodic contributions, grants, subsidies, etc.  It would also have the effect of bringing such projects within the terms of section 15 of the 1988 Act under which the Minister may pay a grant to a housing authority in respect of any assistance the authority provides.  This is the same mechanism under which the very successful voluntary housing scheme operates.</P>
    <P>In spite of statements to the contrary, once again I have demonstrated that I listen and am prepared to improve the Bill where I can.  As a result of contributions by various Deputies in the House I have responded by introducing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate was worthwhile as it produced this amendment.  In dealing with housing problems we have talked about the inadequacy of this Bill and many of us are very concerned about the conditions under which travelling people live.  There was a great opportunity in the Bill to improve their conditions. The change will go a long way towards meeting many of the concerns which the travelling movement &mdash; and many people concerned about them &mdash; expressed in relation to this Bill.  They considered that it did not deal with their needs and conditions and, therefore, the Minister's amendment is welcome.  I am delighted that our efforts have not been in vain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also anxious to see some recognition of the travelling community in this Bill and an acknowledgment of their particular problems.  I do not intend to hold up the debate as I am anxious to reach section 10.  I am curious <Col N="31" /> as to why the Minister has chosen to recognise the problems of the travelling community in this section because it deals with assistance by housing authorities to certain bodies.  It permits the housing authority to assist another housing authority or a body approved for the purposes of this section in respect of the provision of housing and so on.  It is the section normally dealing with co-operative housing, voluntary bodies and so on.  I wonder whether the insertion of the redefinition of housing accommodation to include sites for caravans signals that the Government are changing policy in relation to the provision of sites for travellers.  Does the Minister envisage an arrangement whereby the responsibility which currently exists for a local authority to provide halting sites and housing for travellers will be devolved at arm's length of voluntary bodies?  It might well be a very interesting idea to explore but it is a pity the Minister did not state why he chose this section to include the recognition of the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the powers of voluntary bodies and I was requested, in the course of the debate, to consider whether it would be desirable to extend that range of powers in so far as it would affect halting sites and provisions of that kind; that is all I have done, there is nothing else involved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) In drawing up and adopting or <Col N="32" /> amending a policy under this section a housing authority shall have regard to the distinct needs of and provision for members of the traveller community.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I did not contribute to the debate on the last amendment because of time constraints and because this amendment relates to a similar area.  If the Minister accepted this amendment it would, in addition to the amendment he has just accepted, be a step in the right direction to allay the considerable fears of the travelling community in relation to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The problems of the travelling community have been referred to a number of times in the course of the debate.  It would be a very defective policy statement from a housing authority which did not include specific reference to the particular problems of the travelling community and the policy of the authorities in regard to accommodation for that community.  However, the difficulty arises when the statement of policy has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many cases in which local authorities have adopted a policy in relation to the travelling community but the problems arise when they try to implement it.  I am a member of Dublin County Council, who adopted a policy in 1986 which has not been implemented because it met with resistance, in some cases from local communities, and there were problems in relation to the acquisition of sites.  There was also a High Court challenge which delayed its implementation for 18 months or more and it reached a point where some of the sites which had been available in 1986 were no longer available by the time the court proceedings were resolved.  The policy then had to be amended; it is one thing to state a policy and quite another to put it into effect.  In fairness, most local authorities have shown a willingness to get to grips with the problem of settling the travelling community but we need a national policy or plan to address the problem.  Will the Minister indicate <Col N="33" /> whether he has any plans to introduce a national plan in relation to the settlement and housing of the travelling community?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>All that can be said and I am very anxious to get on to section 10 which deals with the problems relating to halting sites and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that we will get to section 10 within the next five minutes but that is doubtful. Like the proposers of the amendment, I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to outline his views and plans in regard to the travelling community.  In our amendments we put forward suggestions to alleviate their plight.  We were anxious to reach that section but, because the Bill is being rushed through the House, I am afraid we are not going to have a proper debate on this issue.  That is both a pity and unfortunate &mdash; we have protested about it &mdash; because on the one hand there are many people who are concerned about the plight of the travelling community, while on the other, communities are upset that they can impinge on their lifestyle and invade their areas.  It was said in &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo; that the Irish are the blacks of Europe; in this case the travelling community are becoming the blacks of Ireland.  We are, however, trying to improve on that in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tendency in debates such as this to take the view that another national plan is needed to deal with the problem of housing and settling the travelling community.  However, we should call a spade a spade.  We have allocated £3 million for the provision of halting sites and are extremely anxious that local authorities press ahead in acquiring suitable sites.  This problem is not due to a lack of commitment on the part of the Government but rather in practically all cases to resistance on the part of the settled community to allow sites to be acquired.  We should not pretend that there is a line of thinking which says that the problem should be dealt with somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The travelling community will be expected to park in the designated sites and not close to them and that meets the concerns expressed by the settled community, where they have agreed to a site, about illegal parking.  If the matter is handled properly this provision will be of help to the local authorities in acquiring sites but for Heaven's sake we should not pretend that there is a need for further legal powers and another national plan. The solution lies in the hands of the local community given that the local authorities are aware of what the needs are and that the elected local representatives are committed to solving the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be remembered that the members of the travelling community have a different lifestyle, have a shorter life expectancy and do not have the same opportunities in relation to education and employment as compared with the rest of the community.  I am sick and tired of people telling me that further legal powers are required; what is needed is a commitment from the local authorities, with the support of the local elected representatives, and greater understanding on the part of the settled community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the European Council of Heads of State or Government in Lisbon on 26 and 27 June 1992.  I was accompanied at the meeting by Deputy Andrews, Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State in my Department with special responsibility for European Affairs, was also part of the Irish delegation.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the meeting was concerned essentially with three issues.  First on the agenda was the financial perspective for the Community for the period 1993 to 1997.  Next, were the prospects for enlargement, with no less than seven countries &mdash; Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, Austria, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland at present applying for membership. Then, there were also political co-operation items like the situation in Central and Eastern Europe, and, in particular, the deteriorating conditions in Yugoslavia, and developments in the Middle East.  Other areas discussed included the UN Conference on Environment and Development which was held in Rio de Janeiro and the agreement by the Community and its member states to an eight-point follow-up action programme. Ireland was congratulated on the outcome of its recent referendum. The decisions of the Foreign Affairs meeting in Oslo were confirmed. These were that each country should proceed with the process of ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, respecting the timetable to ensure the entry into force of the Treaty as of 1 January 1993, that there should be no renegotiation and that the door for Danish participation remains open.</P>
      <P>At Lisbon, there was widespread acceptance that the dangers of creating an anonymous super-State must be avoided and that there must now be instead greater democracy, the citizens of Europe must be more directly involved and the identities and cultures of individual nations more fully reflected in the integration process.</P>
      <P>We want to build a socially conscious community of States that accepts difference and diversity.  The responsibility for decision-making should be kept at the appropriate level, where it is most effective, and be as close and responsive as possible to the will of the people. In other words, there should be no unnecessary centralisation or harmonisation for its own sake.  The Community should undertake only the essential tasks necessary to implement agreed common policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the underlying principles here is what is called subsidiarity, and this is to be the subject of a report by the Commission to the Summit in Edinburgh next December.  This principle of subsidiarity is now enshrined for the first time in the Maastricht Treaty, and we are <Col N="39" /> satisfied that it is defined in a way that will allow for the continued dynamic development of the Community.  But we must be vigilant against any attempt to use this principle to dilute Community competence in areas of vital interest to us and to the future development of the Union such as the Common Agricultural Policy, EC control on the level of state aids, and internal market principles.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon meeting reviewed progress towards completion of the Single Market. Indeed, we noted that over 90 per cent of the measures needed to implement the market have been adopted.  As Deputies will be aware, the Summit re-affirmed its commitment to the completion of the Single Market by 31 December 1992.</P>
    <P>We touched on such matters as the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty, the fight against drugs, on which we had a report before us from the European Committee to Combat Drugs; and we agreed with the conclusions of a Report from the &ldquo;Trevi&rdquo; Ministers and called for the preparation of a Convention to establish EUROPOL.</P>
    <P>The Council welcomed the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June and, in particular, the acceptance by the international community at the highest level of the aim of sustainable development worldwide, while protecting our precious environment.  We committed ourselves to an eight-point plan.</P>
    <P>On the GATT Uruguay Round, which is of vital importance to Ireland, the Council invited the Community negotiators to intensify the dialogue with their partners, and in particular, with the United States, to resolve the remaining differences so that overall agreement can be concluded before the end of the year. Ireland, with its interests in agriculture, and as an exporter of some 70 per cent of its output &mdash; among the highest proportions in the world &mdash; has an especially large interest in a successful outcome to these talks.  But, as the Lisbon meeting underlined, the negotiations form a whole, and success requires a substantial <Col N="40" /> and balanced result in all areas. We noted that the Community has reformed its Common Agricultural Policy on a basis that, while ensuring that the incomes of our farmers are maintained, matches supply better to demand, thus helping to stabilise markets.  We called on all parties to the Uruguay Round to show similar flexibility so that realistic and balanced solutions can be found in agriculture and so that tangible liberalisation takes place in the areas of services and access to markets.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, which have seen the collapse of communism, the Community has been looked to as a core of stability by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  The rapid changes in these countries have often been marked by vicious ethnic tensions, the collapse of regimes, the disappearance of national or regional boundaries and the collapse of public administration.  The Summit reaffirmed the Community's will to develop its partnership with the countries concerned in their efforts to restructure economies and institutions.</P>
    <P>I have had copies of the conclusions of the summit placed in the Dáil Library for reference. As Deputies will note from the document, the talks ranged even more widely than it has been possible to encompass in my brief summary.</P>
    <P>Of most immediate concern to Ireland at the Lisbon meeting, were the proposals for the financing of the Community in the period 1993 to 1997.  This, in turn, is connected with the proposals for the enlargement of the Community. The European Council in Maastricht, last December, noted that negotiations on accession to the European Union &ldquo;can start as soon as the Community has terminated its negotiations on own resources and related issues in 1992&rdquo;. This linkage is repeated in the Lisbon conclusions which note that the European Council agreed that the negotiations on accession to the union on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty can start as soon as the Community has terminated its negotiations on own resources and related issues in 1992 and the Treaty on <Col N="41" /> European Union has been ratified.  It is quite clear, therefore, that negotiations on enlargement can start only when there is final agreement on the Delors II Package.</P>
    <P>I want to stress this point because there seems to have been a view that we should have been able to come away from the Lisbon Summit with agreement on the financial perspectives for 1993 to 1997.  I never held that view.  In fact, I emphasised, time and again that all that was likely to emerge from Lisbon were guidelines for the negotiation on Delors II. After all, the countries meeting in Lisbon have still to complete their different ratification processes for the Maastricht Treaty: different countries have different concerns and different processes for ratification.  Some have referenda; some involve parliamentary action only.  But they all have this in common: they are all subject to the most difficult and sensitive debate in their home constituencies.  And the Heads of State and Government meeting in Lisbon had to take into account in their approach to all the issues before them, the views of their own parliaments and people.  By the time of the Edinburgh Summit, ratification procedures will have been completed or very considerably advanced in most member states and they will be in a better position then to reach final agreement on the proposals contained in the Delors II Package.</P>
    <P>In the event, the Summit came to a number of important conclusions.  First, they made decisions on the Cohesion Fund, which will assist projects in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece.  The fund is referred to in the Maastricht Treaty &ldquo;to provide a financial contribution to projects in the fields of environment and trans-European networks in the area of transport infrastructure&rdquo;.  The Lisbon meeting decided that this fund will be put in place early in 1993.  This is an important advance, since Article 130D of the Treaty simply provided that the fund should be set up &ldquo;before 31 December 1993&rdquo;.  Thus, Ireland should benefit from early next year from Community assistance for projects at the particularly <Col N="42" /> advantageous rates of Community aid proposed under this fund.</P>
    <P>Next, the Lisbon Council decided that the regressive nature of the current system of contribution to the Community budget will be corrected.  Again, this is a step forward since the Cohesion Protocol annexed to the Treaty referred only to examining means of such correction; now we have a commitment that there will be a correction which will take particular account of the situation of the member states with a GNP per inhabitant below 90 per cent of the Community average and will lead to some reduction in Ireland's budget contribution.  The Commission will present, in July, its report on the application of the mechanisms for correcting budgetary imbalances, which relates primarily to the UK, although Germany is also affected.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Lisbon Council concluded that the cumulated effect of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund will be an increase appropriate to reflect the Maastricht commitments.  Again, this is an advance as the Protocol on Cohesion annexed to the Treaty simply referred to a review in 1992 of the appropriate size of the Structural Funds &mdash; now we have a commitment to an appropriate increase.</P>
    <P>The Commission Paper published earlier this year, <i>From the Single Act to Maastricht and Beyond: The Means to Match Our Ambitions</i>, contains the Commission's proposals for implementing this Treaty obligation.  In it, the Commission say:</P>
    <P>Given the persistent disparities affecting the least developed regions, the Commission considers that it would be appropriate to allow a further significant increase in Structural Fund assistance &mdash; two-thirds in real terms &mdash; between 1992 and 1997.  Regions in countries covered by the Maastricht Protocol (Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain) would also qualify for assistance from the new Cohesion Fund.  This means that for these four countries together, the resources available for the regions in 1997 could rise by as much as 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> I quote this passage <i>in extenso</i> to show the basis of the proposals that the flow of Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, together, should be doubled in the period from 1993 to 1997, which figured so largely in recent debates.  The basis of the understanding is the Commission proposal: that proposal may or not be modified during its progress towards implementation, but I want to make it clear that doubling is a Commission proposal, and that is what Ireland will be seeking in the continuing negotiations.</P>
    <P>Just how seriously the Commission take the proposal can I think be gauged from a recent statement by Commission President Delors, as quoted in a profile in <i>Le Monde</i> in its issue of 27 June, and I quote:</P>
    <P>If I propose 100, it is not to obtain 40 but to obtain 100.</P>
    <P>The same message is repeated in a quotation which I take from the <i>London Times</i> of 29 June, extracted from a Commission bulletin circulated after the Lisbon European Council:</P>
    <P>It is likely that the agricultural guideline will be continued and that there will be a doubling by 1997 of the financial effort ... in the four poorer member states.</P>
    <P>I make no applogy for following the line I have set out.  Deputies will be aware that authoritative Commission estimates show that the increase in Community GNP likely to result from the completion of the internal market and from Economic and Monetary Union is in the order of 15 per cent.  The benefits of this increase will accrue to all Community countries but, on all past experience, the greater proportion of the benefit is likely to go to the countries at the Community's core.</P>
    <P>These additional benefits are likely to be a multiple, many times over, of the Commission request for additional budget funding &mdash; from 1.2 per cent to 1.37 per cent of Community GNP.  In our request for additional Structural Funds, we are not shaking the begging bowl: we are simply asking that a small share of <Col N="44" /> the extra benefit to the core countries of the Community resulting from coming economic changes, which Ireland fully and enthusiastically supports, should, through the budgetary mechanisms of the Community, be used to redress the imbalance in competitivity as between the more and less prosperous regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>These extra transfers will benefit the central states as well: if we look at the experience between 1980 and, say, 1990, in the development of trade between this country and the other countries of the Community, we can see that development, and even prosperity here can benefit those other countries.  What we buy from Britain has almost doubled in that period.  In fact, Britain is one of the few countries in the Community with which we run a balance of trade deficit.  What we buy from France has doubled, from Germany and Denmark almost trebled and from The Netherlands more than trebled.  In other words, Irish prosperity means higher trade volumes for the richer member states: they benefit and we benefit, and the Community is a more stable and cohesive entity.  This is not begging bowl politics: it is the logic of the marketplace about which we hear so often in certain circles, and it is based on specific Treaty provisions.  As a result of the Lisbon meeting we have not moved back or forward so far as action on this proposal is concerned, but we have secured significant advances on the Cohesion Fund and on the revenue side of the EC budget.</P>
    <P>On enlargement, the Council considered that the agreement on the European Economic Area entered into with the EFTA countries, has paved the way for opening negotiations with a view to an early conclusion with those countries seeking membership of the European Union.  As I said, the negotiation will be opened as soon as the Treaty on European Union is ratified and the Delors II Package agreed.  The basis for the negotiation will be that the applicant countries will join a Community with new characteristics, on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty: it will have completed a <Col N="45" /> Single Market, without internal frontiers; it will have created the European Union; Economic and Monetary Union, with the move to a single currency, will be well underway and there will be a common foreign and security policy, as defined in Maastricht.  The accession of the EFTA countries will mean an internal market of 380 million people, held together by common rules of trade, policy and monetary discipline.  It will be the largest single trading block in the world: its basic objective will be peace; and it will be anchored firmly in the principles of democracy and the rule of law.  They bring with them a diversity of culture and traditions.</P>
    <P>An important decision taken by the European Council in Lisbon, after consultation with the President and the Enlarged Bureau of the European Parliament, was to renew the mandate of Mr. Jacques Delors as President of the Commission.  This was a decision I favoured and strongly supported, as Mr. Delors has given outstanding leadership in the process of European integration which has acquired a new dynamism since he first took office at the beginning of 1985.  He has also shown himself to be a true friend of Ireland who has constantly sought to safeguard and promote the interests of the smaller member states within the Community.</P>
    <P>Mr. Delors' new term is for two years, pursuant to the changes in the Maastricht Treaty that aim to make the terms of the Commission and of the European Parliament broadly parallel.  In this context, it will be necessary for the Government to nominate the Irish person for appointment as a member of the Commission by the Governments of the member states.  There will be no undue delay in making this nomination, but the matter will have to be considered by the Government, following the recent renomination of President Delors.</P>
    <P>We had an extensive and detailed discussion on the deteriorating situation in Yugoslavia.  The conclusions and annexed declarations set out the Summit's agreed approach to the issue, and to other international questions such as <Col N="46" /> the Middle East peace negotiations, developments in South Africa, the Community's relations with the Maghreb countries of North Africa, and with developing countries generally, and the forthcoming CSCE Summit in Helsinki.</P>
    <P>Yugoslavia was a matter of particular concern.  The House will be aware that the Community has for the past year been actively engaged in efforts to bring an end to this tragic conflict on our own continent, through a Peace Conference, negotiated ceasefires, the Monitor Mission and support for action by the United Nations.  I want to pay tribute to the Irish personnel who are giving such distinguished service to the EC Monitor Mission and to the UN force in Yugoslavia. There have been some successes, particularly in Slovenia and Croatia.</P>
    <P>The European Council could not ignore the appalling plight of the people of Sarajevo who have suffered for months without food, water or electricity and have been subject to constant shelling from heavy artillery.  Although no party to the conflict can escape blame, by far the greatest share of responsibility falls on the Serbian leadership and the Yugoslav army which it controls.  The European Council focused especially on the immediate need to reopen Sarajevo airport to enable food and medicines to get through.  We proposed that the UN Security Council should urgently take the measures necessary to open the airport and to deliver humanitarian assistance to the city and neighbouring areas.  The Community and its member states declared themselves ready to co-operate in this effort.</P>
    <P>While everyone wishes and hopes that these humanitarian objectives can be achieved by peaceful means, the European Council did not include support for the use of military means by the United Nations.  Ireland was to the front in ensuring that support for any action of a military kind that might be necessary should be in the framework of the United Nations.  We proposed and secured, significant amendments to the Declaration which make this clear, and which were described as &ldquo;ingenious&rdquo; by another delegation. <Col N="47" /> I also proposed that the Troika of Foreign Ministers led by Mr. Douglas Hurd representing the new EC Presidency should visit Yugoslavia at an early date, which was also accepted.  It was and is my hope that military action by the UN will not be necessary.</P>
    <P>Since the meeting of the European Council the signs are encouraging.  Serbian forces have withdrawn from the airport and have begun to place their heavy weaponry under the supervision of the UN.  The Security Council has agreed to deploy a peacekeeping force to secure the airport.  The first consignments of food and medicines have been delivered.</P>
    <P>I hope that the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo signals an end to the violence and bloodshed in Bosnia and that the parties to the Yugoslav conflict will now co-operate fully with the UN and resume serious negotiations in the Community's Peace Conference chaired by Lord Carrington. In this connection I salute the courage and initiative of President Mitterrand of France in visiting Sarajevo immediately after the European Council, which had an important and beneficial psychological effect on the situation.</P>
    <P>The European Council expressed its deep concern at the recent violence in South Africa and its shock at the massacre on 17 June in Boipalong.  There is an absolute need to ensure effective control of the police and security forces in South Africa, and this will be taken up by the ministerial Troika of the Community when they visit South Africa in the near future.  Ireland very much supports this. We want to see the conditions created which would enable all the parties to resume negotiations to ensure a peaceful transition towards a democratic and nonracial South Africa.  It is vital not to lose the progress already made.</P>
    <P>Finally I draw the attention of the House to the adoption by the European Council of a report prepared by Foreign Ministers which identifies areas open to joint action by the European Union <i>vis-à-vis</i> particular countries or groups of countries.  This report, which was called for at Maastricht, is annexed to the Council's <Col N="48" /> Conclusions.  It outlines how joint action might be applied &mdash; when the Maastricht Treaty comes into effect &mdash; in the European Union's relation with Central and Eastern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.  The Foreign Ministers have been asked to continue their preparatory work of defining the basic elements of the union's policy by the date of entry into force of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The domains within the security dimension, which may form the object of joint action; the CSCE process; disarmament and arms control in Europe, including confidence-building measures; nuclear non-proliferation; and the economic aspects of security, especially exports of arms and technology to third countries; are all subjects which we are happy to see discussed by the union.  Most of them have been major preoccupations of Irish foreign policy, and they deal with security in the broadest sense of the term. We are very glad that the Common Foreign and Security Policy should start out in the area of security with these agenda items, and it augurs well for the character and tone of such a policy in the future in contributing to a more peaceful world. The House will note that the report repeats the language of the European Union Treaty included at Ireland's behest to the effect that the policy of the union shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policies of certain member states, a recognition that we are not and do not have to be members of any existing military alliance.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity, in the margins of the meeting, to meet the British Prime Minister.  Our discussions covered the European Council meeting, the British Presidency of the Community, which commenced yesterday, and the round-table talks about Northern Ireland.  We reviewed the talks process to date and the current situation.  I indicated that the Government's agreement to the meeting held earlier this week in Strand Three formation was on the basis that it would help clear the way for Strand Two to commence in line with the statement of 26 March 1991 by the then Secretary of <Col N="49" /> State for Northern Ireland.  We agreed to monitor the process closely and to maintain contact, including a further bilateral meeting in Dublin later this year.</P>
    <P>This was the first European Council I have attended as Taoiseach and I look back on it with some satisfaction.  Irish interests were promoted and defended both with vigour and with some success in the face of considerable pressure.  The outcome should not be measured against the results that we are ultimately looking for, but judged as a stage of the process during which some progress was made in firming up the commitments made at Maastricht, while recognising that the Structural Funds continue to the end of 1993.  As a result, we can look forward to a significant increase in EC funding next year.  I also made a contribution to the wider agenda, in particular the sending of a peace mission to Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>I would like to convey my thanks to the Portuguese Prime Minister and his administration for the courtesy extended to us at all times during the meeting and for the excellence of the arrangements, which ensured that negotiations which were often tense and difficult, were eased to their conclusion with maximum patience and flexibility.  I look forward to a continuation of the discussions and to decisions on the outstanding items at or before the Edinburgh Summit, later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Taoiseach's enthusiasm with regard to the Lisbon Summit.  That Summit represents a lost opportunity, an opportunity for the Heads of Government to spell out the process towards monetary union, to examine the impact of expansion on the Community, to address the issues of democracy and accountability that are not addressed in the Maastricht Treaty, to critically assess the requirements of a common foreign security policy and, lastly, to put the financing of the Community on a firm footing.  It seems that the European Governments have finally woken up to the fact that since the Single European Act the people of Europe have <Col N="50" /> been unclear as to what European unity means.  We should remember that one of the objectives of the Single European Act was to establish a people's Europe, a Europe more relevant to all its people, one with which they could freely identify and of which they could feel part.</P>
      <P>It is clear from reports from the various member states that the people are unhappy with the manner in which the Governments are excluding them from debate and discussion on the question of European Union.  That was quite clear here during the time of the referendum and it is obviously a view also held in Denmark.  There has been a distinct lack of openness in this Government's approach to our participation in Europe. We have continually called in this House for more debates on European affairs. We continually asked to have the Maastricht Treaty debated here before the White Paper was finally published a few short weeks before the referendum took place, but the Government sinisterly ignored our request in that regard.  The last few years should have been used to promote public debates, to provide information and to prepare the country for the challenges and opportunities provided by European Union.</P>
      <P>Since ratification of the Single European Act the road to European union was clear.  The task of the Government was to prepare the ground for our full participation in that process.  What the Government should have been doing was acknowledging the challenges and difficulties and formulating national strategy to minimise difficulties and to maximise the opportunities that undoubtedly exist for business in this country with a market of 320 million people.  In the last two years since discussions commenced on Maastricht they have not done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that the buzzword of this Summit &mdash;&ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;&mdash; relates to handing back to the people the power to make decisions at the most appropriate local level.  It does not appear from what the Taoiseach said in his speech or indeed from what he said this morning that he understands what subsidiarity means.  It <Col N="51" /> does not merely mean that Brussels delegates power back to national governments. It means the delegation of power to regional and local level within each member state.  In an interview published yesterday the incoming President of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Douglas Hurd, described subsidiarity as minimum interference from Brussels.  The concept of subsidiarity does not stop at the shores of Ireland.  It must also be applied within Ireland.  There must be the minimum of interference from Dublin in the affairs of Cork, Galway, Donegal and other regions of the country.</P>
    <P>The whole question of regional decision-making and planning will be very important in a more integrated Community.  Indeed, the Community cannot be held together unless the role of the regions is promoted and powers are clearly delegated to them.</P>
    <P>It would make a great deal more sense if Structural Funds were allocated on a regional basis with the responsibility for their application and spending being agreed locally.  I hope that in the next term the Government will bring forward measures to allow that to happen as was intended by the Maastricht Treaty and is wished by the people because that will promote a sense of responsibility as well as a sense of participation at local level.  If European Union is to succeed after the Maastricht Treaty has been ratified there must be a delegation of powers to the regions.</P>
    <P>These issues should have been discussed in the campaign leading up to the referendum.  The Structural Funds are a particularly useful mechanism for the practice of subsidiarity.  Perhaps the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when replying, will say how the Government intend to put subsidiarity into practice here and what they define as an appropriate increase in the Maastricht Treaty commitment to cohesion, because that is not clear from the Taoiseach's speech this morning.</P>
    <P>The Summit was not a success in economic terms.  The Taoiseach did not <Col N="52" /> achieve a doubling of the Structural Funds.  The Government's faulty expediency of emphasising the economic benefits in general, and the £6 billion in particular, their under emphasis of economic opportunities, their complete neglect of issues such as Europe's role in world affairs and the wider issues of social and cultural policy, demonstrates Fianna Fáil's lack of broad objectives for Ireland in Europe and their total lack of any interest in Europe except for the amount of money it brings in.  It is clear that they have no national strategy with regard to our participation in Europe nor have they any real commitment to the evolution of European Union.  It is unlikely that the post-Maastricht Treaty figure of £6 billion for the Structural Funds will be forthcoming if Mr. Kohl's and Mr. Major's attitude at Lisbon is to be taken as a guide.  The vague promise of appropriate increase is hardly reassuring.  The Taoiseach's optimism in this regard is misplaced.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we need to approach this issue in a different manner.  We need to show how we use Structural Funds constructively and effectively, while also assessing what return we have got in the past.  The responsibility is on two sides &mdash; if we are pushing hard for and making the case for the doubling of the funds, we must demonstrate that we use the funds to maximum benefit and return.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Cohesion Fund will be an important means for our future expansion and growth.  It is difficult to talk about cohesion unless there is a concrete figure available.  We need to formulate policies that can maximise the benefit of a substantial transfer of resources from the Community to the Irish Exchequer not to cover up a budget deficit or to make budget figures easier for 1993 for the Government but with the intention for which they are designed, to bring the poor regions up to the level of the richer central countries.</P>
    <P>We must also look at our industrial, fiscal and educational policies to see how we are doing, or not doing, and why we are performing relatively poorly compared to our European counterparts.  Dr. <Col N="53" /> Kieran Kennedy of the ESRI suggested in a recent paper that the key influence on our well being is the way the economy is run and the success of both private and public sectors.  It is not a question of how much we get from the European Community, we must examine our own policies and how we use EC money.</P>
    <P>The Summit conclusions are generally long on rhetoric and short on specifics or decisions.  There are many issues and questions that arise following Maastricht that the Summit seems to have addressed in a superficial way.  For instance, there was no further exposition of the issues and policies arising from monetary union.  The Summit did not address itself to the reality of the inadequacy of democratic control of decision-making in the Community.  The people of Denmark, and indeed France, Germany and Britain have underlined their unease in this regard.  We should too.</P>
    <P>We do not have a committee on European affairs or foreign affairs and we do not have adequate debate in this House before decision are made by the Council of Ministers.  There is a huge level of suspicion among politicians and people in general that decisions are being taken behind closed doors.  Our only knowledge of those decisions is when they affect us as a result of Government regulations and directions.  If there is to be genuine European Union, if we are going to expand that union to incorporate other member states in the future, the method by which we convey decision-making to the people from the Commission and the Council of Ministers must be clearly looked at and every step must be transparent to all the people who will be affected by these decisions.  That has not been done in the past 20 years, and we all bear some responsibility for that.  If we go on in the same way for the next 20 years we will not create European union. We will break up the gathering of countries there at the moment.</P>
    <P>There was not any reference by the Taoiseach to the Irish Government's view on the democratic deficit.  How will that be tackled and what would the Government cite as the locus of power <Col N="54" /> and decision-making?  Do the Government see the Parliament, the Council, the Commission or this House as being the important part in that?  The problem of democratic accountability and control will be exacerbated by enlargement of the Community.  Unless we tackle this issue head on there is a danger that the legitimacy of European institutions will come into question.  These are issues that could and should have been addressed in the past five years.  They were not addressed at Maastricht.  There is no point in doubling the number of countries in the Community, of adding even the EFTA countries that may apply for membership in the next 12 months, unless we overhaul the decision-making process in the Community.  Otherwise, the people of Europe will not follow and will only be suspicious of what is being done at the centre rather than feeling part of the movement towards the worthwhile goal of European union.</P>
    <P>A European/Foreign Affairs Committee of the Oireachtas could have provided the starting point for a debate on the issues of central importance to the future development of the Community. This committee has been promised for about two years.  I hope it will be set up before the House adjourns so that a meeting can be held in August and another in September.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, in relation to enlargement of the Community, that he will veto any enlargement until adequate funds for cohesion are in place.  Yesterday in the same article to which I referred the British Presidency say that negotiation on enlargement will commence in 1993 and that preliminary work can go ahead this year.  If the Taoiseach really means to use the veto in relation to funds, he should insist that work on enlargement is not done until the matter of funds are cleared up.  Otherwise the enlargement process may achieve a momentum that it will be impossible to stop.  If the Taoiseach is serious about using the veto he should insist that work is not done at this stage.  If the Taoiseach is not serious about using it, he should not have threatened it.  A threat like that <Col N="55" /> must be used.  The Taoiseach should convey to the Presidency that work on enlargement should not be done until he is satisfied as to amount of resources that will be available to the structural and cohesion funds.</P>
    <P>The crucial question of the role of the various institutions was not tackled in Maastricht.  What will be the role of the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers in the future?  Where will the locus of decision-making be and how will the crucial notion of accountability be met &mdash; 1 made this point earlier. These questions will be even more difficult and urgent in an expanded European Community.  There has been some suggestion of an eventual differentiation between the roles and powers of large and small states.  This would go against the spirit of the Community which envisaged the participation of all member states as equals.  And it is a matter that should not be left to chance &mdash; the smaller member states must preserve their right to appoint commissioners.</P>
    <P>On the question of a common foreign and security policy the Summit stated many general aims some of which the Taoiseach repeated this morning. However, in the report to the Summit on enlargement, the External Affairs Commissioner, Mr. Andriessen, underlined the need for new members to accept the committment to a common foreign and security policy and ultimately a common defence policy contained in the Maastricht Treaty.  Instead of dodging this issue as they have done in the past the Government should initiate a serious and constructive debate on the options facing us in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the pre-referendum campaign the Government, correctly, made the point that a common defence policy is not part of the Maastricht Treaty.  However, the intention to develop a common defence policy is, and this matter will be discussed by member states in 1996.  The question of neutrality is a difficult and complex one &mdash; it has been a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy for so many years.  The Government cannot ignore this issue, it <Col N="56" /> needs to be discussed and the options spelled out between now and 1996, and not in 1996.  The Government have a responsibility to initiate this debate.  The people must have all the facts before they make a choice.  Indeed, this House should be given an undertaking that the Government will not change our status at Western European Union from observers to participants without consulting the House.</P>
    <P>I now ask the Taoiseach to give that undertaking.  At present we have observer status and if a status is to be changed, this can only be done after this House has had the opportunity to discuss it.  It is not clear in what capacity the Government representatives attended the last few meetings and the Dáil has not had a report on what actually happened. Perhaps the Minister would clarify this matter in his concluding speech and tell us who attended, whether it was he, his Minister of State or a civil servant, and what was discussed at the meeting.  The achievement of a common foreign and security policy among the Twelve with different historic backgrounds and diverse historic political priorities will be difficult.  The problem will be exacerbated by individual initiatives such as President Mitterrand's visit to Sarajevo just 24 hours after participating in a summit where the need for a common approach was underlined.  Like the Taoiseach, I applaud his courage in going there but it is regrettable that he should do so without telling any of his co-signatories about his proposed initiative. That does not augur well for building a common foreign and security policy in the future.  The member states will need to decide whether they favour inter-governmentalism or superanationalism. This is an area that warrants examination in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>The Summit conclusions welcome the results of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro.  This is an area that is important for Europe.  We now realise that global co-operation on the environment is essential for preservation and progress in this area.  There is a need for <Col N="57" /> public awareness and commitment in this area and the Government need to mobilise support through debate and discussion.  Attending the Rio de Janeiro conference is not sufficient, there must be an active follow-through on the ground involving the Government, Members of this House and the general public.</P>
    <P>The summit conclusions also refer to the need for a swift conclusion to the Uruguay Round of the GATT talks.  It is regrettable that there has been a lack of discussion of issues other than agriculture in Ireland.  In the main the Taoiseach's speech this morning referred to agriculture, although he referred to other matters in a peripheral way.  The question of access for our international services to other countries is important to Ireland.  I have made the point in this House on a number of occasions that the Government seem unconcerned and unaware of the potential of this area.  This is another area where a Government White Paper could have promised public discussion and debate.  It is not too late for the Government to publish a White Paper in this regard outlining the benefits for industry and services as well as the dangers for our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>The European Community is the first supra-national structure committed to peace.  Its ability to develop is based on more than trade; it is based on shared objectives and a commitment to liberal democracy.  Our best hope for the future lies in our participation in the European Community and the evolution towards European Union.  However, our participation must not be as passive beneficiaries but as positive and dynamic members who have something to contribute to the achievement of the European ideal.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say something about the Taoiseach's meeting in Lisbon with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major. The meeting appears to have been responsible for Monday's London meeting to set the agenda for what has become known as Strand Three of the talks to go ahead.  If this is so, then I welcome the fact that the meeting in Lisbon took place.  We should keep in mind what <Col N="58" /> these talks are about &mdash; we are in danger of losing sight of the wood while we concentrate on the trees.  After 23 years of violence, after nearly 3,000 deaths, after millions of pounds worth of damage to property, then all our priority must be peace.  And last night's murders &mdash; and that is what they were &mdash; brings hideously home to us yet again the importance of finding a political solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  This morning another three families are mourning the deaths of these young men who died fifty years before their normal span of life should have expired.</P>
    <P>The talks are important; they are a positive development that hold the prospect of achieving harmony between the communities of Northern Ireland, between both parts of this island, and stability and normality in relationships between Britain and Ireland.  I am particularly pleased that a date has been fixed for the meeting of Strand Two, as I believe that the most difficult part of talks are going to be in this strand.  But the temptation to use words like &ldquo;historic&rdquo; and &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; should be resisted, though it is understandable that these words are used.  What is needed is head-down hard work that will bring about the establishment of structures in Northern Ireland that will be capable of attracting the loyalty and support of both communities, because if that can be achieved then we will see an end to violence and that will be a breakthrough and historic in the fullest sense.</P>

      <P>From Ireland's perspective, the Lisbon Summit was not very successful.  Whenever one of the member states needs to threaten to use the veto, or actually uses it, the process of consensus has broken down.  When it is one of the smaller and more peripheral states that needs to threaten to use the veto, it can usually be assumed that all of the weaker states feel threatened.  Sadly that was the principal feature of the Lisbon Summit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago Ireland was the hero of Europe toasted with champagne in all the comfortable places where Eurocrats <Col N="59" /> and Europhiles congregate.  A couple of weeks later we are told that it is time to re-discover our place in the scheme of things.  Our legitimate demands are based on an already made European commitment to narrow the gap between richer and poorer states.  Those legitimate demands have been put into a very poor second place.  We have been told that we must wait until rows between the richer states about the size of the Community budget have been sorted out.</P>
    <P>What all that means is that the Taoiseach and the Government face an uphill battle if they are to deliver on the one promise on which they sold the Maastricht Treaty to the people of Ireland. Ireland voted for Maastricht principally because the people accepted that the £6 billion promised again and again by the Taoiseach would be a major contribution to improved living standards here, and to an equalisation of living standards throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It will not do for the Taoiseach to say to the Irish people now that he is doing his best, and that even through it is a tough struggle, he is hopeful of getting something in the end.  This is not about getting as many of the crumbs as the richer states are prepared to give away. It is not about going to Europe with cap in hand, hoping that they will find it in their hearts to give us a few bob for marginal constituencies.</P>
    <P>What is involved in the continuing negotiations about Cohesion Funds and Structural Funds is a fundamental principle. The issue is nothing less than the kind of Europe that will be developed in the future.  A European union cannot be built on the cheap.  It involves a total and absolute commitment to equality between citizens, regions and communities. That commitment was not evident in the response of the richer member states at the Lisbon Summit.</P>
    <P>In other ways, too, the Lisbon Summit showed how fragile and cumbersome the process of European union can be.  Faced with the continuing devastation and horror of Yugoslavia, the Community felt itself hidebound by procedure.  While</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I accept fully that the Irish delegation was right to insist on a role for the United Nations rather than the Western European Union, it seems clear that the Summit as a whole became bogged down in confusion between a military response and the much more essential and urgent humanitarian response.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I believe that the whole of Europe owes a considerable debt of gratitude to President Mitterrand of France, who immediately after the Summit, took a courageous and, indeed, audacious personal initiative in flying directly to Sarajevo.  I know that there was a good deal of muttering among officials and Ministers left behind, but the urgency of the situation in Yugoslavia simply did not allow for the leisurely approach that was being taken at the level of the Community.</P>
    <P>The net effect of President Mitterrand's mission has been to secure a breakthrough.  Although, clearly, the situation in Yugoslavia remains fraught and dangerous, there are signs that with every day that has passed since his trip, the United Nations effort is gaining in strength and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Most of the other issues addressed by the Summit will require a great deal more development during the United Kingdom Presidency, which will culminate with a further Summit in Edinburgh at the end of this year.  That Summit will be the acid test for cohesion.  If agreement is not reached then, we will seriously have to question the value of the process of European Union.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would reiterate in the course of this debate a call that I have made several times before.  We share common ground with other peripheral states &mdash; with Spain, Portugal, Greece, and other poorer regions of the Community. That common ground was not in evidence in Lisbon, and I can only assume that one of the reasons it was not was because little or no work was done by our Government, and particularly by our Department of Foreign Affairs, in forging the kind of alliance that is absolutely necessary if richer states are to take the poorer states seriously.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> I believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should be on a permanent mission for the next six months to ensure that the peripheral regions of Europe will speak with one voice in Edinburgh, and that it will be a militant voice, demanding that Europe takes its own ideals seriously.  If the ideal of properly shared prosperity is to be put on a back burner, then the principle of European Union is on the back burner at the same time.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in this debate about how we in Ireland must continue to address the issues that arose during the Maastricht Treaty referendum campaign. Political leadership in Ireland &mdash; especially those political leaders who signed their name to a joint statement &mdash; must accept solemn responsibility to address those issues.</P>
    <P>On 18 June last, the electorate in Ireland showed very decisively that it wanted to continue the European process. However, many of those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; had reservations.  Many of those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; also wanted to continue the European process, but felt that there were serious unanswered or inadequately answered questions, which meant that on balance they had to vote against what was on offer as the Maastricht package. For whatever reason, a large proportion of those that usually vote did not vote.  If one puts those factors together, what it means is that the vote on 18 June did not close the debate &mdash; it merely served as a starter on a serious debate in relation to our participation in Europe.  In the aftermath of the referendum campaign, we have to face the fact, however unpalatable it may be, that the Irish economy upon which we depend is both small and vulnerable.</P>
    <P>We are more dependent on external trade than any other country in Western Europe.  Access to and regulation of our external markets, the creation of an economic, commercial and monetary union, which provide a genuinely level playing pitch, are vital if we are to achieve our economic objectives.</P>
    <P>We must have no illusions about the obstacles we face.  We operate in a global community which is fundamentally hostile <Col N="62" /> to small nations.  Whatever national pride might lead us to want to believe, ours is not a fully blown, self sufficient national economy comparable say to Britain or France.  Ours is essentially a disadvantaged, regional economy on the edge of one of the largest economic concentrations in the world.</P>
    <P>To survive and to assert our practical sovereignty in such a world, the only ultimate resources on which we can rely are our will to be a national community, our capacity to understand the system, to use it to promote our aspirations and needs, and to find and co-operate very closely with appropriate and natural allies.  Information, measured and intelligent debate, a clear understanding of the issues and the options available, are more important to us than to any other European people.</P>
    <P>We must accustom ourselves to a new kind of politics in which there is no longer any clear dividing line between real Irish domestic political issues, and slightly irrelevant unreal European external politics. Policy and decisions are no longer taken in Ireland alone, but in European fora in conjunction with our other European colleagues.  The Council for the Status of Women know this.  Trade unions, farmers, and business organisations know it.  It is time that the political system and the community at large got to grips with it as well.</P>
    <P>The debate which will continue is of crucial importance to us in Ireland.  It will deal either directly or indirectly with issues of immense domestic significance to us.  These issues include, how can we counter and change the trend towards a potentially very undemocratic and centralised concentration of economic and political power; how do we counter the efforts which are being made by some member Governments to demolish some aspects of the Community which are most important for small countries; what is to be the role of small countries in Europe, and how are their legitimate demands for recognition and subsidiarity to be met; what real political commitment exists at European level to the unemployed, the poor and the handicapped; what guarantees <Col N="63" /> will there be to protect, cherish and enhance the cultural identity and diversity which is a fundamental factor in the social and political health of communities; what future security arrangements will be necessary &mdash; and what will not be necessary and what will be the impact of the enlargement of the Community on the Community as a whole &mdash; and on Ireland's ability to influence the evolution of Community policies?</P>
    <P>If, as I strongly believe, the theory underlying the European process is the creation of democratic, just and constitutional structures, in a world which is deeply undemocratic, unjust, arbitrary and unstable, how do we implement this theory within a Community which is governed by so many conflicting interests?</P>
    <P>I was forcibly struck during the referendum campaign by the degree to which many young people are suspicious of, or even hostile to the European Community. Much of this is due to the fact that we have come to take the Community for granted, that we know little or care less of its origins, that we have forgotten or never experienced the fratricidal jungle which it has attempted to replace, that much of its success has been based upon very technical, very methodical, very bureaucratic &mdash; and sometimes extremely boring &mdash; hard work. Until the Maastricht Treaty debate suddenly came to life a few weeks ago, the EC was for many people a total switch-off.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that I proposed on Sunday 21 June &mdash; after the referendum &mdash; that serious consideration should be given to the establishment of a nation-wide council on Europe, which would be chaired by the President of Ireland.  I would like to reiterate that proposal here.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal a major consultative council would be established by law to examine all the areas of our economy, society and environment which will be affected by the European process.</P>
    <P>The council we have in mind would derive significant authority from the fact that it would be chaired by the President <Col N="64" /> of Ireland.  There is no constitutional barrier to this, provided the council is established by law &mdash; under Article 12 of the Constitution, the President &ldquo;shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We would see the Presidential council as being very broadly based.  It should be capable of interacting, on an information and consultation basis, with Government and with specialist agencies in the public sector, such as NESC and the ESRI.</P>
    <P>It should also involve the social partners, women's groups, environmentalists, community activists, the relevant Oireachtas Committees, welfare groups, and persons and groups promoting rights.  In other words, the Presidential council should be a mechanism for forging the broadest possible base of support for a coherent approach to all the issues that we will have to deal with in the future.</P>
    <P>I have already said that those challenges will confront us at two levels.  First, across a range of policy areas, we will have to address the changes we need to make domestically.  Our economy, and especially its trading sectors, will have to be a great deal more efficient and competitive.  There will have to be a new emphasis on quality and reliability, and a new model of social partnership will have to be developed to deliver that, in the interests of both sides of industry &mdash; employers and employees alike.</P>
    <P>In addition, even as we continue to fight for extra funds, we must now begin to address the ways in which we can take advantage of extra Community funding to put policies in place which enable us to catch up on living standards throughout the Community.  No one could argue but that we have always used Community support in the wisest possible way in the past, and if we are to make the most of that support now we need to develop a consensus that involves the whole community here.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we need as a nation to decide for ourselves how we can best contribute to the debate in the rest of Europe.  There is a host of issues which are being intensively <Col N="65" /> debated in Europe but which have been largely ignored here.  The environment; enlargement of the Community; relations between the Community and the rest of the world, especially the Third World; the debate between militarism and peace &mdash; in all these areas and more we need to develop coherent positions, and to do so openly and in the light of public debate.  There must be no more secrecy and no other arrangement presented as a <i>fait accompli</i> to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that a broad-based approach, which would positively exploit the prestige and authority of the Office of President of Ireland, would not only be a fitting way to expand the role of that office &mdash; something which is long overdue &mdash; but would also contribute positively to a much greater degree of understanding of European issues and commitment to the best of the European ideal.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht debate was about Ireland making its way in the world, with our eyes wide open to future opportunities and challenges.  Instead of deciding that that debate is over, now is the time to widen and deepen it.  That is why we have put forward this proposal, which we believe will attract the support of people right across the community.</P>
    <P>Next Wednesday the President will address both Houses of the Oireachtas on the subject of Ireland's identity in Europe.  I see that as a positive and welcome development and I hope very much that it will be the first step in the process of enlarging the debate about Europe.</P>
    <P>In the Taoiseach's contribution we were told of the challenges and the complexities facing the Irish Government in their continuing participation within the European process.  I would say to the Taoiseach that one of the most important aspects of developing a democratic Europe is that we are participating in that democracy.  We have to address the agenda.  It is an extremely complex agenda, and this House to date has not been properly equipped to make the contribution that Members of the House should make.  In that respect, I would say that the sooner we have a committee <Col N="66" /> on foreign affairs and a committee on European affairs the better it will be for our participation, because one of the lessons we must have learnt from the recent referendum was the basic lack of information and lack of participation by the public at large in the debate on the European process.  It behoves all of us as politicians, as people involved in public life in this country, to ensure that the Irish community is allowed and assisted in the debate that will take place.</P>
    <P>There are many extremely complex issues that have to be decided.  Lisbon is part of that process.  Many avenues have to be travelled and many roads have to be travelled but I would say that if the Lisbon Summit has shown us anything it has demonstrated, just as the Maastricht debate did, that we have a lot of work to do, and I mean all of us in the House. Rather than recriminate or seek to make scapegoats as a result of the inadequate progress made in Lisbon, I should like to believe that it would be possible for us to move forward in the European context on a broader consensus and understanding between the parties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement referred to his meetings with the British Prime Minister. Obviously, the whole question of Northern Ireland is very much part of the debate between this country and our European partners.  Certainly one's good wishes are with the Government in their efforts to bring along the dialogue and the discussions taking place.  Nobody would underestimate the size and the scale of the task confronting the Irish people in our collective efforts to bring about peace and reconciliation on this island but it behoves all of us to make a positive contribution to that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lisbon European Council expressed a determination to press ahead with European construction in the spirit of the Treaty of European Union.  Agreement was reached on political guidelines reflecting the Council's determination to maintain the impetus for developing the Community's work internally and externally throughout the coming decisive <Col N="67" /> period.  For my part, I should like to concentrate on the outcome of the Summit in relation to the future financing of the Community.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the future financing of the Community was one of the main items discussed at the European Council.  That was based on the Delors II package, which was put forward earlier this year by the Commission.  Deputies will recall that that package of proposals, made in February 1992, covers the outlook for Community expenditure for the five years 1993 to 1997 and the accompanying increase in the Own Resources (Revenue) ceiling from 1.2 per cent of Community GNP now to 1.37 per cent in 1997.</P>
      <P>The essentials of the Commission proposals were as follows.  The agricultural guideline would continue, but would be increased to take account of the cost of the then proposed reform measures. There would be an overall increase in 1997 compared with 1992 in structural operations &mdash; the Structural Fund and the new Cohesion Fund &mdash; of 11 billion ECU.  This would allow the provisions for the less developed regions, the Objective 1 regions, to increase by 67 per cent. However, the new Cohesion Fund for Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland would bring the increase in provisions for those four countries taken as a whole up to 100 per cent &mdash; a doubling in real terms.  The rest of the Structural Fund provision would increase by about 48 per cent.  There would be significant increases in other areas such as research, external policies, miscellaneous internal policies and administration.  On the revenue side of the budget, there would be a number of changes designed to make the system more equitable: the VAT element of own resources would be reduced from 1.4 per cent to a 1 per cent levy and the VAT base would be capped at 50 per cent of GNP rather than the present 55 per cent. That would benefit member states, including Ireland, whose VAT base is more than 50 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issues for Ireland in the debate are the Structural and Cohesion <Col N="68" /> expenditures and the rate of growth of overall expenditure.  There has been considerable opposition to the proposed rate of increase in overall expenditure and consequently in the own resources ceiling, with a number of countries seeking to have a lower level of increase and &mdash; or a longer phasing in period.  In this context, it has not so far been possible to get agreement to the proposals for the doubling of funds for the four cohesion countries as a whole, taking the increases in Structural Fund and the new Cohesion Fund together.  Ireland's position is that the ceiling must be adequate to meet the expenditure needs of the Community and that a substantial increase in funding for the less prosperous countries is fully justified.</P>
    <P>Ireland's objective at the Lisbon European Council was to seek progress on the package as a whole but particularly on the cohesion aspects.  As had been expected, final decisions on the Delors II package were not reached at Lisbon.  This was left to the European Council in Edinburgh in early December.</P>
    <P>However, substantial progress was made in a number of areas.  In particular, the following should be noted: The European Council re-affirmed that economic and social cohesion represent an essential dimension of the Community and that the principle laid down in 1988 should be maintained and their application simplified. The Council agreed that the new Cohesion Fund will be put in place early in 1993, whereas the Maastricht Treaty referred only to it operating before the end of 1993.  The Cohesion Fund is intended to assist projects in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece in the environment area and in the transport aspects of trans-European networks.</P>
    <P>The Council made it clear that the cumulative effect of the Structural Fund and the Cohesion Fund will be an increase appropriate to reflect the Maastricht commitments.</P>
    <P>The Council stressed that, in implementing the correction of the regressive nature of the current revenue own resources system of the Community budget, particular account will be taken <Col N="69" /> of the situation in the less properous member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>On agricultural expenditure, the Council warmly welcomed the recent agreement on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The reform is very significant for the Community and provides for control of production while guaranteeing the income of the farming community in the coming years.  The Council confirmed that the financial resources to maintain this policy would be provided, and accepted the Commission view that the reform could be achieved within the existing ceiling or guideline for agricultural expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Council also accepted the view, expressed by a number of member states, including Ireland, that measures to improve the competitiveness of European industry must include the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises to participate actively in the research programmes of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Council recognised the importance of good and harmonious relations between the institutions of the Community and agreed in principle that the 1988 Inter-Institutional Agreement on Budgetary Discipline should be renewed. This agreement incorporated the results of the Delors I package of proposals for the Community Budget for 1988 to 1992. The aim would be to ensure that the success achieved under the present agreement will be built on during the period of the new budgetary framework to be put in place at Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>It was not possible at the Lisbon meeting to go further and determine the level of actual increase in overall Community expenditure or in cohesion expenditure because a number of member states were not yet in a position to commit themselves. This was due to a certain extent to domestic considerations such as progress on ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Overall the Lisbon European Council was an interim stage in the discussions on the Delors II package, and negotiations have now entered the crucial stage.  The Council Conclusions make it clear that decisions will be reached on the various <Col N="70" /> components of the Delors II package at Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>Agreement was reached at Lisbon that the new Cohesion Fund will be put in place early next year, and the Commission have proposed that a total of 10 billion ECU should be provided for this fund over the five years from 1993-97. The question of the size of the fund remains to be decided in the context of the negotiations under the Delors II package.  We will be arguing strongly for an allocation of at least the scale proposed by the Commission, and the Government will be seeking to maximise Ireland's share of the funds.</P>
    <P>The Cohesion Fund will support expenditures in the areas of transport and the environment.  Aid rates of 85 per cent to 90 per cent are expected.  On the transport side eligible investments will be in the area of trans-European networks and such possible areas as could benefit from funding will include strategic investments in roads, rail and ports.  On the environment side aid will be provided for expenditures necessitated by Community legislation.</P>
    <P>The availability of this new fund will enable us to undertake essential investments in the coming years without imposing an unacceptable burden on national expenditure.  Details of the operation of the fund will be worked out over the coming months as the Council considers the regulations for the new fund.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations Ireland has emphasised the important role the existing Structural Funds have played in modernising the Irish economy.  We will continue to emphasise this point to our European partners in the coming months and to use the evidence of progress achieved so far as justification for the increases we are seeking for the future under the Delors II package.  We recognise the importance of evaluation of the impact of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In partnership with the Commission the Government are devoting considerable resources to management, monitoring and evaluation.  While there is a limit to the extent to which it is <Col N="71" /> possible to establish the full impact of the funds at this stage of implementation, studies undertaken to date reveal highly positive results where Ireland is concerned. The Commission's mid term review confirms that implementation here is progressing satisfactorily.  We have confirmed to member states that the full Community support framework will be implemented within the five year period.</P>
    <P>The mid term review shows that the fund made a significant contribution to GDP growth.  It estimates that the annual rate of growth in Ireland was boosted by 0.5 per cent over the period of the Community support frame.  This is broadly in line with the Government estimates. Of course, this estimate does not take account of longer term supply side effects that can be expected to reinforce the positive impact of the funds.</P>
    <P>A detailed study of the position here has been undertaken by the ESRI and this report has taken account of the effects of completion of the Single Market.  Overall the report suggests that, taken together, the Structural Funds and the Single Market could raise the level of GNP here by between seven and eight percentage points by the year 2000.  It will also raise the annual growth rate by 0.75 per cent relative to the unchanged EC policy benchmark and raise employment by over 55,000 by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Another recent consultancy study in Ireland concludes that, &ldquo;The CSF significantly augments the medium term prospects of the key traded sectors of manufacturing industry and tourism&rdquo;.  It is clear the Community assistance has enabled the Government to increase investment in the structural area to a far higher level than would otherwise have been feasible.  We have stressed to the other member states that, looking to the medium to longer term, the Structural Funds are enabling Ireland to make significant progress on building up the infrastructure crucial to economic development in sectors such as roads, access transport and sanitary services. They are also contributing to productive <Col N="72" /> investment in industry, tourism and agriculture and to the development of human resources through training and education.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the various Structural Fund assisted measures has produced impressive results to date and targets are being met and, indeed, exceeded in many cases.  Under the industry and services programme, for example, a target of 20,000 new jobs per year was set.  This employment target has been surpassed for the first three years with a total of 63,245 new jobs created to the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>The performance of the tourism sector has been significantly boosted by the measures undertaken under the CSF.  By the end of 1991 the number of overseas visitors had increased by 27.5 per cent, foreign tourism revenue was up by 50 per cent and an extra 15,000 jobs had been created in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Major independent evaluation studies are being undertaken in respect of the industry, peripherality and human resources programmes.  We will draw any necessary lessons from these studies to help us in future programmes.</P>
    <P>That is the up-to-date position for the House from the financial perspective of what happened in Lisbon and what is likely to happen between now and the Edinburgh Summit, and the important work that has to be completed at that stage.</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity we have had to debate the Maastricht Treaty and the EC since the referendum.  I am slightly bemused by the fact that Deputy Spring appears in his speech today to be attempting to distance himself from the consensus of the four parties who argued for acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty during that referendum when he lent his support to the Government campaign which sought to <Col N="73" /> emphasise the acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty on the basis of the £6 billion that was supposed to be in the bag.  That is rather disingenuous.  I note that Deputy Barry made no such attempt to distance himself from his position during the Maastricht Treaty referendum.</P>
      <P>Coming almost immediately after the referendum on European Union in Ireland, the Lisbon Summit offered an ideal opportunity for clarification on the many issues and questions raised during the referendum campaign.  The commitment of the Community to assisting development in peripheral regions and clarification in the area of security and defence policy were among the two most pressing and important matters.</P>
      <P>Rather than clear up the problems, the Summit has, in fact, reinforced the impression of a Community in which there is a continued and possibly increasing resistance to delivering on obligations concerning cohesion policy, and where a near covert drive to the creation of an EC military superstate is continuing unabated.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, the argument that, if not much was agreed at the Summit, no great ground has been lost either.  The Taoiseach, on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; special following the Summit, referred to Lisbon as a half way house to the next Summit in Edinburgh.</P>

      <P>It was a special. This situation, however, was exactly the problem which the Democratic Left warned about before the Irish Government signed the Maastricht Treaty last February.  It was why we demanded that the Treaty should be renegotiated rather than being presented, with its host of vague promises and unanswered questions, for acceptance by the Irish people in last month's referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish people now face the appalling vista, having voted in favour of the Treaty with the assurance of the cosy consensus of the four pro-Maastricht Treaty parties that the much sought funding <Col N="74" /> was as good as in the bag, of the Irish Government's proposals on the Structural Funds being snubbed at last weekend's Summit.  Come next December and the next Summit, the ECs attention is likely to be focused primarily on the problems arising in Denmark, where voters rejected the Treaty, and where a solution must be found before it can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach over the past week, has stated that he is happy that the right signals have been given in Portugal on eventual acceptance of the Delors proposals. Perhaps it is time he instead sent up some smoke signals himself.  The reference in the Treaty to &ldquo;an appropriate increase&rdquo; in the Funds can be interpreted widely.  British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, for instance, also interviewed on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; after the Summit, stated that he felt there was little prospect of the Delors proposals being adopted in Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>Reading the &ldquo;Future Financing of the Community&rdquo; section of the Presidency Conclusions, it is clear just how little was conceded to the four peripheral countries. While it is indeed likely that, in the end, increases will be agreed in the budget, we are clearly very far indeed from a situation which would ensure a convergence of Irish GNP and economic development significantly closer to the developed centre of the Community.  We stand to gain in absolute terms, but will we make any relative gains?  Will we catch up, even a little?  Two decades after joining the EC and five years after the adoption of the Single European Act, all the evidence points to a continued failure of the traditional policies and strategy of the Community in this area.</P>
    <P>The approach generally by the Irish Government to the funding issue and the parallel failure to emphasise the development of economic policies which will favour the peripheral regions like Ireland, highlights the paucity of Government thinking on Ireland's future as a region of the EC.  The Government approached the entire debate on the economic issues of European Union from the vantage of seeking a deal or a scoop <Col N="75" />&mdash; of bringing home so much money in the bag that the natives would be dumbfounded simply counting the number of noughts in £6 billion.</P>
    <P>As Democratic Left pointed out during the referendum campaign, such figures can be, and are, very misleading.  The present Structural Funds amount to £3,000 million, another dumbfounding figure.  Yet Ireland's living standards continue to lag at two-thirds the EC average, our unemployment levels are at record levels and have been among the worst in the EC for the past five years.  With emigration predicted to rise again, we may shortly see a return to the situation of a few years ago when as many young people leave Ireland annually as live in the Taoiseach's home county of Longford.</P>
    <P>These problems can only be solved by specific interventionist policies and mechanisms.  Throwing however much money as a sop to peripheral regions offers no guarantee of producing economic convergence.  It must be spent to develop the economy and industry of the peripheral region through an EC industrial policy.  At present Germany, at the heart of what has been called the overdeveloped centre of the Community, spends 21 times as much as Ireland subsidising its industry.  The Irish Government must demand an industrial policy which assists Ireland to overcome such an institutionalised disadvantage.  It is not good enough, as the Government are clearly arguing, to say we have received positive signals and submit ourselves accordingly to the full rigours of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The Presidency Conclusions note &ldquo;with satisfaction&rdquo; that &ldquo;over 90% of the measures needed to implement the single market have now been adopted.&rdquo;  Further on the document states that &ldquo;beyond the immediate horizon the Council recognises that attention needs to be paid to ensuring that the single market works fairly.&rdquo;  It then &ldquo;invites&rdquo; the relevant institutions to take the necessary steps in this area.  I presume that this is a reference to the Social Charter and its <Col N="76" /> implementation &mdash; the fact that the Charter is not even named in this section illustrates the contempt with which the spirit of the social dimension of the community is being treated in the process of European Union.</P>
    <P>It seems that in addition to ignoring the peripheral regions of the Community, implementation of the Treaty will also involve the creation of an equally ignored `peripheral population' of the Community. This includes the tens of millions of people who face unemployment, poverty and homelessness, the many millions more part-time workers &mdash; many of them women &mdash; school leavers and the disabled and elderly for whom the process of European Union and the Single Market raises many unanswered questions and fears, and the fate of immigrant workers and their families.</P>
    <P>The conclusions go into considerable detail on the elaboration of a common foreign and security policy for the Community. Nowhere is there reference to development of a pre-peace policy for the Community; nowhere is there reference to developing defence and security based on non-nuclear policies; nowhere is there a rejection of the development for the EC as a military superpower.  Perhaps the other member states rejected any such proposals, but I would welcome confirmation from the Taoiseach on whether any attempt was made by the Irish delegation to include such sentiments in the Conclusions.</P>
    <P>With each reading of the Conclusions of these Summits, the ritual reference to not &ldquo;prejudicing the security and defence policies of certain member states&rdquo; becomes more hollow.  Even leaving aside the issue of the Western European Union, the contents of the Annex on common foreign and security policy raise new questions on Ireland's increasing involvement in military style decision making.  Paragraph 36 of Annex 1 states that &ldquo;the union requests Western European Union, which is an integral part of the development of the European Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> In this context the reference to the Middle East under common foreign and security policy, and the stated aim to &ldquo;ensure full compliance by the countries of the region with the relevant treaties and agreements on disarmament and arms control ...&rdquo; leaves open many interpretations.  If a Middle Eastern country is deemed to have breached any such agreements, could we see a request to the Western European Union to &ldquo;implement decisions and actions&rdquo; on behalf of the Community?  What relationship would such action have to the CSCE or the UN?  What is the extent of Ireland's commitment and obligations to defend such actions politically?</P>
    <P>Given that there is a number of references in the Conclusions to covering all aspects of relations with countries, it would appear as though the separation between defence and other matters is being blurred beyond the point of distinction. A further particularly distasteful section of the Conclusions are contained in paragraph 13 &mdash; on relations with developing countries &mdash; and paragraph 15 on arms exports.</P>
    <P>While paragraph 13 refers to promoting development, respect for human rights and democracy, Paragraph 15 further streamlines a common policy on arms exports.  Given that the sale of arms and technology from EC member states to the Iraqi Government over many years was a contributory factor to the outbreak of the Gulf War, with its subsequent horrific consequences for people's lives, economy and environment in a number of Middle Eastern countries, developing a joint policy for arms exports should be replaced by a joint policy for military deesclation.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 15 also refers and links arms exports to states' &ldquo;legitimate needs for security and defence&rdquo;.  But how, for instance, does the British Government square this point with the sale of arms to Indonesia, where there is evidence of continued repression by the authorities on the island of Timor?  Since 1978 Britain has been a major supplier of arms and military and naval craft to Indonesia. Throughout the country there is continued <Col N="78" /> widespread repression.  More than two dozen long term political prisoners were executed in the late eighties.  There are no independent political parties.</P>
    <P>Since the Suharto Government seized power, British companies have sold Indonesia a range of military equipment, including naval frigates, 20 Hawk advanced fighter aircraft, seawolf missile launchers and armoured cars.  I understand a further 40 Hawk fighter aircraft may shortly be sold to Indonesia.  Selling the machinery of death to such a government is not compatible with the official sentiments of the Lisbon Summit Conclusions. Therefore, what weight do we give those conclusions?</P>
    <P>As I have stated in many previous debates in the Dáil on European Union, Democratic Left support the development of a common foreign and security policy, but our concept of security is much broader than the definition to be found in the Maastricht Treaty and as further outlined at the Lisbon Summit. Security is threatened not just by military matters, but in many other ways such as underdevelopment, economic and social injustice, exploitation and racism and faulty environmental and developmental policies.</P>
    <P>Judged on this basis the greatest guarantee of genuine collective security is a policy of nuclear and conventional disarmament and one where the military industrial complex is turned towards civil objectives.  That is not compatible with the old cold war vehicles of NATO or the Western European Union.  Instead the future of collective security must be seen under the umbrella of the CSCE and a reformed United Nations.</P>
    <P>In addition the European Parliament and Dáil must have adequate powers and mechanisms to control and monitor developments in this area, particularly the decisions made by Council of Ministers' representatives from each country.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the problems facing the Oireachtas generally in carrying out its democratic mandate of monitoring the institutions of the European Community. The decision to again only allow time for statements on the Summit is un-acceptable. <Col N="79" /> The Government also agreed the Annex on a common Foreign and Security Policy without any reference to the Oireachtas.  When will we have a further debate on European Union?  Will it be after the next Summit when further agreements may have been entered into without consultation with elected representatives of this State?  This state of affairs says little for the Taoiseach's promise of open government.  It also says little for any hope we might have that secret deals by the European Council will be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>We have proposed the establishment of a European affairs committee which would act as an effectvie watchdog for the Dáil and Seanad and keep the Oireachtas fully informed of developments so that it can respond rapidly and effectively.  It is regrettable that the Government have ruled out the establishment of such a committee no later than Tuesday of this week and that the draft terms of reference for a foreign affairs committee specifically preclude that comittee from dealing with matters related to the Government's negotiating position at the European Community.</P>
    <P>Such a committee is a vital necessity for the democratic development of this stage of European Union.  Discussing and deciding behind closed doors is no recipe for public confidence or democratic accountability.  It is necessary that such a committee should examine all Commission proposals, involve consultations with Ministers before and after Council meetings and provide regular reports to the Oireachtas.  We can no longer permit the Government to operate on our behalf in a semi-secret way informing the Dáil only grudgingly of what they have done after the event.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to make a few points in relation to the Lisbon Summit and, with your permission, Sir, I would like to broaden the agenda to discuss the development of the Community to which no reference was made at Lisbon.  The <Col N="80" /> Taoiseach said that the Lisbon Summit was successful, but I cannot agree with him.  The Council decided to mark time rather than take any positive decisions. There is no doubt that the decision of the Danish people not to ratify the Maastricht Treaty cast a cloud over the deliberations. It also appears that they lost direction, given the way they went about their business.  That is not good for this country.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that the Council did not address the problems that have arisen following the decision of the Danish people not to agree to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  One must wonder therefore if there is any way Denmark can now ratify the Treaty.  The Council should have taken the opportunity to address the problems which have arisen in a positive way and ask themselves if they could make it possible for the Danish Government to hold another referendum or plebiscite to allow the Danish people ratify the Maastricht Treaty.  That should have been the primary aim and achievement of the Lisbon Summit.  Alas, it seems that they achieved nothing in that area.</P>
      <P>This leaves us in a far worse position than most of the other member states of the European Community.  During the course of the debate on the Maastricht Treaty I said, as a regional director of elections, that Ireland had more to lose than any other member state if the Treaty was not ratified.  As a result, increased Structural Funding during the next three to five years has been placed in jeopardy, while a question mark also hangs over the Cohesion Fund.  This will have a negative effect or the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Through good propaganda the message has been sold to the people that the country will gain under the Common Agricultural Policy reform package.  I was willing to agree to most of that package so long as the country reaped the benefts under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country should not lose if any adjustments or changes are made. However we were one of the losers following the reform of the Common Agricultural <Col N="81" /> Policy.  That cannot be gainsaid either in this House or anywhere else; while the experts disagree, it is possible that the country will lose in the order of £500 million per annum in relation to net transfers.  While we cannot disagree with the principle and the way the package was negotiated it is bad that the future of the Maastricht Treaty hangs in the balance.  My primary criticism is that the Taoiseach did not take the lead at Lisbon. It is of vital importance that a guarantee be given that the benefits, the compensatory measures, will flow under the Maastricht Treaty and that everything will be done to ensure that the Treaty becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke in an upbeat way about the Cohesion Fund and mentioned that the Structural Funds may yet be doubled but I find it difficult to take him seriously given the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit.  I am concerned also that Britain is about to take over the Presidency. While one does not want to be too critical of our neighbour, Britain is probably the least European of all the member states.  The new President of the Council, Mr. John Major, has his own difficulties with the Euro-sceptics in parliament and will be inclined, by word and by deed, to make concessions to them.  I do not believe that his Presidency will take any major initiative to ensure that Denmark is involved in the process.  I am one of those who believe that the Maastricht Treaty cannot be implemented unless it is ratified by Denmark.</P>
    <P>The country holding the Presidency will have to make subtle gestures to France, where a referendum is due to be held, and to Germany which is experiencing difficulties in adjusting following reunification.  Many ordinary German taxpayers feel that they are paying far too much, that too many Deutsche Marks are being provided to secure European union while too little is being provided to bring about a union in their own country which is of primary importance to them. We do not blame them for that but we should bear in mind what we had hoped to achieve under the Portuguese Presidency, <Col N="82" /> which supports the concept of full European union, and the fact that the Presidency is due to pass to a country which by no means could be said to support it fully.  It was therefore in our best interests to ensure that decisions were made under the Portuguese Presidency. As I said, that matter was not addressed at Lisbon.  I find it very difficult therefore to take the Taoiseach seriously in relation to most of what he had to say this morning.</P>
    <P>It was also disappointing that the Summit did not address the position in Eastern Europe.  I belong to that group of people who believe that Europe begins along the western shores of this country and extends to the Ural Mountains.  Ultimately we will never have a true European Union unless we take the whole family of European peoples into it.  The ultimate of that dream would be to bring the world into some kind of world family of nations, all under a single umbrella of trading and so on.</P>
    <P>Immediately what we must deal with just beyond our doorstep is the volatility of Eastern Europe after the collapse of communism.  We have seen what has happened in Czechoslovakia.  Czechoslovakia was regarded, under the old communist regime, as the most stable of all the Eastern European countries.  It was more advanced in terms of economic development than any of the old satellite states of the former Soviet Union.  Yet, less than two years after its assuming a new form of independence &mdash; as we had hoped, a country up on its own two feet &mdash; we find it is to sunder in two halves. For those two years, they were led by a very wise man, Vaclav Havel, a true nationalist whose dream was to see his country hold together.  Yet old nationalism reasserted itself.  Now, sadly, his country seems set to sunder.</P>
    <P>The outgoing Chairman of the EC Council of Foreign Ministers, the Portuguese Foreign Minister, made the point, in the dying days of their Presidency, that it was a great pity that that should be allowed to happen.  He seemed to imply that the Community might do something at least at first by way of advice <Col N="83" /> and not allow this to happen.  Yet, to my knowledge, this Summit did not address that problem.  To my knowledge the Irish delegation did not address that problem in Lisbon.</P>
    <P>Then there is the appalling problem of Yugoslavia.  In his statement the Taoiseach said there was a Community initiative. It did not look like that.  While not wishing to be critical of him &mdash; because apparently his trip was successful &mdash; President Mitterrand apparently took himself to Yugoslavia without telling any of his Community partners or, if he did, he told them in a very surreptitious way.  That was not good Community action.  While we are endeavouring to get common action taken on such issues, the Head of one member state &mdash; certainly one of the larger powers within the Community, no doubt with a good deal of influence in that part of Europe &mdash; took himself to Sarajevo, arrived at an airport which, up to that point was not safe for anybody and walked the street.  While one may compliment him on what he did &mdash; and, as it seems now, on what he achieved in a sense that it was the catalyst for getting the United Nations to secure proper control of the airport; it appears it was the catalyst for getting food and medical supplies into the country without those transporting it being fired on as they landed &mdash; nevertheless the action smacked of being anti-common action, or common foreign policy position among the member states.  We made much of the benefits of a common security and foreign policy.  If that type of action had been taken before the Maastricht Treaty referendum here, it would have ridiculed the stated position of many people on these and on the Labour Party benches. Again, that was a raggedness in terms of the results of the Summit in Lisbon.</P>
    <P>There is also the great difficulty in the former Sovier Union, in Moldovia and it appears there was no references to that at the Lisbon Summit.  There is the question of whether Romania can keep the lid on all its ethnic minorities and hold that country together.  For example, can Hungary, probably the most homogeneoud <Col N="84" /> country of the new Eastern European states, hold itself together considering it too has major minorities? After all it borders Czechoslovakia and has a very large land border with the old Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Wise men would need to take a long look at what is taking place on Europe's eastern borders, particularly the leaders of this European Union we are now building.  We should be seen, whether by advice or action, to influence events in that part of the world.  However, it was not addressed at the Lisbon Summit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have spoken at greater length on the need for a more positive statement as to the meaning of subsidiarity and cohesion. Without doubt the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will devastate peripheral areas of this country, affecting farming and major enterprise because, in those parts where there is little or no industry they survive on the transfer of funds.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will mean an enormous amount of that funding will be withdrawn and the position of the people who live in these areas will be more marginal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should have liked cohesion to have been defined at Lisbon because we will not get a good definition of it at a crucial time under the British Presidency.  We should have been told what cohesion will mean to the people of, say, the west of Ireland?  For example, will there be a positive transfer of resources?  We read in the Maastricht Treaty that there will be a review of the policy of cohesion every two years, and that the EC could act outside of the funds to ensure it was taking place but what does that mean? That is a leading question for all of us and an answer is sought in many parts of the country.  I would have expected that we would have had a response to that important question at Lisbon.  Indeed, the appropriate persons to pose that question were the Taoiseach and Minister <Col N="85" /> for Foreign Affairs.  However, I am satisfied the question was not posed. That, from the point of view of that part of this nation which is peripheral and marginal, is a great tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the resounding endorsement of the Maastricht Treaty by our people I am pleased to have this opportunity of putting the major points of our European and education policy, as they are connected, on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>The underlying principle is to give Irish education a clearer European orientation &mdash; this was clear at Maastricht &mdash; while, at the same time, safeguarding its essential Irish character.  There is no contradiction here.  Ireland has always played a significant role in the development of European education and culture.  Indeed history records that, at a time of social upheaval on mainland Europe, during the first Christian millennium, Ireland became the main centre for the transmission of European civilisation.  What we now propose represents not so much a radical change of direction but a renewed recognition of a principle which has always informed the theory and practice of the Irish education system.</P>
      <P>However, social economic and political considerations now lend a fresh urgency to the task.  <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> states that Ireland will continue to pursue a clear national strategy directed to promoting full and balanced European integration in the economic, monetary and social spheres, within the framework of evolving political union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, an important social policy objective will be the achievement of economic and social cohesion by the Community, which would complement the efforts of the less affluent member states and regions themselves including: first, a further strengthening of structural policy, implemented primarily through the Structural Funds, suitably extended and reformed; and, second, the targeted and, as necessary, regionally differentiated application of other Community <Col N="86" /> policies and actions in relation, <i>inter alia,</i> to support for education, training, innovation, and research and development.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the history of Europe since the Second World War one is struck by the faith and vision of the founding fathers of the European Community. I recall in particular the pragmatic assertion of Robert Schuman shortly after the war when he said:</P>
    <P>A united Europe will not arise overnight, or in one grand design; it will be built on practical achievements, creating at first <i>de facto</i> interdependence.</P>
    <P>One hesitates to paraphrase such a towering intellect but it seems to me that he was expressing, in a graphic way, the basic idea that European Union lies at the end of a road of shared learning and experience among the peoples of Europe.  This is precisely where education can and must play a central role.</P>
    <P>There are two main European Community aspects to education policy; first, European co-operation in the field of education and, second, the development of education and training with the support of the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In relation to the first aspect, Ireland, as you will have noted from the Government White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty, tabled a proposal for an article on education policy at an early stage of the negotiations on the new Treaty.  We, therefore, claim a share of the credit for Article 126 which, for the first time in the Community's history, confers a Community competence in the field of education. For the first time education has been put at the centre of the stage of European affairs.</P>
    <P>While explicitly respecting the responsibility of member states for the content of teaching and the organisation of their education systems, the new article provides a more explicit basis for Community support for actions by member states in the broad area of school-based education.  Activities such as exchanges of young people in second-level education, promoting the European <Col N="87" /> dimension in education and developing European-wide efforts to solve problems such as school failure and illiteracy will be more fully supported.</P>
    <P>I have little doubt that these kinds of initiatives, repeated across the Community and networked by the Commission, will facilitate the development of a European awareness among our young people.  This will, in turn, accelerate progress towards the completion of the Internal Market, and, indeed, can be regarded as an essential prerequisite of closer economic and political union.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Structural Funds and their role in the development of education and training in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Article 130a of the Maastricht Treaty defines the broad objective of economic and social cohesion for the Community through harmonious development and a reduction in disparities between the various regions.  The Structural Funds are a major instrument in the Community's progress towards full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>As is pointed out in the Green Paper on Education which I launched last Thursday, the essential objective of the Structural Funds is to reduce disparities between less developed regions and the rest of the Community.  The application of the Funds must serve that objective and their success will be measured by the extent to which they facilitate progress towards it.  Moreover, lessons drawn from the current phase of the operation of the Funds will be taken into account when decisions are taken regarding the effectiveness of this approach to resource allocation after 1993.</P>
    <P>Under the current Community Support Framework, aid from the Social Fund for Department of Education activities amounts to more than £100 million per year for the period of the agreement which remains in force up to the end of 1993.  This is a very significant sum indeed.</P>
    <P>These activities include one-year vocational preparation and training courses for young people who have completed compulsory schooling as well as a <Col N="88" /> range of certificate and dilopma courses provided in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>In addition, and for the first time since Ireland acceded to the Community, a number of postgraduate courses in universities are aided by the Social Fund. Some important initiatives for the long term unemployed and for young people who leave school without qualifications are also supported by the fund.</P>
    <P>A mid-term review of the current round of the Structural Funds is nearing completion and all the indications are that the reforms introduced in 1988 have been successful.  The main elements of reform were: concentration of funds assistance on geographical regions; a programmed approach to aid allocation; more co-ordination between the funds; partnership between the Community and national governments; a greater emphasis on monitoring and assessment; and additionality.</P>
    <P>These reforms appear to have increased the effectiveness of the funds in promoting social and economic cohesion. They have therefore been incorporated into the Commission's Delors-II package proposals for the next round of the Structural Funds &mdash; up to 1997 &mdash; which were published immediately after the signing of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are well aware the Commission proposed a two-thirds increase in the Structural Funds.  This, taken with the new Cohesion Fund provided for in the Maastricht Treaty, was intended to lead to a doubling of allocations from both sources to Ireland for the period from 1994 to the end of 1997.</P>
    <P>The report of the recent meeting of the European Council in Lisbon reaffirms that economic and social cohesion represents an essential dimension of the Community and that the reforms adopted in 1988 should be maintained.</P>
    <P>It decided that the Cohesion Fund provided for in the Treaty should be put in place early in 1993.  It also decided that in the four member states concerned &mdash; Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain &mdash; the cumulative effect of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund will result in an appropriate increase in funds to <Col N="89" /> reflect the Maastricht Treaty commitments. The European Council will reach decisions at its meeting in Edinburgh on the various components of the Delors-II package.</P>
    <P>While final decisions have not yet been taken the outcome of the Lisbon Summit holds out the clear prospect of substantially increased support from the Social Fund for education and training after 1994.  Discussions are already taking place at national level as to the most appropriate mix of measures and programmes which might be presented to the Commission.  We are approaching this task from the standpoint that the Lisbon conclusions leave open the possibility that we can achieve a doubling of appropriations from the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the next round.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are also proceeding at Community level where again our task is to convince our Community partners, especially the more affluent member states, that social and economic cohesion is a two-way process which serves their best interests as well as ours.  We will be pointing to the positive results achieved under the current Community Support Framework and we will be emphasising the by-now widely acknowledged quality of our education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>We will be making the following specific points in relation to the demand for education and training in Ireland &mdash; a level of demand not approached elsewhere in the Community:&mdash; The rapid rate of expansion of courses under the current Community Support Framework has outstripped the level of available European Social Fund support.  This was an inevitable outcome of our decision to draw down ESF aid in four more or less equal instalments from 1990 to 1993.  The fact remains that a significant proportion of our current eligible training activity is fully funded by the Exchequer.  The current position is that 19,600 students on ESF third-level courses are aided by the fund.  The total number of students on these courses is 22,200.  The additional 2,600 students are fully funded by the Exchequer at a cost of £10 million per <Col N="90" /> annum.  This is an obvious case for an upward adjustment of ESF aid under the next agreement.</P>
    <P>Let me say, too, that in relation to third-level education generally numbers have expanded rapidly over the last quarter of a century, from 21,000 in 1965 to almost 70,000 in 1990-91, increasing to about 75,000 in 1991-92.  Student intake in 1991-92 represents almost 40 per cent of the age group and, with the additional places we are providing at present, participation is likely to increase to 45 per cent of the age cohort by the middle of the decade.  That is 45 per cent of school leavers in the country now going on to third level education.  The corresponding figures around Europe are about half of that.  One European country that is a member of the Community has about 21 per cent of its students in this age group going on to third level education.  We are heading for a figure of 45 per cent by the end of this decade.  In terms of the number of people in that age group who go to third level education Ireland is very well up the international league and that is something of which we can be extremely proud.  A total enrolment of 100,000 in full-time, third-level education is projected by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the continuing expansion of our population in the 15-25 year age range and the consistent growth in demand for post-second level education and training makes our position unique among our Community partners.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of our commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to provide 8,800 additional third-level places over the first few years of the programme.</P>
    <P>We will of course also argue strongly for further support from the Regional Fund for the development of our educational infrastructure.  The rapid increase in enrolments in recent years has placed great demands on the physical facilities, both in terms of buildings and equipment.  Moreover it goes without saying that on-going investment in plant and equipment is essential in order to keep courses, especially those in the area of the new technologies, at the highest <Col N="91" /> possible level of relevance to emerging needs.</P>
    <P>Our case for a substantial increase &mdash; £92 million in the amount of Regional Fund aid from the current CSF is exceptionally strong and we will be expecting infrastructural aid from this fund to increase to the level of about £50 million a year or a total of £200 million over the period of the next CSF.  I stress that this is very much a target but a target I will be working to achieve.  Between the two funds the Department would be in a position to draw down close to £1 billion in aid.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me list the initiatives in the area of vocational education and training for which, in line with national priorities, we will be seeking support in the next round of the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>These are developing and expanding existing provision and significantly upgrading the training infrastructure, including the establishment of technology centres; targeting the needs of disadvantaged persons, especially early school leavers and those needing second chance vocational education and training; providing increased access to further skill training for those in need of retraining or upgrading of skills; establishing formal links between programme providers and the social partners, especially industry and business, in programme development and provision, with particular reference to the promotion of a culture of enterprise in all vocational education and training programmes; developing vocational education and training, including certification and the harmonisation of qualifications; developing the range of vocational options within the leaving certificate vocational programme with the objective of increasing the leaving certificate participants in the programme to at least 30 per cent from 1994.  A review of the nature and content of the vocational-technical subjects will be undertaken to ensure that the programme will be relevant and will promote gender equity; and expanding the range of eligible courses, especially at third level, to include many currently not eligible <Col N="92" /> for support from the Funds.  It is clear, therefore, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Maastricht Treaty and the Lisbon Summit has put education at the centre of the stage of the new European Community.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a top level plan to swoop on lucrative illegal salmon fishing off the Donegal coast last week had been unexpectedly cancelled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Naval Service while engaged on salmon protection duties is to provide aid to the civil authority, in this case the Garda Síochána and the regional fisheries boards.  The Minister is satisfied that that arrangement works quite well at present and he has no proposals to alter it.</P>
      <P>Under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, members of the Defence Forces, not below the rank of petty officer, are sea fisheries protection officers for the purposes of that Act while serving on board Naval Service ships. Accordingly, they have statutory authority to enforce the law in relation to sea fisheries.  The primary responsibility for enforcing salmon legislation within 12 miles from baselines, however, rests with the various regional fisheries boards under the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service involvement in support of the regional fisheries boards consists <Col N="93" /> of providing a Naval Service Coastal Patrol Vessel, either <i>LE Orla</i> or <i>LE Ciara,</i> so that the regional fisheries board inspector can carry out his task of examining the licences and nets of salmon fishing vessels.  A member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of sergeant, is also carried on board the naval vessel to ensure that the inspector is not impeded in the exercise of this duty.</P>
    <P>The programme of salmon fishery patrols each year is planned in discussions involving the Department of the Marine, the Central Fisheries Board, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Defence, including the military and naval authorities.  It is accepted by all concerned with the protection programme that patrol plans must remain confidential and flexible.</P>
    <P>With regard to fishery protection duties generally, Naval Service personnel, in their capacity as sea fisheries officers, act on priorities specified by the Department of the Marine and, using intelligence gathered and experience gained over the years, plan and execute sea fishery protection patrols on an ongoing basis.  These would include the implementation of the prohibition on fishing for salmon outside 12 miles from baselines which is enforced by the Naval Service on a year round basis as part of its routine patrol activities.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate to comment on the day-to-day management of fisheries surveillance activities.  By their very nature these activities require flexibility and an element of surprise for maximum effectiveness.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister's response is practically the same as the response given by the Minister for Defence at Question Time on Tuesday.  Will the Minister explain why a patrol to the north west on Friday last was suddenly cancelled without any warning and sent instead to the south-west? Last Tuesday I asked the Minister for Defence to give an explanation for this but I got no response from him.  I was told that the Minister for the Marine would be taking Questions on Thursday <Col N="94" /> and he would respond to the question at that time.  The Minister of State has still not given an explanation.  Why were the people on board the ship not given an explanation as to why this patrol was suddenly cancelled?

      <P>It should not be. It is a matter for the Central Fisheries Board. It may well be that somebody took a very intelligent decision on this occasion, because it appears there was no run of fish off the north-west coast during that period.  As anyone who is familiar with salmon fishing off the north-west coast will know &mdash; I am sure my colleague in the House can confirm this &mdash; the run of fish in that area is around the time of bonfire night.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he will initiate an inquiry into the near sinking of the lighthouse tender Granuaile off the Antrim coast on 26 June 1992; if a replacement tender will be necessary during the repair of the Granuaile; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On Friday, 26 June, at 4.49 p.m. the Commissioners of Irish Lights tender <i>Granuaile</i> grazed a rock off the Maidens Lighthouse, County Antrim.  There were no injuries to any of the 41 people on board.  The <i>Granuaile,</i> which was holed and taking water in the engine room, was taken under tow and beached in Brown's Bay, Islandmagee, approximately one mile from Larne Harbour.</P>
      <P>On 29 June 1992 the Minister appointed a surveyor of the Marine Survey Office of his Department to carry out a statutory inquiry under section 728 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  He has already begun work on the casualty and will report his findings to the Minister in due course.  In line with the Minister's announcement to this House on 26 February last he will, subject to legal considerations, publish a report of this marine accident investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> The repair and-or temporary replacement of the damaged vessel would be matters for the Commissioners of Irish Lights who are the General Lighthouse Authority for the whole of Ireland. However, the Minister is assured by the commissioners that their service to shipping will not be compromised while the vessel is being repaired and that a replacement vessel, if required, would be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know everyone in the House will wish to join with me in congratulating the staff, also the safety crew, who reacted so quickly, and the emergency services.  The important point is that the crew suffered no injuries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Department of the Marine will be holding an inquiry and reporting on the matter.  I would ask the Minister whether there is concern about the fact that the accident happened in good weather and calm seas.  Will the House be made aware of any particular circumstances that led to the accident? All of us share a common concern that life is put at risk when such an accident occurs.  Is there any technical inadequacy that could lead to such an accident?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for the kind comments and I shall pass them to the people involved.  On 29 June the Minister appointed a surveyor under the Shipping Act, 1894.  The surveyor has begun work on the casualty and will be reporting to the Minister.  Taking into account the legal considerations, as is normal, a report will be made available to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 3, 9, 42 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister has no plans to produce a White Paper on the future organisation of our commercial seaports.  The Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation have now completed their task and the review group's report will be published next week.</P>
      <P>The review group have put forward recommendations which are designed to ensure that future policy and legislation in relation to commercial ports will enable them to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises, free from undue control by the State.  The report and its recommendations will be evaluated in my Department in consultation with the social partners and other interested bodies.  The review group's recommendations, if accepted by Government, will be implemented at the earliest date possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite alarmed with that reply.  Is the Minister aware that the previous Minister, Deputy Wilson, announced with great fanfare that the Harbour Review Group would be a watershed in relation to ports and that as regards the structural problems at Irish <Col N="99" /> ports, their lack of capacity and competitiveness, legislation would be updated?  Will the Government merely let this report gather dust and will the Minister confirm that the report recommends the establishment of semi-State companies in relation to a number of ports and recommends, too, new legislation and reforms of dock labour practices? Are the Government prepared now to give the green light to the recommendations of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important that as many functions as possible be devolved to the port and harbour authorities.  I appreciate that the Deputy was informed earlier in the year that the report would be available in March of this year.  However, a copy of the report is available now and it will be published next week.  On scanning through it I believe that the Deputy will be impressed with its contents.  It would be unwise of me to suggest at this stage the recommendations that should be implemented.  We look forward on publication of the report next week, to the comments and views of all interested parties, including Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Minister that not only am I aware of the contents of the report but I am very supportive of them.  What I am requesting is Government action to implement the recommendations of the report, and the best way to do that is through a White Paper. Will the Minister of State speak to the Minister with a view to having the matter reviewed in order to prevent the practice whereby four out of every ten containers travel through Northern Ireland?  There should be proper concerted Government action to deal with outdated ports.  Will the Minister consider publishing a White Paper and give it the type of priority that has been lacking in the past?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The total size of the Irish fleet at the beginning of this year was of the order of 53,000 tonnes.  Negotiations are continuing with the European Commission on a multi-annual guidance programme for fleet development for the period to end-1996.  In that context, we have proposed that in order to take up unexploited quotas, especially of white fish, the fleet should be allowed increase by about 5,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>I should mention in this context that the former Minister, the Tánaiste, introduced a special scheme last year designed to bring in an extra 20 vessels aimed at unexploited white fish quotas to the west of Ireland.  Some eight boats have already been introduced and three further boats will enter the fleet shortly.  This scheme included special arrangements for the phasing of the withdrawal of tonnage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress, however, that there would be no basis at this stage for any <Col N="101" /> general relaxation on the present requirement whereby a person proposing to introduce a new boat must first withdraw equivalent capacity.  If existing capacity is adequate, as it is in many segments of the Irish fleet, adding to capacity would simply undermine the viability of existing boats.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of modernising and renewing the fleet, the financing of such programmes is largely determined by EC rules and conditions.  In this context, we have put a comprehensive development programme to the European Commission and negotiations on that programme are in train.  Already this year, I am glad to say that the Commission has approved grants for the modernisation of some 32 vessels involving a total EC investment of £1.13 million.  I will be pressing for a continuation and improvement of this support in the fleet development guidelines to be adopted for Ireland by the Commission for the period to 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that we should make a strong case to the Commission that in areas where there is no problem with quotas exploratory fishing for new species could be increased tremendously by the Irish fishing fleet? A recent BIM exercise identified that an extra £500,000 could produce another 70 jobs &mdash; jobs in fishing cost about £8,000 per job whereas in industry they cost more than £20,000 per job.  Therefore every effort must be made to provide money in this area.  In coastal areas where jobs are most needed there is every argument, financial and environmental, for increasing the fishing fleet, thereby resulting in a return at every level, which would not be the case in most other jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with the Deputy.  A question has been put down about fish species on which I will give more precise details later, but the point about exploratory fishing for non-quota species is a valid one.  In some cases, for example, with horse mackerel, there is a total allowable catch but I agree that there are non-quota species which <Col N="102" /> must be explored such as blue whiting, argentines, and red fish.  Hopefully a plan will come on stream in this regard very soon.  It is important that fishing operations carried out by producers and processors take place in areas where there are no other natural assets.  In making our case we are concentrating on the under-utilised species, the underdeveloped nature of the fleet and the importance of fishing to the social and economic survival of coastal regions.  I take the point that with an additional 5,000 tonnes many more jobs could be provided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, however, had inquiries made in this case and I understand that because <Col N="103" /> the number of applicants to the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board exceeded the number of licences available, and because the person in question did not use the licences allocated to him in the past three years, he was not considered a high enough priority for the allocation of a licence in 1992.  All the licences which can be legally issued by the board for 1992 have been allocated and it is not possible for the board to issue further licences or to transfer a licence from one fisherman to another.</P>
    <P>This person may, of course, apply for a licence for the 1993 season.  Applications for 1993 licences must be received by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board on or before 30 November 1992.</P>

    <P>Because of the complex nature of the financial compensation for fish withdrawn from the market, it is only possible to give approximate values.</P>
    <P>Fishermen's producers organisations have been urged by my Department to avoid dumping where possible and to dispose of surplus fish through fishmeal or animal feed processing outlets.  In 1991 dumped fish accounted for only 9 per cent of fish withdrawn from the market. The vast bulk, 88 per cent, was used for fishmeal, while the remaining 3 per cent <Col N="104" /> was used for animal feed.  Available statistics show that the percentage of withdrawn fish disposed of by means of dumping has been reduced in each of the past four years from 23 per cent in 1988 to 9 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise that there has been a decline in the levels of dumping since 1989 would the Minister agree that the figures are still alarming? Would the Minister agree that the figures indicate that there is something fundamentally amiss with our marketing of fish?  Would the Minister also agree that fishmeal and animal feed alternatives are not the ideal use to which these valuable fish stocks should be put?  Has the Minister any plans to regulate the markets in such a way as to prevent this obscenity occurring every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with perishable products here.  It is the primary function of the producers organisations under EC regulations to align market supply of fish with demand.  It is extremely difficult to do that.  The intervention system is a safety net which helps fishermen stay in business.  I appreciate the Deputy's point.  We do not want fish to go for fishmeal or for animal feed.  We are making every effort to deal with this problem.  There are two fish producers organisations here, the Killybegs Fisherman's Organisation and the Irish Fish Producer's Organisation.  The KFO, for obvious geographical reasons, draw their members from Killybegs and Donegal generally.  They have a large fishmeal plant in the area.  The IFPO, headquartered in Dublin, have members throughout the country, including Donegal. There is one other small fishmeal plant in Galway.  If there are ten or 20 tonnes of surplus fish in one part of the country, the fish producers organisations must consider the economics involved and it is more economical to dump the fish than to transport it for fishmeal purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there be any fears that fish is being dumped in the channels or alongside the harbours, I should like to say they are <Col N="105" /> disposed of at sea under the direction of the Department's sea fishery officers.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see the day when fish are not being dumped but we are dealing with a perishable product, not with cows and calves which can be put aside until the next day.  Fish are killed at sea, not when they land.  We are well aware of the concern but I hope my explanation satisfied the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation in so far as it goes.  Would the Minister agree that there is something wrong and obscene about his statement that it is more economical for the fish to be dumped than to find some alternative method of marketing?  Given that one in three people are living on the poverty line here, surplus fish could be sold cheaply. Does the Minister have any figures of which species of fish have been dumped into the ocean in the past couple of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>A small amount of mackerel would be dumped and the others, by and large, would be white fish of various descriptions, for instance Saithe/Coley in the region of 12 tonnes, ray/skate in the region of 62 tonnes, mackerel in the region of 74 tonnes, spur dogfish, 108 tonnes and spotted dogfish, 403 tonnes.  With regard to finding a market, there is nobody more shrewd than Irish people and if the markets were available for those fish, they would be used.  There is obviously a glut of that type of fish at that time of the year and one cannot send a message to the bottom of the sea to the effect that only 200 tonnes are to be taken on a given day. Every effort is being made to reduce the level of dumping.  This is not a problem peculiar to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Freezing techniques are so sophisticated nowadays that I wonder why we could not freeze the fish.  I immediately think of Eastern Europe where there is a real food shortage.  With EC co-operation we should try to sell to that market seeing that they do not have the same level of fish production as us. We might be able to resolve the problem <Col N="106" /> in that way.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that it is wasteful to dump our wonderful clean fish when there is hunger in Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>These fish are not dumped when there is spare freezing capacity.  In referring to countries who would gladly avail of this fish it is no harm to mention to the House that the European Community and the United Nations are assisting in the purchase and supply of canned mackerel to Yugoslavia.  At Easter time approximately 13 container loads of fish left the canning plant in my own town and I hope that a further 500 tonnes of fish will go to Yugoslavia.  In the past we were often critical of the Community's concentration on the beef mountain.  Canning fish is an ideal solution because there is no problem with freezing or storing the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23 and 34 together.  I would refer the House to the reply given by the Minister for the Marine, Dr. Woods, on 23 June on this matter.</P>
      <P>In the areas covered by the conservation by-laws made by the Minister recently I would have to say that there is little prospect of worthwhile fishing for sea trout being possible this year. However, in large areas of the western seaboard covering counties Kerry, north Mayo and Donegal, good catches of sea trout continue to be made and prospects are quite good.</P>
      <P>The question of obtaining an objective viewpoint on the problem of the decline of sea trout in the west has already been dealt with through my Department's initiative in setting up a scientific working group, separate from the Sea Trout Action Group (STAG), to examine the issues.  While the programme planning, implementation and evaluation carried out by the scientific working group were all independent of STAG's operation, care was taken to include all the scientists working on the sea trout problem in Ireland &mdash; including those funded by STAG &mdash; in the membership of this scientific working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of this working group, which was issued last December, therefore represents a synthesis of the informed scientific views on this problem, and represents as objective a view as can be obtained.  I do not therefore consider <Col N="108" /> it necessary or desirable to bring in a foreign expert to overlay the scientific information already at my disposal.  I would also point out that a working group of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea which reviewed the available scientific data last summer concluded that the hypothesis that, in all probability, sea lice from fish farms are a major factor in the collapse of sea trout stocks in the west is not justified in the light of that data.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on the statistics that have been produced which say that 94 per cent of sea lice in the west originate in salmon cages? We have seen a constant decline in sea trout stocks since 1989 in the Connemara region and this has caused a very serious fall-off in the estimated 5,000 anglers who visit the region each year.  Is the Minister satisfied that scientific information supports the idea that sea lice originate within the salmon cages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply the scientific working group comprised of scientists from STAG, the Sea Trout Action Group, which is a pressure group, the Department and the Salmon Research Agency, all these scientists were of the opinion, as is the working group of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, that sea lice is not the main reason for the decline in sea trout.  However we are anxious to resolve the problem.  The Minister in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Deenihan on 23 June, announced a major action plan to combat the problem of declining numbers of sea trout in the west.  The programme pinpoints three areas of action but I will not delay the House by repeating this information as it is available in the Official Report of 23 June 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main objective is to ensure the wellbeing of wild fish stocks and angling tourism which we understand is worth £74 million to our economy each year. However, the salmon farming industry employs 1,100 workers in coastal communities where there are no other <Col N="109" /> sources of employment and that is worth some £30 million to the local economies. I am quite confident that the action plan which was announced by the Minister some time ago and which puts the emphasis on research, management strategy and conservation is the best way to tackle this very complex problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that an action plan has been introduced.  I agree with the Minister's last statement on the importance of fish farming as a potential source of employment in some of the areas worst hit by unemployment.</P>
      <P>Allegations are constantly being made against fish farming, particularly salmon farming, that sea lice originating in the salmon cages wipe out sea trout.  I think it is very important to have these allegations cleared up and the sooner this is done, the better for the development of both types of fishing, because it is causing great difficulty for fish farming at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with Deputy Barnes that it is absolutely essential to clear up this matter as quickly as possible to allow both industries to develop independently of each other as both are vitally important to the country, particularly in the west.  The present perception about fish farming does not lead to good relationships.  Now that the Minister has undertaken this initiative we have an opportunity to reach some conclusion and resolve the problem as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledges that this is a very serious problem affecting many people including the tourism industry.  There appears to be a reluctance to employ foreign experts to look at this problem, even though the two scientific groups appear to hold contradictory views.  Will the Minister reconsider employing foreign experts to give us their verdict on the cause of sea lice in trout?  Our wild trout are too important a resource to lose by not resolving this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with <Col N="110" /> Deputy O'Sullivan's point that the two groups of scientists hold contradictory views.  The scientists employed by the Sea Trout Action Group participated in the scientific working group which also comprised scientists from the Department and from the Salmon Research Agency. I also pointed out that a working group of the Internationl Council for the Exploration of the Sea reviewed the available scientific data.  I can appreciate that all they could do was review the scientific data made available to them but we must accept the integrity and independence of our scientists.  Our scientists are as good as scientists from anywhere else and I certainly value their judgment and opinions. I do not think engaging foreign experts would assist us in any way but would entail awaiting further reports. We have all the information necessary now and the Minister has taken the initiative. As Deputy Barnes pointed out, we should not waste any time and I shall certainly do my utmost in the Department to ensure that action is taken as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that there is not much point in having a development plan for sea trout until we find out the cause for the decline &mdash; the collapse &mdash; of the sea trout numbers in the west.  Three years after the decline was signalled clearly the Department of the Marine still do not know what the answer is.  That is ridiculous.  I could tell the Minister what the answer is: it is the presence of fish farms; nothing more and nothing less.  Is the Minister aware of the considerable use of Invomectin, an illegal chemical, in the control of sea lice? Does he realise that this could result in very serious problems for the people who eat farmed salmon if it gets into the food chain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that all experts differ, and Deputy Garland differs from all of the scientists.  As I have said, I value their judgments and recommendations and I must accept them.  I suggest that we await the initiative taken by the Minister and which he announced recently.  The <Col N="111" /> initiative pinpoints three areas of action of which I am sure the Deputy is aware. If the Deputy does not have that information, it is available in the Official Report in reply to a question tabled on 23 June.  I am not aware of the matter referred to by the Deputy.  No doubt, he will be anxious to provide the Department with the necessary information and we shall certainly take a particular interest in it.</P>

Its findings were based on a continuing programme of monitoring of radioactivity in the seas around Ireland.  It found from analysis of radioactivity in seawaters, sediments, seaweed, fish and shellfish that the contamination levels in the Irish Sea between 1988 and 1990 had continued to decline, although the rate of decrease was less than that in previous years.  There was no evidence to suggest that fish stocks had been affected by radioactive discharges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the state and size of fish stocks are monitored regularly throughout the year by the Department as part of a continuing programme of assessment of fish resources in the Irish Sea.  To date no measurable impact of Sellafield discharges <Col N="112" /> on Irish Sea fish stocks has been found.</P>
    <P>This issue has not been discussed at Community level and, in the light of the evidence available, I would not anticipate any developments in that regard.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the extent to which quotas for whitefish have been unexploited in each of the past three years; the steps being taken to ensure the further development of this sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Unexploited whitefish quotas in 1991 amounted to approximately 19,000 tonnes, with an estimated value of £20 million.  This compares with approximately 25,000 tonnes, with an estimated value of £22 million, in 1990 and 17,000 tonnes, valued at £12 million, in 1989.  These figures represent the difference between actual catches and nominal quotas but need not in all cases correspond to real fishing opportunities.</P>
      <P>In an initiative to address the problem of under-utilised whitefish quotas off the west and south-west coasts where real fishing opportunities, valued at some £10 million annually, exist, the former Minister and Tánaiste introduced last year a special whitefish boat licensing scheme to bring badly needed all-weather boats into the Irish fleet.  In December last licence approvals were issued to 20 successful applicants.  I am confident that the entry of these boats into the fleet will make a significant contribution towards the development of the whitefish catching sector and the take-up of Ireland's quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Minister has made a strong case for a relaxation of the restrictions on the capacity of the Irish fishing fleet to the European Commission in the context of the multi-annual guidance programme for the fleet for the period 1992 to 1996.  Specifically, we have sought the addition of 5,000 tonnes to the Irish fishing fleet to allow for the further development of the whitefish sector of the <Col N="113" /> industry.  Discussions are continuing with the Commission on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some indication as to the trend this year with regard to the catch?  In his reply he indicated his confidence that the 20 additional licences would have an impact this year.  Could the Minister indicate how the catches for the earlier part of 1992 compare with those for the earlier part of 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information requested.  The additional boats, eight of which are fishing and three of which have entered the fleet but are not yet fishing, number 11 at present.  Several of those boats are located in the south-west, in the Dingle area, as the Deputy knows.  Increased landings have amounted to some 535,000 tonnes, valued at about £800,000.  Those are the only figures available to give some indication of a trend. It is to be hoped that the trend will grow and will take up many of the under-utilised species.  Deputy Barnes referred to that point earlier.  Of course, that is one of the reasons that the Government are trying to obtain approval for another 5,000 tonnes from the Commission.</P>

      <P>A judgment was given my Mr. Justice Johnson in the High Court on 26 May 1992 in this matter.  The Minister is examining the judgment in detail and is taking legal advice on the implications of the judgment for the particular case and for the wider area of aquaculture and fisheries policy.  My consideration together with that of the Minister <Col N="114" /> includes whether any aspect of the order of the court should be appealed.  I do not wish to comment further on the case at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the issue is being explored.  The judgment would seem to dictate that there had been a deliberate attempt to use only one section of the Fisheries Act and not to use the broader provision which would give greater access and rights to the community. The issue is serious, particularly in the light of community rights and, it is to be hoped, regional powers.  Would the Minister not agree that on environmental grounds it is very important that the community and the individuals involved in that region have the right of reply and to have the same access as that enjoyed by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention or that of the Minister or the Department to deny people their rights nor to deny them the opportunity to defend their rights.  This issue involves a fish culture licence and a designation procedure, referred to by the Deputy.  With a fish culture licence the procedure followed provides for an administrative inquiry. But a fish culture licence goes hand in hand with a foreshore licence.  In order to obtain a foreshore licence one must place notices in the newspapers circulated in the area concerned.  As far as I understand the position, the information is also made available in the local Garda stations.  The Deputy was quite right in her reference to a designation procedure, which is a lengthy procedure that gives opportunity for an oral inquiry. If one applies for an area within the designated area and is successful one then receives an aquaculture licence, but in addition to that one must also have a foreshore licence.  This was not a matter concerning the issue of a licence of which the public would not be aware.  I am of the opinion that the High Court order may be perfected, possibly today.  After that we have 21 days to decide what the Department should do.</P>

      <P>The Department granted permission to the Royal St. George Yacht Club to temporarily moor pontoons at St. Michael's Wharf for the period April to August 1992.  The purpose of the pontoons is to improve the club's access to the water.  The Royal St. George Yacht Club will bear the full cost of installing the pontoons including paying a licence fee to my Department for the use of the waterspace.</P>

I do not have the information to hand as to when this commitment was given by the interim board, but I know the application was made on 11 February 1992.  If that commitment was given it surprises me that we did not consult with them.  We have had no correspondence from Dún Laoghaire Corporation in <Col N="116" /> relation to this.  I know that is not the point, but I would prefer an opportunity to check the dates of when the commitment was given and the issuing of the licence.  A considerable number of conditions are attached to this licence, including that a fee, as advised by the Valuation Office, will be paid to the Department.

      <Quest>the total shipping tonnage under the Irish flag in each of the past five years; if, as part of their commitment to the expansion of the Irish shipping fleet, the Government have any plans for the re-establishment of a publicly-owned shipping company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The totals for the deadweight tonnage of the fleet at the end of each of the years 1986-91 were as follows: 1986, 141,926; 1987, 148,529; 1988, 157,007; 1989, 167,708; 1990, 190,319; 1991, 201,024.</P>
      <P>The total at the end of 1991 shows an increase of 42 per cent over the end 1986 figure.  This reflects, <i>inter alia</i> the impact of the measures introduced by the Government in 1987 to assist fleet development and ensure certain minimum capacity requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pressing need is for shipping services which provide fast and reliable access to the main European markets which account for more than 70 per cent of our trade.  The aim of shipping policy is to ensure that, as far as possible, Ireland's <Col N="118" /> trade routes and needs are catered for efficiently and on an economic and competitive basis.  In that regard, there are no proposals to establish a publicly owned shipping company.</P>
    <P>The Government have proposed in a detailed submission to the EC Commission that Community Support Framework funding be provided to assist investment in unitised capacity in both the lift on-lift off and roll on-roll off modes and while the Commission response was not positive, discussions with the Commission are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that only a small proportion of our shipping requirements is catered for by the tonnage now available to us?  Given the crisis in shipping since the liquidation of Irish Shipping and the Fianna Fáil party's stated policy at that time of their intention to re-establish a publicly owned shipping company, does the Minister think the question of re-establishing a publicly owned shipping company should be reexamined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  While I have not got the exact information, I am well aware from my location that a considerable amount of our exports go through Larne, apart from the east and south, because of the facilities available there.  We dealt with this in Priority Question No. 3 and the necessity to develop and modernise our seaports. Every effort is being made to do this because, if we can develop our seaports, it will contribute to a continued increase in shipping tonnage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister <Col N="119" /> agree that, in the event of a crisis, which we witnessed recently in the Gulf, we would be totally reliant on foreign fleets to bring cargoes to and from this country? As we are an island nation, will the Minister agree that it is vital to have a shipping line of our own to ensure there are routes in and out of this country in a crisis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be practical to invest in a national shipping line in these difficult times when people have to accept financial cutbacks.  A shipping line would cost a considerable amount of money and none of my constituents has expressed difficulties in this regard.  Of course, it is an aspiration but I recognise the excellent service available from Larne to Stranraer and, if it did not exist, we would certainly have greater problems. If we had proper infrastructure, with assistance from Europe, there would be private investment because of our further plans in relation to harbour development and tidying up the 1946 Act.  I am convinced that there will be substantial increases in tonnage.</P>

    <P>Commercial fishing has been part of the management of the Moy for many years and the scientific advice available to me is that it has not adversely affected the level of stock.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from previous replies on this issue that a review of the commercial operation has been carried out by the Department of the Marine and that a number of measures have already been taken in the interest of conserving salmon stocks.  These measures include: the operation of the traps was put back from 1 February to 1 March to allow more spring fish up river; netting was suspended for three weeks from 27 May to 17 June at the height of the season when it became apparent that salmon runs were not capable of supporting a commercial net fishery at that time and the number of hours netting has been reduced from 24 to 8.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that the Fisheries Research Centre have now initiated a major tagging study which will quantify the proportion of fish being taken by each engine, i.e. drift, draft, trap and rod fishing in the Moy system.  They will, in due course, be making an assessment of <Col N="121" /> the total stock available to the system. This study will give a much better basis on which to advise on commercial activities in the future and provide the baseline data needed to establish what level of exploitation should be allowed by each engine.</P>
    <P>Until the findings of this study are known the scientific advice available to the Minister is that there should be no change in the exploitation regime in the commercial fishery at Ballina but, as mentioned earlier, the Minister is reviewing urgently the planned netting level for the rest of the season.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should mention also that the Minister recently received two major reports on the development of the Moy river system.  Both these reports emphasise the importance of managing and developing the system on an integrated basis.  Adoption of this approach will have implications for the balance between various forms of exploitation.</P>

      <P>While the Minister dealt very fully with Questions Nos. 18 and 22 he did not answer my question referring to drift netting, which is not under the control of the Moy Fishery.  I am sure the Minister realises that my question refers to drift netting at sea, an entirely different matter, which impinges on the salmon running into the Moy.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the report from the Moy Fishery to the effect that 70 licences were issued last year for drift netting. Will he agree that it would make economic sense &mdash; and conservation &mdash; to buy out these drift nets for a reasonable price and destroy them?  Will he also agree that drift nets do not serve a commercial or conservation purpose and the netting, if it needs to be done, should be within estuarine waters under the control of the Moy Fishery or whatever other fishery operate in a particular area?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>whether he intends to issue prohibition orders on all beaches around our coastline to tackle the problem of sand removal, bearing in mind that exceptions could then be made where traditional rights and licence applications would pose no threat.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions governing the issue of prohibitory orders are contained in section 6 of the Foreshore Act, 1933.  Under this section, the Minister for the Marine may, in certain circumstances, ban the removal without licence of beach material from the seashore.</P>
      <P>The seashore in this context means the foreshore and every beach, bank and cliff contiguous thereto and includes all sands and rocks contiguous to the foreshore. In Ireland the seashore, excluding the foreshore, is by and large in private ownership.</P>
      <P>Prohibitory orders may only be issued in certain circumstances, where the Minister is of the opinion that the removal of unrestricted removal of beach material from any particular area of seashore has affected or is likely to affect prejudicially any public rights or has caused or is likely to cause injury to any land or to any building, wall, pier or structure.</P>
      <P>The Minister is anxious to substantially increase his powers to ban the removal of sand from beaches and plans to bring his proposals before the Oireachtas as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that removing sand from beaches is very serious?  It has been going on for some time in Ballybunion, much to the discomfiture of the local tourist interests and the golf club?  Recently in Portrane, County Dublin, there was a very serious attack in this way on the sand dunes.  The Minister has agreed that the Foreshore Act, 1933 is totally inadequate because, apart from anything else, fines are much too low.  The environmental action programme <Col N="123" /> was announced in January 1990 and a foreshore Bill was supposed to be introduced then.  That is two and a half years ago but nothing has been done; it is not good enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The main item of interest at the June Maritime Transport Council was the proposal for a Council regulation applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within member states.  This allows vessels registered under the flags of member states to participate in the coastal trades of other member states, that is, to pick up cargoes at one port within a member state and deliver that cargo to another port within the same country.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an open ports policy.  Traditionally, some member states, principally the Mediterranean countries, have had closed coastal trades with only national flag vessels having access to cargoes with both a domestic origin and destination.  This was adjudged to be in conflict with the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome and with provisions regarding the rights of establishment.  In particular the terms of the Single European Act require the removal of barriers to free and fair competition within the Community by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions lasting more than five years a compromise formula has been agreed which will open access to coastal trades within member states on a phased basis.  Work on this problem was a major item during the Irish Presidency and I am glad to say that many of the <Col N="126" /> principles established under our stewardship such as the gradual phasing in of liberalisation and the distinction between mainland and island cabotage, have been retained in the final agreement.</P>
    <P>The Council also called for work on two other important areas of Community interest to be expedited.  These are the proposals to create a Community shipping register and the agreement on a directive on vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods in packaged form or in bulk.  Ireland has been keenly supportive of this latter measure which will be of major help in ensuring that cargoes whether in bulk or in containers are accurately described and that this information is communicated to the shipowner, the master of the vessel and each port of call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State tell the House how the proposed Council directive which will lay down the minimum requirements in relation to vessels entering or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be of help in resolving the problems which have arisen following the mv <i>Kilkenny</i> disaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This directive which was discussed at the meeting of the Council of Ministers which I attended recently has two main objectives.  First, it will ensure that the shipowner or the master of the ship are made fully aware by the shipper or his agent if any dangerous or polluting goods in packaged form or in bulk will be carried.  Second, and this will be of interest to Deputy Stafford, the operator of a vessel carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be required to notify the competent authorities in the Community port of destination and to provide a position report as soon as the vessel enters the coastal zone of a member state.  The finer details of the directive, including the length of advance notice to be given to member states, tonnage and the threshold for reporting requirements are still under consideration by the working party.  If this directive had been in place already the <Col N="127" /> situation might have been different in relation to the mv <i>Kilkenny.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister of State say if the owner of the vessel, rather than the packager or the sender, will be held responsible in relation to all the cargo? This question gave rise to difficulties in the case of the mv <i>Kilkenny</i> when it seemed that one or the other did not take responsibility.</P>

      <P>As I said, the finer details will be worked out possibly at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers in Edinburgh towards the end of this year under the British Presidency.  I cannot confirm if the owner will be held responsible but I can only assume &mdash; perhaps it is wrong to do so &mdash; that he will have to accept some responsibility.  We will raise this point with the Council of Ministers, the Commission and the Presidency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I commence my contribution by congratulating Mr. Jacques Delors on his reappointment as President of the EC.  The European Community could not have a better man at the helm; he is very committed and fair-minded.  I believe that individual Irish citizens or groups should be satisfied at having a person of the calibre of Mr. Delors at the Head of the Community.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Taoiseach and read what he had to say I must confess to having mixed feelings.  For example, I am a little disappointed he did not spell out in simple language and in great detail what the Lisbon Summit has to offer Ireland.  For instance, what do the Cohesion and Structural Funds mean to the Irish people?  Many people will be asking this question.  I am at a loss to inform people because I do not know precisely what is the position.  I would urge the Taoiseach to clarify this position as quickly as possible since there has been too much speculation to date about the Cohesion and Structural Funds.  I hope the Taoiseach will avail of the earliest opportunity to say precisely what is the position of the Government and what are the benefits to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks on the progress made towards the implementation of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.  I should have liked the Taoiseach to have developed his thinking on what this will mean for Ireland.  My view is it will be good for Ireland. Throughout my political life, even before I entered politics, living in a Border county, born 100 yards from the Border, between Donegal and Tyrone, I and the people of the community in which I grew up always could see the evils, not of political partition but of the economic border between North and South whose roots go back to the economic war of the thirties fought madly by the late Éamon de Valera, former President and Taoiseach. There may have been arguments in favour of it but the price of economic war in this country, not only in economic terms but in divisions between our people, is incalculable.  I should like the Government to clarify the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Single Market.  I welcome with open arms anything which affords open market between the North and the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to ponder for a few moments the type of Ireland in which we in Border counties have been living. For example, somebody living in Cork can conduct business with somebody living in, say, Kerry without any obstruction whatever.  But Governments in this House who preached anti-partition followed economic policies which interfered with natural trading and marketing between neighbours on both sides of the Border.  That must be inconsistent with the real thinking on Irish unity in that there must be economic unity in Ireland before political unity.  This was something Fianna Fáil seemed unable to understand.  They were blind to the fact that one had to proceed first, along the path towards economic union and free trade.  I notice the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, shaking his head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not criticise the Minister of State because had I been born in and grown up in Galway, I would not know exactly what it was a Deputy representing a Border constituency was talking about.  I appreciate that and do not say so lightly but I grew up in a Border county.  I know how difficult it was for people on both sides of the Border to have to avoid Customs officers if they wanted to do business with each other, not because they wanted to be dishonest or to smuggle but because it was a convenient, natural thing for them to do so. The Minister of State's Party, by fighting an economic war &mdash; and neither he nor any present Member of his Party was responsible for it &mdash; put a Border in economic terms between North and South. With the benefit of hindsight, they can see what that did to communities on both sides of the Border.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Single Market with open arms.  It will allow business people on both sides of the Border to trade, uninterrupted with each other and, as they do business with each other, they will get to know each other and push away the political fears that at present divide them. <Col N="173" /> So far as I am concerned, that is the excitement of being in Europe; that is the excitement I foresee for the generation coming after me.  If I have any regrets in public life, it is that I am not beginning rather than having spent 30 years participating.</P>
    <P>Ireland's future is in Europe.  When I talk about the future of Ireland I am talking about a new society in Ireland, free of bitterness, hatred, dissension, murder and all of the things we detest. Europe has come to our rescue.  People who oppose Europe and membership of the EC should stop and ask themselves what it is they are opposing.  Are they opposing an opportunity to do away with the evil things we detest in Irish society?</P>
    <P>Most of these people are against violence, are in favour of peace, but are blind to the opportunities the European Market affords us.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement the Taoiseach mentioned political co-operation. Again I was somewhat disappointed he did not develop his thinking on this matter.  I hope he will do so at the earliest possible opportunity.  What does political co-operation within Europe mean for Ireland?  Most people think it is about co-operating with the German, French and Italian armies.  It is not; in kitchen sink, village pump politics, it means most of all our co-operating politically with people on the other side of the Border and with Great Britain.  Where does Britain stand in the matter of political co-operation? Britain was a signatory to the Maastricht agreement and has taken part in the most recent Lisbon Summit.  Now that Britain is about to take over the EC presidency, what will Mr. John Major do about political co-operation in Northern Ireland?  For far too long the British Government have been saying to the world: we are there as a peackeeping force.  On a world stage, in many ways, that is a very convincing argument but the people who look at it very closely, must ask if the British have really been keeping the peace there.  With the sincerity and determination that people like me would wish?  For far too long Great <Col N="174" /> Britain adopted a non-neutral position. Now, having examined its policy on the Northern problem, Westminster has taken up a neutral position.  I think the British Government now realise that the only way to establish peace on the island of Ireland is for them to adopt a neutral stance.</P>
    <P>The political co-operation between Ireland and Great Britain that is the result of European union is completely new to us.  Irish people now have an opportunity to sit down as equals with Great Britain and co-operate on all fronts but especially on the question of establishing peace and normality between the two traditions in the North which seem to be unable to devise political structures by which they can govern themselves.  I welcome Prime Minister John Major's initiative during Great Britain's Presidency of the European Community to use the opportunity to work out structures that will bring peace in Ireland faster than we could do ourselves.</P>
    <P>What does political co-operation mean to the Republic and Northern Ireland? Does it mean that we must help the two communities in the North to find their own level and that once they have found their own level we must co-operate with whatever they ask us to do?  That is a problem we must face eyeball to eyeball. We must look on people on the opposite side of the political spectrum in the North, as equals, as fellow Irishmen and try to bring peace between the two communities.</P>
    <P>What does political co-operation mean to the two communities in the North who have representatives in the European Parliament?  If there is a commitment on the part of the two communities in Northern Ireland they must recognise that the Maastricht Treaty and the conference just ended in Lisbon is very much about political co-operation.  We must sit down and work out what it is we must co-operate politically on.  Otherwise the whole thing is a sham.</P>
    <P>On the question of political co-operation, let me ask the House and the Government what does that mean to the people of Lifford and Strabane who now <Col N="175" /> have to tolerate the structures that are being called &ldquo;checkpoint Paddy&rdquo;.  Monstrosities are being constructed along the Northern side of the Border which are frightening.  I say that not to be emotive but as someone who is trying to understand what the British are at on the Northern side of the Border.  These compounds that the British Government are building from Muff in County Donegal across to Carlingford Lough in County Down are in no way a contribution to peace and normality in Northern Ireland; they are physical evidence of the lack of understanding on the part of the British Government of what is happening in Ireland.  These &ldquo;checkpoint Paddys&rdquo; will not prevent the violence which is happening in Belfast or in Britain and which will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>If the British Government are signatories to the Maastricht Treaty and if they believe in political co-operation, then let them listen to the voice of reason from moderate people in this House who say that their policies are wrong and that there is no need whatever for the structures they are now building between the North and the South of Ireland.  When I go across the Border from Lifford to Strabane and see these frightening structures, that says to me that the people of Strábane and the people of Lifford are enemies, that they do not trust each other and that these compounds are being built to protect one community against the other.  How ridiculous can one get?  It is insulting to the people, whether Catholic or Protestant, nationalist or unionist.  The average person who crosses the Border is decent and law-abiding.  The bombs or ammunition or instruments of warfare that the British Government may have collected have not been seized at normal cross-Border checkpoints or approved roads.  There is no sense in building these compounds.  They are annoying many people and I object in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke in great detail about combating drug trafficking, and I welcome that decision with open arms. There must be co-operation between all <Col N="176" /> of the world's police forces.  I know there is great co-operation between the police forces in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Garda Síochána and the European police and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union we have lost sight of the fact that in 1950 under the Schuman Plan, Germany and France pooled their resources in the interests of economic recovery, particularly in the context of the coal and steel industries, to prevent those two countries from going to war again.  Both Germany and France suffered in two World Wars in the first half of this century and within one year the message got through to Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg, countries which also suffered from two major wars, and they joined in the European Coal and Steel Community which would act as a bulwark aainst the threat of communism in Eastern Europe. That was the beginning of the Common Market.  People have forgotten the thinking of Schuman which was later so well developed by Adenauer and General de Gaulle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>While I might disagree with Deputy Harte on some of his interpretations of economic history, it is interesting that the last thought which he aired was in fact one of the first thoughts I was going to pick up on.  Of course, he is quite right.  Ireland's recent referendum result was a triumph of logic over hysteria. The Lisbon Summit followed along the same lines.  After the Danish referendum the major European institutions showed a degree of hysterical reaction which, to say the least, shook the confidence of even the hardiest proponents of closer European economic integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our own referendum campaign was marked and marred by hysteria.  A positive shoal of red herrings was introduced into that debate and issues which we could and should have discussed were not discussed.  We focused on the negative rather than the positive.  The post-referendum analysis seems, to me at least, to focus on the claims which were made <Col N="177" /> by the Pro-Life Movement.  Let us not lose sight of the fact that there were others involved in the negative campaign, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign, the destructive campaign, the campaign which would deny the opportunity to Irish men and women on both sides of the Border to unite in a common Europe.  Those other negative campaigners also had claims and those claims, too, left their mark.  That is why I welcome the statement that was made by the Taoiseach here because it certainly seemed to me to put to rest some of the ghosts raised in recent campaigns.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget we had posters claiming that the fall-out from the Maastricht Treaty would be nuclear.  We had a claim that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would cut social welfare. We had a claim that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would mean that judges would be travel agents, particularly for women.  We had a claim that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would mean conscription.</P>
    <P>All of these claims were false.  They were false when they were made and the tragic thing about it is that political leaders, people who claim status in the political regime of Ireland, made these claims knowing they were false, knowing tha they were nothing to do with the Maastricht Treaty, and knowing that, if anything, they were the exact antithesis of what European Union is all about.</P>
    <P>The benefit which will come from the Lisbon Summit is that it will help to steady nerves not just here but throughout Europe.  In Ireland, it will help to refocus public debate on Europe, the real issues relating to Europe, the development of European Union and the philosophical notions which are at the core of European Union and turn us away from the ghosts which were conjured up during the campaign, particularly those conjured up by the extreme Left in their latest disguise.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Taoiseach on his report to the House.  He dealt in a clear and business-like manner with the achievements of the Summit.  I am at a loss to understand the views of the last Fine Gael speaker.  To my mind, the Taoiseach's speech was one of the clearest we have had on the results of any <Col N="178" /> summit.  For example, it was noteworthy for its total lack of jargon and the fact that it dealt in clear, business-like and unambiguous language with core issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte seems to have a rather bizarre view of the economic effects of partition.  I accept that his viewpoint is closer to the tragedy of partition than mine.  I was fortunate not to be raised in a Border area, but I am familiar with the economic consequences of borders and that is why I am a very firm advocate of European union, as is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no claim to knowing nothing about it, but I do not claim prescience in everything, which, apparently, is precisely the case with Deputy Harte.</P>
      <P>One of the main arguments I put forward for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote would represent a renewal of economic partition on this island.  That is a matter of fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt Deputy Harte is sincere when he harps back to the economic war.  However, the relevance of the economic war to the Lisbon Summit defeats me.  The economic chaos in counties both North and South of the Border comes from an artificial and obscene border and work which was left undone.  Of course, borders do not just exist on maps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Border between North and South had been in existence for ten years before an economic border was put up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Harte, I believe borders also exist in the hearts and minds of men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europe offers Ireland a model now more than ever before.  When Schuman and Monnet put together the blueprint <Col N="179" /> for the ECSC and their plan for a new Europe they were making a leap of the imagination; they were projecting themselves forward to a Europe which would not focus on the difference of the European nations but to a Europe which would celebrate the commonality of the European nations.  They decided that Europe as a whole was far greater than the sum of all the parts.  I agree with Deputy Harte that there is a lesson to be learned from that by every politician and public leader here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>They made a huge leap forward in Europe and made remarkable progress.  The progress made within the first 18 months of the ECSC was startling beyond belief because brave political leaders made a leap of the imagination.  At the time Schuman and Monnet were considering their plans the big political argument was the &ldquo;pasturalisation&rdquo; of Germany, the destruction of the industrial and economic heartland of Germany. However, there were wiser people there and they said that this would only lead to deprivation, depression and a downward spiral for all of Europe.  Of course, their leap of the imagination was successful only because it was grasped on the far side of the border by Adenauer. Here again there is a parallel and a lesson for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European leaders of the fifties could have focused on their grievances. If any nation had a grievance, France and Germany had &mdash; France lost two generations against German hostility and Germany lost all of its economic might and half of its national land.  However, they put that sense of grievance behind them.  They decided to focus on the things they could do and not on the issues they could not immediately solve.  There is a parable, a parallel and a simile there for those on this island who at this time face each other across tables.  It would be remarkable if in 1992 Irish political leaders &mdash; Unionist, Nationalist, Republican, <Col N="180" /> Socialist and so on &mdash; could make the same type of leap of the imagination.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Harte rightly said, regardless of the side of the Border on which they live Irish people are sad, sick and sore at the results of division.  Irish people on both sides of the Border have come to a consciousness when they look at Europe and see what can be done when people decide to submerge their differences and focus on the positives and things they can do when they come together.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte and I have had private conversations about this issue and we accept that there is a great tragedy on this island and that people have to make a huge leap; they have to break away from history and forget all the battles and things which went in the past.  This is not to say that we should turn our minds on our culture and traditions.  I am simply saying that people need to be practical and realise that they have to spend their time more in the future than in the past. European Union is important not just in terms of economic progress on this island but in terms of political progress on this island.  The lessons learned from the Treaty of Paris, the Treaty of Luxembourg and, ultimately, the Maastricht Treaty, will have, in political terms, a major impact on this island.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes remaining, I wish to refer to one or two issues dealt with more directly by the Taoiseach in his contribution.  He referred to the issue of subsidiarity.  It was interesting for any student of public administration or politics to see the issue of subsidiarity coming, as it did, to the forefront of the debate on the Maastricht Treaty not just here but in other European member states.  This is interesting because the discussion on subsidiarity was a major issue in Ireland in the sixties when we started to talk about economic planning.  At that time the view commonly put forward in academic journals and political debates in this House was that the principle of subsidiarity was important, should be developed and should be used as the borderline between the different levels of government in this State.  The subsidiarity <Col N="181" /> principle will be increasingly important in the new Europe.  I agree with the point made by Deputy Barry in this respect.  I do not agree with much of what he said but I agree with the points he made about subsidiarity.  It will not only be important to have subsidiarity between the boundaries of a nation, that is, between local and central Government, but it will be very important in the months ahead to establish a clear principle of subsidiarity which will apply between the member states of Europe and, in particular, between the growing power of the central institutions of the European Community and the member states.</P>
    <P>It will be very important in the long term to establish a cohesion within Europe and political principles on which progress can be made.  Subsidiarity is one of those principles; in fact, it is as important as issues such as the funds and what will happen in Denmark.  We should explore the principle of subsidiarity and debate it in this House.  I wish I had more time to deal with the Cohesion Fund.  I compliment the Taoiseach on the points he made today about the Delors II package and the way it has been safeguarded in the Lisbon agreement.  I also compliment him for addressing in a fair and forthright manner some of the hysterical reaction to the fact that we are at a very early stage of negotiation on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>These statements give us an opportunity to comment on the general political events surrounding the Lisbon Summit and the consequences of the Referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  The massive support shown here for the Treaty indicates the inherent trust Irish people have in their political leaders, because there is complete and utter confusion among the vast majority of the population about the workings of the European Community, its institutions, the direction in which it is heading in the decade ahead and this country's position in the Community in the closing years of this century.  It is incumbent on the Government and on leaders in politics, industry and other areas of Irish <Col N="182" /> life to ensure that the people understand what is at stake in the formulation of the new European Union.</P>
      <P>As a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, of which you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are an esteemed co-chairman, it is obvious that the debates and meetings that have taken place have resulted in a breakdown of the barriers that existed for generations between Irish and British politicians.  It is interesting to note that probably for the first time in the history of the State an elected British politician, at the last plenary session in Dublin Castle in the closing days of 1991, spoke in Irish about the continuing need for dialogue and discussion. That stage of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association has been a success, and hopefully it will continue to be so, in the context of breaking down the barriers of nationalism and isolationism that have existed for far too long in this country.</P>
      <P>The Referendum on the Maastricht Treaty created all kinds of confusion.  The details of the Lisbon Summit are not as well known by the people because the red herrings were not brought to the surface to the same extent.  However, on the day after the Lisbon Summit the national newspapers gave credit to the Taoiseach for sorting out with his dear friend, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, a problem in regard to the Northern Ireland talks which apparently had been insurmountable prior to the Lisbon Summit.  the perception appears to be that, of all the complex issues that must be dealt with before the end of this year, the Government want to present some juicy political meat to the Irish people in the event of their having to go to the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the meeting in London this week resulted in the commencement of Strand Two of the talks on Northern Ireland, although I am not sure what the Irish Government said to the Unionists, in particular, in regard to Articles 2 and 3 that seemed to send them away happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my lifetime there has not been a war in western Europe, but the history of the <Col N="183" /> continental people over a thousand years indicates national and tribal rebellions on an ongoing basis.  For the first time in the last 500 years, 50 years has passed without an outbreak of war.  The generation of the fifties and succeeding years have not experienced a war in western Europe, as did their ancestors.  As has been stressed by Deputy Harte and others, the fact that political leaders have set aside their nationalist tendancies has brought about unprecedented economic development, peace and prosperity, and the Lisbon Summit is another step in that direction.  It is evident to business people and industrialists that those living in the Far East are committed, almost to the point of fanaticism, to development and economic prosperity.  It is fundamental that this country be allowed play its full part in the overall development of the Community.  As an island on the periphery of Europe, if we do not compete with people who know what the Community is about and can generate ideas for further development, we will fall further behind.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Taoiseach's strategy to set the stage for the time when he will present his Government to the people, be that later this year or in 1993.  It is interesting to note that many communities, organisations and townships have carried out great work in the last number of years in breaking down barriers, the promotion of their areas, the development of tourism and twinning, and the development of more harmonious relationships, particularly with Great Britain, which was, and still is to a great extent, our largest market.  It is a sign of the Taoiseach's wish and that of his Government for continued wellbeing in the political arena at home that he constantly seeks consensus.  Consensus is obviously very important in the context of critical political issues that have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Until we can present ourselves on the stage of Europe as equals with all other member states, we will not have dispensed with the old ideas of nationalism. I will give one example.  Last Sunday <Col N="184" /> week the Taoiseach was accorded an official civic reception in Westport at a reception, a festival for displaying the foods of Europe in the context of the promotion of tourism.  The committee concerned engaged in long and anxious deliberations before agreeing, out of respect for the British flag, that it should not fly in the town square with the other flags of Europe.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice attended this official function at which, as a result of the actions of a small minority of people, the British flag did not fly.  I am not suggesting that the committee involved would in any way show deliberate disrespect to either the British people or the British Government, but that happened.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether the Taoiseach is aware of it, but if in discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, on the margins of a Summit in Lisbon he can sort out a blockage in ten minutes, and if the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Justice go to London and, on the sensitive issue of Strand Two of the talks on Northern Ireland, can convince Unionists that they should sit around a table with them, we should be in a position to have our Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and other public representatives or any Irish people say, &ldquo;we respect you for what you are, as a member of the European Community and as such we are entitled to stand on the same stage as you and <i>vice versa</i>&rdquo;.  It is important to have an ongoing information campaign about how the Government see Ireland and its people playing their part in the new Europe.  In 1985, 500 Irish people were in Munich and this year there are in the region of 5,000 most of whom are there by choice.  Job opportunities may not be as great as people had hoped, but they are there.  If we have the capacity to produce quality people we should be able to send them onto the European stage as equals, as promoters for all that is best in a peaceful modern Europe.  It is in that context that I hope the Government continue to press the case for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with everything the Taoiseach said or with his method of presentation but it is important to bear <Col N="185" /> in mind that in a generation which has not seen war we have ratified the Maastricht Treaty and moved on to the Lisbon Summit.  We brought our population with us to help them better themselves and our country in a prosperous and peaceful Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I hope this is one of the last occasions in which this House debates a European Summit in this manner.  The recent referendum which saw such an overwhelming endorsement by the people of Ireland for the European ideal also demonstrated a keen appetite among the public for more information and more debate on Europe.  The Progressive Democrats have long supported the establishment of a specialised committee to debate European Affairs and I hope that before another Summit takes place such a committee will be operating and that this House, and the wider public, will be better informed on the subject than we can be at present.  I hope these matters can be resolved in a mature way between the various parties before we return after the summer recess.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Portuguese Government on the successful conclusion of their historic first period in the Presidency of the Community.  As we know from our own experience no Presidency is ever easy and that has certainly been true over the past six months.  The many successes which have been secured are due, in no small part, to the efforts of Portugal, and demonstrate once again the contribution which even its smallest member states can bring to the Community.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, we first judge any Community Summit by its implications for us, but it would be naive to look no further than this.  In many ways the real test for Community Summits is how they progress the wider Community agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Portuguese Presidency and the Lisbon Summit occurred at a crucial time for the EC which is now in the midst of a delicate transition between the Community as we have known it and the post-Maastricht <Col N="186" /> Union.  In addition we are fast approaching the January 1993 deadline for the completion of the Single Market. The pressures for enlargement, for redistribution of existing funds towards poorer regions and the ongoing tragedy of the Yugoslavian conflict on our borders have combined to test the Community in an unprecedented way.</P>
    <P>Judged in this context the Lisbon Summit represents a considerable success for the Community.  If our concerns about the actual increases to be agreed in the Delors II package remain to be finalised, they are still all to be played for and the Summit has seen tangible progress in many other important areas.</P>
    <P>The three issues of enlargement, budget negotiations and the conflict in the former Yugoslavia undoubtedly dominated the Summit and all have important implications for this country.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the European Council's unequivocal determination to press ahead with European construction and fully support plans to enlarge the Community.  Indeed, given the changes which are taking place in Europe plans for enlargement must proceed as quickly as possible.  Much of the groundwork and informal preparations for such enlargement can commence now, but it is vital that any formal developments await the full ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, including the agreement of the Delors II package among the member states.  Equally it must be the Community's aim to ensure that newcomers to the Twelve accept the full Union package rather than settling for some sort of half way house even for an intermediate period.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there has been disappointment here at the failure of the Lisbon Summit to finally agree specific targets under Delors II.  The reality, however, is that everything is still to be played for.  The debate here has focused crudely on particular sums as if success or failure can be judged in pounds, shillings and pence.  In reality, the Delors II package is about much more than mere balance sheets.  A central aim of Community policy to date, <Col N="187" /> and a key element of the Maastricht Treaty, has been the promotion of cohesion and the narrowing of the wealth gap between member states.  This is as important as an underlying philosophy of the Community as it is in purely financial terms as the Community develops into a real union of shared and common interests and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that the Council conclusions agreed at Maastricht again underline this philosophy and are important markers for future negotiations in this area.  In particular we welcome the confirmation in the conclusions of the essential dimension of economic and social cohesion; the agreement to put in place the new Cohesion Fund in early 1993; confirmation of plans to reinforce other structural policies and the decision to decide various components of Delors II in Edinburgh.  If we think back to the bitter arguments that were fought over the original Common Agricultural Policy reform plans and now see their eventual success, we have significant reason for optimism in the negotiations which will take place over the Delors II package.</P>
    <P>One important development in this regard has been the decision to give equal treatment to five East German Lander and East Berlin as Objective 1 regions along with countries like ours.  This inevitably means that any increased funds will now be shared among a larger group of countries and underlines the need for substantial increases in such funds.  The progress of the Maastricht Treaty ratification process was, of course, central to the debates at Lisbon and this country should note with satisfaction the welcome given by the Heads of Government to the referendum result here, which reflects the growing stature of our country within the Community.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Government at Lisbon demonstrated a keen interest and desire to learn from the lessons we have seen in the Europe-wide debates on the Maastricht Treaty and particularly in the referendum campaigns here and in Denmark.  Those campaigns have brought home to the Heads of Government <Col N="188" /> the dangers of the Community becoming too removed from its citizens.</P>
    <P>There is now a clear willingness to bring the Community ever closer to the public which is reflected in decisions to increase the transparency of Community decisions and to increase dialogue between national parliaments and the European Parliament which again underlines the need for this House to proceed with a specialised committee on European affairs.</P>
    <P>Equally important has been the decision to move forward with the concept of subsidiarity and to give precise delineation of the type of Community action which can be carried out.  We would do well to remember that subsidiarity is as relevant to internal matters here as to our relationship with Europe.</P>
    <P>The last six months have also seen important progress being made on the implementation of the Internal Market. Over 90 per cent of the necessary measures for the completion of that market have now been adopted at Community level.  There has, however, been a notable failure to yet agree proposals on the harmonisation of VAT/excise duties. This is now long overdue and is of vital interest to us.</P>
    <P>Another important influence at Lisbon was the ongoing tragedy of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  If progress on almost every other front in the Community has shown its growing stature as a world economic power, the Community's virtual paralysis in the face of this tragedy reflects an impotency which must concern us all.  The response at Lisbon &mdash; where progress has been made in identifying possible areas of joint action under the Common Foreign and Security Policy arrangements &mdash; is welcome, if only a starting point.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that even those who are most stridently neutral can be satisfied to see the Community sit idly by while fellow Europeans are subject to the carnage and destruction which is taking place now on our very borders.  If the Community is to develop as a pillar of security and stability in Europe it must find the means to match its undoubted <Col N="189" /> economic power with a political influence which can operate for the benefit of Europeans everywhere.</P>
    <P>The Community remains at a crucial phase in its development and the challenges of the next six months will be as great as those we have faced to date. Central to these challenges will be the forthcoming referendum in France and the ability of the Community to come to terms with the difficulties raised by the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Throughout the recent referendum campaign, however, the Progressive Democrats stressed that the European Community represents a political movement and not just a legal arrangement.  I believe that the present difficulties facing the Maastricht process will be overcome and that the Danish people will yet be embraced in a progressive and developing union.</P>
    <P>In the Community on the energy side a number of issues are currently under discussion.  Progress is being made on completing agreements under the European Energy Charter.  Discussions are continuing on the draft directives on the completion of the internal market in electricity and gas, on harmonisation of licensing procedures and conditions for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons and on oil crisis measures and Community membership of the International Energy Agency.  The question of an energy tax was discussed at the most recent Energy Council in May and we are awaiting proposals from the Commission on energy conservation under the SAVE programme and on the development of renewable energy under the ALTERNER programme.  At home we are making progress towards interconnection for both the gas and electricity grids.</P>
    <P>The European Charter, which was signed by me on behalf of Ireland in the Hague on 17 December 1991 is a declaration by the countries involved expressing a desire for Europe-wide co-operation in the energy sector.  To date there is a total of 49 signatories to the Charter, consisting of 47 countries, the European Communities and the Inter-state <Col N="190" /> Economic Committee, representing the Confederation of Independent States of the former republics of the USSR.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the Charter are to improve security of energy supply, maximise energy efficiency, enhance safety and minimise environmental problems on an acceptable economic basis. The intention is to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprise and to the flow of investment in technology by applying market-economy principles to the field of energy.  The Charter itself is a political declaration without legally binding powers but it provides a frame work for a basic agreement and individual Protocols which will have legally binding effect.</P>
    <P>The basic agreement is designed to cover horizontal and organisational issues of the Charter while the individual Protocols will cover specific sectors. Negotiations are, at present, in progress on the basic agreement and on protocols dealing with hydrocarbons, energy efficiency and nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>While it had been hoped that the text of the basic agreement would be ready for signature by 30 June 1992, at the end of the Portuguese Presidency, it has been delayed due to various difficulties which have arisen during the negotiations.  It is now the aim to have it ready for signing by the end of the year although it is possible that negotiations will, in fact, carry on into 1993.  The Protocols will not be concluded until the basic agreement is finalised.  In its efforts to complete the international market in gas and electricity the Commission has a three stage approach:</P>
    <P>I.  To implement the directives on transit of gas and electricity and on price transport.</P>
    <P>II.  The creation of a transparent, non-discriminatory system of granting licences to build pipelines and for the production of natural gas; the separation of the management and accounting of production, transmission and distribution of operations, and the introduction of limited third party access.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> III.  A third stage will be defined in the light of experience gained.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the most recent Council of Energy Ministers in May that I would be very anxious to ensure that change from the present well established position would in fact bring benefits and that these benefits should not be at the expense of any group of consumers, nor bring about risks to security of supply in the short or longer term.</P>
    <P>I added that a carefully graduated approval to third party access was not only possible but desirable and could be done in such a way that would avoid any possible threats to the financial stability of existing monopoly utilities.  The details of this proposal will require careful consideration as the discussions progress.</P>
    <P>At the May Council I agreed with other Energy Minister that the proposed tax on CO2 emissions should be conditional on other industrialised countries taking comparable measures.  I expressed the view that while the Community had and should continue to lead the debate on proposed action in that area it could not and should not take unilateral action which could put it at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I realise that I am running short of time and I will conclude on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to a number of points raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy De Rossa raised questions on the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).  I can only conclude, with respect to the Deputy, that he has not read the report with sufficient care.  The entire emphasis in this report is on supporting stability in Central and Eastern Europe, in Yugoslavia, in North Africa and in the Middle East, by encouraging negotiations, conflict resolution, disarmament, arms control and respect for international law. The Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe is given a particular prominent role in the section dealing with Europe.  These are all aims that Ireland advocated in the preparation of the <Col N="192" /> report and they are in conformity with Ireland's foreign policy objectives.</P>
      <P>What is more interesting, although more bizarre, is the Deputy's questioning of the objectives contained in the report of ensuring full compliance with treaties and agreements on disarmament and arms control, including those on nonproliferation, and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.  Is the Deputy saying the Community should not work for compliance with international treaties on disarmament?  Surely compliance with the norms of international law must be the foundation of any effective foreign policy.  This has always been Ireland's stance.  We have a proud record in advocating the rule of law and the implementation  of international treaties, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  We will continue to work for these aims in all organisations of which we are a member, including the European Union.  In my view the Deputy should welcome the emphasis given in the report to this aspect of the Community's foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barry asked about attendance at Western European Union meetings. Ireland has attended these meetings on three separate occassions as an observer. Two of these, one in the Hague on 19 September 1991 and the other in Brussels on 30 September 1991, considered the conflict in Yugoslavia and the steps the Western European Union might take to support the European Community's peace process including its monitor mission. In the event no such steps were taken.  The Government's decision to attend as an observer was based on their desire to be fully informed of all developments that might have a bearing on the Community's peace process in Yugoslavia. The third meeting took place at the time of the Maastricht Council on 9 and 10 December 1991 at which the Western European Union discussed its future relations with the European Union and the invitation to be issued to members of the European Union to become members or observers of the Western European Union.  This invitation is contained in a declaration by <Col N="193" /> the Western European Union which was noted by the inter-governmental conference.</P>
    <P>Ireland was represented as an observer at all three meetings by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins.  An <i>ad hoc</i> meeting at official level which prepared the draft of the Western European declaration and took place at the time the Maastricht Council meeting was taking place was attended by an official from the Department of Foreign Affairs, acting as an observer.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Barry's question about a Dáil debate if Ireland applies for membership of the Western European Union, I repeat what I have said already &mdash; Ireland does not intend to become a member of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor remarked that the Conclusions made no reference to Moldavia. I would draw his attention to the first point of paragraph 5 of the Conclusions in which the European Council expressed its deep concern at the continued fighting in that country and strongly urged all the authorities concerned to end the vicious circle of violence by engaging in political dialogue and cooperating with all the peace efforts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harte mentioned what he described as monstrosities being erected on the British side of the Border.  I assume he is referring to the permanent vehicle checkpoints.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's views on the new checkpoints which have been erected by the British authorities.  Having visited the Border areas, of course the Deputy has first-hand knowledge of the areas by virtue of his passage through them on a weekly basis.  Having visited those Border areas, too, I agree that they seem strange manifestations of security if that is what they are intended to be.  One can only wonder what their purpose is in the context of what we all seek to achieve&mdash; the defeat of the IRA in all its manifestations.</P>
    <P>In relation to the generality of the debate I join with other Members who have indicated their support and appreciation of the Portuguese Presidency in the <Col N="194" /> past six months.  My short involvement has been at the Council of Ministers under the Presidency of Dr. Joao de Deus Pinheiro and I would like to pay tribute to him for the manner in which he controlled matters and balanced the views of all the contributors.  I would also like to pay tribute to him for the fair-handed and even-mannered way in which he handled all the proceedings under his Presidency.  He was a good President and it was a good Presidency.</P>
    <P>On the question of the French President's courageous initiative in visiting Sarajevo, I had already considered, as I expressed to my officials, that a gesture of that kind&mdash;I did not anticipate President Mitterrand's taking the decision he took &mdash;was what was required to bring an end to the savagery which is continuing in Sarajevo and the former Yugoslavia.  I salute President Mitterrand's courageous initiative in visiting Sarajevo.  It was an imaginative step that falls fully within the parameters of EC policy.  It brought hope to the suffering indigenous population. The Bosnian Serb leadership made contact with President Mitterrand after his conversations with President Izetbegovic.</P>
    <P>The European Council examined the grave situation in South Africa in the aftermath of the Boipatong massacre. The European Council noted the stated readiness of the South African Government to allow foreign observers to participate in the investigation underway and underlined the absolute need to ensure an effective control of the police and security forces.  The Ministerial Troika of the Community and its member states will address this issue on its forthcoming visit to South Africa.  Ireland was part of the process in suggesting this particular type of visit by the Troika and it was accepted by the Portuguese Presidency at the Summit in Lisbon last week.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Presidency and the Commission, the EC has been present as an observer at the CODESA negotiations. These enjoy the full support of the Community as a means towards a truly democratic and non-racial South Africa, in the first place through the <Col N="195" /> establishment of a transitional Government. Following the Boipatong incident and previous events of a similar character, the CODESA process &mdash; for reasons which this House will readily understand &mdash;is under strain.  The European Community will now be looking at what steps might be taken to help all the parties resume negotiations.</P>
    <P>The European Council adopted declarations on the Middle East peace process and on relations between Europe and the Group of North African countries known as the Maghreb.</P>
    <P>The European Council shared the widely-held view that the election results in Israel will help reinforce the peace process. At the same time, it reiterated a number of principles which have retained their validity ever since the first major European Council Declaration on the Middle East in Venice in 1980.</P>
    <P>Of fundamental importance, if an agreement is to prove just and lasting, is the principle of land for peace enshrined in Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.  The European Council also looked forward to immediate action by the Israeli authorities to halt the building and expansion of settlements in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, which are illegal under international law, and to apply in full the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The constructive involvement of the European Community in the Middle East peace process on the basis of these positions of principle will be a factor for bringing the sides together.  It will also serve to reassure both Israel and her Arab neighbours that they have everything to gain if peace can at long last take root in their region.  Another issue which should be addressed in concluding my remarks, which will be brief of necessity, having regard to the amount of time available, is the enlargement of the Community and of the European Union and that will be one of the main preoccupations of Europe over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes an open and positive view of enlargement.  The EEC Treaty and the <Col N="196" /> Treaty on European Union permit any European state to seek membership.  To date seven have applied &mdash; Turkey, Austria, Cyprus, Malta, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland.  It is likely that Norway may also seek membership by the end of the year and applications may also be made in the near future by countries in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Against this background it was important that the European Council should have a detailed debate on the issues involved in enlargement.  The Commission set out its views in a paper which was circulated during our meeting and which is attached to the conclusions circulated to the House.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Maastricht in December agreed that accession negotiations could start on the basis of the new Treaty on European Union as soon as negotiations on the Delors Plan are completed.</P>
    <P>It is a very important point in this particular area that the negotiations could start on the basis of the new Treaty on European Union as soon as negotiations on the Delors Plan are completed, then and only then can this particular process conclude.  In Lisbon we restated this requirement and agreed to ask the institutions to speed up preparatory work on the mandates for the accession negotiations. The Taoiseach made this clear on a number of occasions.  In this regard and without sounding sycophantic, I would like to pay tribute to the Taoiseach's contribution at the Lisbon Conference, at times he had support and on other occasions he was left out on his own, but he fought well and hard and, I think, successfully to keep the negotiation process on the road towards a proper conclusion at the Summit in Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>The Delors plan will provide the framework for the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty and the financing of Community policies well into the latter half of this decade.  It is essential that the plan be in place before negotiations start so that there can be a clear understanding by our future partners of the shape of the Community's long term agenda.  In <Col N="197" /> Lisbon we reaffirmed the Maastricht agreement on this point.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon meeting also confirmed the conclusions of the Foreign Ministers in Oslo on 4 June regarding the Maastricht Treaty in the light of the Danish referendum. It was agreed in Oslo that there would be no renegotiation of the Treaty and that all of the other member states would go ahead with their ratification procedures, as we are doing in Ireland, while leaving the door open to Denmark.</P>
    <P>Again, it is reasonable that accession negotiations should start after the European Union has been formally established and a clear path has been established for its development.  Thus, the decision of the Irish people on 18 June has important implications, not just within the Community but also for the African countries.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Language and Learning Unit.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Ceann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue.</P>
      <P>My question concerns St. Angela's Language and Learning Unit, which was established in 1985 in a room in the community centre at the back of Donnybrook church.  The unit was set up by a group of parents.  It started with three children and is attendance increased to six children in June 1986.  The parents put together a proper diagnostic and assessment team and, after continuous pressure from me and other Members, and particularly from the parents, the former Minister of State, Deputy Kenny, gave temporary recognition to the unit in September 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been struck by the extraordinary opposition that has come from the Department of Education to the establishment of the unit, and I have first-hand knowledge of the opposition.  Since the unit was established the Department have given no co-operation.  In fact, closure was threatened each year.  No speech <Col N="198" /> therapist was appointed by the Eastern Health Board and no attempt was made by the Department to get one.  Eventually, the parents, through fund raising activities, employed a speech therapist on a part-time basis.</P>
    <P>After the Department recognised the unit it was transferred to Scoil Chaitríona, Baggot Street, but the enrolment was restricted to the six original children. Sister Patricia Mulcahy, M.Ed. Language and Learning Disability, a professional in her field &mdash; the only one in Ireland of which I am aware &mdash; and a highly qualified woman, undertook the task of teaching those children, initially without any payment from the Department. Sister Patricia was trained by the Ursuline Sisters in the United States at a cost to that order.  She eventually took over the unit, again on a temporary basis. The unit had real success stories and some of the children involved have since gone on to second level mainstream education.</P>
    <P>I became involved with the unit through a personal friend whose child had been assessed by a child psychiatrist as being mentally retarded and should be sent to an institution and forgotten about. The child psychiatrist advised the parents to have another child.  The parents fought against that advice and established the unit.  Today, that child is playing on the local football team and is undertaking second level education.</P>
    <P>I raise the issue today because, unfortunately, the Department of Education have finally got their way and the unit is due to close in September next.  Sister Patricia has been lost to the country.  The Ursuline Sisters have become fed up and Sister Patricia has taken up work abroad.</P>
    <P>The problem was highlighted on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; by Mrs. Rowena O'Connell, whose child gained access to the school through representations by myself and the good offices of the Minister for Education at the time, Deputy O'Rourke.  I do not know if the Minister had an opportunity to hear Mrs. O'Connell on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  She was interviewed for about 45 minutes and expressed deep concern about the future <Col N="199" /> of her child, the fact that the Department could not guarantee a place for the child and the backward step that the closure represented in so far as the progress that had been made could suddenly stop.  Gay Byrne ran the story for about a week and the Minister for Health telephoned the show and offered the services of a speech therapist.  Unfortunately, nothing has happened.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question on the issue and part of the reply I received read:</P>
    <P>The requirements of children in the Dublin area with speech and language disorders were reviewed some time ago.  A number of special classes for children with these disorders have been established in recent years in the Dublin area and these have been located in the areas of greatest identified need.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it does not appear that the special class referred to is required at present and, accordingly, it will not continue in operation from September 1992.</P>
    <P>The reply also stated that suitable alternative educational placements were being secured for the three pupils who were in the school.</P>
    <P>On the most recent occasion on which I spoke to Mrs. O'Connell, one week or ten days ago, the Department of Education had not supplied a suitable place for her child, despite the fact that my parliamentary question was answered on 28 April 1992.  I do not know why the Department are determined to get their way and close the unit, in view of the fact that Ireland is losing a highly specialised teacher in that field.  We are losing a very valuable asset from an educational point of view.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is for the wellbeing of the children who suffer from that disorder and disability.  Many children with similar disorders may already have found their way into mental institutions and should never be there.  The progress made by my friend's son demonstrates <Col N="200" /> the extraordinary work done by Sister Patricia.  That child once came into my office and hid behind a chair in the corner but today he is playing football and is an expert with computers.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to review the decision not to continue the unit and not to allow the services of Sister Patricia to disappear from this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barrett for raising this matter and for the personal concern he has shown in this case.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need for adequate education provision for children with speech and language disorders.</P>
      <P>In this regard, my Department have already sanctioned a number of special classes for children with speech and language disorders in recent years.  Of the five classes located in the Dublin area, two are located in Drumcondra, two in Churchtown and another at Belgard, Tallaght. Another special class is based in Galway city.  In addition to the special classes mentioned, facilities for language disorder also exist at Ballinteer for pre-school language disordered children.</P>
      <P>Facilities are also available in various other types of special schools and classes for the handicapped, as in many cases the children suffer from additional disabilities such as hearing impairment, emotional disturbance, physical or mental handicap or reading disability and the language disorder may not be the primary cause of referral in such cases.</P>
      <P>The requirements of children in the Dublin area with speech and language disorders were reviewed some time ago and as a result of this review the classes were located in the areas of greatest identified need, the most recent of these being a second special class in The Good Shepherd national school at Church-town, which commenced in January 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been indicated to the Deputy in the past, official sanction was given to the special class in Scoil Chaitríona, Baggot Street, because of the special relationship which had been developed <Col N="201" /> between the class teacher and the children then attending.  However, there were just three children attending the class at the end of the 1991-92 school year and suitable alternative educational placements are being secured for those children at present.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it does not appear that the special class is required at present and, accordingly, the school authorities have been notified that the class will not continue in operation with effect from 31 August 1992.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the personal interest expressed by the Deputy, if he can indicate to the Department that there may be an increase in the number of children attending the unit I will be happy to investigate the matter further.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment shown by the teacher of the special class in Scoil Chaitríona over the years.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Driver Testing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary failure rate among those who take the driving test is causing much concern and distress to those involved and to their families.  It surely must be a matter for examination that up to 47 per cent of those taking the test fail.  I got this percentage in reply to a question I tabled to the Minister some months ago from my constituency.  The situation is now at crisis point for some who believe now it is next to impossible to pass their driving test.</P>
      <P>I stress that it is of the utmost importance to maintain a high standard of driving and thus ensure our roads are travelled by safe and competent drivers. However, it is unacceptable that so many applicants, some of them experienced drivers, are continuing to fail their driving test despite having taken lessons from what I consider to be excellent instructors. In many cases they are being failed for minor technicalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept that the majority of applicants are very young people, many of them still in full-time education and <Col N="202" /> without an income of their own.  With the cost of applying for a test at £30 and the need to take driving lessons at approximately £12 per lesson, it can cost a person almost £100 to apply and prepare for the driving test.  This is too much to expect from people who have to sit the test three or four times.  Worse still, I have come across many cases of people losing out on job opportunities because they had not passed their driving test.</P>
    <P>I believe the inspectors are doing their job, but I call for an examination into the guidelines set down for passing the driving test.  Many of those who are failing their driving test are continuing to drive on our roads with a provisional licence.  In my constituency of South Tipperary a person who has been driving to work every day for the past six years has failed his test on five occasions, each time, I believe, on minor technicalities. That person has never had an accident. It is unfair and unjust that people are being failed in this manner.  Some parents have come to me really distressed that they can no longer afford to allow their children to take driving lessons or apply for the test.  As I have pointed out, in many cases they cannot apply for jobs that require the person to have a driving licence.</P>
    <P>Adequate driving standards must be maintained but a person should not be deemed unfit to drive by reason of minor technicalities.  I am anxious that the Minister re-examine the criteria for obtaining a driving licence to ensure that competent and safe drivers are successful but those who are unfit will not pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for giving me this opportunity to put on record some pertinent facts about driver testing and to dispel some myths which continue to hang around in relation to this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out first that the primary purpose of driver testing is to ensure that those who become licensed to drive can do so safely and with due consideration for other road users.  Before a tester can issue a certificate of competency he must be satisfied that the person being tested <Col N="203" /> has an adequate knowledge of the Rules of the Road and can demonstrate the ability to drive safely and competently in accordance with those rules.  If the person does not achieve the requisite standard, the tester has no option but to withhold the certificate of competency.</P>
    <P>The testing service is not a means of raising revenue for the State.  It has never paid its way and in 1991 the loss on the operation of the service was of the order of £731,000.</P>
    <P>The rules and regulations governing driver testing, including the various manoeuvres which must be carried out during the course of the test and the skills which must be displayed, are laid down in an EC Directive and are in turn incorporated in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989.  The Irish driving test, therefore, is basically the same as the test carried out in all of the other 11 member states of the European Community.  The same general criteria apply.  The standard of driving test, therefore, is fully commensurate with the test carried out elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>Our driver testers receive a full and extensive training before commencing testing and are supervised regularly by very experienced supervisory testers.  A primary purpose of this supervision is to maintain an even application of standards throughout the country thus ensuring patterns of passes and failures which are in reasonable balance.</P>
    <P>The average pass rate nationwide is 52.5 per cent in 1992 to date.  Last year it was 52.1 per cent.  Over the years it has not varied much from these figures.  The rate may vary somewhat from area to area within the country but, where a significant distortion appears, the test results are examined and analysed to establish underlying causes with a view to bringing the pass-failure rate into closer harmony with the national average.  In the circumstances I think Deputy Ahearn will agree that there is nothing alarming about the failure rate for driving tests nor is there any need for an investigation.  On the contrary, I would like to put on record my belief that the present driver testing <Col N="204" /> service is first-class and provides an excellent service to the community.</P>
    <P>As regards the person in question, departmental records show that he took four tests over a period of years, the last being on 28 May of this year and his previous tests being in February, June and August of 1987.  Three different testers conducted the tests.  In this case there is no basis whatsoever for concluding other than that the tests carried out, as I have already indicated, by three different driving testers, were satisfactory.  It is, of course, regrettable that persons, as in the present case, will fail the test on a greater than average number of times, but this is a necessary aspect of any driver testing scheme in order to protect the lives and safety of both road users and the drivers in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity of praising the actions of the Office of Public Works in their co-operation with the local community in floodlighting St. Mary's Abbey, Howth. This is an excellent initiative.  Just as their care for this ancient abbey over the years must justifiably be praised, what a dreadful pity that the Office of Public Works, with their truly good record of conserving ancient monuments, cannot take Howth House itself into their care.  I strongly feel that their brief should be extended to include so-called modern buildings.</P>
      <P>By the way, I hope that the officials of the Office of Public Works have not collapsed from the shock of hearing of my very genuine praise for their efforts in some of the areas of their endeavours after my attack on them for certain catastrophic actions appertaining to the location of interpretative centres during the Estimates for their Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I would remind the Minister that Howth House stands at the foot of St. Mary's Abbey, Howth, and fits in admirably with this important historic building. Would the Minister ask the Office of Public Works to extend the floodlighting to include Howth House?  It is very important that the future of Howth House and its immediate surrounds can be assured.  If not, all the good work of the Office of Public Works would be seriously at risk, if not semi-destroyed. It would be absolutely appalling if, for example, a development which would destroy the coastline, a development which would be out of keeping with the wonderful vernacular architecture of Howth were to take place, directly at the base of this wonderful abbey.  It would surely be a disaster of Wood Quay proportions and I call on the Office of Public Works to enter the fray to protect this part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The planning application which has been shelved would have materially contravened the zoning in the county development plan which states that this site should be only for housing.  Dave Arnold's company, Monastra, obtained planning permission to demolish Howth House but pulled back because they were well aware that there would have been a local revolution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it true that, as a <Col N="206" /> result of an agreement with this company, Monastra still own Howth House? Is it true that Dave Arnold is a good old buddy of the Taoiseach?

      <P>The Office of Public Works have contributed very handsomely to the lighting of the walls and the remains of the 11th century St. Mary's Abbey and the related collegiate.  It is regrettable that the work there did not encompass the adjoining &mdash; and integral part &mdash; of St. Mary's Abbey location, Howth House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that as a result of recent <Col N="207" /> excavations traces of 14th century habitation have been found beneath the structure of Howth House and clearly illustrates that Howth House and its site is linked to the way in which the surrounds developed under the walls of the abbey and indeed in a way we would expect such ancient and medieval locations to have developed.  Consequently, I urge the Minister of State to look at the work and plans which have already been put in place by his Department <i>vis-à-vis</i> the abbey and its collegiate. He should look at the site and the emerging evidence from the excavations which are necessarily involved with regard to the proposed developments of the site at Howth House.  There are very important archaeological, historical and aesthetic reasons for the Office of Public Works taking a broader interest and a more active regard of the work they have already done in this area to see that a very important facility and treasure of the Howth seafront is maintained.</P>

      <P>St. Mary's Abbey in Howth is a very important urban national monument.  Sigtrygg, King of Dublin, founded the first church here in 1042.  When the old church was <Col N="208" /> amalgamated with one on Ireland's Eye in 1235, a new church was founded by Luke, Archbishop of Dublin.  This church was altered on several occasions, and much of the present structure dates from the 15th and 16th centuries.</P>
      <P>On 12 May last I informed the House that the Office of Public Works had not finalised plans for floodlighting the abbey.  Since then, an architect from my Office met representatives of the local community and a lighting system has been tested satisfactorily.  The policy in relation to floodlighting of suitable sites is that the Office of Public Works pay the capital cost of the installation, and the running costs are met by the local authority. I understand that the community representatives in Howth have undertaken to approach the county council about connecting the system into the town supply and to report to the office on the outcome.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to respond to this question. I will review the situation based on what Deputies said and I am also very pleased that Deputy Garland is anxious to ensure that the Office of Public Works continue to acquire properties in the interests of the conservation of our heritage.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 July 1992.</P>

      <P>The five major fishery harbours under the management and control of my Department are Howth, County Dublin, Dunmore East, County Waterford, Castletownbere, County Cork, Rossaveel, County Galway and Killybegs County Donegal.  Development works are being carried out in the context of a major development programme encompassing all harbour facilities covering a five year period 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>Many of the projects specified in the development programme have commenced or are at an advanced stage. Commencement of projects not already underway is dependent upon satisfactory results from preliminary surveys and site investigations and availability of finance.</P>
      <P>Specific developments at each of the harbours are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Killybegs</i>
      </P>
      <P>At Killybegs, a new synchrolift which cost in the region of £2.6 million was inaugurated in 1991.  The facility will assist fishermen by providing a speedy and efficient service for maintenance and repair of boats as well as increasing the efficiency of fishing operations and safety.</P>
      <P>The ice plant, operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, was built in the early 1980s and its production capacity was increased from 60 to 80 tonnes per day in 1990.</P>
      <P>A workshop, garage and staff welfare facilities will be completed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further work remains to be done on <Col N="130" /> upgrading safety and maintenance requirements and reviewing the need for dredging and a new pier.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Howth</i>
    </P>
    <P>Howth has been developed as a major fishery harbour at a total cost in excess of £11 million.  During 1990, my Department provided a gear storage compound at Howth Harbour and also surfaced an area which is being used by fishermen for the repair of their nets, the cost of these works amounted to almost £50,000.  As I have already informed the House, work will commence this year on the building of a new fish auction hall at Howth.  This new auction hall will provide local fishermen with a modern facility to ensure maximum prices for their catch.</P>
    <P>In the course of the major developments during the mid 1980's, B.I.M., provided an upgraded ice plant with a production capacity of 40 tonnes per day and this Department provided a synchrolift and boatyard.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rossaveel</i>
    </P>
    <P>The major developments at Rossaveel, Co. Galway announced in the Harbour Development Programme are now at an advanced stage.  This comprises work on a new pier as well as dredging the harbour. Ancillary works, including provision of a new auction hall, are also proposed.  The total cost will exceed £6 million.  A new modern ice plant is also to be provided at a cost of about £0.8 million. The whole project is scheduled for completion at the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Castletownbere</i>
    </P>
    <P>The programme envisages the upgrading of the auction hall and dredging of approach channel &mdash; site investigations to determine the depth of dredging required has been carried out at Castletownbere. In 1991 a new `a state of the art' computer-controlled ice plant was provided by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This represents a total investment of £810,000.</P>
    <P>There is a synchrolift operating in the <Col N="131" /> port and the facility underwent a major overhaul in 1991.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Dunmore East</i>
    </P>
    <P>The auction hall was re-roofed and the capacity of the synchrolift has been increased.</P>
    <P>Here also BIM installed a new &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; ice plant at a cost of £650,000 in 1990.</P>
    <P>The need for safe berthing of half deckers at Dunmore East has been addressed with pontoons recently installed.</P>
    <P>In summary, positive progress is being achieved in the development of the State's Fishery Harbour Centres.  I am conscious from my recent visits to all five ports of this progress and of what requires to be done in the future as and when resources permit.</P>
    <P>In the context of general harbour developments I have instructed my Department to reassess the infrastructure requirements nationally with a view to reviewing the existing programmes and drawing up a new Fishery Harbour Development Programme, to cover a second five year period commencing in 1993.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the very comprehensive reply which my predecessor gave the House on 6 November 1991 concerning the implementation of the recommendations of the Ballycotton report.  He outlined, at that time, the progress which had been made as regards the equipping, training, and the establishment of operational criteria to ensure the safe operation of sea patrols.  Subsequently an additional £250,000 was allocated to the fisheries boards to cover safety expenditure costs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of Government policy in relation to the fishing industry is to maintain and strengthen its contribution to the national economy and, in particular, its contribution to the generation of growth and employment in coastal communities.</P>
      <P>I think it is fair to say that the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy to date has been of somewhat mixed benefit to Ireland.  Under the policy Ireland for example has been guaranteed specific quota entitlements, has enjoyed unrestricted access for its products to Community markets and has benefited considerably from the range of financial aids available to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be stressed, on the other hand, that the Common Fisheries Policy inhibits the development of our industry, in-so-far as quota allocations fall short of what could be regarded as fair and reasonable and also in so far as Community fleet policy limits our ability to fully take up our existing quotas.  On balance, therefore, I am of the opinion, and this is a view shared by the industry as a whole, that the application of the <Col N="135" /> policy to Ireland has been unbalanced, particularly in relation to the key areas of quota allocation and fleet development.</P>
    <P>As a means of addressing these serious deficiencies, I have, in line with the thinking of the industry's Whittaker Committee, formally submitted to Council a number of specific proposals designed to enable the Irish industry achieve a reasonable measure of expansion and development over the next ten years.  My proposals have set out very clearly what I would regard as our rightful entitlements, in relation particularly to the critical areas that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that, over recent months at Fisheries Council and in bilateral contacts with my Council colleagues, I have been strongly arguing Ireland's unique case for special consideration in the current policy review. I will continue to do so as the review continues during the second part of the year.</P>

      <P>The initial distress call was picked up by Valentia Coast Radio Station and Falmouth MRCC were advised.</P>
      <P>Since the marine rescue helicopter came into service on 15 July 1991 it has provided assistance on five occasions to the UK authorities.  I am delighted to have available the resources to reciprocate the assistance we have so readily received in the past from the UK authorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the considerable increase in gill net activity by Irish fishermen this year and of the concern this has generated in some sections of the industry. This increase could have significant implications for the rational management and regulation of the hake and monkfish fisheries in particular.</P>
      <P>In the light of this development, which has resulted in the increased exploitation of these species this year, I have taken steps to have the current management regime for these species reviewed as a matter of urgency.  My principal objective is to ensure that these fisheries are exploited in a manner that ensures the optimum economic return to the fishing industry and the Irish economy as a whole while not endangering the long term health of the stocks.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated in this House earlier this year, gill netting is an effective and selective method of fishing, which, when properly deployed, can contribute more to conservation than some other forms of fishing.  Through its selectivity it allows undersized and immature fish to pass freely through the net, with larger fish only being caught.  Generally fish caught in this way are in better condition than those caught in trawls.</P>
      <P>At this juncture I am not in a position to indicate whether the interests of the fishing industry would be best served through the introduction of a ban on gill nets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question is very relevant in the wider context of the EC Community. The fleets of a number of other member states, with rights to fish the species in question in Irish waters, are <Col N="140" /> also practising this method of fishing. Should a ban on gill netting seem necessary arising from the current review being undertaken by my Department I will not hesitate in taking this matter up with the EC Commission with a view to having a community-wide ban imposed.</P>

      <P>Testing carried out in recent weeks by the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department shows the presence of toxins in shellfish in Bantry Bay and Dunmanus Bay, and the grounds concerned have been closed.  These toxins arise from algal bloom, more popularly known as red tide.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that red tide is a seasonal problem around this time in recent years for the shellfish industry in the south-west.</P>
      <P>No proven theory explains the cause of the bloom.  Its occurrence at this time each year would point to the convergence of several conditions as the cause, e.g. warm weather bringing organisms from deep water to the surface, providing an enrichment of the surface waters.</P>
      <P>The only sensible option at this stage is the temporary closure of the shellfish grounds in the interests of the consumer and, ultimately, the industry.  The grounds will remain closed until testing shows that the levels of toxins have fallen and the shellfish are safe for consumption again.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of this report which is a wide ranging and timely review of all aspects of the Irish aquaculture industry.  I am particularly pleased that the authors have highlighted the major contribution which aquaculture makes to economic development and job creation in coastal regions.</P>
      <P>A detailed examination of the analysis, conclusions and recommendations of the report is now being undertaken by my Department.</P>
      <P>The report will help with the ongoing process of consultation by my Department with the State Agencies, the industry and other interested parties on strategies for continued development to maximise the potential of the aquaculture sector for creating new jobs and revenue.</P>
      <P>The industry has developed from small beginnings in the early 1980's to a production level of close to 30,000 tonnes valued at £40 million a year to the economy.  There are now over 2,500 full time and part time jobs in the sector with indirect employment gains in related service industries.  The ESRI report is a positive endorsement of those achievements to date.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the potential for extra jobs which has been identified in this sector of the fishing industry.  The prospect of up to 1,000 extra people in employment is a development which will have my full and urgent support.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern regarding the use of jet skis, speed boats and other motorised craft on both inland and coastal waters which are also used by fishermen, divers, yachtsmen and bathers.  I understand from the Department of the Environment that local authorities have power to make by-laws regulating boating in public places which could be used for the purposes of regulating these craft.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which will shortly come into effect, enables me to make regulations governing the safety of pleasure craft, including jet skis, and their users.  In this connection, the Pleasure Craft Safety Working Group has been established to review safety procedures and standards on such craft and to advise me on the need for and content of any new regulations. Among the options being considered by the Working Group are the possibility of a registration procedure for these craft and the designation of suitable areas for their operation.  I am awaiting the Working Group's final recommendations before introducing any new measures.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a major development scheme for Howth which cost in the region of £11.6 million was completed in 1985.  This scheme included:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" />&mdash;construction of a breakwater pier;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increased berthage through pier widening and extensions,</P>
    <P>&mdash;reclamation of a portion of the Claremont Beach adjacent to the root of the West pier to provide sites for fish-related industries,</P>
    <P>&mdash;provision of a synchrolift.</P>
    <P>Since my Department assumed responsibility for the harbour, a gear storage compound and a tarmacadam area for repair of fishing gear has been provided at the rere of the West Pier together with minor upgrading to pier and breakwater structures.</P>
    <P>The result has been to bring the harbour to a high state of development. Landings are now valued in the region of £6.3 million per annum, compared with landings valued at £2.6 million in 1979, the year before the development scheme started.  The major species landed at Howth comprises high value demersal species.  There are approximately 145 fishermen and 28 boats based at Howth and it is estimated that there are 100 onshore jobs, related to the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will know I have made provision for an Auction Hall at Howth this year.  The preparation of detailed designs and costings for the Auction Hall is presently being progressed by my Department.  An application has been submitted to the European Commission for grant aid of up to 50 per cent for this project and, it is planned that building of the Auction Hall will commence by September this year.</P>
    <P>In response to a request from the local Howth Fishermen's Association, I established a Port User's Committee during February this year which brings together representatives of my Department and the main users of the harbour.  The committee, which has met twice to date and will meet again shortly, has proved to be a valuable forum for discussion between fishing and leisure users of the harbour and in assisting the harbour master in effecting smooth running of the harbour. The committee will also be consulted on <Col N="144" /> the design of the auction hall when drawings become available.</P>

      <P>Research into fish stocks including exploratory fishing for new species and into new fishing grounds is carried out by BIM, the Fisheries Research Centre of the Department of the Marine and, of course, by the fishing industry itself.</P>
      <P>The total allocation for exploratory fishing in 1992 for BIM is £235,000.  The provision in 1992 in the Department's research budget for the operational costs of exploratory fishing vessels comes to £561,000.  There are no proposals to increase these amounts in the current year, but requirements for 1993 will fall for review in the setting of expenditure estimates for 1993.</P>
      <P>Community funding may also be available from time to time to support exploratory ventures.</P>

      <P>Since becoming Minister for the Marine I have met with the Central Fisheries Board and all the Regional Board Managers.  In recent weeks when launching four of the eight newly established angling co-operatives I took the opportunity to meet with the relevant Regional Fisheries Boards and intend to meet the remaining ones in the near future.  While visiting the different regional areas I have experienced some of the different facets of the work of the fisheries boards.  I have seen excellent publications produced on the various types of angling available, development schemes such as the European Regional Development Fund assisted scheme at Moycullen in Co. Galway, staff involved in difficult and invaluable protection work and others involved in vigilant and effective pollution control.</P>
      <P>But what struck me in particular when visiting these areas is the potential for developing the inland fisheries resource so that the maximum benefits, in financial and employment terms, may be derived for the community as a whole.  It is for this reason I have requested all of the fisheries boards to submit detailed, costed development plans which I hope will be finalised very shortly.</P>

      <P>(b)  The following legislation was introduced by the Oireachtas: The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Act, 1990; The Fishery Harbour Centres (Amendment) Act, 1992; The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of legislation for which I am responsible, enacted by the Oireachtas which has not come into effect are as follows: (1) The Oil Pollution (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988; <Col N="149" /> A Commencement Order has been prepared and will be signed shortly. However, the full implications of the Act will not become effective until the State ratifies the Conventions/Protocols to which the Act gives effect in domestic law <i>viz.</i> the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage and its Protocol of 1976.  On ratification (currently being arranged by the Minister for Foreign Affairs) oil tankers coming into or leaving the State's harbours, terminal installations or offshore terminals will be required to hold adequate insurance to cover damage and the major oil importers will be required to contribute to a Compensation Fund from which compensation may be made in the event of compensation under insurance being inadequate or unavailable i.e. it serves as a top up.</P>
    <P>(2) The Sea Pollution Act, 1991; A Commencement Order to bring into operation all provisions of the Act other than those relating to oil discharges has been prepared and will be signed shortly. The Act gives effect to the International Convention for the prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and its 1978 Protocol &mdash; commonly referred to as MARPOL 73/78 &mdash; and to the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of pollution by substances other than oil.  Regulations to give effect to the obligatory Annexes of MARPOL 73/78 relating to discharges of oil and noxious liquid substances carried in bulk are being drafted.  Until they have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956-1977 will remain in force and the &ldquo;oil&rdquo; provisions of the new Act cannot become operative.</P>
    <P>(3) The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992. A Commencement Order to give effect to all Parts of the Act except Part II is ready for signature by me.  Date of signature will be dictated by reference to my Department's ability to cope with the regulatory measures for &ldquo;passenger boats&rdquo; under the Act.  These measures include inspection of vessel, grant of licence subject to requirements with <Col N="150" /> regard to numbers to be carried and waters that may be plied and such restrictions and conditions as is considered necessary.  Part II of the Act which deals with the regulation of &ldquo;passenger ships&rdquo; by way of survey, grant of passenger certificates etc. will be brought into operation later this year.  These ships are adequately regulated at present except in so far as penalties for non-compliance with requirements are too low and insurance cover is not compulsory.  The heavy penalties under the new Act will apply straightaway.</P>
    <P>(4) Marine Institute Act, 1991.  As I explained to the House on an earlier occasion, work is progressing in my Department on the administrative, budgetary, and other issues involved in setting up the Institute, many of which are complex and require a process of consultation and, indeed negotiation.  I am confident, however, that good incremental progress can be made in the meantime, in line with the objective of establishment at an early date.</P>

      <P>There is no such category of prisoner as is referred to in the question.  It is presumed the Deputy is referring to persons sentenced to imprisonment for crimes which may have had a subversive-type motivation. These cases are likely to have been dealt with in the Special Criminal Court, though the jurisdiction of that court is not related exclusively to such cases.  The number of all persons committed to custody following conviction by the Special Criminal Court since 1982 is as follows: 1982 &mdash; 44; 1983 &mdash; 46; 1984 &mdash; 28; 1985 &mdash; 27; 1986 &mdash; 18; 1987 &mdash; 12; 1988 &mdash; 24; 1989 &mdash; 28; 1990 &mdash; 31; 1991 &mdash; 11; 1992 (to date) &mdash; 5.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the Dublin metropolitan area there are currently 161 members of the force assigned to community policing duties which include liaison with representatives of neighbourhood watch schemes.  In addition to this there are 23 members of the force assigned to the community relations section in Harcourt Square which is responsible nationally for the implementation of the juvenile liaison officer scheme, overseeing neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes, development of the schools programme, community/neighbourhood policing and crime prevention initiatives.</P>
      <P>There is a growing awareness by the public of the part which they can play in crime prevention, a development which I very much welcome.  The community policing schemes have put the members of the force in closer touch with the communities they serve and the neighbourhood watch schemes play an important role in the fight against crime by involving the community in crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The success of programmes such as neighbourhood watch can be gauged in terms of the continuous support and enthusiastic involvement by the community in them.  The number of neighbourhood watch schemes has grown from 75 in 1985 when the scheme was first introduced to a present figure of 1,340 schemes involving 242,412 households throughout the country.  In the Dublin metropolitan area there are currently 818 schemes in operation involving 192,201 households.  I look forward to the further development of such community involvement in crime prevention.</P>

      <P>The Board is of the view that the large institutional buildings on the campus of St. Ita's Hospital are unsuitable to accommodate people with a mental handicap.  In 1991 two of the former staff houses on the campus were converted into hostels for clients of the service which facilitated the closure of one of the main institutional units.  This year the Eastern Health Board intends to open a further 23 places in three other group homes on the campus.  This will facilitate the closure of a further institutional unit. The Board plans to continue this process of transfer from the institutional accommodation. Before any client is transferred, his or her individual needs are assessed, and an individual programme plan agreed.  Parents are actively involved in the transfer and the preparation of programme plans.  The Board has also embarked on the provision of a comprehensive range of community services in North County Dublin with the initial aim of preventing inappropriate new admissions of people with mental handicap to St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

      <P>I presume the question relates to a proposed high level bridge over the River Suir in Waterford City which was the subject of a bridge order application in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>In 1979 Waterford Corporation were advised that the application could not be progressed until information was made available about the acquisition of property that would be required for the construction of the bridge and associated approach roads.  It was also suggested to the local authority that the planned replacement of Redmond Bridge, which had become hazardous, would afford an opportunity to review the implications of a high level bridge proposal, particularly in relation to environmental and financial aspects and current and future traffic requirements.  The information which would need to be available for presentation at a bridge order inquiry has not yet been furnished by the local authority. At this stage the proposal would also require a formal environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>In view of the extensive programme of road improvements which have been carried out in the area in the meantime, including the new dual carriageways at Ferrybank and Dock Road, the new Rice Bridge and improvements to the Quay and Manor Street, any proposal for the provision of a further bridge would have to be examined very closely in relation to the likely cost and the benefits to be derived from it.</P>

      <P>He visited the area between 19 and 30 April 1992 and held meetings with the King of Morocco and the Secretary-General of the Polisario Front.  He concluded that their respective positions remained far apart and continued to present serious obstacles to the implementation of the plan.  But he was encouraged to find that both parties were still committed to the plan as a framework for a just and permanent solution to the conflict.</P>
      <P>Mr. Yaqub Khan is pursuing his contacts with all the parties concerned.  In due course the Secretary-General will be reporting to the UN Security Council on their outcome.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the two people concerned is in receipt of old age contributory pension at the rate of £76 per week.  This weekly rate includes a temporary alleviation payment of £12.  The other person, his spouse, is receiving an invalidity pension of £56.40 per week. The aggregate of the two pensions is £132.40 per week.  In addition, both persons receive free travel passes.  One member of the couple receives a free fuel allowance of £8 per week during the annual heating season as well as the free <Col N="166" /> electricity allowance.  The other person is in receipt of free telephone rental allowance.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that, arising from recent decisions of the European Court of Justice, it has emerged that the temporary alleviation payments, which offset the effects of the equal treatment legislation, are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment and cannot be continued.  Therefore these alleviation payments are being discontinued with effect from 30 July 1992, coinciding with the date of implementation of this year's budget increases.</P>
      <P>However, many of the families affected by the discontinuance of these payments will be entitled to payments under retrospective legislation arising from the delay of the then Government in implementing the 1979 EC Directive on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security. Accordingly, married women who were affected by this delay will have equal treatment arrangements applied to them retrospectively for a period between December 1984 and November 1986.  A sum of £22 million has been provided in 1992 for these extra payments which will be made on a phased basis between 1992 and 1994.</P>
      <P>In the case of one of the people referred to by the Deputy, the cessation of the temporary alleviation payment from 30 July will result in the loss of £12 a week.  However, this loss will be offset to some extent by budgetary increases totalling £4.90 per week in their pensions payable from 31 July 1992.  Therefore, the couple will incur a net loss of £7.10 per week in total.</P>
      <P>It is not known whether the couple concerned will benefit from the retrospective legislation, until the details in this case are fully assessed by my Department.</P>

      <P>On 1 April 1992, the person concerned was awarded a reduced rate old age non-contributory pension of £23.00 per week with effect from 31 January 1992 &mdash; the Friday following receipt of his application for pension.  This includes a personal rate of £15.00 and an adult dependent allowance of £8.00 in respect of his wife.  He was also awarded a free fuel allowance of £5.00 per week from 31 January 1992 for the duration of the winter heating season.</P>
      <P>This is the rate of pension appropriate to a married person with weekly means of £45.23.  Means in this case were derived from the net yearly value of his holding which were assessed at £4,600 per annum.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is not satisfied with this decision to award a reduced rate pension, he should write to the independent social welfare appeals office in D'Olier House, D'Olier Street, Dublin 2, outlining his grounds for appeal and enclosing any supporting documentation. His appeal will then be determined by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The person concerned might be entitled to a free electricity allowance, a free television licence for a black and white television and a free telephone rental allowance.  Application forms for these allowances issued to him for completion on 1 July 1992.</P>

      <Quest>if having regard to the annual review that applies to the family income supplement scheme, he will consider making annualised increases in the threshold earlier than in July each year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the family income supplement scheme weekly payments of <Col N="168" /> supplement are made to families with children, where one or more parent is in employment of at least 20 hours a week and where the income of the family is less than a prescribed weekly amount.  Once entitlement to FIS has been established, the payments continue for 52 weeks while the claimant continues in employment.</P>
      <P>When any changes in the threshold levels or payment rates under the FIS scheme are being implemented, the payments made to all existing claimants are reviewed and increases applied to all recipients, regardless of when entitlement was established.  Therefore claimants whose entitlement was established prior to rate changes are not disadvantaged because of the timing of their claim.</P>
      <P>In line with changes in social welfare schemes generally, changes in the family income supplement are implemented in July of each year.  The family income supplement is designed to ensure that the incentive to work is maintained and increases in the income limits under the schemes are determined by reference to the increases applied to unemployment payments.  It is therefore appropriate that the increases in both cases come into operation at the same time.  The simultaneous implementation of all social welfare payment changes also assists the process of alerting the public to changes in their entitlements.  I have no plans at present to alter the timing of increases under the family income supplement scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that 60 per cent of the applications for FÁS Schemes throughout the country may not be dealt with due to the serious reduction in funds; if he intends to rectify this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Social Employment Scheme and Teamwork. Expenditure on the Social <Col N="169" /> Employment Scheme this year is projected at £72.9 million which represents an increase of £4 million approximately on the 1991 expenditure figure of £68.943 million Expenditure on Teamwork will be £3.8 million approximately compared with £4.048 million in 1991.</P>
      <P>The funding available for the Social Employment Scheme will allow the participation of an average of 11,300 participants each week with the actual number at any time varying depending on the number of projects in operation. Teamwork will provide opportunities for up to 2,000 participants this year.</P>
      <P>FÁS has a responsibility to manage intake to these Schemes to keep within the overall budgets made available by the Exchequer.  This can mean that projects seeking renewal may not automatically be accommodated or that renewals or new projects may not start as soon as sponsors would like.  At the end of May there were 12,199 people participating in the Social Employment Scheme while 846 people were participating on Teamwork.</P>
