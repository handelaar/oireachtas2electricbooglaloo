      <P>I am seeking the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the urgent and important matter of the potential major industrial dispute in the main banks.  In particular we should ask all involved in this matter to take no action which might further escalate the dispute before the Labour Relations Commission have had an opportunity to intervene.</P>

In view of the very serious nature of the allegations contained in the report I would ask the Taoiseach whether we will be afforded an opportunity of debating it a some stage, preferably in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Government published the Health (Family Planning) Bill <Col N="375" /> approximately eight months ago.  In view of the growing health danger to young people posed by AIDS, may I ask whether the Government intend to take this Bill or an amended version of it in this House in the near future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to item No. 11 on today's Order Paper which relates to the debate we are due to have on Friday next?  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the report of the inspectors warrants a full scale debate because it is extremely important and has very serious messages for the conduct of Irish business. Has the Taoiseach considered making the papers of the inspectors available in the Library of this House so that we can have a full debate on the matter and that there will be no prevarication or clouding of the important issues in this report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what the Deputy is requesting.  Of course the report will be debated in full in the House and I expect a full and informed debate from all sides of the House in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am suggesting is that the Taoiseach or the Government should place in the Library of this House the papers that are available to the inspectors, which I believe the court has ordered to be filed away for five years.  If those papers were placed in the Library of this House there would be a much <Col N="376" /> more informed debate on Friday next and there would be clarity in the debate rather than the clouding of issues as was the case last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as a lawyer, will fully accept that any orders made by the court in that respect must be respected by this House as well as by everybody else.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate to the House, following his round of meetings with party leaders yesterday, when he expects to make proposals with regard to the Maastricht Protocol which must come before this House; and has he decided when legislation arising from the Supreme Court ruling will be published?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I wish to raise a matter with the Taoiseach that I have raised twice previously.  The Greencore report will be debated next Friday. There are 275 pages in that report, and it has not yet been distributed to Deputies. How can the House properly debate this report when copies have not yet been distributed?  The report cost enough to produce.  At a cost of £1.1 million, surely <Col N="377" /> the Government can afford to print 166 copies.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications intend to register a protest with the RTE Authority about the trial by television of the Ben Dunne affair that went out on last night's &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme?

      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the publication of the White Paper on the Maastricht Treaty. Will recent developments in relation to the Protocol affect the date of publication? When can we expect to have the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question yesterday.  The White Paper will be circulated as soon as possible.  I do not expect the amendment to the Protocol to interfere with that at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the first the Oireachtas heard of the Protocol was when it was announced in Brussels, <Col N="378" /> that the House did not have an opportunity to debate the Protocol and that neither we nor you, Sir, were told in the two major debates in the House of the intention to lodge such a Protocol, can the Taoiseach give an assurance that, before any proposed revision of the Protocol is circulated in Brussels by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 6 April, this House will have an opportunity to debate it and, perhaps, put the Government on the right course for a change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be the understatement of the century that the Government were not on the right course.  Never has the Government been proved so completely wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Would it be possible to give some indication of the heads of that legislation to many people who are confused about their legal rights in the run up to the abolition of ground rents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in future, the Taoiseach proposes to disclose the content of his discussions with Opposition leaders, he should, first, say in advance that he proposes to do so and, second, ensure that he is accurate in anything he says. <Col N="380" /> the Taoiseach did not show me the wording of the proposed amendment.  He mentioned orally to me a wording he had in mind; but did not, as he stated here, show me any such wording.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that there have been huge claims made about the powers of this Bill and the Minister's intentions, perhaps the Minister of State would explain to the House exactly what is meant by the provisions of this section. This matter was debated already in the Seanad when a certain amount of controversy arose because of the section's wording. Perhaps the Minister would explain exactly what is meant by its wording which reads:</P>
      <P>This Act may be cited as the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1991. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this Bill has finally reached the House on Committee Stage since we have awaited it for a very long time.  There was a debate in the Seanad in relation to its title.  I understand that the logic of the case put forward by the Minister of State there was that the Bill was <i>sui generis</i> and did not constitute a consolidation of previous legislation.  To call it the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is a limiting title in that its provisions will have a much more profound impact on environmental awareness and protection then simply the establishment of a state agency.  The comparable legislation in the United Kingdom &mdash; the Environmental Protection Act &mdash; would be a more appropriate title, to actually call it an Act, to indicate the determination of the Oireachtas to protect the environment rather than simply an Act to establish an agency, which demeans its purpose, focus and comprehensive nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might remind the House that the debate in the other House in relation to the title had more to do with the fact that the proceedings of the day were being televised and there was a question of some Member wanting to get in first before the proceedings went off air.  That is why an <Col N="384" /> amendment was tabled to the title.  If Members read the comments of other parties in the House I think it will be seen that they took that view.</P>
      <P>What we are establishing here is an environmental protection agency.  Certainly we would confuse the public now were we to endeavour to change the title of the Bill since it is associated in the public mind with the establishment of a new agency to re-organise the way we deal with environmental protection and pollution matters.</P>
      <P>I do not quite understand the point Deputy Howlin made.  The United Kingdom Environmental Protection Act is an Act because it has passed through the legislative process, as will this Bill once enacted.  I might add that the United Kingdom Act contained provisions in relation to legislation already on our Statute Book in regard to air and water pollution. We already have those Acts in place.  While we are not here consolidating our environmental protection legislation, essentially, we are establishing a new body with very precise powers and controls to reorganise the manner in which we deal with environmental protection and pollution matters. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for this House to seek to endeavour to change its title.  Unfortuntely, the Bill has taken quite a long time to reach this Stage.  I hope we will have the co-operation of all sides of the House in its speedy passage through final Stages.  It would be to the detriment of the agency if we were to seek to confuse people now by simply changing its title.</P>

      <P>I welcome any move to have this Bill processed through the House as quickly as possible since, to date, the promise of the agency has been milked to the utmost by all Members on the Government side.  At the same time there are insufficient regulations under the legislation obtaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the Minister mean by going headlong into the establishment of the agency while legislation obtains &mdash; and the Minister herself referred to this &mdash; in the form of the 1987 Act allowing the <Col N="385" /> Government to do many things?  Yet they have not even introduced regulations to carry out those obligations.</P>
    <P>I might give one example, that of an issue raised in Dublin, Cork and a number of other cities recently about the whole question of hospital incinerators and we were informed that local authorities do not have power under that Act to monitor emissions from hospital incinerators. Yet we have the Minister rushing headlong into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My fear is that we will have another Act on our Statue Book without any will to implement its provisions. Legislation without the will to implement its provisions is quite useless, as has already been witnessed <i>vis-à-vis</i> the 1987 Act.  I hope the Minister will get her act together in relation to the legislation already obtaining.  There is no point in establishing agencies without resources, when obviously the will does not exist to implement the provisions of the legislation already on our Statute Book.</P>

      <P>The point being made about the title of the Bill is not an invalid one.  The point made by Deputy Carey, supported by Deputy Howlin, is that the Bill, rather than one to establish an Environmental Protection Agency should be called the Environmental Protection Bill.  Indeed, if many of the amendments tabled are accepted this Bill will become more than just an Environmental Protection Agency Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the slow progress made on this Bill.  The Minister must be criticised for the tardiness with which this Bill has come before the House.  She has been Minister of State at the Department, responsible for environmental matters, for more than two and a half years.  The sad fact is that her <Col N="386" /> Government would not accept the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill introduced by my party's former spokesman on the environment, Deputy Shatter, that sought the establishment of an environmental protection agency.  It is dispicable that this Government have resisted any positive contributions from the Opposition, just as they resisted the idea of an employment forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are indeed very many amendments.  I rise to support the proposal that the Bill be cited, not as the Environmental Protection Agency Bill but as the Environment Protection Bill. It is also valid to criticise the Minister of State on her tardiness in bringing this Bill in Committee before the House after some two and a half years and on her lack of generosity in accepting the Private Members' Bill introduced in this House over two years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State certainly misunderstood my previous comment. Obviously the Bill will become an Act when it is enacted.  The difference between ours and the British legislation is that the British title is the Environmental Protection Act since it has been enacted, whereas this Bill will be called the Environmental Protection Agency Act once enacted.  Indeed the point has been made across these benches that it is far more than a Bill to establish an agency. It is not a four page Bill to establish an agency, define their terms of reference, funding and staffing; it is a measure to tackle the whole issue of environmental protection.  Therefore, it would be more appropriate, and the signal would be clearer, to call it, at this stage, the Environmental Protection Bill and the Environmental Protection Act once signed by the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat reluctant to become involved in this discussion <Col N="387" /> since we are dealing with section 1 which merely cites the short title and there is no amendment tabled thereto.  Like previous speakers I am somewhat concerned that this Bill has been in the offing for more than three years.  We are still a long way from finishing it in this House, longer still from having the agency put in place. We have approximately 300 amendments with which to deal.  If we commence our deliberations by lengthy debates on what it is called, about what I consider to be rather cosmetic aspects of the entire issue, we will not make a great deal of progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore's comments.  As he said, it is interesting that there are no amendments tabled to this section.  Deputy Jim Mitchell made great play of the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill which was also called the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  We need to get on to the substance of what the agency will do, which is what is important.  I know there is anxiety on all sides of the House to have that agency established as soon as possible.  We should not delay any longer. What something is called is not as important as what it does or its overall purpose. We should now proceed to debate the substance of this Bill and the moving and discussion of the 289 amendments tabled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;Part I, Part II (other than section 43), Part IV (other than section 91) and Part VI will come into&rdquo;<Col N="388" /> and substitute &ldquo;Parts I, II, III, IV, V and VI will commence&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>According to the Bill as it came from the Seanad, Parts I and II, other than section 43 and Part IV, other than section 91 and Part VI will come into operation on the passing of this Bill.  About half of the Bill will come into operation on the passing of the Bill and the remainder will come into effect at some stage in the future.  It is worth reflecting on where this legislation came from and how long it has been before us.  I have a press statement issued by the Minister for the Environment and by the Minister of State at the Department, on 5 December 1989 and I should like to read some of the aspirations expressed by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, at the time.  He said:</P>
    <P>We are planning to have the legislation enacted and the agency in operation next year.  Pending the enactment of the legislation we are proposing to put interim arrangements in place so that some aspects of the work of the agency can be got under way on a non-statutory basis as soon as possible. </P>
    <P>The intention at the end of 1989 was that the legislation would be enacted and the Agency would be in operation some time in 1990.  There was at that time a budgetary provision of about half a million pounds to enable the agency to come into operation on a non statutory basis pending the enactment of the legislation. Such was the urgency at the time to get into place an environmental protection agency which would deal with the many areas which concern us.  It took another year before the legislation was published. There was then a long debate in the Seanad.  There is no point in criticising the Seanad because it is a very long Bill and we will probably have a very long debate in this House on it as there are 300 amendments to deal with.  The Seanad took eight or nine sittings to deal with approximately the same number of amendments.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad there was an amendment that all sections of the Bill be brought <Col N="389" /> into operation by the end of December 1992.  Given that the Seanad were debating it at the beginning of 1991, it was hardly a very ambitious objective.  That amendment was rejected by the Minister of State in the Seanad.  Clearly it is not the intention to have the agency and all sections of the legislation in place by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that Part I which deals with routine and regulatory matters, and Part II which deals with the structure of the agency should come into effect when the Bill is passed, but Part III, which deals with the functions of the agency, should not come into effect until sometime after that.  Part IV will come into effect on the passage of the Bill with the exception of section 91 which deals with charges in relation to emissions.  Part V, which deals with general pollution control, will not come into effect until some time later.  We will get a mish mash with some parts of the Bill being brought into effect and others being left in abeyance. We had a similar experience with the local Government Bill.  We now have the absurd situation that parts of that legislation which deal with the establishment of committees and joint committees on local authorities, have not been brought into effect.</P>
    <P>I can understand that in certain circumstances time is needed to put aspects of legislation in place and that is why in phrasing this amendment I used the term, that the parts of the Bill &ldquo;will commence&rdquo; operation when the Bill is passed.  What we are looking at is legislation which was born in 1989, took one year to draft, another year to go through the Seanad and may take another year to get through this House.  Its provisions may not come into effect until the mid-nineties by the time the agency is established and the various bits and pieces are put into place.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about environmental protection and about establishing an agency which will provide some kind of objective, independent, scientific forum to deal with aspects of environmental protection, we need to address the question as to when it will happen.  This is <Col N="390" /> one of the longest promised bodies ever. During the five years it will have taken to come into operation further damage and destruction will have been done to the environment.  There was an urgency stated by the Government when they first announced this legislation at the end of 1989.  That urgency seems to have gone out of the legislation.  At this stage the Minister should agree that at the very least, when this House is finished with the Bill, its provisions should be implemented so that we will not have to wait for another 12 months, 18 months or two years for the Minister to introduce regulations and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is a very important section which deals with the commencement of the Act.  This section was added, I understand, by way of a Government amendment in the Seanad.  Even the sections which are to commence on the passing of the Bill require regulations to be drawn up, or an order made by the Minister to enable them to come into effect, for example the commencement of the agency under section 19 (2).  We are all concerned at the length of time Bills of this nature take to be enacted, but it is even more frustrating when after a huge effort is put into preparing the best legislation we can it is left on the shelves.  I was a member of the special committee on the Child Care Bill.  A huge amount of work was done on that Bill and at least as many amendments were tabled and debated as will be debated on this occasion.  Unfortunately, many of those sections have yet to be brought into effect and funded, although they have been the law of the land for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendments will be to circumscribe the coming into operation of this legislation.  We cannot allow for prevarication and delay due to lack of resources or lack of will with regard to the implementation of the important provisions in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Gilmore or the broader amendments tabled by Deputy Garland and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Amendment No. 3 propose that the provisions not mentioned in section 2 (1) should come into effect not later than a year after the enactment of the legislation. Surely it is reasonable to provide a year for the Minister to draw up regulations and make the necessary provisions in terms of the infrastructure for the agency.  Obviously it cannot be done instantly but one year is sufficient time if there is a commitment to have this agency up and running and all the provisions of the Bill in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what the two previous Deputies have said.  My amendment is identical with Deputies Howlin's amendment and similar to that of Deputy Gilmore.  We realise things cannot be done overnight.  It will take time to set up the agency and a great deal of thought must be given to selecting their director general.  But surely a time limit of one year is not unreasonable.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Bill deals with one of the main duties of the agency and provides for the extension to the agency of certain powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, and a similar extension under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  It also sets emission limit values and quality standards.  These are very vital matters which are not being dealt with properly at present, as there is no machinery for doing so.  It is not unreasonable therefore to propose a period of a year as the limit for the coming into operation of the legislation. This is very important amendment and I ask the Minister to consider it very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to suspend the repeal of section 51 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which provides for the control of noise as a nuisance until the replacement controls which are to be provided for by means of regulations under section 106 are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that it is my intention to make the regulations allowing <Col N="392" /> for the introduction of the new and better arrangements for dealing with noise nuisance as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill.  I understand the desire of Deputies Howlin and Garland to ensure that all sections of the Bill are commenced within a reasonable period of time.  However, the amendment, if adopted, would be counter-productive. Were the deadline in the amendment to be accepted, the agency would be obliged to commence operations on a very broad range of fronts in a very short space of time.  This could only result in a rapid demoralisation of the agency's personnel and an erosion of public confidence in the agency as it sought to undertake all of their statutory duties and functions with underdeveloped structures and an inadequate staff.</P>
    <P>If the agency are to be successful they must be given the opportunity to build up their staff and expertise over a reasonable period of time and they must be given their functions in line with the availability of staff to perform them.  Having said this, I can assure the House that the agency will be given the necessary resources and there will be no undue delay in assigning functions to them. Nevertheless it was always intended that the full range of functions, which are extremely wide and some of which are of considerable complexity, would only be assigned over a period of some years.</P>
    <P>These arguments apply equally to Deputy Gilmore's amendment which would oblige the agency to commence operations on all fronts at once.  Bearing in mind that it will take some time, possibly up to six months, to recruit and put in place the board members, the director general and other directors and the need to get an adequate staff for the agency. It would not be possible, I believe, to take on all the functions in the time proposed.</P>
    <P>I might also add that if this legislation, having been signed by the President, were to be subjected to any legal challenge, that would obviously add further delays and make it impossible to meet the deadlines proposed.  If the proposed deadlines are not met, the legislation <Col N="393" /> falls, and I do not think that anybody would think that is desirable.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Howlin said, initially there was no time specification at all and as a result of the debate in the Seanad, the Bill was amended to bring in as much as possible of the legislation as quickly as possible on the passing of the Bill. However, desirable and all as it may be &mdash; and I understand the intent of the amendments &mdash; I do not believe it is physically possible or practical to do so. I have always said that after the agency is established, which will of itself take a number of months, it will take two or more years before we can assign the full range of functions to the agency because they are very complex, wide-ranging and comprehensive.  There are many matters, particularly the operation of an integrated pollution control licence which is new to this country.  It will take some considerable time for the agency to get the expertise and resources together to carry out that task alone.  Therefore I believe it would be counter-productive to achieving the aim we all have if we were to pin the agency to be fully operational within a year of the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The contents of the Minister's reply &mdash; and obviously it is a prepared statement &mdash; are a recipe for inactivity on some of the most pressing issues facing us today.  The lack of a coherent policy in relation to environmental protection and waste management affects our industrial development policy.  The Minister has got fair mileage out of this issue in recent years.  In every paper we read and on every television channel we turn on, there is coverage of the Minister dealing with environmental issues and the pressing matters of the day.  Now that it comes to make-your-mind-up time, the Minister says it will be six months before the executive is set up and at least two years before the range of functions of the environmental agency are on stream. This is extremely disappointing news for the many people throughout the country who had anticipated swift and decisive <Col N="394" /> action from the Minister in dealing with the most fundamental problems facing the country today.</P>
      <P>There is so much lip service to unemployment and job creation, and one of the major issues affecting job creation, the formulation of proper policies in relation to environment protection and industrial development, is being long-fingered again.  I always suspected that the Minister's statements far outran the Government's commitment to the implementation of a comprehensive and adequate environmental protection policy.  If the Government had a real interest in environmental protection, they could have used the provision of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, to bring in many of the regulations that are being considered at present and which would have given the existing agencies throughout the country the teeth to control what is happening in the country.  You ruled me out of order earlier, a Cheann Comhairle, but my point is really relevant in view of the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>The local authorities do not have the power to clamp down on one of the greatest sources of poisonous emissions in this country, that is hospital incinerators. They do not have the power even to monitor emissions from incinerators.  My own local authority in Cork has informed me that the absence of regulations under the 1987 Act prevents them from monitoring emissions.  The simple task of issuing regulations under that Act would empower the local authorities to put pressure on the bodies that are polluting our atmosphere.  The Minister may reply that under the 1987 Act bodies causing pollution have a responsibility to ensure that everything is in order, but who wants self-monitoring for such bodies.</P>
      <P>Here again is an example of foot dragging and long fingering on environmental protection.  It is down to the issue of resources.  If the local authorities had been allocated the resources to protect the environment, they could have done so very effectively.  However, it is a matter of following up promises with the financial commitment, and I suspect that that commitment is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> I am extremely disappointed that this Committee Stage debate should start on this note.  The Minister knows what amendments she will accept or reject. She has the voting power in the benches opposite to put through whatever legislation she wants.  She knows the detail of the finished product and I would ask her to explain it.  The record of this House shows that amendments considered vital by the Opposition but contrary to the Government's views are voted down. There is no excuse for the Minister not to have in place some of the detail of the agency so that it could come on stream within the time set out by Deputy Howlin in his amendment.  It is totally unacceptable to say that we will have to wait two years before any real action occurs. We hear lovely phrases such as &ldquo;integrated approach&rdquo; but such phrases mean nothing if there is not financial commitment and if decisions are not made within the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only describe the Minister's response as parliamentary bunkum.  She will be aware that the Government published for the &ldquo;green&rdquo; Presidency of the European Council an Environmental Action Programme.  That programme stated:</P>
      <P>Proposals for the establishment of an Environmental Protection Agency have been published and the necessary legislation is being prepared as a matter of urgency with a view to having the agency in operation in 1990. </P>
      <P>If that is the measure of the word and commitment of this Government and of this Minister of State to this agency, I am not prepared to accept that the provisions of this important legislation will be implemented in two or more years.  I have already instanced my experience in this House in relation to putting a Bill in place after a horrendous amount of work and taking the word of the Minister steering the Bill through that it would be implemented as quickly as possible. The Child Care Act has still to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> The Government must be required to bring in the provisions of this Bill within 12 months.  It can be done if the Government are so minded.  I do not believe it will necessarily take six months to put the executive of the agency in place.  It is patent nonsense to suggest that the agency would be demoralised if we gave them a requirement to implement their statutory duties in 12 months.  They would not be demoralised if they were given the duties, the responsibilities and the resources to do the required job of work.</P>
    <P>I thought this Minister of State would get away from the shadow dancing that occurs on the passage of Bills and that we would try to do what is right by Ireland, with no prevarication and no &ldquo;Civil Service-speak&rdquo;.  The Minister has it within her power to accept this reasonable amendment which provides that we will endeavour to the best of our abilities to have this done within 12 months.  It would be a tremendous signal to us as we embark in detail on this Bill if she would accept that it will be done within the time scale.  If she were willing to do that, we would forget all the announcements made around the country and in this House and the comments on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill and we would trust the Minister to do her best to have it in place.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the Minister of State's response that it could take two or more years to bring into effect many of the provisions of this Bill. Assuming normal practice in this House, the legislation before us will probably be enacted by the end of this year and that means that the agency may not be in operation until sometime in 1995.  It was promised in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At roughly the same time as the Minister of State was going to Power's Hotel on 5 December 1989 to announce that the Bill was on its way, the Berlin Wall was falling.  Since then there have been enormous changes on the European Continent. The Single Market is about to come into effect and the whole idea of European union has advanced.  There is <Col N="397" /> to be a new treaty on European union and we will have a single currency in Europe before this Bill comes into operation. The Minister need not try to convince us that things cannot be done.  If the entire political configuration of Europe can be changed in a couple of years, surely it is possible to put in place a semi-State agency and to give them the necessary powers to enable them to do their business.  What the Minister is really saying is that when this legislation is passed the Environmental Protection Agency will be an under-resourced, under-staffed and under-empowered body which will have to depend on the goodwill of the Department of the Environment to cede some of their responsibilities to them.  It will be beholden to whomever happens to be in office as to whether they are given powers and functions.</P>
    <P>My amendment refers to the coming into effect of all sections of the Bill, while the amendment tabled by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Garland specifies a period of one year for all of this to be put in place. Both amendments are reasonable and both get at the heart of the debate.  Has the commitment to establish an Environmental Protection Agency gone off the boil?  In 1989 the Minister was being photographed with every group protesting about environmental protection. Environmental protection and the need for an agency were at the top of the Minister's agenda but they seem to have disappeared.  At the rate we are progressing, I supect that the Minister will never get to cut the tape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>She will not be the Minister of State who will open the Environmental Protection Agency.  The whole situation has changed.  Perhaps it is because the dog is wagging the tail again. The commitment to the Environmental Protection Agency has gone off the boil and the agency will not be in operation until two or three years after the enactment of this legislation.  In 1989 there was <Col N="398" /> general support for the idea of an agency which would get to grips with environmental problems and have the requisite powers to do so, but the whole thing is beginning to drift away.  It is critical that this House puts down a marker that the Environmental Protection Agency be established without delay, get on with their business without delay and be properly resourced and staffed.</P>

      <P>You will know the seanfhocal, tús maith leath na hoibre. This is a very bad start for the Minister and I think she will regret what she has just said.  It shows she has no clout, that she says a great deal about environmental protection but has no real determination to get on with this Bill and to get agency set up and running.  If she had, she would grasp the amendment in the names of Deputies Howlin and Garland.  That is a reasonable amendment and proposes to give her one year, following the enactment of this Bill, to set up the agency and to get all parts of the Act in operation. Deputy Gilmore has acknowledged that that amendment gives more flexibility than his.</P>
      <P>The Minister should quickly redeem herself and accept the amendment in the names of Deputies Howlin and Garland, otherwise she may have left the Government benches like the three Ministers for the Environment since this Bill was first mooted.  Indeed, Deputy Flynn has been recycled to the back benches and now to the Front Bench since this Bill was launched.  I do not wish the Minister of State Deputy Harney, to be recycled to the back benches but she may be before this Bill is passed.  From her comments it is clear she will no longer be Minister of State with responsibility for environmental protection by the time this agency is up and running.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her remarks on these amendments are regrettable.  I ask her to reflect on what she has said and accept the need for a timescale bearing in mind that when the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill on the proposal to set up an Environmental Protection Agency was before this House in November 1989 it was voted down by <Col N="399" /> Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats on the basis that they were bringing in their own Bill and would be setting up their own agency in 1990.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that the Minister should come in here this morning and say she cannot accept a time limit of one year, not from today but from the passing of this Bill and signature by the President, which could be a couple of months down the road.  The Minister said she cannot accept that because it might be two years or more before any of the sections can become operative.  That is extremely disappointing bearing in mind that there have been several offers from this side of the House to expedite the progress of this Bill either by way of agreed times for dealing with sections or by special committees. Deputy Howlin and I have made that offer on different occasions in order to expedite the Bill because of the importance and urgency of it.</P>
    <P>At the outset of Committee Stage the Minister has stripped herself of any reputation she had for a sense of urgency in relation to environmental protection.  I ask her to reflect on her position and to accept the amendment in the names of Deputies Howlin and Garland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <P>Like previous speakers, I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  We all realise we have not got the luxury of being able to go through this Bill slowly, dotting all the i's and crossing all the t's.  I would remind Members and the Minister that we in this country and people throughout the world are facing a major ecological crisis.  What is the Minister's response?  She said the Environmental Protection Agency may not be set up for another two years following the enactment of this Bill.</P>

      <P>We cannot wait that long.  The coded message I am getting is that there has been a message issued by the Cabinet which says, slow this down, we have to cater for the chemical lobby, the agri-business and for budgetary <Col N="400" /> restraints; slow it down, bring it in gradually, string it out as long as possible.  Since I have been elected to this House there has been a cynical provision in the budget each year for the Environmental Protection Agency.  The people framing that budget must have known in their hearts and souls there was no possibility of any expenditure being made for the Environmental Protection Agency because there was never any possibility of the Environmental Protection Agency being set up. I wonder if there will be any expenditure provided this year for the Environmental Protection Agency.  To me it seems very doubtful.</P>
      <P>Without digressing too far from the subject in the last few months thousands of people in Naas were subjected to poisoned water.  The latest incident is in Strokestown, County Roscommon, where three days ago, thousands of families were affected by polluted water, which was not fit to drink even after boiling.  We must get this agency up and running.  We have a crisis at this stage. We cannot afford to fiddle about with it. Let us get on with it and, please take this amendment on board.</P>

      <P>I am committed to having this agency established as quickly as possible.  Deputies are being a little unfair.  I regret it has taken so long for this Bill to get to this Stage.  There was a long delay in the publication of the Bill following the 1989 press conference; I regret that.  We have had many political difficulties over the last number of months to which many Deputies referred.  Since I became Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, we have had three Ministers for the Environment.  The fact that I am still a Minister of State at that Department is a good sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem saying to Deputy Howlin that I will endeavour to the best of my ability to have this agency established as quickly as possible but if I were to accept the amendment I would be grossly irresponsible because the agency may not be fully operational.  It is not that the agency will not be up and running, as <Col N="401" /> Deputy Gilmore said; I have no doubt that this agency will be established this year.  It is intended to get this legislation through the House in a matter of weeks and I hope I have the will and the co-operation of all Members of the House. Deputy Gilmore is involved in the establishment of a new party as I was a number of years ago, and we all know it takes time to do certain things.  For example, the procedure we have put in place for the recruitment of the director general and the directors is such that it will take at least four to six months to recruit those staff.  Why?  We may have to have a head hunting exercise, we may have to recruit the services of a professional organisation to help recruit the right people.  It will not be easy to find the director general and four directors with the expert, scientific and professional knowledge to allow them to carry out their functions.  I want to be honest with you.  There is no doubt that, following their appointment, it will take time before they can organise their affairs, recruit staff and carry out their various functions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom Act was passed in 1990, almost two years ago, yet to this day, they are experiencing enormous difficulties trying to operate their integrated pollution control licence. It is new, it is difficult and it is complex. I am not even waiting for the agency. Recently, we commissioned consultants to draw up proposals in relation to BATNEEC so that, when the agency are established and begin to operate the integrated pollution control licence, they will have the assistance of a group of consultants who have done work on this issue for the European Commission.  Other preliminary work is under way to ensure that when the Bill is enacted there will be no undue delay in relation to some of the back-up ancillary services that will be required.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points made by Deputy Allen &mdash; he has made these points on a number of occasions &mdash; it is not correct to say that neither Cork Corporation nor any other local authority have the power to deal with pollution <Col N="402" /> caused by hospital incinerators, although I accept that we have an inadequate system to deal with hospital waste.  The Department of Health are working on proposals at present to try to rectify this in certain areas.  Under section 26 of the Air Pollution Act, as implemented, local authorities have the power to serve notices.  I will quote the Act exactly to ensure I am not misinterpreted.  It reads:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to a local authority that it is necessary to do so in order to prevent or to limit air pollution, a local authority may serve a notice under this section on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission. </P>
    <P>The local authorities also have the power under section 28 of that Act to go to the High Court to obtain an order to prohibit or restrict any emission.  Those are substantial powers and the local authorities can chose to exercise them if they wish in relation to hospital incinerators or any other matter causing pollution.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that it is my intention to ensure, when this Bill comes into operation, that the regulations I have to make will be made as quickly as possible. I will also ensure, in so far as I can, that the resources and staff are made available to the agency so that they can set about the comprehensive and complex task they are going to be given.  I have always said, even in 1989, that from the time the agency are established it will be two years at least before they are fully operational.  I want to be honest about this.  If I accept this amendment and we cannot meet the deadline in 12 months those matters that cannot be put into operation will fall.  It would be highly irresponsible of me for the sake of being popular on this occasion to accept amendments which I know cannot be met and will fall within a short period of time.</P>
    <P>The procedures that will be put in place for the recruitment of staff, including the director general, will be more lengthy than we might have wished because they are going to be independent and we are going to headhunt to try to get the right people some of whom may have to give notice of one month or more.  I am aware, <Col N="403" /> for example, that those with an academic background may have to give more notice if they are to serve on the board of the agency.  These are practical difficulties which I will have to overcome.  As I said, it would be irresponsible of me for the sake of being popular to accept an amendment of this kind.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of resources to which Deputy Garland referred, we envisage that when the agency are fully operational, at present day monetary values, it will cost about £8 million to fund the agency about half of which will be met through the redeployment of existing staff in the State and local authority sectors while the remainder will be met by way of additional State expenditure. I have no doubt that the Government are commmitted to providing those resources.  I have not been told, as Deputy Garland suggested, to slow it down and keep things going for as long as possible.  As Deputies are aware, it has been difficult to get time in this House to debate this legislation.  A number of Bills have been brought forward by my own Department, such as the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill and the Roads Bill, and we have been under a lot of pressure &mdash; indeed, there have been many changes &mdash; to get legislation onto the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>I seriously considered a suggestion made by both Deputy Howlin and Deputy Mitchell &mdash; in fairness, Deputy Gilmore mentioned this during the course of the debate on Second Stage &mdash; that we set up a special committee.  I felt that we might have had a more meaningful debate at such a committee because there are only a few Deputies who have an interest in this legislation, as can be seen from the number present. However, given the amount of time it took for the Companies Act and the Child Care Act to become law and that we have gone through a long process already I felt we could not go down that road.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to see to it that this agency are established this year.  As I said, I hope the Bill will be passed within <Col N="404" /> a matter of weeks and that we can then begin the process immediately of recruiting the director general and the directors. I can tell the House from the time the Bill is signed into law that the process will begin within a matter of days.  I can give the House that assurance.  I should also say that other things that we can do in advance are being done and will be done.</P>
    <P>Some political decisions have to be made in relation to where the agency will be located.  These will have to be made as a matter of urgency because before we start to recruit people we will have to know where they will be located.  In so far as the House is prepared to accept it, I want to give the House an assurance that I will endeavour in so far as I physically can, to use Deputy Howlin's language and to the best of my ability ensure that the agency are fully operational as quickly as possible.  They will certainly be operational this year but they will not be fully operational for about two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State's assurances are meaningless because we were given assurances as far back as 1989. I am not going to go through the statements that have already been made or to repeat myself but we were given assurances in 1989.  It is quite obvious, to use the Minister of State's own words, that it is a question of resources and that the resources that will be required by the agency will not be available to them.  We are now talking about the redeployment of staff from the local authorities and other bodies but if the Minister of State is going to depend on staff who will be redeployed from the local authorities the local authorities will be left with very little &mdash; to return to the point I made at the outset &mdash; in relation to their ability to monitor emissions from hospital incinerators or other incinerators within their jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State quoted section 26 of the Air Pollution Act and stated that the local authorities will be able to go to the High Court to seek an injunction. That is all very well but one must first have evidence.  At present the local authorities <Col N="405" /> do not have the expertise, the technology or the powers to enter property of other bodies to monitor emissions. This is correct and the Minister of State should not try to fudge the issue.  At present the local authorities in my own city are only monitoring emissions of sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide.  That is the only testing being done in regard to atmospheric pollution.  There is a possibility &mdash; this is a problem in your own constituency, Mr. Chairman &mdash; that dioxins are present in emissions from hospital incinerators which inefficiently burn disposable waste, such as plastics and polyvinyl chlorides.  There is evidence to show this.  Last week the Southern Health Board stated that their incinerators did not have the capacity to cope with the pressure.  Given the possibility that very dangerous and hard to detect gasses are being emitted, the Minister of State's statement is very shallow. I can state quite categorically that the local authorities do not have the ability to take any offender to the High Court and it is grossly misleading to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of resources, it is quite obvious, while I do not doubt the Minister of State's good intentions, that there is a greater master, that somebody else is pulling the strings and dictating the pace.  As I have already said, this most pressing issue is tied in with the question of an industrial policy because if we do not have proper controls, a proper policy and agency, industrialists will be very slow to deal with us.  This is fundamental in relation to the drive towards job creation.  Yet, the Minister of State has come into the House to state that the agency will not be fully operational for two years.</P>
    <P>The groundwork and the homework have not been done.  It is only now that the Department are preparing plans to implement what is passed by this House. The groundwork should have been done. Both the Minister of State and her Department have been extremely negligent in regard to this lack of preparation. Will the Minister tell us what financial resources are available from the <Col N="406" /> Exchequer for this and next year to carry out the very important functions referred to in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister lacks credibility; she talked convincingly, as she is prone to do, about setting up the Environmental Protection Agency this year.  However, the problem is she said that more than two years ago and that is why we find it difficult to believe her now. We listened incredulously as she said it could be more than two years after the Bill has been enacted before some of its provisions will be in operation.  Deputy Allen inquired about resources.  What provision has been made in the budget for the agency this year?</P>
      <P>I did not fully agree with the point made by Deputy Garland a few minutes ago but perhaps there is some substance in it.  Are some of the Minister's party industrial friends slowing the progress of the Bill?  What other explanation is there?  The Minister initially said the Bill would be implemented in two years and four months but now she says that it will perhaps be another two years and four months before some of the sections are implemented.  If the Minister was sincere, she would not have to wait, she could set up a non-statutory agency which was done in the case of Bord Telecom and An Post.  Before the enactment of legislation these bodies were set up and did all the preparatory work so that they could be in operation as soon as the legislation was enacted.  Why has the Minister not set up non-statutory boards?  Why can she not set procedure in train for recruiting a director general now, anticipating the legislation?  The Minister has been fooling us and all her speeches about environmental protection have been fakes.  It is certainly a very depressing start to the debate on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address my amendment which deals with the same problem, in a different way.  The Minister of State to date has concentrated on the mechanics of setting up the agency and the length of time it will take to recruit a director general.  She also talked about <Col N="407" /> the extent of the notice someone in the academic world &mdash; I do not know whether she has anyone in mind &mdash; might have to give to their employer.  That is all understood.  However, when the Bill is passed there is provision for establishing the agency straight away taking into account the time they would take to recruit staff, set up an office and purchase equipment.  There is no sign of implementing Part III which deals with the functions of the agency and which might not be brought into effect for another two or more years.  Curiously, she proposes bringing into effect immediately the Bill is passed Part V which I would have thought was more complicated and with which she would have the greatest difficulty as it deals with integrated pollution control and the very significant changes in the way planning and licence applications and so on are to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nice words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that part of the Bill &mdash; borne out by the submissions I received &mdash; is likely to cause the greatest difficulty; it is the most complicated and will involve the greatest deal of interface between local authorities, the agency, the Department and so on.  Yet it is the part with which the Minister is going ahead.  The only conclusion I can come to is that it is the part which industry wants her to go ahead with.  It is the part which will get industry through the licensing and planning procedures more quickly than at present. However, Part III, which deals with environmental protection as we all know it, will not come into effect for some time afterwards.  I should like to refer to matters dealt with in Part III and to explain to the Minister of State, if it has not already dawned on her, the implications of what she is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the agency relating to drinking water will not be brought into effect until a Minister, at some point in the future, decides to give the agency functions in that area.  As Deputy Garland <Col N="408" /> said, there has already been a crisis in Naas in regard to the quality of drinking water.  One of the most frequent environmental complaints which I get as a public representative is about the quality of drinking water which contains particles. An industry has grown in this supposedly green country for bottled water because people do not trust the quality of water coming out of their taps. Yet the function of the agency in that regard will not come into effect until sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>A critical situation is developing in regard to a proposed landfill site for Dublin's waste.  People in Kill, County Kildare, oppose the location of a major landfill site to take Dublin's waste. Dublin local authorities are actively considering what they will do about waste disposal as the life of the existing waste disposal dumps comes to an end.  These matters are being considered at present yet the section of the Bill which would have given the Environmental Protection Agency some control and power to make regulations as to how local authorities manage landfill sites, how they select them and so on will not come into effect until all the decisions have been made. The Dublin local authorities will have made their decision about how they will deal with waste disposal for probably the next 20 or 30 years before the section comes into effect.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the monitoring of activities of public authorities.  There are controversies in parts of the country at present in regard to where the Office of Public Works propose to locate interpretative centres.  Yet the regulations in the Bill dealing with the monitoring of public authorities, which would have some influence in that regard, will not come into effect until later.  We know that a report on the state of the environment which the Minister's Department should have prepared last July for the Rio de Janeiro Conference has not yet been prepared; presumably the Environmental Protection Agency are the kind of body which would play a role in that yet the functions of the agency involved in preparing reports on the state of the environment <Col N="409" /> do not come into effect until sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>There will also be a European Directive in relation to labelling long before the Environmental Protection Agency deal with it.  I cannot understand why it is possible for the Minister to activate immediately Part V dealing with the most complicated aspect of this legislation, integrated pollution control, and it is not possible to activate the section giving the agency functions in relation to all these current matters which are urgent and which certainly cannot wait for two or more years before they are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said earlier that he felt I was conceding that the amendment I have tabled is not wide enough.  It is a very wide amendment.  All I am saying is that those sections should come into operation once the agency are established. It is perfectly understandable that a new agency will not be able to get on top of everything immediately but as soon as the agency are set up they should be able to start dealing with all of these urgent matters.</P>
    <P>I though it would have been a matter for the agency, the director general and his or her directors, when they are appointed, to decide the immediate priority of the agency.  The Minister is proposing to make integrated pollution control the priority.  Because of all the complications which will be involved &mdash; the involvement of the planning staff in local authorities, An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency, etc &mdash; I believe this will bog down the agency for years.  It will take the agency, if they are under-resourced &mdash; which I suspect they will be &mdash; years to get around to dealing with the day to day matters of environmental protection which are of concern to the public, for example, matters relating to drinking water, disposal of waste, the state of the environment, what public authorities are doing, etc.</P>
    <P>It is critical that Part III is given effect to as soon as the Bill is enacted.  I have deliberately used the term &ldquo;commence operation&rdquo; on the understanding that it will take time for the relevant staff to be <Col N="410" /> transferred, etc.  Surely there is no reason the Minister cannot concede that, unless what is being proposed here is a fake Environmental Protection Agency which in practice will turn out to be a clearing house for quick fix licences to be issued to industries which find it a bit cumbersome at present to go through the normal planning procedure and which sometimes end up in An Bord Pleanála under appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to say to Deputy Gilmore that what is being proposed is certainly not a fake Environmental Protection Agency.  Deputy Mitchell, who unfortunately has left the House, accused me of being influenced by what he called my big industrial friends who perhaps had asked me to slow down.  I do not know who my big industrial friends are but I presume Deputy Mitchell has many more big industrial friends than I have.  Whatever about being taken to task over delays in regard to other matters, I do not think I could ever be accused of bowing to any vested interest.  I reject Deputy Mitchell's incorrect suggestion and I respectfully ask him to withdraw it.  In fact, it was not even put to me by any vested interest that there should be a slowing down.  Even if it had been, it is not something I would consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure Deputy Gilmore that I do not have anyone in mind to serve as director general or as a director. However, it has been put to me by many people, particularly by those in the environmental world, that it will be extremely difficult to get the kind of staff necessary to do the job.  There may not be many of these people in the country at present.  This is why we have so many problems in the way we organise environmental protection and pollution matters. By making 33 local authorities responsible for such matters obviously they cannot all have the kind of expertise which will enable them to monitor and licence very technical, complex and difficult issues.  Therefore, it will take time and it will be a difficult process.  There may have to be a head hunting exercise <Col N="411" /> to recruit the broad range of staff who will have to be part of the board.  Obviously everyone cannot have the same kind of expertise and different expertise will be required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made some very useful points in relation to the functions of the agency.  I will undertake in advance of Report Stage to look again at what functions can be reasonably given to the agency when they are set up.  I want to sound a warning in this respect.  I remember being told by the people who worked in An Foras Forbartha that when there was a difficult problem they were snowed under with work and were not given adequate resources: it was a handy way of handing out work and making somebody else responsible.  I am keen to ensure that that does not happen to this agency.  This is why I have included a provision in the Bill which proposes that no additional functions can be given to the agency without consultation with them.  It would be very easy for a Minister or Government of the day to pass on a difficult problem to some independant outside body and leave it there.  This would not be appropriate or reasonable.  When the director general and the directors are appointed I envisage discussing with them the phasing in of the operations and responsibilities which they will be given.  I have always said that this has to be done on a phased basis and I believe it would be reasonable if I discussed with them a type of phase-in programme, for example, areas which they believe they can begin to work on immediately and those which might take some time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the integrated pollution control licence, obviously we will have much discussion about this later.  This issue has probably taxed my mind more in recent times than any other Part of the Bill.  I believe many of the problems have been caused because of the way the existing licensing system is organised.  This has also led to a lack of confidence in some parts of the country about the existing enforcement and monitoring mechanism. If there are new developments and we have an agency in place who <Col N="412" /> do not have any say, I believe public confidence in the agency will be immediately eroded.  If a community group are agitated about a particular project which is still being handled by the local authorities who, on occasion are not perceived to be handling it adequately, it will be very difficult for the agency to start off on a right footing if they do not have an integrated pollution control function in the first instance.  If they have to sit back while debates are going on in relation to these matters, because they have not been assigned this function, it would be very awkward and would discredit the agency.</P>
    <P>I accept that it would be easier to leave this function to last as it will be an enormously difficult task, as can be seen from experience in the UK at present.  It is a totally new function and it will be particularly taxing on the resources and expertise of the agency, particularly in terms of complex developments.  Nevertheless as it will be a central function of the agency and is part of the <i>raison d'etre</i> of having the Bill in the first instance I believe it is appropriate that the agency should begin to operate that licence immediately.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Gilmore made some very valid points.  I will give an undertaking, without giving any commitments, to look at them again to see what we can do to ensure that some of the functions are brought into effect on the passing of the Act and the establishment of the agency.  Obviously the agency will have to be established before the functions can be put into place.  I had always envisaged discussing the allocations of the functions on a phased basis with the director general and the directors as they recruited staff and staff were transferred from local authorities and public authorities generally. I believe it is appropriate to start devolving the functions on that basis.  It will be in my interests to ensure before I leave office, which hopefully will be in two years time or so, that I give this agency, which will be in being, all the functions I can.  That is certainly my intention and I will endeavour to do this. Obviously no Minister wants to establish a body and then leave them stripped of <Col N="413" /> functions and powers.  This would be grossly irresponsible and I can assure the House that that is not my intention.</P>
    <P>In relation to resources, I want to say to Deputies Mitchell and Allen that £710,000 was provided in this year's Estimate. Some of this money is being spent on consultancy work in relation to BATNEEC for certain sectors.  A substantial amount of the resources will come to the agency when staff are redeployed. Many of the staff in the Environmental Research Unit of my Department who were formerly with An Foras Forbartha, and staff from other public authorities, will be redeployed to the agency and the resources will travel with them. As I said earlier, approximately £4 million will come from the redeployment of existing State or public authority staff. There will be a net additional £4 million when the agency are fully operational. That is the best estimate of cost I can give at present.  I am satisfied that the Government are committed to providing resources of that order to ensure that the agency can do their job.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone around in circles without really saying anything.  She referred to the integrated pollution control licences and the complicated and complex issues involved.</P>
      <P>There are pressing issues that could be dealt with more than adequately given the will and the necessary resources.  The more the Minister goes on, the more dubious I become of the whole exercise. She said that £710,000 will be provided this year and that staff will be deployed from other bodies.  The deployment of staff alone is not the answer.  What about the technology required to carry out the extensive monitoring on industrial sites throughout the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where will the money come from to carry out that work?  A sum, of £4 million may sound impressive but it is totally inadequate.  I accept it is very easy for the Opposition to say that but that amount of money will not provide the comprehensive air-water pollution monitoring system required here.  It seems we will have a toothless giant, a body that <Col N="414" /> will have powers they cannot implement, while industrialists will be left to monitor themselves.  The more the Minister goes on, the more incredible this exercise becomes.  The Minister is fast changing from being the darling of the Green lobby to someboyd who will be seen as the greatest hedger of all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I forecast that the Minister will be well gone from office before this agency have any real ability to tackle the major problems here.  I could talk about these problems all day.  It is incredible that only £710,000 is being provided this year and perhaps £4 million next year, with a deployment of staff.  If it is just a question of moving bodies around the bodies who are there already could do the work.  It is all about powers and resources such as the technology and equipment that is required in each area.</P>
      <P>For example, in Cork we have the manpower but not the resources or the equipment to deal with the problems there. Last week again in Little Island noxious fumes were emitted but nobody could tell the people what was happening.  Neither the Garda, the county council, the corporation nor any of the State agencies know what is happening.  Problems constantly arise in Cork Harbour, but the industries do not have the equipment to deal with them.  I pity the industries in this area because there is a culprit there but everybody is being tarred with the same bush and the protest groups are being given more and more muscle.  Here again there is a fudging of the issues.  The Minister speaks nice words and makes general statements but no action is taken. About four years ago this matter became a very important political issue but before that time nobody was interested in environmental protection.  Suddenly everybody rushed in with pious platitudes to the people involved but no real commitment was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody had great expectations for this legislation but only £710,000 is being provided, with a little more to be provided <Col N="415" /> next year and people to be deployed from one body to another. There is no detail as to the equipment or the technology that will be involved.  The buzz words of the moment, which can be seen in all magazines, are, &ldquo;integrated pollution control licences&rdquo;.  The whole exercise is vague and abstract.  There will be academic discussion, a great deal of debate and conflict, but no real action for the people who are affected, the industries, the people living nearby and, most important, the unemployed who demand a combined effort between industrial development and environmental protection and a guidance as to where we are going.  At this stage we do not know were we are going.  We will be debating Committee Stage for four or five weeks and we will end up with a toothless giant without resources.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the commencement date.  We have had a very broad-ranging discussion on aspects of the Bill, but I will try to avoid getting into the meat of the legislation which will be dealt with by way of specific amendment. We have all put great effort into the preparation of this Bill and are frustrated at the slowness of its passage through the Houses.  I am anxious to reach a consensus because I know we cannot force this issue.  If the Minister does not accept the reasoned argument from this side of the House she can troop in enough bodies to vote down the amendments.  I am asking the Minister to display her commitment to bringing in this legislation by moving an amendment to the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Garland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it was her intention substantially to accept the import of what we propose, to have the balance of the Bill brought into effect on or before one year after the passing of this Bill.  She voiced the fear that if it was not possible to have one section enacted by that date that section would fall.  I am suggesting that she insert an extra clause to the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Garland to the effect that such a <Col N="416" /> deadline would be contingent on a resolution of the Dáil, or a form of words to the effect that if it was not possible to have every provision enacted within the 12 month deadline a subsequent resolution of the Dáil could defer the enactment of any particular provision.</P>
    <P>If we cannot agree to a form of words now perhaps the Minister, on Report Stage, will accept the thrust of our arguments and ensure that the agency with all their functions are up and running within 12 months.  If for any technical reason that is not possible, despite the legislative imperative I am seeking to put into this Bill, perhaps the legislation could be referred back to the House, giving the people's representatives an opportunity to pass a resolution allowing for a delay in any one section which could not be put into effect for some reason.  This is much too important a clause to let slip by.  We have about 300 amendments to address but if we withdraw this one and accept the word of the Minister &mdash; I know it is made in good faith &mdash; all the hard work and all the good intentions will mean nothing to the people.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment, to agree that the legislation be enacted into law within the 12 month timeframe and, if there is difficulty with any section or subsection, we can address it in 12 months time by way of resolution in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in her reply made two promises without commitment; that she would examine what functions could be commenced and that she would come back on the matter on Report Stage.  I have some doubt as to the value of a promise without commitment, but I am prepared to accept the Minister's word and, therefore, I will be withdrawing my amendment.  However, I wish to put on record that I will be tabling it on Report Stage and if the Minister does not come back with a positive response she will have to explain her position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider the points made by Deputy Howlin.  We have had a long debate on this important matter and that reflects the anxiety of <Col N="417" /> Members to have the agency up and running as quickly as possible.  To some extent, it also reflects our frustration that that has not happened before now.  The reasons given by the Minister for not accepting the amendment of Deputy Howlin and Deputy Garland were legalistic and technical.  Deputy Howlin has now provided the Minister with a formula whereby she could overcome her legalistic and technical concerns.  As the Minister has already made a commitment in relation to my amendment, it would be only fair of her to make a similar commitment or agree to the point made by Deputy Howlin in respect of amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two points at this stage.</P>
      <P>On the most recent occasion I spoke I forgot to comment on a point made by Deputy Allen and, in the main, by Deputy Mitchell.  Deputy Mitchell wondered why I could not appoint the director general and the board in advance of the passage of the Bill if I were really serious about getting the agency off the ground quickly.  The Deputy suggested that I follow the procedure taken in the appointment of the board of Bord Telecom and of An Post.  If Deputy Mitchell is suggesting that the appropriate manner of appointing a director general and directors is for a Minister to choose names, put them to the Government and have the Government appoint those people, I cannot accept that.  It is fundamental to the operation of the agency that there be a selection process that is seen to be independent and that an outside committee consisting of organisations such as the Congress of Trade Unions and the Council for the Status of Women be involved in the selection process.  Although there is no nomination procedure involved here, that would be similar to the way in which the board of An Bord Pleanála is appointed.  I do not consider it appropriate to follow the procedure used in the appointment of Bord Telecom.  I forgot to reject that idea earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the points made recently <Col N="418" /> by Deputy Howlin and Deputy Gilmore, I do not disagree with most of what has been said.  I want the agency to be working as quickly as possible.  I, too am very frustrated at the length of time that is being taken on this issue.  That is probably the reason I am being encouraged to think again before Report Stage in relation to what Deputies are saying. Even in 1989 when the idea was first mooted, I said that I envisaged a period of about two years before the agency would become fully operational.  I still believe that that is the kind of timeframe that will be required before the agency can be given its whole range of functions. I also believe that it would be appropriate to discuss the allocation of functions with the director general and the director so that, on appointment their capacity and their feelings about dealing with the functions are known.  For example, the agency would devolve certain functions, perhaps monitoring functions and so on to local authorities and other groups.  All such matters will take time to organise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned monitoring costs.  It is envisaged in the Bill that the cost of monitoring processes and companies and plants will not be borne by the taxpayer but by the companies so monitored.  That provision is reasonable and fair.  When high monitoring costs are incurred they will have to be met by the person or the company so monitored.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I will consider the matter before Report Stage.  I shall do my best to determine the way in which we can best do what I realise the Deputies want done, which is also what I want done.  Obviously, I have to take the advice that if the agency were to undertake their role in all functions within a year they might not be able to cope.  The reasons for that might be only technical reasons, it could be that the agency would not have the required capacity in a certain area because of a lack of expertise or a particular resource, and in this I do not necessarily mean a lack of financial resources from the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to countenance the agency falling for such a reason.  It would be better that the agency not be operational <Col N="419" /> in all its functions for two years than that they never become operational. That is the reason I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment now.  I do not want the agency to commence all functions immediately.  It would be unreasonable to establish a new body and expect them to carry out such a large number of functions from the first day.  Such a requirement would prove very cumbersome and difficult and would be very much an instance of the Government passing the buck to the agency.</P>
    <P>I shall come back to the House on Report Stage and shall do my best to take on board what the Deputies want to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very brief final comment.  I am anxious that there not be a full opening of the debate again on Report Stage.  The formula I suggest has been followed by the House in the past. I suggest the addition at the end of amendment No. 3, in the names of Deputy Garland and myself, the words &ldquo;unless Dáil Éireann otherwise order.&rdquo;. I am sure that Deputy Garland would have no objection to that proposal.  The result would be that the amendment would come into effect but there would be an out clause if that were not possible for a reason such as one of those outlined by the Minister.  I am sure the Minister could now indicate to us that that is feasible rather than put the House through another two-hour debate on Report Stage, precious time that the House does not have available.  If this issue is not put right the Bill will be fundamentally flawed.  I again ask that the Minister now accept the amendment, with the ministerial addendum I have suggested, that the Minister herself propose the addition of the words &ldquo;unless Dáil Éireann otherwise order.&rdquo;.  The Minister has broadly accepted the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) ionising radiation, electro-magnetic <Col N="421" /> radiation and other radiations (light and heat), or </P>
    <P>(f) residues (salts and pesticides);&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The list of items mentioned in the Bill as it comes from the Seanad &mdash; the emission into the atmosphere of pollutants, the discharge of polluting matters, sewage effluent or trade effluent, the disposal of waste and noise pollution and so on &mdash; are all matters of major concern.  I could speak for hours on the issue.  However, I am puzzled by the omission of ionising radiation and pesticides.  I ask the Minister whether the whole question of ionising radiation is a matter for the Nuclear Energy Board.  Is it solely the function of the Nuclear Energy Board to monitor and report on such issues?  What interlink will there by between the agency and the Nuclear Energy Board?  I seek assurances on that whole area.  I shall not waste the time of the House by going into too much detail.  The House has spoken about nuclear waste, its dangers and related issues.  I draw attention to a recent incident involving the robbery of a vehicle containing nuclear waste.  The issue is major and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in that regard.</P>
    <P>In today's papers we read again of a major health scare concerning pesticides, this time in Holland, and involving many Irish workers who have gone over there to work in horticulture.  It is alleged that dangerous pesticides are being used in horticulture in Holland.  This is another huge issue that has created a lot of uncertainty. I should like to hear the Minister's opinions on this issue also.  What will be the agency's role in relation to pesticides? What will be their working relationship with the Department of Agriculture in relation to the use and control of pesticides? I shall make my position on the issue known, depending on the Minister's response.  Deputies could go on at length and spend another hour and a half discussing these two issues but if the Minister can satisfy me that these matters will be dealt with adequately either by the agency, or the agency in conjunction with <Col N="422" /> some other body, I shall be happy.  I should like to hear her views on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 in my name basically deals with the expansion of the definition of &ldquo;emission&rdquo; in section 3.  There are already four different types of emissions in the Bill.  I was proposing to add an additional two.  My first additional proposal is very similar to that in the Fine Gael amendment tabled by Deputies Mitchell, Carey and Allen; while they call for the definition of &ldquo;emissions&rdquo; to include &ldquo;ionising radiation, electromagnetic radiation and other radiations (light and heat),&rdquo; mine simply says &ldquo;radiation&rdquo;.  Possibly theirs is a better proposal.  I have no problem with paragraph (f) of their amendment which reads &ldquo;residues (salts and pesticides);&rdquo;.  I propose another addition &mdash; subparagraph (f) of my amendment &mdash;&ldquo;release of a genetically modified organism as defined in section 109;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the radiation aspect first.  This matter arose in connection with the debate on the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  At that time I had tabled amendments to take the power for dealing with radiation and radiation related matters from the proposed Radiological Protection Institute, and vesting it in the proposed Environmental Protection Agency for the simple reason I felt it was ridiculous to have the Department of Energy monitor their own protection agency.  Clearly radiation and related problems should come within the purview of the Environmental Protection Agency.  If this amendment is accepted it could necessitate an amendment of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  If that is the case, so be it; if we got it wrong, let us put it right.  I hope the Minister of State will not resort to the lame excuse that she would have to amend the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.  We should first establish what is the proper place to deal with this.  I submit that it arises more properly on this Bill than on the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of my amendment deals with the release of a genetically modified organism, a rather technical, <Col N="423" /> but nonetheless important subject.  Two EC Directives have been issued on these GMOs which were to have been implemented by 23 October 1991.  It would appear that the Government are not taking their responsibilities seriously in regard to GMOs since they have failed to implement those directives by the deadline, particularly disturbing since many of the worthwhile provisions in this Bill will not apply to GMOs.  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency is not being given a proper role with regard to GMOs; basically they would not be controlled by the agency. One problem arises in that sometimes GMOs are used to clean up pollution. Nobody knows what the consequences will be; nobody knows what actually happens these novel organisms.  I commend these two additional definitions to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendments in the names of Deputies Mitchell, Carey, Allen and Garland.  It is odd that responsibility for nuclear power and nuclear-generated pollution should rest with the Radiological Protection Institute under the provisions of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, rather than with this proposed new agency.  I do not think anybody will take offence when I say that this is a much more impressive, encompassing Bill than the Radiological Protection Act.  I contend it would be wrong to segregate radiation and the nuclear industry from the general pollution controls coming within the scope of the Environmental Protection Agency.  If I were to be mischievous I am minded to say that the reason this section was beyond the scope of the Department of the Environment led agency might be interdepartmental rivalry but, on reflection, I could not see how there could possibly be rivalry between the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility for environmental matters, and the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, in that they are so <i>ad idem</i> on all issues.  I do believe it is fundamentally wrong that the agency <Col N="424" /> should be debarred from having control over this important area.  I have never seen any cogent or clear reason advanced for this being the case.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister of State to accept the reasonable amendments to give on all encompassing power to the new Environmental Protection Agency we want to establish.</P>
      <P>Certainly paragraph (f) of amendment No. 4 &mdash;&ldquo;residues (salt and pesticides)&rdquo; is a fair, acceptable broadening which I am sure the Minister of State will have no difficulty accepting.</P>
      <P>I also commend Deputy Garland's inclusion in amendment No.  5, (paragraph (f), of &ldquo;genetically modified organism&rdquo; which has been the subject of discussion in recent times.  If we are to enact a comprehensive Bill I contend the Minister should accept the reasonable amendment tabled by Deputy Garland at paragraph (f).  I think the Deputy himself accepts that paragraph (e) of his amendment No.  5 would be better defined within the Fine Gael more comprehensive definition of &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; which spells out the different forms of radiation to be included.  Unless there is a compelling reason I have yet to hear for excluding the nuclear industry from the provisions of this Bill, I contend they should be included and be subject to monitoring by the proposed agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to my amendment No.  12 which also deals with the inclusion of &ldquo;radioactive substance&rdquo; in the definitions and in the forms of pollution the provisions of this Bill are intended to cover.  I contend the Bill would be seriously defective if its provisions were to omit radioactive material from their remit and/or that of the proposed agency. The question of radioactive substances is not confined purely to their management and/or their scientific control.  We know that a pollution problem arises from radioactive substances.  There was a recent case of radioactive material having been found in a truck which gave rise to a potential environmental hazard.  We know also there is a problem with regard to the disposal of radioactive materials, <Col N="425" /> particularly by hospitals.  Essentially those are areas of environmental concern.</P>
      <P>The argument advanced &mdash; and I know this ground was covered in the debate in the Seanad &mdash; by the Minister of State was that the Radiological Protection Institute would be the body responsible, and that, therefore, there was no need to involve the Environmental Protection Agency.  That logic does not apply to other areas of the Bill.  For example, local authorities have responsibility for waste management, waste disposal, the provision of water, sanitary services and a whole range of areas where other more normal, day-to-day substances are concerned. Yet, in those areas the Environmental Protection Agency has been given specific responsibility to make regulations and provide for the environmental protection aspects.  In this legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency are being given responsibility to give directions to other public authorities on how to deal with the environment.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that radioactive materials are being left out of this.  What this reflects is an attitude that has prevailed in society that radioactive materials are out of sight and therefore they are not really a hazard.  There has also been a denial here of the existence of radioactive pollution.  When we think of nuclear waste and radiation there is an automatic assumption that we are talking about Sellafield.  It is almost as if there was no radiation before Sellafield.  Yet, we know that there are radioactive materials used in hospitals and that there is a problem with the disposal of them and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we faced the fact that we have a problem with radioactive materials and with environmental and pollution hazards from radioactive materials and that we make provision to address it.  It is not sufficient to say that radioactive materials need an expert body to deal with them and that there is no cause for worry now that we have an expert body to deal with them.  There is cause for worry.  There is need for a second agency which deals specifically with environmental protection <Col N="426" /> to have an interest in this area.  I have no reason to doubt that the radiological protection institute will not do their job, but who will check if the institute get it wrong or are not applying the highest standards?  There is a need for a second agency to have an interest in this area in the same way that the Environmental Protection Agency will have an interest in the area of drinking water, waste and a whole range of things which are the remit of local authorities. They should also have a remit in the area of radioactive substances.  The definition of radioactive substances should be in this Bill and the Bill should cover radioactive materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Howlin's comments it has nothing to do with my ministerial colleague, Deputy Molloy.  Deputy Molloy and I do not always agree on everything.  I am delighted to be in a party in which we can express those views just like many other members of parties can express different views on fundamental issues.</P>
      <P>In relation to radioactive substances, if we lived in an ideal world, everything that had anything to do with the environment would be under the auspices of my Department, but we do not and there are lots of other arms of Government that deal with certain environmental matters. We will come to that later when we are talking about the definition of environmental protection and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recently passed legislation to establish the radiological institute to replace the Nuclear Energy Board.  That institute will be established very shortly.  It is appropriate that this institute should have sole responsibility for radioactive substances.  We work to streamline the way we organise matters and that is why we are establishing an agency.  It is not fair to say that because we are taking responsibility from local authorities, that is a reason to take responsibility from the radiological protection institute.  We are taking responsibility from local authorities in some cases because it is not possible with the kind of resources and expertise required for all of the 33 local <Col N="427" /> authorities to be able to have the full range of expertise at their disposal.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense in a country which has under four million people to duplicate throughout the country the range of expertise that might only be used to deal with one plant in one county.  It is appropriate to reorganise the way we deal with environmental protection matters by giving an overall agency responsibility, certain supervisory powers and so on.  Since we are also establishing an agency to deal with radioactive substances, it would be improper to give the Environmental Protection Agency a role in relation to that too.  It would lead to confusion and a duplication of scarce resources.  We could not expect this State to recruit and employ on a fulltime basis, experts in relation to radioactive substances in two different agencies.  I am anxious to ensure that there is consultation and discussion.  I am anxious that the agency do not work in a vacuum and that is why there are specific provisions in relation to consultation.  I envisage that when the institute and the agency are established they will work together closely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the radioactive substance found in a truck last week.  I presume he was referring to the incident in Rathcoole.  The people called to deal with that were not local authority staff, they were the Nuclear Energy Board, because they are the only people who can handle matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>In relation to residue salts and pesticides, they are already included in the definition of an emission if they are discharged through polluting matter, sewage effluent or trade effluent within the meaning of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, or if they are emitted into the atmosphere as a pollutant within the meaning of the Air Pollution Act or if they are included in the disposal of waste.  We did not go through the Air Pollution Act and the Water Pollution Act and the various waste directives in operation and include everything by way of defining emissions.  It would not have been satisfactory to do that, but <Col N="428" /> I assure the House that I am fully satisfied that they are covered and that there is no need to include a specific reference to these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to electro-magnetic radiation, light and heat, I am assured that they are already covered under the definition of environmental pollution. Under section 4 (2) of the Bill, environmental pollution includes:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; for the purposes of the Air Pollution Act, 1987; </P>
    <P>Pollutant as defined in the 1987 Act includes as well a specific substance as specified in the First Schedule to that Act and any other substance or energy which may cause pollution.  I am advised that this includes electro-magnetic radiation, light and heat and that therefore this part of the proposed amendment is not necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to genetically modified organisms, perhaps from here on in we should call them GMOs before we are accused of doing rather strange things through this legislation.  They are catered for in section 109 of the Bill which provides for the establishment by means of regulations of a specifically designed control system by these highly complex substances which require special and separate treatment.  This is the approach to GMOs adopted worldwide.  The agency and the IPC licensing system is not the appropriate means for controlling GMOs.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Garland's comment in relation to the European Community Directive, the Deputy is right in saying that we have not implemented it. Only four member states have implemented it, because many of them have to pass separate legislation.  That is why we are including it in this legislation. The release of GMOs is not necessarily a pollutant.  What is required is to control the releases.  That is what we propose to do by providing a mechanism through this legislation so that we can establish a separate special authority to control the use of GMOs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the manufacture of pesticides and pharmaceutical or veterinary <Col N="429" /> products, Deputy Allen asked me a legitimate question in relation to the role of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the role of the agency.  It is the case that the agency will be able to advise on these matters and draw up codes of practice in relation to agriculture.  All pesticides are not pollutants but the manufacture of pesticides, pharmaceutical or veterinary products and their intermediates are controlled under the licensing system in the First Schedule. Under paragraphs 5 and 6 of the First Schedule, the manufacture of these items are and will be controlled by the agency. Obviously the agency will have a role in relation to the laying down of codes of practice and they will be encouraged to advise Ministers either on request or of their own volition in relation to matters of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 4 dealing with ionising radiation is linked to waste management.  I cannot understand how the Minister can allocate different areas of waste management to separate agencies.</P>
      <P>We do not have a waste management policy, but I will not go into that point further today.  How can one separate toxic waste, chemical waste and radioactive waste if it is coming from the same industrial source?  What process will be put in place to separate the waste into these different categories?  It may be difficult for the Minister to answer that question because we do not have a waste management plan.  I thought I made a slip of the tongue when I referred to the Nuclear Energy Board; however the Nuclear Energy Board is still operational because the Radiological Protection Institute has not been set up, despite the enactment of the Radiological Protection Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not raising this matter just to be awkward but I wonder how much thought has gone into the issue of managing waste.  We had the example last year where nuclear radioactive sources were found in waste from an industrial plant. How does the Minister propose to define the role of the agency in the areas of <Col N="430" /> waste management and how will the agency's role be separated from that of the Radiological Protection Institute? Will everybody's baby be nobody's baby? What is the distinction between the functions of the agency and those of the Institute?  I have worked in this area but I find it impossible to divide them.  If one agency is to be responsible for toxic and chemical waste, I believe it should also be responsible for nuclear waste because at times it can be hard to separate waste into different categories.  In the absence of a waste management plan, this may be a difficult question to address.  I would like to hear the Minister's response and perhaps between us we could come up with positive ways to control this growing problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore is right when he says that Sellafield is the most dramatic and publicised issue in the debate on nuclear waste.  It is very convenient to focus on the problem that another country is generating while ignoring the reality at home.  I see that Deputy Burke is in the chamber; he was here one evening when I spoke about nuclear waste and the embarrassment we had to endure when we went to Sellafield to protest.  After raising the question of threats to our environment and health, we were taken four miles down the road and shown a tip head.  Then we were told, very diplomatically, that that was where our nuclear waste was disposed of.  Before we criticise anybody else we should get our act together.  As I said, it is very convenient for us, at times, to focus on an external threat or an external problem, and ignore the reality at home.  We have ignored the problems under our noses for far too long.</P>
    <P>Hospitals, research institutes and universities generate waste.  Before I came into the more radioactive pasttime of professional politics, I worked in this area.  Looking back, it is apparent that the guidelines for dealing with radioactive waste were primitive, in my view they are still primitive, and until such time as we have a national waste management policy there will be major grey areas that will be open to abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> The absence of a waste management policy is a defect in our quest to have a proper industrial development policy and encourage job creation.  I keep harping on this because I have spoken to a great many industrialists who were considering setting up here, but who were aware that there would be a problem with the disposal of waste.  We have not faced up to this problem.  Will the Minister outline her views in this area before I decide whether to press my amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy makes some very valid points in relation to waste and as Members know, we do not have appropriate waste legislation other than the Acts of the last century and the nine EC Directives.  I am very reluctant to say that we are working on waste legislation that will be produced soon &mdash; I say soon but without defining what &ldquo;soon&rdquo; means.  A draft Bill has been prepared but it has to be discussed with a number of interested bodies before it goes for Government approval and subsequent publication.  I am very keen that we will have appropriate waste legislation because it is a gap in our environmental protection legislation. We have up-to-date legislation on air and water pollution, but we do not have up-to-date legislation in relation to waste.  Legislation can do so much by way of penalties and fines, but legislation would also need to be accompanied by a waste management plan with the emphasis on the minimising and reduction of waste and providing appropriate disposal facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about radioactive waste.  I notice that while Deputy Gilmore brought &ldquo;radioactive waste&rdquo; into the definitions, he did not bring it in subsequently in the Bill.  I am not sure what the agency would do in relation to radioactive waste.  Because this is a very specialised, complicated and expensive area to deal with, it is appropriate that the Radiological Protection Institute would be the body to deal with radioactive waste.  I do not think it would be appropriate to load this agency with a function they would find impossible to <Col N="432" /> carry out because another body had the resources and expertise to handle it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked how we would handle several different types of waste from the same plant.  If the agency were faced with a problem of that kind, I envisage that they would consult with and get the advice of the institute and ensure that the standards considered appropriate by the Radiological Protection Institute would be enforced in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>Waste is dealt with by way of licensing under the First Schedule.  It will be the agency's responsibility to license any hazardous waste incinerator or any hospital waste incinerator.  I share the Deputy's concern about hospital waste.  The agency generally will be the licensing, monitoring and enforcing authority. When they deal with matters relating to radioactive waste they will consult with the Radiological Protection Institute and ensure they are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to be awkward but it is difficult to understand why we should have two agencies dealing with the one issue.  I would prefer to see the agency dealing with it.  I would envisage the institute dealing with the controls, conditions and so on. When we have a national waste management policy it is essential that one agency should deal with it.  More than one would be a fatal flaw in the management plan.  We cannot separate the questions of nuclear, chemical or toxic waste.  I will not press the matter if the Minister will undertake to consider it and perhaps come back at a subsequent stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy that assurance because it is not envisaged nor do I think it appropriate that this agency should have responsibility for nuclear waste.  The Radiological Protection Institute will have the power to regulate by license activities involving radioactive substances and to monitor. The institute will have a long list of responsibilities.  Many people would feel that eventually many of the responsibilities <Col N="433" /> of the Departments of Energy and the Environment should be streamlined in regard to environmental matters.  It is, however, appropriate that the Radiological Protection Institute should have responsibility in relation to radioactive waste.  Community Directives on toxic and hazardous waste do not include radioactive waste.  That is always dealt with on a separate basis by a different expert body.  It is appropriate to allow our expert body to handle matters of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have reservations, I do not intend to press this amendment. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter with the Minister for Energy.  The Minister said that pesticides are defined under &ldquo;emissions&rdquo;.  I am worried about the use of pesticides in the cultivation of crops.  The Minister did not give me a satisfactory explanation as to the interlink between the Department of Agriculture and the new agency regarding the use of pesticides as controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The agency has the power to advise Ministers of the Government and public authorities generally on any matter in the interests of environmental protection.  The agency also has the power to draw up codes of practice, including codes of practice for agriculture. A recent Community Directive is now in force relating to the use of pesticides.  The matter is handled by the Department of Agriculture.  I support the Deputy's point about the need to have appropriate controls on the use of pesticides in agriculture.  The agency has an appropriate role by way of advice and codes of practice in relation to a large number of issues, including pesticides.  It has a very broad remit.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line, 30, to delete the definition of &ldquo;established activity&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `established activity' means an activity&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a) in respect of which a permission under Part IV of the Act of 1963 is granted prior to such day (in this paragraph and in paragraph (b) referred to as `the relevant day') as may be prescribed by the Minister and which on the relevant day has not ceased to have effect, in accordance with the provisions of sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982, or</P>
      <P>(b)  which is, on the day immediately prior to the relevant day, or was, at any time during the period of twelve months ending on the day immediately prior to the relevant day, carried on, other than an activity which involves or is associated with an unauthorised structure or an unauthorised use within the meaning of the Act of 1963;&rdquo;.  </P>

    <P>In a very detailed Bill we should try to make its provisions as clear as possible to the reader.  I have sought to put all the definitions in the definitions section.  The definition of &ldquo;established activity&rdquo; is not spelled out in the definition section but it is spelled out in section 80.  People reading the Bill should be able to see the <Col N="435" /> definitions in the definition section without ploughing through the Bill to see where it might occur.  If one did not know it was in section 80 one would have to plough through the Bill to find it.

      <P>We are dealing now with the definition of public authority.  There are two issues, a public authority and a local authority. My understanding is that the normal definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in previous legislation included UDCs in some instances.  This amendment seeks to clarify the definition of &ldquo;public authority&rdquo;. &ldquo;Public authority&rdquo; is defined in paragraph (f) as:</P>
      <P>a board or other body established by or under statute, </P>
      <P>The impact of my amendment is simply to add &ldquo;(other than the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990)&rdquo;.  I understand this was discussed in the Seanad.  For purposes of clarity I want to ensure an ordinary company is not classified as a public authority. Obviously a company would be a board or body established under the Companies Acts.  While the company is defined in two other subsections each subsection stands alone.  For the sake of clarity the amendment as I framed it would improve the definition section.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern for clarity in this case.  However, I have been advised by the parliamentary draftsman that it is clear in the context of the definition that companies incorporated under the Companies Act are not included.  Paragraphs (g) and (h), in particular, bring State-owned companies incorporated under these Acts within the ambit of the definition and serve to make clear that other companies are excluded. <Col N="437" /> The parliamentary draftsman is anxious that we follow the procedure followed in recent legislation so far as the definition of these matters is concerned so that there is no confusion.  For example, both the Urban Renewal Act and the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, follow this definition of a statutory body.  In the interests of clarity it is better that we do not confuse matters by adding in &ldquo;(other than the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990)&rdquo; which might imply in the other Acts that because these words are not included that they are included.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand the logic of that, that we should not have clarity in this Bill lest I would undermine in some way previous Bills because they were less clear.  Clearly, each subsection stands alone.  The Minister rightly said that paragraphs (g) and (h) include certain public companies but they do not exclude any company.  When drafting legislation let us do it to the best of our ability and let clarity be its hallmark.  When we do not mean companies under the Companies Acts, let us state that.  Let us not hope there is an implication by including some companies that other companies are excluded.  That is a very bad way to make laws.  If people were not sharp enough in framing previous legislation to include the sharpest definitions it is no excuse for us not having the finest definitions included in this Bill.  Let us go along step by step putting together the best Bill possible.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) (a), line 24, after &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;through <i>inter alia</i> promoting clean production&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now dealing with section 4 which deals with the definitions of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;, &ldquo;environmental pollution&rdquo; and &ldquo;environmental medium&rdquo; whatever that word means.  Amendment No. 14 proposes that we include after the word &ldquo;pollution&rdquo; the words &ldquo;through <i>inter alia</i> promoting clean production&rdquo;. It should be said very clearly at this stage <Col N="440" /> that it appears the agency will be committed to pollution control rather than pollution prevention.  It is a tragedy, as Ireland establishes its own Environmental Protection Agency, it is adopting an already outmoded and increasingly discredited approach.  Despite several references to the importance of pollution prevention the overwhelming emphasis is on the regulation, licensing and control of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Bill assumes that significant levels of pollution are inevitable in a developed economy.  It sees the role of the Environmental Protection Agency as determining levels of pollution which are to be acceptable in Ireland.  This is a fundamental flaw.  In order to correct this serious weakness the Bill should be amended to contain a statement of commitment to economic planning incorporating the concept of clean production. If the Bill does not incorporate such a commitment to pollution prevention at source on a phased basis the Green Party consider that the agency will be so fundamentally flawed as to be incapable of inspiring public confidence in their ability to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection, in the view of the Green Party, begins at the start of the production process regardless of whether it is pills, pigs or potable water that is being produced.  The Environmental Protection Agency need to focus on and eliminate the causes of pollution and not just concentrate on setting limits for emissions to air and water or for amounts of hazardous waste for disposal on land.  If they are, essentially, preoccupied with these end-of-pipe solutions and the Bill ensures that this will be the case they will fail to tackle the root cause of the pollution problem.  The Environmental Protection Agency will be like a doctor who treats only the symptoms and ignores the causes of the diseases.  The Bill's commitment to pollution prevention at source needs to be stated unambiguously.  I should say to the Minister of State that environmental protection is pollution prevention, not pollution control and this must be addressed to ensure the sustainable development <Col N="441" /> of our economy in the immediate and long terms.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 to section 5 would delete from subsection (1) the words &ldquo;best available technology not entailing excessive costs&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;clean production&rdquo;.  This is the so-called BATNEEC clause which is rightly seen by industry as providing protection for them against what they consider to be the worst effects of this Bill which in some cases would entail excessive costs.  The point should be made that we cannot use this clause, which has been inserted at the behest of industry, to discourage us from producing goods using clean production methods.  I do not think there is sufficient commitment to do this.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 26 I suggest a definition of &ldquo;clean production&rdquo; which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;clean production&rdquo; means production systems which avoid or eliminate hazardous waste and hazardous products, and which ensure that inputs of water, air, soil, energy and other raw materials are renewed, reused or conserved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That amendment is self-explanatory.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments. In the preparation of the next European environmental programme, there has been a thrust away from the &ldquo;thou shalt not&rdquo; principle towards a different frame of mind in relation to the need to protect the environment.  A list of prohibitions which says that one cannot do this and one must not do that would not be put in place; rather it would address in a positive way the issue of enhancing, protecting and defending the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the first in a list of amendments which deal with the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;.  I support the contention put forward by Deputy Garland in the amendment that we should promote clean production in a positive way because it is not enough to say that we will outlaw transgressions against the environment.  We should in a <Col N="442" /> positive way help, assist, promote, develop and encourage mechanisms which are environmentally friendly.  That is the new thinking and the way we should proceed.  Since this legislation is to be the standard for the future, this concept should be incorporated in the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these amendments also because prevention is better than cure at any time.  The emphasis therefore in our policy should be on prevention rather than on the cure which can prove to be far more costly.  Like Deputy Howlin, I welcome the moves which have been made in some of our research institutes in recent times where industry, whether some people like it or not, has become involved in projects the aim of which is to encourage the use of clean processes in industry.  This should be supported in every way.  I hope the Department will place greater emphasis on prevention rather than on the cure because this would be far more cost effective. Naturally, we are all concerned about the environment and, as I said, it is better to prevent damage rather than have to repair it.</P>

      <P>The court case in question has not yet been fully disposed of by the court and the proceedings will be resumed on 23 July next. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to comment on it until it has been concluded.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has been made since the completion of the O'Donnell report in developing the full potential of the Chester Beatty Library.  In particular, improved management and staffing structures have been put in place.  New equipment to ensure the highest conservation standards is being installed in the storage areas and inventory control and cataloguing is being undertaken on a systematic basis.  There is an ongoing review between the Garda and representatives of the library, the Office of Public Works as well as my Department to ensure that security installations, practices and procedures at the library are of the highest order.  I can assure the House that my officials will continue to liaise closely with the library's recently-appointed director to ensure that its unique collections are maintained and exhibited to best advantage for the public benefit.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I take this opportunity to wish him well in his artistic responsibilities.  I wish to ask two questions arising from this reply.  Will the Minister of State say how much the State give as an annual subvention towards this library?  Have the trustees agreed to the proposal contained in the O'Donnell report that they should retire when they reach approximately 70 years of age as the present system of oligarchical self-perpetuation is unacceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provided £260,000 in 1991 to meet the current expenditure for the Chester Beatty Library.  The library have not yet been advised of their allocation for 1992 but a repeat provision is likely.  This compares with a sum of £220,000 for 1989 and 1990, respectively.  In reply to the Deputy's second question, according to the <Col N="444" /> O'Donnell report the maximum age limit of 70 was recommended by the consultant. However, as the Deputy may be aware, the subject has not been pursued with the trustees in deference to the chairman.  Nevertheless, the trustees have accepted the fixed term appointments as desirable and the four most recent appointees were for a five-year period.</P>

      <P>The future use of the properties at 88-89 Merrion Square is currently under consideration between my Department, the National Gallery and the Office of Public Works.  I understand that the director of the National Gallery has plans to develop a Yeats section in the gallery.  I have been pursuing this matter and asked for a meeting to be arranged &mdash; which I will attend &mdash; between representatives of my Department, the National Gallery and the Office of Public works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State with responsibility for arts and culture seriously take on board the suggestion contained in the question, to celebrate the contribution of the Yeats family, male and female, to the culture of our island?  He should also avail of the opportunity to provide access to the public to two potentially fine Georgian houses in Merrion Square, separate and independent, but nevertheless related to the National Gallery, in view of the fact that that type of museum presentation has been so successfully put in place in Paris <Col N="445" /> and Amsterdam?  It would be a mistake to confine the focus of attention on the visual arts contribution of the Yeats family when a unique opportunity presents itself in relation to two State owned properties adjacent to the National Gallery.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, one room in the National Gallery is dedicated to Jack B. Yeats.  At present they cannot exhibit their entire collection of Yeats, which numbers approximately 42 works, because of space considerations. The gallery have already indicated their intention to develop a special Yeats collection within the gallery.  I have an open mind in regard to his suggestion, it is worthy of consideration and I will pursue it at the meeting between officials of my Department, the National Gallery and the Office of Public Works.  However, if the accommodation at 88-89 Merrion Square came under the control of the National Gallery there would be a very strong argument for using it as office accommodation so that there would be more space within the gallery for an expansion of the area dedicated to Jack B. Yeats.  As I said, I will keep his suggestion in mind at the meeting with the people concerned.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  When he is examining this matter will he also look at the house on Merrion Square which the National Gallery restored for their own exclusive use at an outrageous cost, and which is not open to the public?  Will he ensure that that kind of excessive expenditure is not repeated?  Will he also seriously look at the integrated exhibition, not just at the visual arts, which is the sole remit of the gallery, but of the literary works, the Cuala Press and all the other things with which the Yeats family were associated. It is a unique opportunty to do this and the space should not be lost to provide office accommodation for officials within the gallery.  It is inopportune use of scarce space.</P>

BGE will be the principal partner in the joint venture. It is envisaged that there will be other partners.  Whether or not the ESB choose to be a partner is a matter for them.  Presumably the funding will be arranged by the joint venture consortium in proportion to the equity holdings of the various partners in the consortium.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5, 49, 54, 64, 105 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>The ESB were aware of my concerns about the lack of transparency in the billing arrangements for credit sales and about the widespread fears of cut-offs of supply for non-payment of bills for goods bought in ESB shops before I informed the board of my requirements in January 1992.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will probably be aware that agreement has now been reached with the ESB on changes to be made in their billing system for customers making instalment payments for goods bought in ESB shops.  The ESB will be issuing a new style invoice for these customers, which will incorporate distinctly separate bills, one for electricity charges and another for instalment payments on electrical appliances purchased in ESB shops.  I consider that the administration costs associated with the changes to the billing system will be negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new bill for shop purchases will state clearly that the ESB will not disconnect electricity supply for any default in payment for goods purchased in shops. I am pleased that the ESB have <Col N="450" /> responded to my concern for this transparency so that ESB customers can distinguish clearly what is due for electricity and what is due for instalment payments for electrical appliances.</P>
    <P>Electrical appliances will continue to be sold in ESB shops throughout the country and credit facilities will continue to be available.  It was never my intention to deprive lower income families of access to credit facilities.</P>
    <P>The new billing arrangements does not require any change to the ESB's legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Energy is not present to answer these questions.  I should like the Minister to reply to my specific question about whether the Minister for Energy had any consultations with the ESB in advance of this directive.  Will the Minister confirm that the directive went much further than merely seeking transparency in bills?  I have a copy of the Minister's letter in front of me and it refer to alternative credit arrangements and to the discontinuance of the billing system for the purposes of retail sales and it specifically refers to alternative credit arrangements. As I said, I regret that the Minister for Energy is not present to answer these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Energy is abroad today on official business. As I understand it, the Minister for Energy had some discussions with senior people in the ESB on this problem over a long period and expressed his concern about it to them.  The Minister regards the arrangement which has now been arrived at as satisfactory in as much as it clearly distinguishes between the two types of moneys which can be due by a customer to the ESB.  This was not clear up to now and may have resulted in some people having their electricity supply disconnected in circumstances where it would, of course, have been much preferable if they did not have it disconnected.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is widely believed that the Minister for Energy introduced this directive for reasons other than his concern for the consumer?  Is the Minister now saying that his only concern was for the consumer? In view of this, can the Minister be more specific?  For example how many cases did the Minister take up with the ESB where customers had their electricity cut off for the non-payment of instalments for appliances?  Surely there must be a record of the number and specific nature of complaints which the Minister states he made to the ESB about people having their electricity supply cut off because of falling behind in the repayment of their instalments.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the cutting off of electricity is simply a red herring on the part of the Minister for Energy to cover his tracks? Is it not clearly evident from the history of this case that the Minister had no idea of the implications of his directive of 22 January 1992 which could have put ESB shops out of business.  Clearly he saw the <Col N="452" /> light during the intervening six weeks as a result of representations from the 150,000 consumers who were affected. Would the Minister explain why, since these questions were put to the 70 Deputies around this House, the ESB's case was never made until after the Minister issued the directive?  It was the Minister's job to make their case and I would like to know why that was not done.</P>

      <P>I may have understated the number of Deputies who made representations, but Deputy Flaherty corrects me and points out that the figure is 70.  If I inadvertently misled the House by saying that only 53 Deputies were involved, I regret that.  As I have made clear already it was never the Minister's intention to close ESB shops or to stop them trading at retail level.  The Minister was concerned because of the large volume of complaints he was getting about the difficulty for consumers and he was also concerned about the question of fairness of competition as between the ESB and other retailers of electrical appliances.</P>
      <P>This topic has been raised with me, in my capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce, on four separate occasions in this House in the last 12 months in adjournment debates and in debates on the Competition Bill where it was raised several times as being an example of the worst aspects of anti-competitive practices. Several Deputies, particularly in the Fine Gael Party, repeatedly asked me to put a stop to what the ESB were doing and pointed out that it was very unfair. The Minister had a great deal of support for his efforts to make the system more transparent in the interests of the consumer and fairer in everybody's interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say because I have not seen the letters the Minister received.  Obviously under the present billing system, which happily will be changed, if a consumer received a bill part of which related to the consumption of electricity and part of which related to instalments on an appliance and the consumer paid part of the bill but was not able to pay the remainder, he or she was in danger of having the electricity supply cut off.  I do not think that person could have claimed that the part of the Bill he paid related to consumption of electricity rather than to the instalment or instalments he owned on the appliance.</P>

      <P>The position in so far as I know it &mdash; obviously I would not have the close knowledge of it as has my colleague, the Minister for Energy &mdash; is that it was the practice in the ESB to appoint people as directors of subsidiary companies and to pay them fees that were <Col N="455" /> very substantially in excess of the fees that were paid to members of the board of the ESB.  The Minister for Energy has expressed his disapproval of that practice and asked that it be stopped, and I understand that it has stopped.  As far as the question of buying houses for officials is concerned, the Minister for Energy became aware of that some months ago and queried the matter very strongly as to why it should happen and whether it was necessary.  I do not know what the final outcome of his discussions with the ESB on that matter were but I am sure the House will agree that if it happened in the way outlined, it is most desirable that it would not happen again.</P>

    <P>While employment statistics are a matter for the Central Statistics Office and not for my Department, I can provide the Deputies with the following information which may be of assistance. There were 1,772 permanent employees in Coillte Teoranta on 1 January 1992. The comparable figure for 1991 was 1,966.  While I do not have overall employment figures for the forestry sector I can say that the gross employment created by the expansion of forestry activity under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> up to the end of 1990 was some 1,400 jobs.  I am satisfied that the forestry employment targets set out in that programme were not alone achieved but were, in fact, exceeded.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> over 620 full-time job equivalents were created in 1991, and I expect gross job creation in 1992 and 1993 to exceed 1,000.  The programme also calls for an expansion of national planting to 30,000 hectares per annum for the period 1993 to 2000.  Achievement of this target will raise forest cover to about 10 per cent by the turn of the <Col N="457" /> century.  Last year 23,390 hectares were planted and I expect planting this year to exceed 24,000 hectares.</P>
    <P>Timber production last year reached 1.76 million cubic metres and the target for 1992 is 1.9 million cubic metres.  The 2.0 million cubic metres forecast by 1993 in the programme is likely to be exceeded.  Combined public and private sector forest road construction over the period 1990-91 was close on 270 kilometres. The 500 kilometres of forest roads targeted for construction over the period 1990 to 1993 is expected to be exceeded.</P>

What arrangements have been made to provide that weighting?

      <P>In general, for both categories mentioned by the Deputy, grant incentives have been considerably improved, with the help of the EC, which has made moneys available for forestry activity as an alternative to conventional agriculture.  The grant and tax incentives are geared towards greater investment. The indications are that that programme is successful.  The growth in private forestry <Col N="458" /> in recent years has been quite spectacular and, happily, there has also been a growth in public forestry.  Private investment in forestry is now almost equal to that of public investment and will pass it out shortly.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that a new research facility commenced in the University of Limerick in the past year or so.  A good deal of research into both indigenous Irish timber and the usual coniferous species that are also grown here is being carried out.  The studies and work carried out show that the timber is suitable for many purposes for which we have until now relied entirely on imports.  When that develops more widely and becomes commercially available there will be a dramatic substitution of Irish timber for imported timber, and the traditional view of the alleged unsuitability of Irish timber will be overcome.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out that in the year in which I have been spokesperson on Energy, this is the first time we have reached forestry issues.  Regrettably we are testing out many ideas with the wrong Minister, but Deputy O'Malley substitutes very well.  While accepting that there has been a substantial increase in planting and employment from forestry in the public and private sectors, given that there will be a 50 per cent EC wood deficit by the end of the century, <Col N="461" /> given that the percentage of our land used for forestry purposes &mdash; at 6 per cent &mdash; is so far below the 20 per cent to 25 per cent EC average, does the Minister not think there is substantial additional scope for employment creation and increased investment in this area on the part of the public and private sectors; that the targets set in the Programme for Government are not realising anything like their full potential in one area which holds enormous potential by way of employment and economic return for this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the figures I have given that there has been a dramatic increase in planting in recent years, particularly on the private side, but the public level of planting nowadays is also forging ahead to levels much higher that they ever were in the past.  In fact, they are double what they were some years ago. The rate of private planting is greater by a factor of 20 than it was some years ago. Obviously, in terms of utilisation, it will be some time &mdash; because of the nature of timber and forestry &mdash; before the country reaps the full value.  We are certainly building up an extremely valuable asset for the future especially, as the Deputy rightly said, as the EC is at present only 50 per cent self-sufficient in timber and may be a lot less than 50 per cent self-sufficient during the early part of the next century.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline his response to the report of the independent expert committee on the uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bogs; if he accepts the recommendations of the committee; if it is intended to implement the recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined my response to the committee's report in a press statement which I released on 10 January 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> Some of the recommendations contained in the report have a direct bearing on the operations of Bord na Móna.  I have not accepted the report's recommendation that the future uses of Bord na Móna cutaway bog should be subject to an independent planning process.  It is my belief and that of the Government that Bord na Móna should continue the development of the bogs they own on commercial criteria and that they should seek to dispose of cutaway in accordance with the company's financial interests and market requirements.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental principle set out in the report that the disposal and allocation of cutaway should be determined by market forces.  I am fully in agreement with this concept.  As proposed in the report.  I am making arrangements with Bord na Móna to ensure that a proportion of cutaway suitable for conversion to grassland will be disposed of in small lots to enable small full-time farmers, adjacent to the cutaway, to increase their holdings.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that the arrangement whereby cutaway identified as being suitable for conversion for afforestation is transferred to Coillte Teoranta should be discontinued.  I have accepted this recommendation and, in future, such lands will be placed for sale on the open market.  I would be satisfied that Coillte Teoranta will succeed in acquiring significant parts of such land for their purposes.</P>
    <P>The report makes a large number of recommendations in relation to the development of the amenity and environmental potential of the cutaway and to the establishment of &ldquo;farm villages&rdquo;. These are not areas in which I have any function, as Minister for Energy, but I would like to see the appropriate authorities and private interests collaborating to exploit the potential of the cutaway bogs for those purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate the total area of cutaway bog at present under the control of Bord na Mona?  Can he indicate also what area of cutaway bog which is outside the control <Col N="463" /> of Bord na Móna and whether there are any proposals for dealing with that area of cutaway bog not under their control? Additionally, can the Minister indicate how much of the small parcels of cutaway bog &mdash; to which he referred in his reply &mdash; as being suitable for conversion to grassland has been transferred to small farmers to date?  Furthermore, if the Minister does not accept that there should be a body established to plan the future of Bord na Móna cutaway bog can he indicate in what way the use of that land should be planned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not have the relevant information in regard to the total area of cutaway bog, I regret that, but I will get it and ask the Department of Energy to send it to the Deputy. The Deputy will be aware that cutaway bog in significant quantities began to become available only in quite recent years.  Up to fairly recently there were not significant amounts of it.  I note that, of the total boglands in the country, Bord na Móna only own 10 per cent.  Therefore the bulk of bogland, whether cutaway or still peat-bearing, would be in private ownership here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister clarify why he has rejected the recommendation of the review group to have a planning process put in place &mdash; which would involve many interests &mdash; in view of the substantial amounts of land involved and in view of the importance of their future to the economy of the regions and the many varied uses to which they could be put?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the planning of cutaway bog, or its use in the future, relates only to cutaway bog and not to bogs generally.  It is the view of the Government that Bord na Móna should continue to develop bogs where it is commercially viable but that they should dispose of cutaway bogs in the company's financial interests in response to market requirements which will allow them to do so most advantageously bearing in mind <Col N="464" /> that over the years they have built up an enormous accumulated deficit which is a big drag on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>First, can the Minister indicate whether Bord na Móna have undertaken any research in relation to the suitability of these lands for grassland production?  Second, since, as the Minister himself said, Bord na Móna have built up a huge deficit over the years, can they not be criticised for being absolutely neglectful of this land, some of which has been lying idle for over 30 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier in reply to Deputy De Rossa, significant quantities of cutaway bog have become available only in recent years.  That was not the case in earlier years.  There were patches here and there.  There may have been, say, 50 acres or 100 acres here or there, but there were not very large tracts which is likely to be the case in the future. As I understand it, Bord na Móna have undertaken quite an amount of research into its other uses, such as grassland.  Of course, another obvious use would be horticulture for which cutaway would be suitable; afforestation would be another suitable use.  As a result of the research they have undertaken in this respect, Bord na Móna are well aware of the potential of cutaway bog.  I feel sure they would make the results of that research available to interested parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of my earlier supplementary related to the amount of cutaway bog, if any, which had been transferred to date to small farmers who had sought to increase their holdings. Can the Minister indicate whether any such parcels of land have yet been transferred to such farmers?  Can he also indicate whether there has been any sale of cutaway bog by Bord na Móna, indeed, whether Coillte Teoranta have bought any and if he can indicate to what extent Bord na Móna have benefited financially from any such sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe Coillte Teoranta must have bought some of this land <Col N="465" /> in the past because the committee recommended that they should not be given an automatic right to it in the future. Therefore, I infer from that that they must have bought some in the past.  I am not aware that there have been sales to small farmers, as yet, which is what is recommended among other things in the report.  I presume the Minister has accepted that recommendation and that that will begin to happen henceforth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply touched on an issue which I would like him to clarify.  Have the Minister or the Government accepted the recommendation that Coillte Teoranta should no longer have first refusal on cutaway bog suitable for forestry, and will it now be available in open competition to private and public alike?  Have Bord an Móna been given the go ahead to proceed with the disposal of that land?  The report is relatively new, only slightly over a month old.  Have they actually been given the go ahead to dispose of land along the lines agreed by the Minister arising from the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told Deputy De Rossa in reply to the last supplementary that Coillte Teoranta did not have or will not have from now on, the automatic right of acquiring these lands for forestry.  They will have to bid against other interested parties.  That no doubt will result in their buying some of the land, but probably not all of it.</P>

      <Qid>10</Qid>
      <asker>Mrs. Barnes</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>the efforts he is making to ensure that there is a diversification of species in our forests.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my priorities as Minister for Energy is to encourage diversification of species in our forests, both in the sense of broad leaves versus conifers and of diversification within broad leaves and conifers.  Diversification is important from a number of view points, including the environment, plant health, import substitution, quality, yield and end use.</P>
      <P>A number of mechanisms are in place to encourage such diversification.  A higher grant rate is available for planting broad leaves as opposed to conifers, and the recently introduced planned recreational forestry scheme, which encourages the planting or upgrading of forests with public recreational facilities, specifically requires a minimum of 10 per cent broad leaf planting.</P>
      <P>Apart from these financial incentives, the rules of the forestry grant schemes allow my Department to set conditions for the establishment of plantations, which may include a requirement to plant specific species.  While economic considerations will often prompt the applicant to prefer sitka spruce, for example, my Department may require the planting of one or more other species for environmental reasons.  The new inspectors recently appointed to the Forestry Service have been asked to give particular attention to these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a target of 10 per cent for broad leaved species to be included in all plantations. Is that a requirement now in all new plantations, or is the Minister setting higher targets in order to achieve the additional diversification required having regard to the overwhelming plantation of conifers to date, before we became sufficiently conscious of the environmental and health factors that are causing concern at the moment?  Are we insisting <Col N="467" /> on 10 per cent on all new plantations and are we doing anything to plant beyond that amount in new plantations to make up for the bias in the wrong direction in earlier plantations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to qualify for grant assistance under the new scheme now in place, which is generous and which has got a good response, it would be necessary for applicants for grant aid to plant at least 10 per cent of the forest as broad leaf.  I hope that many applicants will choose to plant more than 10 per cent because there is a desire that we have more broad leaved trees due to the predominance of conifers here and their rather ugly appearance apart from any other difficulties to which they may give rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely what would govern the planting of broad leaved trees would be the type of land on which one would be planting them?  Surely the yield class would have to be reasonably high before we could compel people to plant broad leaved trees?  Grants could not be completely controlled by planting 10 per cent of broad leaved trees on unsuitable land. In regard to the species known as poplar, why are they not grant-aided? They are grant-aided in the North of Ireland and in England but not in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the land quality and type has a bearing on this. Obviously I am not an expert in the matter but I am not aware that there is land of forestry quality in this country that could not carry at least 10 per cent broad leaves.  The Deputy should bear in mind that almost all our indigenous trees are broad leaf or deciduous.  The sitka spruce and the type of trees that have become popular to plant in the 20th century in Ireland are not indigenous and are mainly Scandanivan, Canadian and Western and North American in origin. When one considers that a broad leaf species like oak covered most of Ireland centuries ago, broad leaves will grow in <Col N="468" /> most parts of Ireland.  I would encourage people to move in that direction in so far as they can.  Certainly the grant limits for broad leaf forests are very much more generous than those for mixed forests.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the relative impact on climate of, (a) operating a 470 MW gas powered generation station and (b) achieving a similar reduction in electricity demand through conservation measures; and whether this has any implication for national energy policy.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Gas use in electricity generation is the least polluting in the case of carbon dioxide emissions and, <Col N="469" /> furthermore, does not emit sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxide pollutants. Obviously, there will be less pollution if we avoid the need for new generating stations.  We must be realistic, however, and realise the importance of energy for economic growth, particularly in the context of our desire to match EC income levels at some time in the future.</P>
      <P>This Department's on-going energy conservation policy is to encourage the efficient use of all forms of energy, including electricity, in all sectors of the economy in order to have a secure mix of energy forces to conserve resources, to achieve financial savings and to protect the environment.  The ESB have adapted their marketing policy to employ a range of demand-side management strategies with the aim of improving end user efficiencies as a key objective.  The improved efficiency of energy utilisation will be a major component in stabilising CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>This programme has resulted in savings on some 53MW hours in 1991 and the ESB envisage that by the year 2000 the construction of 270MW of additional new plant will have been avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Ireland is recognised as being the least energy efficient nation in the EC and that it is variously estimated that we are burning between £450 million and £600 million annually in wasted energy? Could the Minister outline if the Minister has yet set any conservation targets or are we simply making <i>ad hoc</i> decisions in relation to new plants without any overall analysis of what we could save, where we could save it and programmes to achieve those savings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it is a fact of life that we are not among the more energy efficient nations.  The Minister for Energy has made quite some efforts to introduce the concept of conservation into this country.  It is not a very easy concept to introduce.  However, he is availing of every opportunity to do so and encouraging major energy distributors such as the ESB, for example, <Col N="470" /> to strive in that direction.  I hope he will have greater success in his time in that regard than I had in my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that it would be a great deal easier to achieve serious conservation if the tiny budget for conservation measures was not halved in the last Estimates and that serious objectives were set by the Department there might be some chance of people aspiring to conservation?  There is no public programme of information or encouragement in one of the most seriously under-efficient areas of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say there is no programme, but obviously the programme would be better if there was more money to spend on it.  The Deputy will be aware of the considerable pressures on public financial resources.  I hope that more can be done in this area but it can be done not just by the expenditure of public moneys but by people adopting a more conservationist attitude towards the use of energy, frequently in their own interst.  I am glad to be able to say that in important sectors of industry there has been a tremendous improvement in recent years in the conservation of energy and I would like to see that in the domestic and commercial spheres as well.</P>

However, it is my policy that all forestry development shall contribute to the improvement of the environment, including the protection and encouragement of <Col N="471" /> wildlife, both flora and fauna, and specific measures, have been introduced in this regard.

      <P>I am, of course, aware of the incident referred to by the Deputy which was widely reported by the press both here and in the United Kingdom last September.  The UK's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provided full details of the matter in their quarterly statement of nuclear incidents.</P>
      <P>This particular incident took place on 15 September 1991 following maintenance work on a monitoring cell at British Nuclear Fuel's (BNFL) Sellafield Waste Vitrification Plant.  In order to facilitate this work two shield doors, normally closed during such operations, were opened to allow access.  When operations were restarted, a container of vitrified waste was raised into the cell and it was then observed that the shield doors had remained open.  Action was then taken to close them, thereby reinstating the shielding.  No workers were in the area at the time, no-one was exposed to radiation and the incident was of no radiological significance for Ireland. Accordingly, I have not raised the matter with the UK authorities.  The vitrification plant was shut down following this incident. The HSE's nuclear installations inspectorate granted BNFL permission to resume limited operations in the plant in January 1992.</P>

Is he aware that the problem arose from a fault in the computer safety system in the new section of the Sellafield plant and that there is considerable concern in the United Kingdom about the fact that the safety control system at Sellafield is now virtually indistinguishable from the normal running systems of the plant which are also computerised &mdash; and I believe this is contrary to British regulations in any event?  Is the Minister also aware that the Sizewell B plant which is under construction in Suffolk is being computerised to a degree greater than any other plant ever in the United Kingdom and that the HSE nuclear installations inspectorate have stated that it is impossible to check what way the computerised system will react if the reactor acts in a dangerous way?  There are major safety gaps in the way we can expect these computer systems to operate in a dangerous situation.</P>

      <P>The incident was not reported to the Department of Energy <i>via</i> agreed informal procedures because it was not of radiological significance. It did not involve human exposure to radiation nor did it involve a radioactive discharge.  The computer-controlled steel and lead doors of a cell remained open for a short time &mdash; I do not know exactly how long, it may have been a matter of seconds &mdash; when the doors should have been closed.  The incident occurred when a container of treated nuclear waste was put into a cell for a quality control check. No person was exposed to radiation.</P>

      <P>My understanding <Col N="474" /> of the incident &mdash; obviously the Minister would have an official report on the matter &mdash; is that the doors opened prematurely.  It was not that they did not close following some operation but that they opened prematurely, and that in one of the chambers where these safety doors opened, there was a highly radioactive material.  The Minister stated in his reply that that was in vitrified glass, which I am sure is correct, but surely, his Department should require that any incident, whether it results in a human being being exposed to radioactivity or not, should be reported to him, given that it is not a question of human error but an error in the computerised safety system.  The concern must be whether the system which continues to operate in this plant, which was opened only in February last year, is still likely to be risky and whether a similar type of computerised system will be incorporated in the Sizewell B plant in Suffolk.  Anything going wrong there would clearly have repercussions on this island.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I am not familiar with these matters since I do not deal with them on a day-to-day basis. I am not quite clear whether the doors opened slightly prematurely or were closed slightly too late.  There was a short period during which a piece of vitrified waste in a cell was not fully shielded by the double doors of lead and another substance.  It was not reported because it was regarded as not being of radiological significance.  That is probably true.  It was of course of some considerable significance in terms of safety.  There was not a specifically radiological incident and there was no contamination.  Since this system began in January 1987 there have been 93 notifications.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply raises significant issues.  Does the Minister not think that an incident which led to the closure of the plant from September to January is of very great significance? It clearly warranted concern within the industry.  Does he know whether this matter was reported to the <Col N="475" /> EC and examined at that level?  It raises again the absolute urgency of some form of independent EC inspectorate in respect of nuclear installations to ensure that we are adequately safeguarded. Should we seek reporting not just of incidents of radiological significance but of substantial operational significance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the slow closing of doors rather than the premature opening which caused the difficulty.  While the incident was not of radiological importance in the sense that no person or property was contaminated, it was obviously a serious matter in that there was apparently a malfunction in the computer system.  If the door closing mechanism could malfunction, however slightly, one's great fear would be that there might be a malfunction in some more basic part of the whole operation. That is why the British safety authorities closed this part of the plant for four months until they were satisfied in that regard.  I have no information on the design of Sizewell B and I could not comment on the relative merits or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is standing in for the Minister for Energy on this matter and could not be expected to have the same detailed understanding of the issues concerned. My point is not as to whether the Minister is aware of the adequacy of design of Sizewell B but whether he is satisfied that his Department have sufficient information and sufficient ability to monitor what is going on in the UK with regard to nuclear installations, in order to protect citizens of this State.  National boundaries or seas do not protect us from an emission from Sizewell B or from Sellafield.  It is absolutely important that we have some input into what is being planned and designed in the UK.  Will the Minister undertake to request that all incidents at Sellafield or Sizewell B, whether they have radiological significance or not and whether human beings are affected or not, will be reported to the informal monitoring committee that operates in <Col N="476" /> his Department?  Will he also undertake to contact British Nuclear Fuels Limited regarding the computer design of the Sizewell B plant?  It will be computerised to a far greater degree than any other nuclear plant in the UK.  It is a totally new plant and no one knows how it will operate.</P>

      <P>I understand that my colleague loses no opportunity to urge that on them.  From our point of view it would be much more satisfactory because we are not in a position to provide the same type of monitoring service and safety arrangements as other countries which have major nuclear installations. We are somewhat in their hands as to what they report.  If they fail to report something we may not know about it.  We would prefer independent monitoring and inspection.  I hope the Community, which has seen fit to involve itself in a great many activities which have no real Community dimension or great Community importance, will involve itself in this matter, which of its very nature is a Community-wide problem.  We would <Col N="477" /> very much like to see that and I hope it comes about.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that we should have the best possible monitoring system so that other member states, including Ireland, would be alerted at the earliest possible moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had got to the end of what I wanted to say.  I did refer to research institutes being involved in projects which sought to attain clean production techniques because, as I said, prevention is better than cure.</P>
      <P>On a parochial level I would like to mention that the Cork Regional Technical College set up a scheme in conjunction with some of the industries in the Cork Harbour area recently to devise systems and projects whereby clean production techniques would be developed. We should develop those procedures rather than try to eliminate pollution when it has arisen and has damaged part of our environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputies desire to try to achieve clean production.  His amendments are idealistic in their <Col N="559" /> aims but I am afraid they are impracttical both in their wording and effect. No modern society has yet managed to develop technologies which totally eliminate the production of waste.  This may be possible in the future but it would be unrealistic to think that Ireland could develop such technology at this stage or base the future development of the country wholly on a system that avoids or eliminates hazardous waste and hazardous products.  It must be remembered that we are largely importers of technology and thus largely dependent on technical developments in more highly industrialised countries.  We must certainly aim to encourage clean production. My amendment to section 5 seeks to make clear that the prevention and elimination of pollution is the desirable option.  Where this is not possible we must ensure that waste, and particularly hazardous waste, will be safely disposed of.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I referred to the waste Bill which we are working on in my Department. The whole emphasis in that Bill, so far as it is possible, will be on elimination, prevention and minimisation.  That is the way in which we have to proceed for the future.  I am also making provision for a system on the lines of the toxics release inventory in the United States through my amendment No. 239.  This should stimulate industry to reduce levels of toxic emissions including waste and will also keep the public informed of what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to recognise the great efforts being made by the Regional College Cork, University College Cork, local industry and other environmental groups to establish in Cork a centre for clean production.  I was pleased to be in a position to assist that project and to be able to give it some financial assistance.  In this country, as elsewhere, we need to put greater emphasis on clean production. Unfortunately, though the aim is to have production which is based on clean technology and that does not produce hazardous waste we are a long way from achieving that.  Until such time as we can <Col N="560" /> it would be totally unrealistic to put an amendment of this kind into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should point out to the Minister of State that the precautionary principle was espoused by the Government in their own 1990 environment action programme which states &ldquo;the principle of precautionary action, even where there is no definitive scientific evidence to link emissions or discharges with detrimental environmental effects...&rdquo; I would also remind the Minister of State that this and other essential provisions were included in Deputy Shatter's ill-fated Environmental Protection Agency Bill which, if the Government had had the good sense to adopt, this Environmental Protection Agency would now be operational with these essential provisions already included.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's amendment seeks to incorporate the precautionary principle into the operation of the agency and I have no problem with his objective.  However, I have already <Col N="561" /> made an amendment to the Bill in the Seanad, to section 52 (2) (c), which in effect incorporates the precautionary principle into the Bill and requires the agency in carrying out their functions to have regard to this principle.  This amendment is therefore unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the inclusion of this principle in the Bill.  I have read the Seanad debate on the amendment which was accepted, and I welcome it.  This principle, whereby measures are taken to protect the environment where there is a significant probability of environmental damage, is a very important one.  Given that we are setting out in this section to define &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; it is appropriate to include this principle at this stage.  Since it has been accepted by the Government I am at a loss to understand the reason the definition is not acceptable also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. I do not think the Minister should have any objection to including it at this stage.

      <P>If Deputies read the Seanad debate they will note some of the arguments that I used in making what I consider to be a very reasonable amendment to section 52 (2) (c).  We should be quite frank in regard to this precautionary principle.  Deputy Garland quoted from the environment action programme but if we were to implement the precautionary principle we probably would stop many things from happening because once we give our approval there is always a chance that something might go wrong.  There is virtually no activity that I am aware of which does not have the potential to cause some damage or harm.  Therefore we sometimes use the principle too loosely when all we want to do is to ensure that the agency in carrying out their duties, their licensing functions in particular, seek to ensure where there <Col N="562" /> is a significant possibility of damage being caused to the environment, that they take the precautionary approach.  We have given them this power in section 52 (2) (c).  If we were to insert the amendments suggested by Deputy Garland and the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore it would not work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to broaden the scope of the section.  As we commented earlier this morning, the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; seems to be too negative in that it refers to prevention, limitation, elimination and abatement while only a bland statement is made to the positive side, the preservation of the quality of the environment. Therefore what the amendment seeks to do is to broaden the positive side of the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; to include the protection and enhancement of all aspects of the environment, including fauna, flora, soil, <Col N="563" /> water, air, climate, landscape, the built environment and cultural heritage.  You will be glad to hear, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I will not refer to each of those aspects of detail because their importance to the environment is clear to everyone here.  I hope, however, that the positive side of the definition of &ldquo;environment protection&rdquo; will be spelled out in the way I describe, otherwise we will get trapped in the old mode of punishing those who pollute rather than promoting the enhancement and protection of the environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 contains definitions for a number of environment related terms used throughout the Bill which when viewed together cater adequately for the functions proposed for the agency.  The definitions have been framed to ensure the agency will have a broad remit as far as the environment is concerned in relation, for example, to their advisory functions, while also ensuring that they are not being required to take on environmental functions that are already the responsibility of other bodies.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) defines &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; to include the prevention, limitation, abatement or reduction of environmental pollution and the preservation of the quality of the environment.  &ldquo;Pollution&rdquo; is defined in subsection (2) by reference to definitions in air and water legislation and by reference to waste and noise requirements as defined at subsections 2 (c) and 2 (d). It includes emissions or discharges that could damage or create a risk to public health, air, water, atmosphere, soil, plants, animals, the countryside amenities and places of special interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the definition in section 4 is perfectly adequate to enable the agency to carry out the extensive functions provided for in this Bill including integrated pollution control, and their general supervisory role and advisory functions. There is also an implicit recognition that there are other bodies with defined responsibilities for environmental issues. There is no proposal to transfer these <Col N="564" /> responsibilities to the agency although there is provision for the transfer of existing or additional functions to the agency under sections 53 and 54 if such is decided in the future.  For example, the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works are responsible for fauna and flora matters, planning authorities are primarily responsible for the built environment, and the Heritage Council are responsible for cultural heritage affairs.  This does not mean that the agency would have no function whatsoever in relation to such matters.  On the contrary they can have a considerable impact, for example, in relation to their advisory functions under section 55, functions in relation to environmental research, monitoring, the preparation of codes of practice, and the consultation provisions in sections 78 and 79.  In being reluctant to take on board any amendments to this section I am mindful of the primary reason for establishing the agency, i.e. the control of pollution from those activities with the greatest potential for pollution in the context of the effects of pollution on the environment.  The definitions in section 4 are in keeping with this primary objective and I am fearful that adoption of the amendments proposed would dilute the agency's resolve to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>Inherent in the amendments proposed is a broadening of the functions envisaged for the agency to include other aspects of the environment which are being dealt with adequately by other bodies such as the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works &mdash; the protection of national monuments or the provision of public amenities such as picnic sites and soon.  It is important that there should be no confusion as to the responsibilities in environmental matters and I have already indicated that the definition in the Bill provides adequately for the agency's functions.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the agency should be directly promoting or funding environmental improvement although they can do so indirectly in giving advice to Ministers or others and issuing recommendations under sections 55 and 56.  It could not be accepted therefore that the <Col N="565" /> agency would have a role in enhancing all aspects of the environment as proposed - the agency would not have the funds for carrying out such a function.</P>

      <P>My amendment, No. 19 which is being taken with amendment No. 16, proposes that the words &ldquo;including wildlife&rdquo; should be included after the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo;. No definition of the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is contained in the Bill.  The Bill should contain such a definition which would include eco-systems, which means any system of terrestrial or aquatic organisms within their physical environment; all natural and physical resources; the social, economic, aesthetic and cultural values of the environment. It is particularly important that wildlife be included in this section since noise pollution often poses a serious threat to endangered and indeed all species of animals and birds and they must be protected.  I support the broad thrust of amendment No. 16.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am again disappointed at the attitude of the Minister in speaking in Civil Service terms.  It is important to broaden the scope of this section as we are talking about a definition for &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo;.  I sought to broaden that from the old focus of inhibitions because the attitude to environmental protection over the last ten years has been to put up barriers and laws in relation to people despoiling the countryside. Obviously that was very important and worthwhile but the next phase of European thinking at least &mdash; I know it is an integral part of the Fifth Programme on Environmental Policy which is being prepared &mdash; is to get away from the sanctions mentality and into the positive enhancement view where people have a role in enhancing and developing the environment in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I seek to broaden the terms of the definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; and to give scope to the new agency.  I do not accept what the Minister said, that it would dilute the agency; giving them broad scope does not mean that they have to respond to every call <Col N="566" /> made on them but they should be capable of doing so if they felt it would suit the circumstances to assist in enhancement of the environment in any of the areas I have outlined.  The Minister indicated that the main focus of the Bill is the control of pollution.  That is a very narrow focus and I had hoped the Bill would have had a greater impact than simply the control of pollution, that it would have a positive role to play in the enhancement of the environment in all its aspects, including the built environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there are agencies already charged with a statutory duty in relation to the enhancement of the environment and she referred to the planning authorities regarding the built environment. I am a member of two local authorities and I do not believe that they necessarily have the wherewithal, resources or the legal framework to enhance the environment in the way we would like.  They can certainly make an impact on it to some degree and there have been some marvellous urban renewal schemes.  However, we need an agency charged with overall responsibility for the development, enhancement and protection of the environment, not only in controlling the polluter but in positively selling the notion of an improved environment.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to reconsider her view on this amendment.</P>

When we brought up the question of nuclear waste we were told that the Radiological Protection Institute are responsible in this area.  The Minister gave her explanation and we did not press the point too hard.  However, when I brought up the question of the control of pesticides and the dangers posed by them I was told it was a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food which also control horticulture.  The Minister said she did not want the Environmental Protection Agency to have in their brief the whole question of conservation of the countryside.  The issue of environmental protection is as basic as any other issue; <Col N="567" /> there is a threat to the Burren.  County Clare, at present which shouod be a prime concern of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The trouble is that. at the last count, there were 14 agencies responsible for environmental protection. The local authorities do their own thing.  Today the Minister for Energy answered questions regarding certain aspects of environmental protection; the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Transport, in some instances, are also responsible for environmental protection. The same applies to the health boards, everybody has some responsibility but nobody has overall responsibility for co-ordination and organisation. There is a totally disjointed effort in relation to reaching a situation where we have a comprehensive environmental protection policy.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that already there are lines of demarcation between the RPI and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I ask the Minister once and for all to grasp the central issue that it is not just a question of protection or undoing damage, it is a question of preserving something before it is damaged.  The amendment put forward the philosophy that we should preserve what we have instead of trying to undo damage when it occurs.  I ask the Minister to be flexible and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Deputies are serious in assuming that this agency will be the panacea for all our ills and will deal with every aspect of the environment.  That was never envisaged by me, nor was it ever suggested to me by any outside body.  Deputy Howlin's suggestion would mean dismantling the present planning system because he believes the agency should have ultimate responsibility for the built environment. I do not accept that that is necessary; perhaps if we were now establishing this State we might organise things differently, but we have in place in the main a very satisfactory planning system which is decided at local level by elected representatives <Col N="568" /> in the first instance through development plans and thereafter the executive decisions are made by officials. There is an appeals system to An Bord Pleanala which works fairly well although we do not necessarily always agree with all their decisions.  Generally speaking, however, the system is fair, transparent and acceptable and I do not believe it is necessary or desirable to set up one national body with total responsibility for every matter relating to the environment.  If this was to be the remit of this agency they would never get off the ground, their role would be so diffuse they could not possibly do their task.</P>
      <P>In relation to developments in Europe and the Fifth Programme, it is true that developments now in terms of the environment are in relation to the whole concept of sustainable development.  It is now recognised that we cannot go on living the way we have over the last 20 or 30 years.  While integration was the &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; word of the Fourth Action Programme for the Environment, &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; will certainly be the basis of environmental debate in the future.  That means we must examine in this society the impact of sustainable development, what it means in the first instance and what it means for agriculture, industry and energy and transport policies.  I look forward to the day when the environment will be uppermost in the decision making process in all these areas of Government.  I also look forward to the day when the whole environmental impact assessment procedure will be applied to the policies and programmes right across Government policy making because the environment must be a prime consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the Environmental Protection Agency should have this broad remit because it is neither necessary nor desirable.  They would be snowed under with complaints because the built environment is certainly a cause on occasions for an enormous amount of complaints.  We have a Heritage Council and an Office of Public Works, whether we should have these bodies is a different issue, but they have a very distinct and <Col N="569" /> specific role in relation to these matters. When these bodies can carry out a specific role it is not intended to take it from them and to give it to the agency.</P>
    <P>The agency have a wide range of functions, they have proactive powers, they can hold inquiries, draw up reports, give advice, issue codes of practice and so on. The definition of &ldquo;environmental protection&rdquo; is contained in section 4 (1).  It includes (a) the prevention, limitation, elimination, abatement or reduction of environmental pollution, and (b) the preservation of the quality of the environment. That is a broad definition.  To go into specifics in this respect would be both unnecessary and undesirable.  Reference was made this morning to the United Kingdom Environmental Protection Act and great play was made about aspects of it.</P>

      <P>I love the way Deputies pick and choose.  In that Act the environment is defined as consisting of all or any of the following media: the air, water and land.  That is exactly the approach we have taken in our definition of environmental medium in section 4 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be much merit in what the Deputies are saying if we did not have other bodies, did not organise things in a different way and were starting from scratch to set up a new planning system, devising a system of Government or dividing and allocating responsibilities. However, we are not doing this.  The <i>raison d'etre</i> for the establishment of this agency was to put in place a supervisory body who would ensure that the appropriate monitoring was carried out and that the laws and regulations we make in this House were fully implemented right across the country in a consistent and uniform way.  This does not happen at present because it is not possible for 33 local authorities to have the resources and expertise needed to do this.  Earlier Deputy Allen made this point very forcibly in relation to a number of other issues.  The way we organise environmental protection matters at present is <Col N="570" /> unsatisfactory and this agency are being established to change that.</P>
    <P>It was said that it seems the agency will be a pollution control agency.  They will not be a pollution control agency.  What causes pollution? Pollution is caused when certain substances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;are either released into the atmosphere, water or soil.  It is the disposal of certain wastes in that way which causes pollution.  We need a body who will be able to set high standards, ensure they are enforced and who have the expertise to understand the complexities of many of these processes. Developments in technology and industry are so rapid now that it is extremely difficult, even for many experts, to keep pace with them.  In a country like ours, we need an agency who are nationally based and regionally and locally organised to do this task.  I never envisaged &mdash; I do not believe anyone really envisaged this &mdash; that this agency would deal with the built environment.  I do not believe it is possible to have an agency with that kind of responsibility nationally organised. Our present system works reasonably well.  It does not mean we necessarily agree with every decision made and we may not agree with every decision made by this agency either.  The day we all agree with decisions made by a particular body will probably be the day the body are becoming toothless or ineffective.  It is not always possible for people to make decisions with which we are all able to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to developments in the Burren.  It is interesting to note that his colleagues from County Clare seem to support this development. There is a different view about this issue also and people approach it from a different perspective.  Obviously, there will have to be a local input into much of the decision-making but at the end of the day the national body responsible, the Office of Public Works, have to make decisions of this kind.  I do not believe this would <Col N="571" /> be an appropriate function for the Environmental Protection Agency.  It would be lovely if every controversy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great care to the Minister and I take on board some of the points she made.  However, she has deliberately misconstrued the intention of my amendment.</P>
      <P>We are proposing to establish an environmental protection agency.  We are dealing now with the definition of environmental protection.  The point I am making is that the definition is too narrow.  The Minister cannot argue both ways at once.  In her initial contribution she said that the main focus of the Bill was the control of pollution and if that is the case it should be called the Control of Pollution Bill but that would not enhance or protect the environment.  This is not the way Europe, in particular, is thinking in relation to the enhancement and protection of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to broaden the very narrow scope of a short sentence in the Bill.  Section 4 (1) (a) is all in the negative &mdash; prevention, limitation, elimination, abatement or reduction. This is all on the sanction side.  The positive side is limited to a few words &mdash; the preservation of the quality of the environment.  One could say that that encompasses all I want to encompass in my amendment.  I am sure the Minister has no difficulty with that.  It could be interpreted that the preservation of the quality of the environment includes flora, fauna, soil, water and so on.  For the Minister to say they are all the specific responsibility of other agencies is disingenuous. Other agencies and bodies have been established by statute and they will carry out the statutory functions assigned to them by the Oireachtas.  We are proposing to establish one body who will have overall responsibility for the protection of the environment.  It is right that the Environmental Protection Agency should have a say in the building of an interpretative centre and should not be precluded from having an opinion on it.  That would be a normal and reasonable thing for an Environmental Protection <Col N="573" /> Agency to do.  We are not asking the agency to take over the planting functions. Nobody suggested that, and it is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to set down broad and clear definitions in the Bill.  The Minister said it was important there should be no confusion as all the agencies were doing such a marvellous job that giving an overview to any agency might sow the seeds of confusion.  I am not content with the work of some agencies charged with this function.  A very strong case could be made for giving some agency an overview, even if it is only to issue a report and say that the agency are not acting properly or the environment would be better served by certain action.  All those strands should be pulled together so that this agency can have a broad ambit.  I agree we cannot have everything in the one agency or in the one Bill.  However, we should not reduce the Environmental Protection Agency to the control of pollution, which is what seems to be emerging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We discovered this morning that the agency will be under-resourced. We are now finding that the terms of reference of the agency will be too restrictive. As Deputy Howlin said, if the agency are confined to the control of pollution this will be totally out of line with present European thinking.  I listened to the Minister misrepresenting what we were saying.  I gave no opinion one way or the other on the development in the Burren.  All I was saying is that an agency other than the Office of Public Works should have an opinion on the future of the Burren.  Surely the Environmental Protection Agency should have a say and an input into what happens to our countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what objection the Minister could have to extending the terms of reference of the agency and accepting the amendment.  I would merely clarify the definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and extend the terms of reference of the agency, and I cannot understand the objection to that. In the interests of giving more teeth to <Col N="574" /> the Environmental Protection Agency I would ask the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If I misunderstood Deputy Allen I apologise.  Of course the agency can give their opinion under the existing Bill but I understood Deputy Allen to imply that the agency should be the decision-making body in relation to those matters.  What we are doing here is defining environmental protection. Throughout the Bill functions are assigned to the agency in relation to environmental protection.  If we were to accept, for example, Deputy Howlin's amendment which deals with the cultural heritage and the built environment, the agency would have a direct role in this regard.  Section 61 gives the agency a supervisory role in relation to environmental protection, as defined in the Bill over local authorities.  If environmental protection is to be defined to include the built environment and our cultural heritage the agency would have a direct supervisory responsibility in relation to planning matters and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see the point in putting in a definition of the environment if it is to have no meaningful effect thereafter.  I believe we are trying to dance on the head of a pin.  We have defined environmental protection widely enough to include the prevention, elimination and control of pollution and also the preservation of the quality of the environment, and I believe that definition is broad enough.  It is not desirable to provide that the agency's role be so widespread as to involve planning, the built environment, our cultural heritage or even the social environment.  The definition would be almost limitless.  We want to keep the role of the agency as clear and as focused as possible.  Bodies that do not have a clear focus tend to be very much advisory, drawing up reports and so on.  If there was a fault with An Foras Forbartha, a body that did outstanding work, it was that they did not have the kind of teeth that this agency will have.  They could make no decisions and were operationally under the direction <Col N="575" /> of the Minister for the Environment of the day.</P>
    <P>We are setting up a body who will be operationally independent and who will have very specific powers in relation to environmental protection.  We are defining, for the purpose of those powers, environmental protection, which means powers and control over substances emitted into the atmosphere, water, soil, land, or whatever.  That is what the focus of the agency should be.  They will have a broader role in relation to advice, codes of practice, eco-labelling and other matters. They may hold an inquiry, publish reports or advise the Minister.  They may deal as they see fit, in the interests of the quality of the environment, with matters such as the Burren and they may produce reports and make known their views if they so desire.</P>
    <P>There is a view in some quarters that when this agency are set up there will be no more environmental problems and no more controversy, or if controversies arise the agency will deal with them and we will all be satisfied with the outcome. That is not the kind of body we are establishing. Controversies and difficulties will still arise and decisions will always have to be made with which many people might not agree, but what we are trying to do here is to set up, in relation to the natural environment, a body who are independent, transparent and properly resourced, a body who will be seen to be competent and who will make decisions on the basis of competence and fairness. That is what is lacking at present.  This body, when set up, will have credibility and public support and, through their licensing role and, in some instances, their advisory role and other functions in relation to landfill sites, drinking water, sewage treatment plants and so on, will be able to ensure that environmental rules, regulations and laws are implemented as fully and as consistently as possible throughout the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (c), line 32, to delete &ldquo;would&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;could&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment which proposes to delete the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;could&rdquo;.  It is an amendment to subsection (2) (c) which reads: &ldquo;the disposal of waste in a manner which would endanger human health&rdquo;.  There is a problem with the word &ldquo;would&rdquo; in that it is typical of the approach taken by industry and all those who promote dangerous technology, such as incineration. A very recent example is the case of the Dupont incinerator in Derry where the promoters demanded that people prove that this technology would be a danger to their health.  It is not up to the people to prove that technology is unsafe but rather it is up to those promoting it to prove that it is, beyond any reasonable doubt, safe, and it is clear in the Du Pont case that they are unable to do so.  Even the best researchers in America are unable to state categorically that incineration is safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislators of this country were elected by the people to govern for the people and to protect the people rather than to legislate for industry which could endanger the health of those they are paid to protect.  If there is any doubt whatsoever about the safety of a process, every precaution must be taken to prove its safety before it is permitted to start or, indeed, to continue operation if it has already started.  It is totally unacceptable that ordinary people do not have available to them the expertise, technology and money necessary to prove that their health and wellbeing is endangered by such industry should have to do so. Therefore I contend that to insert the <Col N="577" /> word &ldquo;could&rdquo; would greatly strengthen this clause.  The word &ldquo;would&rdquo; is very weak and clearly puts the onus of proof on those people objecting to an industry. By inserting the word &ldquo;could&rdquo; the ball would be back in the court of industry, which is what should be done.  I commend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would introduce an element of vagueness and uncertainty into the definition of pollution in respect of waste.  Were the amendment to be adopted the definition of pollution would extend to almost every case where waste is disposed of, as even the most well-managed and carefully operated disposal operations may contain some element of risk.  This could put at risk the operation of waste facilities, which will continue to be an essential requirement in ensuring proper and safe disposal of waste.</P>
      <P>Section 52 (2) (c) requires the agency to have due regard to the principle of precaution when carrying out their functions. It is clear, therefore, that activities which pose a real risk to the environment would be controlled in a preventive manner by the agency.</P>
      <P>Section 81 (3) (e) prevents the agency granting a licence unless they are satisfied that an activity will not cause significant pollution.  Were the Deputy's amendment adopted this could lead to the agency's ability to licence activities being dramatically restricted.  It could be argued, for instance, that since practically all waste disposal was pollution, all large scale waste disposal was significant pollution.  I am sure that this is not what the Deputy intends and I would ask him to withdraw his amendment.</P>
      <P>Without being flippant about the matter, virtually every activity has a potential to cause serious environmental pollution.  I accept that the Deputy is trying to adopt a preventive approach, which is already adopted in section 52 (2) (c), but to delete &ldquo;would&rdquo; in favour of &ldquo;could&rdquo; would make the clause so vague and so uncertain that I do not think it would work.</P>

      <P>I understand the anxieties of Deputy Garland and I also recognise the point being made by the Minister, but in the absence of any national management waste plan at the moment the Minister should not be talking about vagueness; at present we do not have an idea of what we are about in relation to waste.  We have been through this matter already this morning and I do not want to hold up the proceedings.  Because we are in ignorance at the moment, much waste is being dumped in drains, ditches, fields and rivers.  It is unsatisfactory for the Minister to criticise an amendment because of its vagueness.  We are living in ignorance because of the absence of a waste management plan.  I recognise inherent dangers in the Minister's acceptance of the amendment in that every project could be brought into question, but the Minister must realise that until there is a plan in place there will be vagueness and ignorance.</P>

      <P>If we have learnt any lesson from the past couple of weeks it would be that a minefield is created when laws are enacted which contain vague and <Col N="579" /> uncertain phrases such as &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; and &ldquo;as reasonably can be expected&rdquo;.  I know what Deputy Garland is trying to achieve but I believe it is covered by the Bill.  As I said, anything could potentially cause damage if something went wrong.  At even the best operated disposal site an accident could cause damage.  We are not trying to cover that eventuality but to deal with the situation where the potential for damage is certain rather than possible.  As I understand it, we are not trying to deal with possibilities and vagueness but with certainties.</P>
      <P>The phraseology in the Bill which deals with the disposal of waste in a manner which would endanger human health or harm the environment, covers even a risk to waters, the atmosphere, land, soil, plants or animals; or a nuisance caused by noise or odours; or an adverse effect on the countryside or places of special interest.  Quite honestly, I consider that wording to be very comprehensive and clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that at all.  The Minister also keeps saying that the Bill, if it is passed, will not solve all our problems.  Of course I accept that totally.  There are risks with everything and with the best will in the world, and even if every amendment we supported were incorporated in the Bill, there would still be potential problems.  If the agency had an annual budget of £500 million and thousands of employees there would still be mistakes made, there would still be pollution and there would still be problems.  This is not a perfect world and I am sure we will realise that. Nevertheless, I do consider that unless we aim very high we will finish up with a very poor environment.  We have to raise our sights as high as is feasible.  Of course <Col N="580" /> we will not realise our target.  Perhaps if we raise it to 95 per cent of what is possible we will achieve 80 per cent.  If we were to aim for an achievement of 50 per cent we would probably reach 30 per cent.  That is the difference between my philosophical approach and that of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be considered anti-industry or anti-job, because the Green Party are neither one nor the other.  I realise that we cannot be over-fundamentalist in our approach and that there has to be compromise.  There has to be industry and there has to be jobs. We are all here to try to find a balance in this regard but I do not consider that that approach is being reciprocated on the other side of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (2) (d), line 42, after &ldquo;environment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including cases where extension/ addition to runways results in increased noise levels in the environs of the airports&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make provision in the Bill for control and safeguards in relation to emissions from aircraft.  The Bill clearly states that the legislation will not apply to noise caused by aircraft.  Aircraft noise is a major issue in my constituency and the <Col N="581" /> fact that it is not referred to in the Bill is scandalous.  The omission is a deliberate act by the Department to ignore a major issue that has been left aside for years.  I accept the role of civil aviation in this country and throughout the world and I also acknowledge the huge contribution it has made to industry, particularly in my constituency where, at Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus have created thousands of jobs.  However, there are knock-on effects from such development and the huge increase in the use of civil aviation.  Those effects impact on my constituents and on other constituents throughout the country.  There is no legal recourse for people who feel that they are affected by developments that have taken place.  In a piecemeal effort to deal with the problem of noise pollution the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications passed the ball back to Aer Rianta.  This problem is recognised throughout Europe.  The EC has issued directives on the limitation of noise emissions from subsonic jet aeroplanes, the most recent being 4 December, 1989.  Yet when people make a legitimate case to any Government Department inevitably they are told that that Department have no responsibility.  Since the provisions of this Bill deal with the environment generally I contend they should take that problem on board and devise mechanisms to deal with it properly, giving people affected by noise pollution some recourse particularly in the case of extensions of airports.  The agency should be directed by the Department to devise the necessary legislative provisions in this area.  Since noise pollution will affect hundreds of people and their families, residing in such areas for generations, surely it is not asking too much that the Government should devise specific mechanisms providing them with some legislative recourse, compensation or, at the very minimum, some insulation in their dwellings not at present available.  Perhaps the proposed agency might consult Eolas, examine the noise contours, examine what is required in other parts of Europe and the level of insulation required.  We must remember that we are talking about <Col N="582" /> a Bill whose provisions are intended to protect our environment when it is of enormous importance that we put people first and devote our attentions to them. One does not have to contend that the choice is between the creation of jobs in developments at airports and the continuance of such noise pollution.  A proper balance can be struck, which is what we are endeavouring to achieve in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I contend my amendment would deal adequately with that problem, giving some credence to our concern for and support of people living within the vicinity of airports.  I hope the Minister will see the justification of my case and will accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support Deputy Ryan's amendment.  A very serious problem we have not addressed is that of noise pollution, particularly in places like Dublin Airport and its environs, although this would be a problem experienced by residents in housing located near all airports.  The same problem will affect people living within, say, 50 yards of a proposed motorway.  Here I would have to say that the attitude of the Department of the Environment to giving reasonable grants for double glazing in houses located near an airport or say, the Southern Cross motorway, is very niggardly and most unsatisfactory.  I do not know whether any Member lives within 50 yards of a motorway.  Anybody finding themselves in such circumstances would be better off having their house demolished, to be included within the parameters of such a motorway, and be rehoused elsewhere.  At present such people are being totally neglected.  The proposed Environmental Protection Agency should be in a position to help such people subjected to excessive noise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seek to bring the control of noise resulting from runway extensions within the ambit of the Bill.  However, they seek to do so in two different ways.  While I appreciate the Deputy's concern on this matter I have problems in accepting what is proposed <Col N="583" /> for reasons I will outline.  I must also draw attention to the improved noise provisions that have been included in Part VI of the Bill and which are relevant to this problem.  For example section 104 makes provision for the regulation of noise which could apply to noise from aircraft in specified circumstances. Section 105 enables the local authority or the agency in relation to a licensable activity to take action to prevent or limit noise by serving a notice on the person in charge of the activity concerned. Therefore, the provisions for noise control, are substantially enhanced by this Bill.  However, I do not wish to give the impression that all aircraft noise will be ended by the operation of these new provisions. There are international controls in this matter which I will come to later.</P>
      <P>To return to the amendments proposed, the first amendment seeks to include increased noise levels as a result of the extension of runways in the definition of environmental pollution contained in section 4.  This definition is included primarily for the purposes of the integrated pollution control licensing system contained in Part IV of the Bill. Airfields are not licensable activities for the purposes of the Bill.  Therefore, the adoption of this amendment would be inappropriate in purely drafting terms.  It would also be inappropriate to include the extension of runways in the licensing system as this is a once-off development which is subject to the planning process, and in certain cases to the environmental impact assessment procedure.  The potential noise increase would be a matter for consideration as part of the planning and environmental impact assessment systems and would not be appropriate for the ongoing licensing process to be operated by the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment seeks to dilute the exemption provided for aircraft in section 106 which introduces a simplified District Court complaints procedure in respect of neighbourhood noise.  It would not be appropriate to include aircraft noise under this procedure as the operators of aircraft and airports would be <Col N="584" /> open to unlimited complaints even if such complaints were unfounded in terms of practical operational procedures.  It is important also to realise that there are controls on aircraft noise contained in various international conventions and these controls are in force in Ireland.  In this connection it has to be accepted that air transport is an international activity and needs to be controlled principally by international arrangements.</P>
    <P>Under EC requirements and in accordance with national regulations aircraft must be certified to noise standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation &mdash; ICAO &mdash; if they are to operate at Irish airports.  In addition, noise restrictions are placed on the earlier generations of aircraft &mdash; called &ldquo;Chapter 2&rdquo; aircraft &mdash; and such aircraft can no longer be added to the aircraft register in the State.  A number of these &ldquo;Chapter 2&rdquo; aircraft have already been replaced by later models which comply with the more stringent noise certified requirements as set down by the ICAO.  The remaining &ldquo;Chapter 2&rdquo; aircraft will be phased out over time.</P>
    <P>The Airport By-laws &mdash; made by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications under section 16 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950, as amended &mdash; applicable to the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, are currently being comprehensively updated and will significantly prohibit, (a) aircraft engines from being operated for testing other than in a place approved for such purpose by or on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and (b) the ground running of engines for testing which must not be done outside hangars, from 2300 hours to 0700 hours or at other times specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I might add that there is provision in paragraph 13.1 of the First Schedule for the testing of engines, turbines or reactors where the floor area exceeds 500 square metres.  That provision will allow the agency to license those activities and, obviously, to place controls and restrictions in relation to noise.</P>
    <P>In the light of the circumstances I have <Col N="585" /> outlined I do not consider I can extend further existing noise controls in the provisions of this Bill in so far as aircraft are concerned.</P>
    <P>Night flying between 2300 and 0700 hours at Dublin Airport is extremely limited and is confined largely to charter flights.  Aircraft operating during this period must adhere to arrival/departure procedures, consistent with operational requirements, designed to minimise noise levels.  Shannon Airport, as a transatlantic international airport, does have some flights between 2300 hours and 0700 hours but, again, the number of such flights is small.  There is no flying at Cork Airport between 2300 hours and 0700 hours but, exceptionally, a short extension beyond 2300 hours is specifically requested by an airline during the summer period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret the Minister is not prepared to take on board the specific problems to which I referred. While she referred to noise factors in relation to aircraft and airports, it is clear that at present there is no limit on noise pollution occasioned by aircraft.  This means that residents within the vicinity of airports cannot, as of right, claim compensation for such noise pollution.</P>
      <P>Both amendments refer to cases where additions to runways result in increased noise levels in the environs of the airport.  We are talking only about a few specific areas where runway extensions are envisaged. That happened in Dublin airport and when the Shannon stopover problem is solved I have no doubt that a second runway will be required in Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>Traffic through Dublin airport is increasing by 18 per cent per annum. People living near the airport are seriously affected by the noise.  That was acknowledged by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications who gave Aer Rianta responsibility to come to an agreement with the residents of the area.  We want this covered in the Bill so as to copperfasten the right of people in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> In her reply the Minister did not refer to my suggestion that the agency could set up a body to adjudicate on this.  We know the importance of the aviation industry to our economy and that we cannot have people seeking compensation for noise problems.  This was taken on board in our amendment. People in my constituency feel very strongly about this noise pollution.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that the EC is also concerned about this, but when this was first put to the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications he clearly indicated that the people had no rights and that what they were being given in compensation for the acknowledged noise inconvenience was just an offer.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to establish a precedent with the amendment but these people are clearly affected by noise pollution. There should be some mechanism in the Bill to define acceptable levels of noise.  That is not an unreasonable request.  People should know that they are entitled to a fixed amount of compensation or insulation for their homes. I gather that the Minister has a certain amount of sympathy for my case.  On the basis of the Minister's past commitment to environmental protection I hope that sympathy can be extended to giving a commitment to taking the problems I referred to this afternoon on board in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what the Deputy is concerned about is covered in sections 104 and 105 and under the licensing provisions in relation to the testing of engines.  What is excluded under section 106 is aircraft in the sky as opposed to aircraft on the ground and the making of engines.  It is a difficult international issue.  Because of the international aspect of the business it is controlled by international regulations.  It is an extremely difficult issue and I sympathise with much of what Deputy Ryan has said.  However, regulations can be made under sections 104 and 105 to give us extensive powers in relation to noise. At the moment, the legislation in that <Col N="587" /> regard is very unsatisfactory.  Certainly, it will be possible under these regulations to greatly improve the enforcement and complaints mechanisms and to control noise.  It should be possible to modernise the legislation in relation to noise pollution and make it more enforceable than it is at present.  At present it is dealt with almost exclusively on a nuisance basis and it has become difficult to enforce controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us have experienced noise pollution not just of the type to which Deputy Ryan referred but in relation to a host of activities.  For instance, many industrial activities go on throughout the night in premises adjoining residential properties.  That can be extremely annoying for residents.  I have had some experience of that.  We need to improve our legislative controls in this area and that <Col N="588" /> is why we used this Bill to bring in new measures to deal with noise pollution.  I accept that aircraft are excluded under section 106 and are dealt with while they are in the sky by international regulations and standards with which we comply.  The Minister will shortly make new regulations in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue this matter much further.  I do not accept what the Minister said, that the problems I have identified are dealt with in the Bill.  I want the problem dealt with in the Bill and a mechanism set up to deal with complaints.  We are talking about aircraft taking off from a new runway and the extension of an existing runway.  That is not incorporated in the Bill.  I feel strongly about this and I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 11, lines 5 to 10, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to subsection (3), a reference in this Act to the use of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs to prevent or eliminate, or where that is not practicable, to limit, abate or reduce an emission from an activity, shall be construed as meaning the provision and proper maintenance, use, operation and supervision of facilities which, having <Col N="591" /> regard to all the circumstances, are the most suitable for the purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment clarifies that there is an onus of prevention and elimination of pollution and only where this is not practicable is the solution of limiting, abating or reducing pollution an acceptable option.  Even without this amendment, it is my understanding that the application of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost would require such an approach.  However, I want this matter to be transparent and that is why I am introducing this clarification in the wording of the subsection.  This wording is also in line with the principle of precautionary action at section 52 (2) (c), which I introduced by amendment in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The amendment to section 81 is consequential on the amendment to section 5.  If my amendment is carried, Deputy Gilmore's amendment which seeks to delete the reference to the circumstances of the case will fall.  In any event that amendment is unacceptable to me as it would turn what is intended to be a flexible pollution prevention strategy into an administrative straitjacket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is not satisfactory to those of us in New Agenda.  Section 5 quite clearly releases established industrial units or factories from the full repercussions of the legislation. It is quite understandable that any new plant coming on stream should start off with a clean sheet, but it is not the new enterprises which are the cause of our present difficulties.  Existing industrial practices are currently causing headaches to many environmentalists, communities and individual members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong if shoddy practices were engaged in by either industry or others.  We are trying to clean up such activities which are causing so much inconvenience and possible damage to the health of people and livestock.  Therefore, we should recognise bad practices as an established activity that somehow <Col N="592" /> or other should not be covered fully.  In subsection (3) (b) reference is made to the cost which would be incurred in improving or replacing the facilities referred to in relation to the economic situation.  Essentially, the Minister is saying if it costs money to improve, to eradicate or to remove the cause of pollution, emissions, etc., that somebody could plead inability to improve their methods of operation on grounds of cost.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be right morally or in any other way to allow a community to suffer from emissions because an argument is being put forward that it would cost too much too improve production methods or the method of incinerating waste in industry.  I do not accept that the Minister's amendment addresses the problems which Deputy Gilmore has raised in his amendment.  I request the Minister to look again at this amendment and accept the reservations that have been expressed.</P>

      <P>Obviously I make notes as I go along.  As you have advised, amendment No. 14 was put to the House, voice voted, and lost.  That is what I have in my note.  I understood they were taken together for debate purposes.  I remember distinctly Deputy Garland saying he was unhappy at their being grouped but in the interests of saving time would not involve himself in a procedural wrangle. You are right in saying amendment No. 14 was put and lost on a voice vote.  I understood &mdash; and I am here a little longer than Deputy Garland &mdash; that that would not impact on being able to put amendments Nos. 24 and 26 because they had been discussed in a grouped fashion but that when they were reached they could be put.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (2) (a), to delete line 12. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I inadvertently drifted into this amendment earlier and, therefore, I will reiterate some of the points.  It is not fair, right or proper that, for example, the current state of technical knowledge or the requirements of environmental protection should not apply to an established activity.  The reason we are looking for the deletion of the line is that we believe the legislation should apply to all activity <Col N="600" /> regardless of the length of time in which the activity has been engaged.  Throughout the country, environmental problems are being caused by a huge variety of annoying and disruptive practices with possible health-related effects on human beings and livestock.  These activities include piggeries, certain methods of farming and abattoirs which very often are located in residential areas.  Many residents in the inner city of Dublin are unfortunate enough to live close to abattoirs. Why should these activities not be covered in the legislation?  Why should a coalyard adjacent to a residential area which emits massive quantities of coal dust into the atmosphere in bagging operations be able to argue that the best available technology requirement should not apply to them?  I know of a coalyard in the Dublin south inner city area which badly polluted the atmosphere in the area as a result of their activities.  It appears that the legislation will not apply to this coal yard as they are an established activity.  Why should it not apply to them? I should like the Minister to elaborate on why the legislation will not apply to existing chemical factories.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines the term &ldquo;best available technology not entailing excessive costs&rdquo; as it is used in the Bill. Provision is made to avoid any conflict of requirements under this section and under section 5 (3) of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  The use of best available technology not entailing excessive costs is a precondition for the grant of a licence under section 81 and must also be used for the control of genetically modified organisms under section 109. </P>
    <P>I believe the provisions of the Bill should apply equally to established activities and to new plants coming on stream.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment which is of tremendous importance to many communities who have been campaigning politically and otherwise to improve the quality of the environment in their districts.  Companies and factories <Col N="601" /> which cause pollution, annoyance and possible injury to health should not be allowed to evade the requirements of the legislation just because they are established activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands what precisely BATNEEC is all about.  It is not my intention that all existing industries would not be licensed by the agency.  It is proposed that the agency will initially begin operating BATNEEC as one of six measures they will have to take into account when deciding to licence an activity under the First Schedule.  Obviously, this will begin with all new activities coming into Ireland.</P>
      <P>With regard to existing activities covered by the First Schedule, it is envisaged that over time all of their licence applications will be reviewed by the agency and BATNEEC will be applied to them. It would be unreasonable on day one to suddenly expect older plants to apply the same kind of technologies which can be applied to new plants starting from scratch.  That would be unreasonable and would not be playing the game fairly. Generally speaking, the older the activity the greater the pollution caused.  It is envisaged that all activities covered by the First Schedule will be brought under the auspices of the agency for licensing purposes as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously technologies are changing as technical knowledge improves and so on.  If the agency were to license in year one a particular activity and there were technological developments in that field in year two, does Deputy Byrne envisage that because there is an improved BATNEEC for that class of development that within a year or thereabouts of the activity having first been licensed it should be upgraded to the new standard? I do not think the Deputy envisages that that should be the case.  Once a plant is licensed by the agency it will become an established activity, even if it is new.  It is not envisaged, nor would it be desirable, that the agency should have to constantly go back to companies as technology improves and expect those changes to be put into practice instantaneously in cases <Col N="602" /> although that might not be desirable or necessary from an environmental point of view.</P>
    <P>When one is talking about matters relating to technology and technical knowledge it is probably more difficult to understand what is involved than when one is talking about buildings.  For example, it has never been envisaged as planning criteria improve that we should require established buildings to be changed, knocked down and rebuilt from scratch.  Even though standards improve and opinions on what is acceptable change it is not thought desirable under the planning system that a building should be knocked so that another building which would be more acceptable from a visual point of view could be put in its place.  The reason we do not expect this is that when we are talking about physical buildings we seem to accept that they are there and that is the way they will be. However, when one is talking about technology we seem to think it is easier to put in place the kind of things which might be desired.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies it is intended to bring all existing activities in the First Schedule, for example, pharmaceutical and chemical companies, food processing companies and so on under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency as quickly as possible.  Obviously regard will have to be had for the age of a plant. Some plants might be coming very near the end of their lives.  For example, it might be envisaged that a plant will go out of operation in a year or two.  If this is the case obviously it would not be desirable to require that plant to put in place the best available technology at that time.</P>
    <P>With regard to their licensing role the agency will have to take a number of things, including BATNEEC, into account when deciding to grant a licence. There is an assumption that the best available technology not entailing excessive costs is the only criteria the agency will take into account when prescribing conditions for the licensee.  First, the agency will have to be satisfied that any emissions from the activity will not result <Col N="603" /> in the contravention of any relevant air quality standards specified under section 50 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and will comply with any relevant emission limit value specified under section 51 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  Second, they will have to be satisfied that any emissions from the activity will not result in the contravention of any relevant quality standards for water, trade effluents and sewage effluents and standards in relation to treatment of such effluents and so on.</P>
    <P>Third, they will have to satisfy themselves that any emissions from the activity of any premises, plant, methods, processes, operating procedures or other factors which affect such emissions will comply with, or will not result in the contravention of any relevant standard, including any standard for an environmental medium prescribed under regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972.  That obviously relates to the area of waste.  Fourth, they will have to be satisfied that the noise from the activity will comply with regulations under section 104 and fifth, that any emission from the activity will not cause significant pollution.  Therefore the best available technology is not the only matter that will have to be taken into account by the agency.  It is not true to say that in order to be able to comply with high standards the best available technology is always required.  Neither is it desirable that if the best available technology not involving excessive cost is put in place an investor can be assured, unless there is environmental pollution in which case the circumstances would be different, that he or she will not have to change the investment within a short period of time.  If the Deputy's amendment is accepted it would require the agency to constantly review every licence as technology improves, even though that might be within a very short period from the time of the granting of the initial licence.  I do not believe that would be necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier in reply to Deputy Garland's amendment on clean production, in the main we import technologies <Col N="604" /> into Ireland and therefore we depend very much on developments elsewhere. The definition and the concept being used here are the ones most widely used in the developed world, that is the best available technology not involving excessive cost, together with other criteria. The Deputy's aim is to bring under the control of the agency all existing activities so that they would be licensed to higher standards.  That matter would be more appropriate to section 80 which deals with the established activities.  We will probably have a longer debate on this matter when we come to deal with that section.  I want to make it perfectly clear that this agency will not only deal with new activities that are set up in the future but will be charged with reviewing licences and monitoring and enforcing conditions in relation to a large number of existing activities covered by the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Byrne and to the Minister I have not changed my views and I support Deputy Gilmore's two amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has put forward as being the only solution to the problem.  She has argued that if the application of a licence is compulsory, over time the plant may change and it would be unfair to treat those engaged in existing activities in the same way as those who are about to set up new plants.  Would the Minister not agree that existing activities should equally comply with the legislation?  If that was provided for, the agency would be empowered, by not granting them a licence, to close down these plants or factories.  That would not discriminate against existing activities but would compel them to comply with the legislation and if they did not do so the agency could withhold the granting of a licence to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to amendment No. 30 in which Deputy Gilmore proposes the deletion of subsection (2) (b). As regards old plants which are likely to pollute the environment and surrounding <Col N="605" /> communities, how does the Minister intend to balance the question of the cost of improving these plants with the rights of the people living in surrounding communities? Subparagraph (iii) states: &ldquo;the costs which would be incurred in improving or replacing the facilities referred to in subparagraph (ii) in relation to the economic situation of activities of the class concerned&rdquo;.  Companies in particular are masters at claiming that their economic situation does not allow them to modernise their facilities in order to eliminate practices which pollute the environment.</P>
    <P>The former McHenry's coalyard at Clanbrassil Street used the argument that they could not afford to bring in the protective gear necessary to prevent solid particles from being emitted into the atmosphere thus destroying the quality of life for those living in that part of Dublin's inner city.  It is easy to allow companies to get off the hook on the grounds of their economic situation.  I am thinking of the position whereby pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere from hospital incinerators.  I can understand the argument made by hospital boards that they can ill afford to improve their facilities because the Government have not allocated sufficient funding to allow them to do so.  Unless hospitals are given the money to improve the quality of incinerators they will continue to pollute the atmosphere.  Most environmental pollution is caused by established activities and in many cases these activities are not included in the legislation. Basically, they can walk away from their responsibilities to the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a misunderstanding in relation to the application of the BATNEEC concept.  It will not apply on a plant by plant basis.  BATNEEC will be defined for a class of activity.  There will be a BATNEEC for the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the food processing industry and so on.  All industries within that sector will have to comply with that BATNEEC.  It will not be sufficient for a particular industry to argue that the <Col N="606" /> costs are prohibitive.  If we are talking about excessive costs, those costs will relate to a class of activity rather than to individual activities.  The agency will be required to specify BATNEECs for different classes of activity.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by the Deputy that in many cases it is existing activities that have led to the need for the Environmental Protection Agency.  It is the intention and will be the case that all existing activities covered by the First Schedule &mdash; in other words, all of the matters covered under the agency's licensing system &mdash; will be licensed by the agency.  That cannot be done immediately.  It is only fair and reasonable that existing activities that have particular technologies in place at the moment be given an amount of lead-in time to apply the higher standards. In some cases we are talking about an expense of millions of pounds.  The change cannot come about overnight and I do not know of any instance in which such a change has been made overnight.</P>
      <P>Technology can change in a matter of months.  Something might be licensed today and then the technology involved could change in six month.  If an industry invested £5 million or £10 million in technology when permission was granted and a licence approved, would it be reasonable to expect investment in new technology a couple of months later because of improvements in technology?  If we were to go down that road there would be no investment in this country.  There has to be some certainty that the technology that applies will be applicable for several years.</P>
      <P>As I have said, applying the technology is only one aspect that the agency will have to consider in deciding whether to approve a licence.  Application of technology is one of six conditions that must be fulfilled.  Obviously, if serious pollution is being caused or if there is a possibility of serious pollution problems under air pollution, water pollution or waste disposal legislation then the agency would not grant a licence, even when the BATNEEC could be applied.  I want to make that point perfectly clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to classes of developed and <Col N="607" /> existing activities, the Government envisage letting those classes of development know the time period for compliance with the BATNEEC and the agency's licensing system.  That issue will take some consideration.  Some sectors will be able to comply more easily and quicker than others.  It is possible that older plants towards the end of their life would not be in a position to comply with the higher standards and would have to cease to operate because the new technologies could not be applied to the older plant. There would obviously be a question of new plant in the case of some industries and time would have to be provided for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne seems to be under the impression that the agency will license only new activities and that everything that exists as of now will never come under the control of the agency.  I do not want that impression to go out because that is not the case.  Activities will be brought in on a class by class basis and as quickly as it is physically and practically possible, in what we believe to be a reasonable period of time, for those classes of development to meet the highest standards.</P>

    <P>The amendment speaks for itself.  In <Col N="608" /> areas of special environmental significance and sensitivity there may need to be requirements and provisions over and above those needed in normal instances.  I ask the Minister to consider acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I realise the intent of these amendments, I consider that the provisions of the section and the way in which BATNEEC is used in the Bill are sufficiently flexible to incorporate already the intentions of the Deputies in relation to the existing environment.  For example, section 4 (1) defines environmental protection as including &ldquo;the preservation of the quality of the environment&rdquo;. I have no doubt that the significance and sensitivity of that environment would be taken into account in any exercise involving an assessment of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost for the particular activity concerned.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments would have the effect of inserting a phraseology that could be difficult to define legally and thereby cause confusion when the agency come to interpret it.  I do not believe the proposed amendment would add anything useful to the Bill.  In addition, BATNEEC is only one of six grounds on which the agency must be satisfied before a licence can be granted. There would also appear to be some element of duplication between the two amendments.  Amendment No. 28, affecting section 5 (2) (a) (ii), would not be necessary if the additional section 5 (2) (c) were inserted by amendment No. 31.</P>

The Minister could well be right in one respect, in that if amendment No. 31 were accepted perhaps amendment No. 28 would not be necessary.

      <P>If the Minister was accommodating, it would appear that what is sought in this amendment would be easily applied in that, subsection (3) (a) calls for a copy of the specification to be made available when the agency may, from time to time as occasion demands, specify the best available technology not entailing excessive costs for preventing, limiting, eliminating, abating or reducing such emissions as may be specified either from an activity or activities of a particular class or description and regard shall be had, in the administration of this Act, to any such specifications.</P>

      <P>Yes, I did give an undertaking in the Seanad.  At the outset I want to say I do not have any disagreement with the spirit of what is intended here. Nonetheless I want to outline the difficulties involved.  I did give an undertaking in the Seanad that I would prescribe the bodies that are prescribed in the Planning Acts, together with other bodies, because, of course, they are not the only bodies that are concerned about BATNEEC specifications.  The difficulty about including specific organisations in the Bill on a statutory basis is the following. First of all, it is difficult to cover all the organisations in legislation, in that new organisations are established and so on.  In relation to the existing specified organisations, I should say one of the four organisations to which Deputy Byrne referred no longer exists, that is the National Monuments Advisory Body, one of the four bodies prescribed in the Planning Acts.  While it is the intention to prescribe other bodies, such as Bord Fáilte, the Arts Council, An Taisce, <Col N="612" /> the other three bodies, there will be a large number of additional bodies that would have an interest in receiving from the agency the BATNEEC specifications made.  Certainly it is the intention to prescribe as many bodies as could reasonably have an interest in this matter.  I will certainly give an undertaking to that effect.  If we include just the remaining bodies specified in the Planning Acts, and do not include others &mdash; off the top of my head I cannot think just how many more there would be; while I can think of some, the list is by no means conclusive at this stage &mdash; choosing some, putting them on a statutory basis and placing others on a different basis would not be desirable.  It would be better to put every body on the same basis, which would mean that they would be prescribed by way of regulations.  I would ask Members to accept that proposal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) in making such specifications the Agency shall have regard to the need for an effective precautionary approach to safeguard the environment, where the Agency believes that damage or harmful effects are likely to be caused, even where there is not definitive scientific evidence to link emissions or discharges with detrimental environmental effects.&rdquo;. </P>

    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The Agency shall issue a comprehensive specification of all such technology as soon as may be after the commencement of this Act and this comprehensive specification shall be revised and published annually thereafter.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>santhi </P>
    <P>This amendment speaks for itself and has been tabled for the sake of completeness. Much has been said about the need for clarity so as to ensure that our rightful concern for the environment is not a hindrance to economic development, based on the belief that very many people interested in industrial development prefer to know exactly what they must deal with, to be certain about what are the environmental and other planning requirements.  It was in that spirit that our addition was proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it may well sound unreasonable to say that I cannot accept this amendment but, quite honestly, I do not think it would be necessary for the agency, where they define a BATNEEC, to revise that specification every year, which would be required under the provisions of this amendment.  That would place an enormous burden on the agency. Section 5 (3) (a) confers some flexibility on the agency to adopt a programme for specifying BATNEEC.  In doing so, they would have regard to any specifications issued by the Commission of the European Communities or other member states.  In the light of those specifications they could consider the need for a separate specification of their own, or adopt one from another member state.  Pending the issue of a general specification for a particular class of activities the agency can specify BATNEEC requirements and the conditions to be attached to a specific integrated licence under Part IV of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of BATNEEC specifications for all activities immediately would be unnecessary in view of the stated intention to bring existing activities under the licensing system on a <Col N="614" /> phased basis over a number of years. There is already adequate provision for a review of BATNEEC under section 5 (3) (a) if the need arises.  I should say that BATNEEC would also be reviewed in specific cases where a licence is being reviewed under section 86.  We should remember that the rate of technology change is not uniform across the range of scheduled activities.  In many cases the technology would not change for quite a number of years.  In addition, annual revisions of specifications would be wasteful of resources.  Moreover, it would be unreasonable for operations or activities that have just introduced a new BATNEEC into their process to have to change immediately to a new BATNEEC which is what is intended.  There is a minimum period of three years specified in section 86 during which reviews, with specific exceptions, may not take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. BATNEEC enters into the provisions of the Bill not only by way of reduction of pollution but also by way of prevention of pollution at source.  If it is excessive to require an annual updating and publication, perhaps the Minister would indicate what would be a reasonable timescale for such updating.  I do not think one can rest on one's laurels once one has a technology acceptable, in that vast improvements can take place in the course of 12 months, particularly in the prevention of pollution.  Therefore, there should be some timescale within which it would be reasonable to have an updating and publication of the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment perhaps she could suggest an alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously reviewing a BATNEEC would depend on the rate of technological developments and change. For example, if there are no changes in relation to BATNEECs or in developments elsewhere &mdash; and as I said we are in the main a net importer of technologies and are very dependent on developments in other more industrialised countries &mdash;<Col N="615" /> it would be wasteful of resources to force the agency to go through the routine of having a review simply for the sake of it. I honestly think leaving it in the flexible way it stands is more desirable.  That means the agency can pick and choose if something has changed.  Obviously they can review it but, if there are no changes or developments, then it is not required of them, by statute, to do so.</P>
      <P>It is important to safeguard, in relation to the operations of this agency, that we do not over-burden them with the kinds of red tape or bureaucratic requirements that have no beneficial effect.  Obviously the agency will be operating an integrated licensing control system and, in so doing, will have to ensure that any particular application submitted to them specifies the best available technology not entailing excessive costs.  In the initial years there might be classes of activity that do not come up for licence, when the agency may decide to leave it for some time, as they begin to perform their functions, before specifying a BATNEEC in relation to that activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that once a BATNEEC is established and published, once specifications are acceptable and agreed, she would not see any legislative necessity to have it updated?  It is important that it be clear that there would be a constant monitoring and updating.  While I have no particular hang-up on an annual publication, surely it would be acceptable that some updating, within a regular, defined period, would be required?</P>

      <P>Thank you.  This is a bit of a hardy annual.  It is put in by Opposition Deputies and opposed by Government Deputies.  There is a tendency for this practice to be followed even when Deputies move from one side of the House to the other.  What I have in mind is that this House should be the final arbiter in relation to regulations, because often regulations are passed that are really not subject to proper democratic scrutiny.  That is a fundamental flaw in the way we do our business.  More and more legislation passing through the House is enabling legislation and Ministers are simply given powers, and huge volumes of legislative work is done by way of statutory instrument.  This is very undesirable and very undemocratic.  I have often made that case.</P>
      <P>In relation to this legislation I hope the formula I have proposed in amendment No. 37 will be accepted whereby every order made under the Act would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either House within the following 21 days on which the House has sat after the order has been laid before the House, that the order shall be annulled accordingly without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.  I am intrigued by the different approach being taken by my Fine Gael colleagues.  It is interesting that they propose that seven Members of the House could put into play a motion that would require a positive decision of the full House.  That is an interesting proposal, worthy of support.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy for the position of Opposition Deputies in relation to the almost impossible procedure we have for annulling regulations. While on that side of the House I tried to do this on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very much a framework Bill.  To a large extent it has to be put in place through regulations.  If we did not do it that way, long as it took to get this Bill here, it would not even be here at this stage.  It is virtually impossible to cover in the primary legislation all the kinds of <Col N="619" /> matters that have to be covered to allow certain things to happen.  That is why it is appropriate that we have the procedure known as Statutory Instruments, Regulations or Orders.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to the fundamental aspects of the Bill, it is appropriate that they could not be changed unless the approval of the Oireachtas was given and that is why in relation to adding to or deleting from the First and Second Schedules in relation to selection committees and so on, and those matters which are fundamental to the operation of the agency, they can only be changed with the approval of the Oireachtas.  That is an important safeguard, but in relation to other matters which in many cases come under the day-to-day housekeeping matters of the agency, it would be unreasonable to expect that they would all have to come for approval before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we were to accept that procedure we would have a matter of form, as we had here this morning when four or five matters before this Bill started were disposed of without debate, by agreement.  They were just formalities because that is the way they had to be dealt with.  We had a similar procedure yesterday in relation to the Limerick Markets Bill.  Many of these formalities become ritual formalities and a nuisance, quite often.  We need to be aware of that.  There is a need for radical reform of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the way we do our business.  This is not an appropriate way in which to deal with primary legislation.  There are five of us here now and there have been more or less five people here all day.  It would be more appropriate to go through the legislative process in a different way.  We need to change procedures and the way in which regulations operate and so on, but that is more relevant to fundamental Oireachtas reform and the way we process legislation than it is to this Bill.  There is a safeguard in the Bill &mdash; this point was debated in the Seanad &mdash; in regard to fundamental matters, such as the selection of a director general and board members.  The First and Second <Col N="620" /> Schedules can only be changed with the approval of the Dáil and Seanad. Deputies can be reassured by that safeguard. Given that a host of regulations will be made under the legislation, it would be unreasonable if we had to join the queue to have them approved because that would make it virtually impossible for any Government to do their business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, a former member of Government, realises that the regulation procedure is a necessary way of making things happen quickly.  By and large most regulations are uncontentious and do not cause difficulties.  It is usually the case that when the regulations are not made, as Deputy Allen referred to this morning, that problems arise.  It is what does not happen that causes problems for Deputies.  It is not appropriate to change the Bill as suggested by the Deputy in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister has not been able to accept this amendment.  The implications of my amendment go far beyond this Bill or this Department.  When the practice commenced to insert regulations, that would take effect after 12 days, as a feature of the legislation, it was clearly understood and implied that any annulling motion would be taken in the House within 21 days.  The Government have taken to ignoring the implied right of Deputies to have such motions taken and frequently the business of the House is ordered in such a way as to refuse them time to deal with them.  It seems to me that this is one of the basic reforms of the House that is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason there are so few Deputies in the House at any one time is that the House is so powerless and we are wasting our time talking to empty benches.  If Ministers were brave enough to accept amendments of this type, they would force the pace of reform and make the House more relevant.  I have no doubt it would improve the quality of the legislation being enacted.  What is more, it would keep Ministers on their toes.  The purpose of Parliament is to hold Ministers <Col N="621" /> to account thus improving the performance of Ministers and their Departments.  If the Minister can draft regulations, knowing for certain they will never see the light of day in this House, they may be careless.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that we would not get any business done because of the number of these motions that would have to be dealt with.  We would get the business done and we would be forced to change the format of debates in this House.  We would have to have a committee system.  All the environmental issues would be discussed at an environmental committee without having to compete with crime or finance matters because they would be dealt with separately by another committee.  That is the procedure in other Parliaments.  This would be a very useful change.  The elected Members would then become legislators in the true sense rather than feeling we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister will not accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I too regret that the Minister will not accept the amendment.  This is a fundamental point and the Minister of State indicated she would be sympathetic to it.  I do not think it is good enough to say that one has sympathy for a point but that things change when one is on the other side of the House.  The Minister suggests this is a matter of fundamental Dáil reform but we must start somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept what the Minister of State said about the motions on the Order Paper today.  The placing of the motions on the Order Paper forced the Whips to look at them.  The motions were brought before the Whips last Thursday, were discussed with the spokespersons of the other parties and it was agreed to nod them through today without further examination.  The point is that they have to be brought to the attention of Deputies.  If every resolution or regulation enacted into law had been subject to the same scrutiny, democracy would have been enhanced.  When I first became a Member of the Oireachtas I was <Col N="622" /> appointed a member of the then committee on legislation.  One of our functions was to examine Statutory Instruments.  We trawled through thousands of Statutory Instruments and examined them.  Some were bad.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea of having proper committees of the House.  For example, a committee on the environment could deal with environmental legislation and the Statutory Instruments signed by Ministers on foot of enabling legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  We could establish committees on crime, health, education. Every area should be subject to democratic scrutiny.  The amendment would not go that far but it would be a significant step in that direction.  It was a good idea to include motions on the Order Paper today.  I do not think they cluttered the agenda or stifled debate because they were nodded through. What it meant was that they were examined in the first instance by the Whip.  The Statutory Instruments, and the briefing notes on them, were discussed with the spokespersons concerned.  They are subject to scrutiny and that is democracy in action for once.</P>
    <P>We need to address this issue.  I am well disposed to supporting amendment No. 35 because it is innovative and gives power to a relatively small number of Deputies to initiate a process that requires the House to act.  That is a good thing.  If the Minister of State accepts that some sections, what she described as the important sections, will be subject to the affirmation of this House, then it is important that all sections are subject to some form of democratic scrutiny.  It would be good if Deputies sent out the message of their need to assert their influence on legislation.  It would be a good day's work for Dáil reform if the Minister of State began the work tonight.</P>

      <P>I do not know of any committees of this House that meet in August.  We do not have a committee system that works like that at present. The Deputies want all the regulations to establish this agency to come before this House within ten sitting days.  Therefore, if we are doing a great deal of work, as we will be, during the early summer, we will have to wait until the middle to end of September or, indeed, early October before we are in a position to have them approved by this House.  That is unreasonable and no Government could operate on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at the more fundamental aspects of this in relation to Oireachtas reform.  I do not think we can take a unilateral decision in relation to regulations under this Bill without looking at how regulations in general operate in the context of the legislative process. That needs re-examination.  If this amendment were accepted &mdash; I hope to be in a position in early summer to produce the housekeeping or administrative regulations to establish this <Col N="624" /> agency &mdash; we would have to wait until the Dáil resumed after the summer recess before regulations could take effect.  That would completely tie the hands of any Government and it would be unreasonable.  This is enabling legislation. Regulations in relation to fundamental matters such as the selection of the director general and the directors will have to be approved by the Oireachtas.  It is not appropriate that regulations with regard to administrative matters should need parliamentary approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill is to be welcomed not just by women but by all those who seek to end discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, age, handicap, religion, race or membership of the travelling community.  It may be a sad indictment of our society that this legislation is necessary to remove such discrimination and ensure that equality of opportunity is a reality rather than a pious hope.  Much of this Bill concentrates on the area of training, employment and equality of opportunity for women and others, giving them the same status, pay and protection as that afforded to male employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour claimed last night that Ireland had been rightly credited with developing one of the most effective and accessible legal mechanisms <Col N="625" /> in the EC with regard to equal pay and equal opportunity legislation.  In fact we have a sad history of women who had been denied basic justice here having to go to Europe to seek what should have been available to them in Ireland.  The Minister also mentioned the discussion document circulated in 1987.  It was welcomed by interest groups who responded with urgency and consistency.  These included the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  Five years later when I asked the Taoiseach when the legislation based on this discussion document would be introduced, he replied that it was at an early stage and very unlikely to be ready for this current session. If the Minister for Labour is claiming effective mechanisms and crediting us as outstanding in the EC he should consider this dire record, of which we should be ashamed and embarrassed.</P>
    <P>Amending legislation must be introduced which will place the onus on the employer rather than the employee and which will allow women to take cases based on what a man would earn were he in the same job.  Until such legislation is introduced women will still be earning 68 per cent of the rate enjoyed by men and they will be locked into part-time working due to lack of training, lack of equality of opportunity and career development and above all lack of child care facilities and supportive maternity and paternity leave.  We are so far behind other European countries that we should feel a sense of shame and embarrassment. Up to now our record has not been good.</P>
    <P>We should take special cognisance of the fact that for many traditional reasons women have not had the same opportunity as they have had in other countries. There was the denial of the right of married women to work, thus cutting back for years on all career development and even educational opportunities.  There is still a reluctance to introduce any mechanism to allow married women who have been in the home to be retrained and to come back into the workforce.  This is not a priority, although in other countries it is strongly encouraged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> There are overt discriminations on a social level.  I spoke yesterday about the denial of credit facilities.  One of the most overt and least acceptable discriminations is in the area of sporting facilities and recreation.  Golf clubs have been mentioned because many of them deny full membership and voting rights to women.  For 60 years women fought for universal suffrage.  It is remarkable that full membership and voting rights should still be denied within golf clubs. People may regard this as a frivolous and trivial point but the fundamental denial of rights in this area is socially acceptable. I have seen some American advertising showing that over 80 per cent of tenders, contracts and business deals are completed at golf club level.  Women were absolutely excluded from that network which has benefited male golf club members.  Another dramatic and serious point is that representatives of management, the decision makers, the Judiciary, the Church, those who feel they have the wisdom and power to set standards and impose laws, are members of such clubs.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights in 1991 contacted 208 golf clubs, of which 174 replied.  Fifty-five clubs, mostly in rural areas, indicated no discrimination.  Fifty-three indicated discrimination, some of them with offensive insolence, and 53 were considering changing the rules. That is an incredible indictment.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that in welcoming the Equal Status Bill and in asking the Government to take it on under the broad umbrella of social and employment rights Deputy Taylor when introducing the Bill said it may not necessarily be perfect, but it is open to amendment.  That is something with which we would all agree.  Other legislation is needed in this area which is part and parcel of the status and freedom of women in this country.  I would remind the House that not alone are the outstanding discriminations, which we had some time to allude to in this debate, alive and well but they are thriving in Ireland.  In 1992 the right to abortion information, non-directive pregnancy <Col N="627" /> counselling and the right to travel outside this country is prohibited to women.  That cannot continue.</P>

      <P>Following on the contribution of Deputy Barnes the former chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, on which I served, I fully sympathise with the views she expressed on the golf clubs issue.  I will refer to it later in my contribution.</P>
      <P>The last time I had the opportunity to participate in a debate on the issue of equality between the sexes was less than a year ago when, as a backbench Teachta Dála, I contributed last April to Deputy Gay Mitchell's Private Members' Bill on the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution. Deputies will be aware that this Bill sought to insert a new equality clause into Article 40 of the Constitution.  In that debate, I concluded my remarks by saying:</P>
      <P>Let us collectively take the best proposals from the many positive issues which have been referred to during this debate.  In co-operation with the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Office of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who since her election to the Dáil has been constantly to the forefront in promoting equality for women and currently co-ordinates Government legislation in this area, we should get down to building on the progressive steps that have been undertaken by this Government and bring about real equality for women. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> When I spoke at that time I little knew that I would myself now have the singular honour of performing the pivotal role of representing the concerns and interests of Irish women within the overall Government structure by occupying the same Office at the Department of the Taoiseach to which I refered last year. But while my status within this House has changed since that last debate, I am pleased to have the opportunity now to underline the consistency of my own views on the equality issue and to say that my response to Deputy Spring's Bill is exactly the same as that outlined in the earlier debate.  The difference is, however &mdash; and I believe it is an important difference &mdash; that it is now open to me as Minister of State for Women's Affairs to make a full contribution in the combined effort to promote equality which I recommended last year.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us has the objective of prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality, or national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community.  Coming from the perspective of my responsibilities as Minister of State for Women's Affairs, my primary interest in the proposals before us lies, of course, in the question of discrimination between the sexes and I propose to concentrate my remarks on this subject.  Indeed, I was interested to note from the debate in the House last evening that the contributions also concentrated on the issue of equality between the sexes.</P>
    <P>I would like from the outset to acknowledge the fact that much thought and good research has been put into the proposals before the House this evening. Indeed, as a legislator committed to the principles of social justice and of equal opportunity for all our citizens, I can subscribe to the underlying philosophy of the Bill and confirm my personal empathy with its objectives.</P>
    <P>What I do have problems with, and it is for this reason that I will be opposing the Bill, is the fact that I do not believe that these objectives can be achieved by <Col N="629" /> the means now proposed by Deputy Spring in this Bill.  My colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, has in his contribution last night dealt in detail with the significant flaws in the Bill as drafted in so far as the amendments to our employment equality laws &mdash; and the crucial functions exercised by the Labour Court and the Employment Equality Agency which complement these laws &mdash; are concerned.  I will not repeat the Minister's critique of these particular proposals, but propose to concentrate on broader issues.</P>
    <P>As the explanatory memorandum to the Bill before us acknowledges, the Bill is far broader than that covered by existing legislation on discrimination.  But it is the very fact that the Bill is so broad that presents problems for me as Minister of State for Women's Affairs.</P>
    <P>My firm conviction is that the question of discrimination on grounds of sex is of such fundamental importance that it must be addressed in legislation in its own right.  Women represent half of our population and women's concerns and interests should not, in my opinion, be addressed as a part of a catch-all measure which seeks to eliminate discrimination against a number of groups in our society. I have no hesitation in saying that all the groups cited in this Bill deserve the full protection of our laws against discriminatory acts.  I would posit the view, however, that the odious discriminatory treatment of women in our society deserves a focused rather than a confused and blurred approach to its resolution.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we were to address the very serious issue of discrimination on grounds of sex by way of Deputy Spring's proposals before us, we would quite simply lose the very focus of what I believe should be the primary and overriding priority of this Legislature &mdash; the promotion of equality and equal opportunities between the sexes.  To the extent that discrimination against other groups in our society exists &mdash; groups which, I would emphasise, involve both women and men &mdash; I believe these issues can and indeed should be addressed by separate <Col N="630" /> legislative and administrative arrangements.</P>
    <P>In making this point, I would refer Deputy Spring to the arrangements which are in place in other jurisdictions to deal with the issue of discrimination against the categories of persons covered by this Bill.  In Northern Ireland, for example, discrimination on grounds of sex is dealt with by the Equal Opportunities Commission, while there is the separate Fair Employment Agency to deal with religious discrimination.  In Britain, the Equal Opportunities Commission are also the statutory agency dealing with discrimination on grounds of sex, but there is a separate Race Relations Commission to deal with racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>While I have no detailed information available to me for other jurisdictions, the existence in Denmark of an Equal Status Council, in Portugal of a Commission on the Condition of Women, in Spain of an Institute for Women, in Greece of a Secretariat-General for Equality, in the Netherlands of an Emancipation Council, and, in Finland, of a Council for Equality, points to the fact that most western societies have acknowledged the need to address the question of equality between the sexes as a separate issue.</P>
    <P>My information is that all of the equality bodies abroad which I have just now referred to have, to a greater or lesser extent, functions, which are similar to those currently exercised by our Employment Equality Agency.  While I am not an exponent of a slavish copying of arrangements pertaining in other jurisdictions, I would nevertheless suggest to the promoters of this measure that there are compelling reasons to believe that, notwithstanding the bona fides of their intentions, the Bill as presented could in fact do a disservice to all our efforts to achieve equality between the sexes if it were to be enacted.</P>
    <P>The Government decided not to oppose the introduction of this Bill because they were happy to give the House the opportunity to discuss discriminatory practices in our society and <Col N="631" /> to place their own firm commitment to the principle of equality between the sexes on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that any objective assessment of the structures which have been maintained or put in place to combat inequality between the sexes by this Government since taking office in 1989 would conclude that they are comprehensive and effective. These structures involve the explicit assignment by the Taoiseach to all Government Ministers of responsibility for the promotion of the status of Irish women within their own areas of responsibility; my appointment as Minister of State for Women's Affairs with the important task of complementing the activities of all Government Ministers and all Government Departments by exercising a monitoring and co-ordinating role on all aspects of Government policy as they affect women; the re-establishment of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, on which I myself had the honour to serve &mdash; and I would remind the House that it was on the personal initiative of the Leader of Fianna Fáil in Opposition at the time, Deputy Haughey, that this committee were established in the first place in 1983; the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in November 1990; the progressive increase of the order of 24 per cent in the funding of the Employment Equality Agency since 1989; the continued funding of the Council for the Status of Women, which is the umbrella organisation for over 80 women's groups in Irish society and whose pivotal role as an effective lobby for women's concerns is recognised by this Government; indeed, it was in recognition of this role that the council obtained a 19 per cent increase in funding last year and that the 1991 grant has been repeated this year.</P>
    <P>I believe it would be helpful to this debate to give the House some flavour of the types of initiatives which have been taken by this Government since 1989 in the equality area, initiatives which very often do not attract the attention they deserve.  The types of initiatives I have in <Col N="632" /> mind are: the increase in the number of women being appointed to the boards of State bodies from 225 in 1987 to 299 last October; the enactment in December 1990 of new legislation on rape which introduces new offences with more severe penalties and abolishes the martial exemption in relation to rape; the enactment of a pension Act in 1990 which provides that every pension scheme and every other scheme providing any kind of occupational benefits payable on termination of service or interruption of service by reason of sickness, shall comply with the principle of equality treatment; the enactment in 1991 of new legislation to protect part-time workers, the majority of whom are women; the continued promotion of equal opportunities in our educational system; measures include the existence of specific working groups within the Department of Education aimed at eliminating sexism and sex stereotyping in post primary schools and, with the same objective, the review of the primary curriculum handbook by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment; the introduction of a new carer's allowance in the 1990 budget payable in respect of certain relatives who care on a full-time basis at home for relatives who are permanently ill and elderly persons; the extension of the carer's allowance in the 1991 budget to include carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance; the special allocation of £0.5 million in the 1990 budget for programmes for women, which was repeated in 1991 and again this year; only last week, my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare invited applications for assistance for this year's scheme of grants for locally based women's groups, and I know that Deputies on all sides of the House have acknowledged the very worth-while benefits the scheme brings by way of seed funding to women's self-help groups; a special tax allowance for widowed parents with dependent children, to apply for the three years following that in which the spouse died, and the extension of payment of the higher <Col N="633" /> rate of monthly child benefit to include the fourth child in each family.</P>
    <P>What I have attempted to do in the foregoing is to give the House a flavour of the types of initiatives taken to promote the status of women in our society, but it is no more than a flavour, and I am happy to inform the House that I will &mdash; within two to three months at the outside &mdash; be in a position to publish and submit a detailed report on the equality initiatives taken by all Government Ministers and all Government Departments since September 1988. My predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, had published a first report covering initiatives up to that time. My first act when only recently appointed Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs was to arrange for the priority publication of a second report and this is now in train.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I am happy to anticipate criticism from the other side of the House which would point to the more than three-year time lag since the last report.  In the debate last evening, Deputies Taylor and Barnes very rightly emphasised the crucial need to change attitudes if we are to promote <i>de facto</i> equality between the sexes.  I fully agree with this viewpoint and I believe that one key component in the changing of attitudes and in sensitising all our citizens to equality issues is by means of communicating what is going on and what is being planned across the whole spectrum of Government activities.  For this reason, I am happy to inform the House of my intention not only to publish a comprehensive overview of equality initiatives taken since 1988, but to continue this communication process by means of annual updates and publications for the future.</P>
    <P>In the short time since I have been appointed to my office, I have also established a new tier or structure within the overall Government machinery.  In my message to Irish women on the occasion of the United Nations International Women's Day last Sunday, I pledged to establish a strong and formal liaison with all Government Ministers and to ensure that the interests and concerns of Irish <Col N="634" /> women are reflected in the schemes administered by them and the policy proposals being advanced by them.  I also emphasised my willingness and commitment to act as an effective channel for conveying their considered views on issues across the Government system as a whole.</P>
    <P>In order to give practical expression to the pledge I have made to Irish women, I have already established an interdepartmental committee on women's affairs, comprised of senior civil servants, who will serve to inform me of all policy initiatives being undertaken by Government Departments.  In this way, I hope to be in a position to exercise a strong pro-active role in integrating the concerns and interests of women into all such initiatives as they proceed through the normal policy making steps of Government.</P>
    <P>But, clearly, I can only exercise this role if I have the staff resources to support me.  Here again, I think the House should accept the practical commitment of this Government to promote equality between the sexes as expressed by the fact that, since my appointment, the Taoiseach has increased the number of staff reporting to me specifically on women's issues by three.  The Taoiseach himself announced this increase in staffing resources to the House on 25 February and I can inform the House that the extra staff involve an assistant principal officer, an administrative officer and an executive officer.  I am confident that these additional resources will enable me to carry out my functions effectively and to the concrete benefit of Irish women over time.</P>
    <P>In my remarks last year I spoke of the pivotal role which my office and the Second Commission on the Status of Women could play in securing the objectives which are now being sought by the Bill before us, in so far as discrimination between the sexes is concerned.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy Taylor seriously downgrade the importance of the second commission in his contribution last night.  Not alone do I believe that his remarks fly against the <Col N="635" /> views of all women's groups in our society, who universally approved of the second commission's establishment in November 1990, but I also believe that the Deputy's allegations of inaction which, he implied, underpinned the establishment of the second commission simply do not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I say this because, almost uniquely in so far as the deliberations of Government commissions are concerned, the Second Commission on the Status of Women decided not to wait for their 18 months mandate to expire before putting their own stamp on the equality debate, the Second Commission published their first statement containing seven interim recommendations.  These seven recommendations addressed issues of key concern to Irish women, including the ownership of the family home; the appointment of more women to State boards; equality proofing in memoranda submitted to Government; the withholding of national lottery funds from private sporting, social or recreational clubs which operate discriminatory policies; the appointment of a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee for the most senior posts in the Civil Service; age limits; and sexism in primary education.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree with me when I say that Deputy Taylor, in suggesting that the Second Commission on the Status of Women was a receipe for inaction, was conveniently ignoring the fact that all seven interim recommendations of the commission were immediately accepted by this Government and are being progressively implemented, including the appointment of a woman to the Top Level Appointments Committee which is being pursued by the Taoiseach.  In ignoring this reality, Deputy Taylor is not simply refusing to give the Government credit where credit is due.  He is, in fact, performing a disservice to the second commission and to the wide range of expertise across all sections of our society which is represented on the second commission.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the House that, <Col N="636" /> before deciding what elements of the Bill before us warrant our considered attention, what we need is precisely the considered opinion of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, having regard to the very expertise which is available within their membership.  The very complex and wide-ranging Bill before us has already been submitted to the second commission by the Labour Party.  The second commission is chaired by an eminent High Court judge, Justice Mella Carroll.  They include among their ranks the chairwoman of the Employment Equality Agency, Catherine McGuinness, who is an eminent lawyer in her own right.  They also include the chairwoman and chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.  The second commission are reporting not in two years time, but within a matter of some three months.  They are charged in their terms of reference with the task of recommending the means by which women will be able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in economic, social, political and cultural life.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, and particularly in view of the imminent report of the second commission, I suggest to the House that it would defy all reason to give serious consideration to this catch-all measure proposed by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister of State for Women's Affairs I have no hesitation in saying that much remains to be done to secure real equality between the sexes, notwithstanding the structures put in place by this Government and the many initiatives taken by them since 1989.  With the full support of the Taoiseach, I propose to use all the resources at my disposal to secure sustained progress in this area by ensuring that women's concerns, women's interests, women's aspirations and indeed women's apprehensions are conveyed across the Government system.</P>
    <P>I agree with the contributions made last evening which emphasised the need for a change in attitudes; for more positive action in favour of women in the employment and other fields; for a greater recognition of the dual responsibilities <Col N="637" /> of parents in the home; and for practical support for women wishing to return to the labour force by such means as the progressive provision of training and childcare.  I will place a particular emphasis in my own work on these issues.</P>
    <P>I unreservedly condemn the odious practice of many, but by no means all, private sporting and recreational clubs which, on the one hand, willingly accept subscriptions from women to bolster their financial resources while, on the other, offensively exclude these women from the option of full membership of their clubs.  I believe that such a patronising stance is no longer tenable in an Ireland which is fast approaching the next millennium.  It represents an affront not just to all women, but also to the vast majority of men who are committed to the principle of equality and who also take exception to the fact that certain forces in our society continue to deliberately restrict the opportunities available to their partners, their mothers, their daughters or their sisters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I can inform the House that, last December, my office requested the advice of the Attorney General as to the status of Ireland's outstanding reservations to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  One of these reservations refers to the question addressed by the Bill before us, namely discrimination in the field of goods, facilities and services, sports and other forms of recreational activity.  I can assure the Deputies opposite that, if the Attorney's advice suggests that specific legislation is required in this area, I will be happy to bring forward proposals to Government for approval as a priority.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am unable to support the Bill before us for the detailed reasons I have outlined in this contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and indeed the House for allowing me to share his time.  This Bill attempts to do too much too quickly and in so doing will pose a threat to the effective operations of well established mechanisms and procedures. <Col N="638" /> The Bill over-emphasises the efficiency of legislative enforcement in combating discrimination.  Despite the increased participation by women in the workplace &mdash; and the existence of laws prohibiting discrimination at work based on gender &mdash; major differences still exist in the treatment of men and women in employment.  These differences relate to the distribution of work and pay structures. Although the new generation of Irish women are well educated in a broad range of disciplines, the majority of those in employment are in traditionally female occupations which offer limited prospects for career advancement.</P>
      <P>It has already been noticed that women are grossly under-represented at management level; it has also been recognised that legislation and the monitoring of same is not sufficient to eliminate discrimination against women.  The levels of women's employment in many countries is worsening yet all these countries possess the basic statutory framework so, obviously, we need a more radical and fundamental change.  Real change can only be brought about by a change in attitudes.  This will necessitate a change in social attitudes by women towards themselves and towards other women and by men towards women and indeed towards themselves.</P>
      <P>Equal opportunity is not just a woman's issue, it affects the whole community, the fear that equal opportunity is giving an unfair advantage to women and, therefore, is a disadvantage to the male workforce must be eliminated.  To form a whole society approach is to the benefit of all those who wish to take part in work, both male and female.  It makes good business sense to encourage and insist that all employees should develop their full potential which, again, necessitates the promotion of motivation and the concept of affiliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in 1989, through the State-sponsored bodies, put a positive action programme in place which was also designed to encourage leadership in the private sector.  This was done through policy formation, training, monitoring and evaluation and sought to introduce <Col N="639" /> flexible working arrangements to allow for the reconciliation of professional and family responsibilities.  With regard to the last point, it is essential that properly standardised child care facilities are provided and that they are accessible and affordable.  I encourage the Government to follow the EC recommendation on child care which was adopted last month by the Council of Ministers.  I recognise that this was a recommendation, not a directive, and, like every other Member in the House, I recognise that a recommendation does not necesarily imply an obligation on the part of the Government. I hope that the Government will be encouraged to implement the recommendation with regard to child care because providing such child care facilities gives practical help to the many women who would like to play a part in the workforce but cannot because of the lack of such facilities.</P>
    <P>Training and education play a major role in trying to get rid of any discrimination based on gender.  It is well known that positive action programmes embody a demonstration effect; this is where pioneering women, performing successfully in non-traditional occupations and at management level, pave the way for more women to follow their lead.</P>
    <P>I am sure we would all like to praise the great work which FÁS have done for women; their programmes have indeed given greater opportunities to women and to their participants generally.  They have encouraged women to enter a broader range of occupations.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the NOW initiative which aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training, lending practical and immediate help to many women already in the workplace or who wish to enter it, or to give help to those who wish to return to the workplace.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the whole area of sexual harassment and to mention the Rubenstein Report which has correctly identified sexual harassment as an <Col N="640" /> obstacle to the proper integration of women in the labour market.  I am, therefore, surprised that sexual harassment is not explicitly referred to in the Bill before us.  If it had been incorporated in the Bill it would have been a tremendous advance on the Employment Equality Act, 1977. I am disappointed that it has not been referred to.  However, I am pleased to note that during the Irish Presidency of the EC, a resolution was adopted in May 1990 by the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs which led to a code of practice on the subject of sexual harassment. That was published on 4 December 1991.  Because of this publication the ICTU and the FIE have taken practical steps to ensure that their members are fully informed on the issue.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this Bill, however well meaning, lumps too much together and, therefore, the fundamentals are in danger of being lost.  It is cumbersome and could well be bureaucratic. A far more positive approach can be found in consensus between the social partners and in harnessing the careful deliberation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  All Members, particularly women, know that change is slow but I ask the Government to continue their consistent efforts to eliminate discrimination in employment.  This can be done by achieving a fine balance between legislation and other promotional and educative policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fairly ambitious Bill which contains a number of inadequacies to which I propose to refer initially.  Nevertheless, it seeks to tackle an area which has been comprehensively neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more unfortunate aspects of the Bill is that it continues to use the legal word &ldquo;he&rdquo; even though many Deputies have indicated on more than one occasion that whatever about the legal status of the word &ldquo;he&rdquo; in our current legislation, one would expect a Bill which deals with the question of equal status to use the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; as well.  As I said, this issue should not be overlooked in terms of how we address the question <Col N="641" /> of equal status. Of course, the Bill does not merely address the issue of equal status for women; it deals with a much wider range of issues.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other deficiencies in the Bill.  Section 38 (3) (d) would appear to perpetuate discrimination in education on the grounds of age.  This is unfortunate because given the structure of our population this will become much more of a problem.  We should avoid adding to this discrimination at all costs, particularly as it is linked to the issue of discrimination against women who for a long time were discriminated against in the Civil Service.  Women in the Civil Service had to retire from work as soon as they married and in many cases could only return to work late in life.  In terms of improving their education, this would also discriminate against them because in many cases women like to rear their families before returning to education. This is an issue which should be addressed on Committee Stage, which I hope we reach.</P>
    <P>The exemption for private clubs under section 45 is unfortunate.  I realise that this is a difficult area to address but the Bill refuses to face the fact that some of these clubs hold very powerful positions and influence, for example, the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club.  Sections 45 (2) and (3) do not deal adequately with the discrimination which exists in clubs.  The second exemption simply perpetuates a fairly invidious kind of discrimination. The question has to be asked: how can women ever participate in football teams if they are discriminated against in the first instance? It is a vicious circle which needs to be broken.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with discrimination and proposes to make discrimination unlawful in certain circumstances.  It approaches the issue of discrimination from the point of view of equal opportunity.  From a socialist point of view, I have to say that equal opportunity is not sufficient.  We also have to address the question of equal access because in many respects simply having equal opportunity, whether one is disabled, a woman or a traveller, does not <Col N="642" /> guarantee that the discrimination will be removed.  The question of access and giving preferential treatment, reverse discrimination, to a number of sectors of our community must be seriously taken on board.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill falls down on a number of points.  Having said that, it is an ambitious Bill which seeks to address the problem of discrimination under a very wide variety of headings &mdash; sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, age, handicap, religion, race or membership of the travelling community. This Bill should have been introduced by the Government.  The Labour Party are to be congratulated for their initiative in bringing the Bill forward.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not possible to end prejudices which lead to discrimination by legislation alone.  This can be done only by a process of education in an attempt to change social attitudes.  It must be said that many of our major institutions have an important role to play in changing social attitudes.  I would argue that Churches in particular have a role to play in this regard in Irish society. The statement by the Roman Catholic Bishops today on the question of abortion is not at all helpful in that regard.  Instead of giving a lead in terms of this issue it seems that the Roman Catholic Church are trying to retrench and batten down the hatches and in some way warn legislators that they may not step over a certain threshold.  Given this strength and role, I believe the Roman Catholic Church and the other Churches in our society, as well as politicians of whatever political hue, have a special and specific responsibility to give a lead in this area.</P>
    <P>It is possible through legislation to make sure that actual discrimination is made unlawful and that potential victims of discrimination are afforded the protection of the law.  Over the years, attempts have been made to deal with problems of discrimination by measures such as the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Prohibition of Incitment of Racial Hatred Act, 1989.  This <Col N="643" /> Bill seeks to fill many of the gaps which remain in this area.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation is inadequate in many respects.  For example, I understand that no prosecutions have yet been taken under the Prohibition of Incitement of Racial Hatred Act since its enactment two years ago.  Yet statements continue to be made which sail very close to the wind and articles continue to be published which reflect the most offensive form of locker room racial prejudice. For example, last year, at the height of the Gulf War, one columnist in a Dublin evening newspaper wrote an article in which he referred to &ldquo;sand-for-brains Jordanians&rdquo; and made derogatory references to the Muslim religion.  The article was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decided that it did not constitute a breach of the Prohibition of Incitement of Racial Hatred Act even though section 2 of that Act specifically says, &ldquo;it shall be an offence to publish or distribute written material if it is threatening, abusive, insulting and intended to, or having regard to all the circumstances, likely to stir up hatred&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irish people are quite rightly indignant about insulting references to Irish people when they appear in the British media. We have a responsibility to ensure that our media is not used to stir up racial hatred against other nationalities or intolerance against other religions.  Imagine our reaction if a London evening newspaper had referred to &ldquo;bogs for brains Irish&rdquo;.  We cannot, on the one hand, complain about offensive racial comments about Irish people and, on the other, turn a blind eye to similarly offensive attitudes on our own doorstep.</P>
    <P>As a society we sometimes tend to clap ourselves on the back and say there is little or no racial prejudice in Ireland. Unlike many other European countries the number of people of other races living among us is quite small.  Therefore, our attitudes are not put to the test all that much.  However, the way in which we deal with the small number of illegal aliens of other races living in this country reflects a more underlying level of intolerance <Col N="644" /> and prejudice.  The approach of the aliens section of the Department of Justice is quite appalling, and illegal immigrants are shown no tolerance whatsoever. People in this position can be arrested and held in custody pending deportation, without any entitlement to legal aid or advice.  If the tens of thousands of Irish illegals in the United States were dealt with in a similar manner there would quite rightly be an outcry.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw to the Minister's attention the report of the European Parliament whose committee of inquiry on racism and xenophobia made some very interesting recommendations in relation to Ireland as well as to member states generally.  It pointed out, for instance, that Ireland was the only European country that had not yet signed the United Nations Convention on Discrimination, and recommended more than a year ago that we should do so.  I am pleased to note that the Minister has finally indicated in the House that the areas which prevent us from ratifying that convention have been identified &mdash; I understand that we have signed it but it has not been ratified. I hope that the Minister will move as quickly as is practical to eliminate those final obstacles to the signing of that convention.</P>
    <P>The report analysed the degree to which discrimination on racial grounds existed in each member state and pointed out that Ireland was remarkably free of such discrimination.  However it indicated that that was probably primarily because there were only about 18,000 non-EC people living in Ireland.  It listed the incidents of discrimination that have been reported in recent years such as discrimination against a Moroccan family and the refusal of a Dublin hotel to allow travelling people to enter it.  The report took the view that precisely because we had such a small non-EC population to accommodate in Irish society the number of incidents therefore indicated that there was a basis for concern about discrimination on racial or indeed religious grounds.  It was felt that steps should be taken to ensure that we dealt with the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> I do not propose to read all the recommendations for member states &mdash; there are about 20 in all &mdash; but it is interesting to note a number of them.  Recommendation No. 51 specifically referred to the only member state that has not ratified the United Nations convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination, that is Ireland.  No. 52 recommended that an anti-discrimination law be enacted condemning all racist acts and enabling legal persons such as associations to bring prosecutions for racist acts or appear as joint plaintiffs. No. 54 recommended that member states take the necessary measures to ensure that an immigrant population has access, within a reasonable period, to legal status as residents and workers.  No. 57 recommended that member states work against the ghettoisation of their ethnic minorities and adapt their housing policies to provide inexpensive and adequate housing to encourage integration. Obviously that recommendation could very well apply to Ireland's travelling community.</P>
    <P>No. 62 recommended that member states adopt measures to permit the application for nationality by immigrants who have legally resided in the Community for a continuous period of five years, keeping the costs and administrative procedures to a minimum and permitting applicants for citizenship to maintain passive citizenship in their country of origin where loss of citizenship would entail problems in relation to ownership of property, inheritance and so on, and to give those born in a member state the nationality of that state at birth.  No. 64 recommended that member states consider granting the right to vote and stand at least in local elections, first, to all Community citizens and then to all legal immigrants with five years continuous residence in the country.  No. 66 recommended that member states respect the traditional way of life of gypsy and other travelling communities, encouraging the provision of the necessary facilities to make this possible at external frontiers as well as within the Community.</P>
    <P>No. 71 recommended that member <Col N="646" /> states introduce teaching against racism into the curriculum of their primary schools as a compulsory subject. No. 72 recommended that member states adopt policies enabling children from the majority population and from ethnic minorities to be educated together. No. 73 recommended that member states step up the support that education systems can provide for the campaign against racism, anti-semitism and xenophobia through the teaching of human rights and history at school, through teacher training and through university research.  These are just a number of the recommendations from the Committee on Racism and Xenophobia in which I had the honour to participate.  It would be well worth while for this House to take on board these recommendations and implement them in legislation.</P>
    <P>Our attitudes in relation to homosexuals need to be addressed by Irish society in a very calm and urgent way.  I do not think we can draw comfort from the attitudes we have shown to our travelling community or indeed homosexuals. Irish citizens are still refused service in public houses and in shops by virtue of the fact that they are members of the travelling community, a situation which is quite unacceptable and which should be made unlawful under this Bill. We are almost the only remaining European country which regards homosexual activities between consenting adults as a criminal offence.  It is three and a half years since the European Court of Human Rights found that the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861, were a breach of human rights.  Yet we are still waiting for amending legislation.  That legislation was promised by the last Government, it was promised again in December 1990 by the then Minister for Justice and again in the review of the Programme for Government, but there is still no sign of it.  The latest information from the Minister for Justice in reply to my question of 4 February last was that legislation was expected by the end of this year.  I would ask the Minister to accept that it is time that Irish society and this House stopped <Col N="647" /> treating adult homosexuals as criminals or potential criminals.  This sort of foot-dragging is simply not good enough.  The fact that the law may not be used very often is no excuse.  As long as that law remains on the Statute Book those against whom it is directed are discriminated against and indeed live in fear and this country remains in breach of internationally accepted standards of human rights.</P>
    <P>The group in Irish society who are most frequently disadvantaged and who suffer discrimination most often are not the minority; it is the 51 per cent of the population who are female.  I listened to the speech of the Minister for Labour last night which gave a glowing account of the position of women in Irish society.  I found it hard to relate that speech to the real world inhabited by Irish women. Almost 20 years after the enactment of the anti-discrimination pay legislation the gap between male and female pay is still huge &mdash; more than £100 per week.  In June 1991 the average male industrial wage was £269.90 per week while the figure for women was £161.14. Female weekly earnings represent less than 60 per cent of male earnings.  This is almost exactly the same ratio as ten years ago. The existing legislative framework is simply not adequate to even narrow not to mention eliminate the gap.</P>
    <P>Decisions are made every day in every walk of life which have a particular impact on the position of women.  Yet as often as not women have no input into the decision-making process.  Women constitute only 14 per cent of the total membership of State boards.  Of the 200 State boards 69 have no women members. Currently there is no woman Secretary of a Government Department and no women have reached the top in local government administration.  While two thirds of the clerical and administrative employees in local government are women, no woman has been appointed a county manager, an assistant county manager, a county secretary or a finance officer.  Women are grossly under-represented <Col N="648" /> in the House, with only one member of the Government being a woman.  That is a problem that needs to be addressed by all parties, including those of us on this side of the House. Indeed, as everyone knows, there is no woman TD in either the Labour Party or my party.  It is obvious that we have to address that issue.  A proposal in the formation of my new party is to incorporate immediately a gender quota in relation to election to executive bodies and for candidates for local, Dáil and European elections.</P>
    <P>There are many important lessons to be learned from the developments of the past 20 years since the first Commission on the Status of Women assessed the position of women in Irish society and made a number of recommendations. Perhaps the most important lesson is that specific steps must be taken to redress inequalities that do not disappear of their own accord.  That is very clear when one reads the recommendations of the first commission.  By and large, the areas in which there has been little or no progress are those in which either no particular remedial measure was suggested or no particular mechanism for change was established on foot of the recommendations made.</P>
    <P>Another lesson is that any legislation designed to deal with discrimination and remove inequalities must be exceptionally tightly drafted if it is to be effective, otherwise loopholes will be found and exploited and good intentions circumvented by many of those at whom the legislation is directed.</P>
    <P>The other major lesson is that however effective the legislation might be, in the sense that it compels even the most unwilling to cease sex discrimination, much more than legislation is required to place men and women on a genuinely equal playing pitch.</P>
    <P>Our party's commitment to women's equality is part of a broader commitment to social progress and betterment of all those men and women who are disadvantaged or discriminated against.  My aim, and the aim of my party, is to build a society that will bring freedom, equality <Col N="649" /> and betterment for everybody, regardless of sex, status in terms of employment, religion or any handicap, whether mental or physical.</P>
    <P>If the Bill was enacted as it stands it would constitute a considerable move forward in regard to ending discrimination in a wide range of areas.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned that I felt there were several gaps in the Bill.  The question of age is one of them.  It may still be possible for women to be discriminated against on the basis of age in entering education.</P>
    <P>There is also no obligation in the Bill on advertisers to avoid sexism in their advertisements.  My belief is that advertising is a potent factor in the maintenance of sexist attitudes in Irish society. As the advertising industry is self-regulatory, it is important for us to impose statutory obligations under this Bill in order to ensure that the industry avoids the worst excesses of that form of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Payment of compensation for loss of jobs is not an adequate response to the question of discrimination in jobs.  Too often young people, both men and women, who lose their jobs, take a case to the Labour Court and end up with perhaps a few hundred pounds or even a few thousand pounds in compensation but no job.  In most cases the person concerned took his or her case to court in order to try to hold on to a job, not merely to get a few hundred pounds.  It is important that we try to ensure that there is an obligation on employers found to have dismissed a person improperly to restore that person to his or her job rather than simply back out of that on the basis of making a payment of a few hundred pounds.  The other eventuality that has to be legislated against is the procedure whereby some companies against whom cases have been successfully taken simply go into liquidation and re-form under another name, thereby avoiding their obligations under the results of a court case.</P>
    <P>There are many issues that need to be examined.  The Bill has attempted to cover a wide area and any criticisms I <Col N="650" /> make of it are aimed not so much as an attack on the Bill but as an attempt to indicate ways in which I feel it might be improved.</P>
    <P>The cop-out factor incorporated in this Bill that allows an employer to discriminate against a handicapped person on the grounds that the cost involved might be prohibitive is one that would be turned into a fairly wide loophole if it was enacted.  That provision should be eliminated or, certainly, circumscribed. As we know, in the labour market, with unemployment running close to 300,000, there is a very real problem for people with a physical handicap to get employment and if they lose their job it is virtually impossible for them to get another job.  The public service has traditionally been considered as an organisation in which people with a physical handicap have a hope of getting jobs but the public service are not taking on as many people as before.  That issue needs to be addressed, not so much from the point of view of legislating against discrimination but to positively discriminate in favour of people with a physical handicap; in favour of women, who have been traditionally discriminated against, and in favour of many sectors of society, such as travellers, who have been specifically discriminated against in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The New Agenda will be voting for the Bill.  I hope the drafters of the Bill will take the criticisms I made in the spirit in which they are intended.</P>

      <P>The concept of equality of opportunity between men and women has been enshrined in law for over 15 years.  Yet the experience across the European Community has clearly shown that translating those legal rights into reality is difficult.  Nonetheless considerable progress has been recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> Legislation relating to employment equality is contained in the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 established a legal right to equal remuneration where women and men employed by the same employer in the same place are doing &ldquo;like work&rdquo;.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, makes it unlawful to discriminate on grounds of sex or marital status in relation to access to employment, conditions of employment, training or experience relating to employment, promotion, regarding or classification of posts.  That is the law. Yet on a weekly basis people must take cases against their employers pressing for their rights, some 20 years after some Acts were passed.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of employment equality legislation the position of women in the market place has improved.  Yet there is no doubt that further progress is necessary if the current imbalances in the labour market are to be eliminated.  Legislation alone is not enough.  Most women still work for less money and in jobs with poorer prospects than men.  Average female hourly wages in manufacturing industry are still only 68 per cent of those of men.  However, it must also be remembered that figures for average industrial earnings relate only to the small and declining proportion of women working in manufacturing industry &mdash; about 20 per cent of the total industrial workforce in 1992, compared with 24 per cent in 1971.  Women still work mainly in &ldquo;female-only&rdquo; jobs, and very few women make it even into middle management, let alone top management. This is a sheer waste of talent and skills. We cannot afford this waste if we are to make the most of the opportunities ahead in the Single Market.  We need a committed, motivated workforce with everyone keen to operate to the best of their ability, not only for the sake of the nation but on a humanitarian, purely personal development basis.</P>
    <P>Improved legislation has an important role to play in overcoming present imbalances. <Col N="652" /> The Minister for Labour is committed to introducing a Bill to amend the legislation later this year.  To achieve progress positive action initiatives which complement the legislation are of the essence.  Institutional measures have a role to play in countering inequality in the labour market.  Training and education are necessary to stimulate and further the development of increased access to employment particularly for women whose skills need upgrading, and for those re-entering the labour force taking into account new technologies and industrial developments; to progressively eliminate traditional role stereotyping in curricula and to provide a full range of educational and training choices for women and men, both for further education and skill qualifications for employment.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, it is ongoing Government policy to eliminate sexism and sex-stereotyping.  This is stressed at &ldquo;pre-service&rdquo; and &ldquo;in-service&rdquo; training courses for teachers.  The issue has been examined in the context of a review of the curriculum at first and second levels. Yet very few girls enter what would be considered &ldquo;male only&rdquo; occupations, such as engineering, fitting, mechanical engineering and so on, much of it due probably to peer pressure but also to lack of encouragement of girls.  The level of sexism and sex-stereotyping in textbooks and teaching materials at primary level is being examined.  Girls are being encouraged to take up non-traditional subject choices.  Subject availability and choice play an important role in influencing career decisions, a development much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the training area, FÁS, through their positive action programmes, actively seek to promote equality of opportunity for women.  They have adopted a specific equality policy for their activities.  They promote women's access to non-traditional areas of work, for instance, through programmes to encourage women to gain skills in the new technologies. More broadly, they promote women's participation at all levels of the labour market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> Apart from the direct advantage of these positive efforts to enable women to enter non-traditional work areas and reach the top levels in their occupations, these policies embody a &ldquo;demonstration effect&rdquo; in that the presence of women in sufficiently large numbers, performing successfully in non-traditional occupations and at management level, paves the way for more women to move forward. FÁS, through their range of training and apprenticeship schemes, seek to provide the opportunities women need to extend their career choices and improve their occupational mobility.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise the important role the social partners must play in the achievement of equality in employment.  The Federation of Irish Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have developed important guidelines on several aspects of employment equality.  The level of collaboration between Government and social partners is an important factor in promoting equality in the workplace and is reflected in their membership of very many of the important public bodies who have a role in that aspect of public policy.  The FIE issued policy guidelines on equal opportunities and sexual harassment to their member companies in 1990, the ICTU already having had such policies for some years.</P>
    <P>Organisations today must be open to change, particularly in this increasingly open and competitive market environment. Therefore, it is important for individual employers to review labour market policies and to develop work-forces which enhance their competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Adopting a positive approach to employing women is sound business sense.  It will help to build a pool of employees with suitable skills and qualifications and, equally important, to retain those employees in whom they have made a considerable investment in recruitment and training.</P>
    <P>In order that positive action initiatives at enterprise level can succeed, senior management must be committed to the theory that equal opportunities is not <Col N="654" /> only a right for all workers but is necessary in order to ensure that the human resources of a company are given every chance to develop and to contribute effectively.  Commitment is not established if management just &ldquo;says it&rdquo;; there must be commitment to finding the means to achieve it.  Responsibility for the policy must be allocated to a high level manager.  Senior management must be encouraged to adopt a pro-active approach to progress equal opportunities, rather than merely confirming their efforts to compliance with legislation. The Government recognise the important leadership role the public sector can play in relation to new concepts of positive action.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Government have given a number of commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  In particular the Government gave a commitment to a policy of substantially raising recruitment age limits throughout the public sector having regard, however, to the need to hold competitions for school leavers, trainees and graduates.  This commitment has been implemented in relation to the Civil Service, local authorities and health boards.  As a result, age limits for many posts in these public sector organisations are now 50 years.  This type of approach is more appropriate than the legislative approach adopted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> also provides for the introduction of childcare facilities on a progressive basis in the public sector, with the State providing the physical facilities and staff paying running costs. In the context of the Civil Service it is hoped to open the first crèche in coming months.</P>
    <P>Women are under-represented in decision-making.  Recognising this fact, the Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that as the boards of State-sponsored bodies are reconstituted or set up, Government policy should guarantee a minimum of 40 per cent of both men and women among direct Government nominees.  The Government are committed to <Col N="655" /> implementing this recommendation as far as is practicable.  I go further than that: I contend that the boards of every State or semi-State body should be comprised of equal numbers of men and women.  In this day and age, after 20 years or more of what was supposed to have been, and what I hope will be in the future, free secondary education, I am not convinced there have not developed in our society women of outstanding ability who should be appointed to the boards of such semi-State bodies.  After all we saw recently an example of male-dominated boards who, to put it mildly, did not distinguish themselves in their decision-making.  Perhaps 50 per cent of women serving on such boards might have brought an air of reality into their deliberations.</P>
    <P>The active participation of women in the decision-making process is one effective way of achieving equality of opportunity between men and women and of bringing about a lasting change in attitudes. For example, workplaces and board rooms would benefit from an input of women's skills and abilities.  Equally important, the specific interests and needs of women in employment would be addressed more comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The Employment Act, 1977, provided for the establishment of the Employment Equality Agency.  The main functions of the Agency are to work towards the elimination of discrimination in employment; to promote equality of opportunity in employment between men and women; and to keep under review the operation of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and, where necessary, to make proposals for amending either or both of those Acts.</P>
    <P>The EEA discharge this function through the development of positive approaches to equality at organisation level in the public and private sector.  In particular, the EEA provide advice and assistance to various public and private sector companies in drawing up equal opportunity policies and statements and on methods of developing actions <Col N="656" /> designed to improve the balance of male and female participation in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The EEA are active in promoting networking among State-sponsored bodies. Five networks classified on the basis of size and type of business are now in operation. The EEA provide support as required.  The progress made by the organisations actively participating in networking underlines the value of this initiative and should serve to encourage the less active ones to reconsider their level of activity and commitment.  Networks function as support groups, educational forums, and meeting places for women who aspire to power in business and the professions.  Women teaming together consciously in groups which stress professionalism can learn through experimental techniques the responsible uses of power.  The Employment Equality Agency provide advice and assistance to persons who believe they may have experienced discriminatory treatment in their job or a job they have applied for.</P>
    <P>In summing up it must be emphasised that the specific issue of equality in employment is best served by ensuring that women: have the skills needed to obtain employment in the higher paying sectors of the workforce; are given appropriate training to allow them to advance and be promoted within employment; and a variety of working arrangements are afforded to men and women which will allow them to participate in the workforce in a way which meets their varied needs and which permits role reciprocation and the breakdown of traditional attitudes and work patterns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was originally presented on 10 April 1990.  It has been overtaken to a significant degree by some statutory and non-statutory developments in the interim.  It has been overtaken for instance by the Pensions Act, 1990, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, all of which received support from all sides of this House, although with a certain amount of criticism in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> Since the Bill was introduced the most significant development was the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women in 1990.  That illustrated the importance of non-statutory measures.  The commission had a wide ranging mandate and they were charged with making recommendations to the Government on the means by which women would be better able to participate on equal terms in employment. The commission's terms of reference incorporated two main elements.  They were to review the implementation of the recommendations of the first commission and they were to produce new recommendations for consideration and implementation.</P>
    <P>The commission have already made considerable strides in discharging their task within their allocated time.  They issued their first interim report in April 1991, identifying a series of recommendations which complement the thrust of Government policy as outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>It seems that the re-emergence of the Labour Party Bill at this stage could be portrayed as being some semblance of an attempt to pre-empt recommendations in the commission's final report which is due out in July next.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night the Minister suggested that catch-all measures along the lines proposed in this Bill could deflect attention from real problems of equality and inequality.  There is a strong case for awaiting the outcome of the deliberations of the second commission. To proceed as the Bill proposes puts inordinate emphasis on the role of legislation as a catalyst and an instrument for change.  The commission's approach as reflected in their first statement in April 1991 is evidence of a more rounded perspective. The reality is that discrimination, whether based on gender, age, creed or colour, is fundamentally stupid and one cannot really legislate against stupidity.  The positive outlook of the second commission is reflected in the Government's view that while legislation has a crucial role to play in achieving <Col N="658" /> equal opportunities in employment, it needs to be complemented by positive action and initiatives in the workplace. One area where initiatives are needed and are being taken is in training.  In this area FÁS have quite properly expanded opportunities, opportunities specifically for women, to take up careers in non-traditional areas.  This has been achieved through the FÁS positive action programme, a programme which includes amongst its features precise target setting and pre-apprenticeship courses.  All concerned with it are to be complimented. The initiatives being taken by FAS are supported on all sides of the House.  A range of practical actions designed to contribute towards a better balance of men and women in the labour force are being developed by this FÁS programme.</P>
    <P>Measures to assist married women to return to employment is another important area, because for many years we had this extraordinary discrimination of the marriage bar.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants for training courses should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce. The Government are taking steps to give effect to this.</P>
    <P>As a result of this combination of initiatives the level of women's participation in FÁS programmes continues to increase annually.  In 1971 only 5 per cent of all FÁS trainees were women. The figure for 1991 was 42 per cent.  We are approaching the target of equality.</P>
    <P>Promoting equal opportunity in the public service is another commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The public service can be a proving ground for new concepts of positive action.  The public service, because it is the public service, has an obligation to give leadership in this area.  The process of monitoring equality of opportunity initiatives was started in the Civil Service by the unions and management in 1987 and it continues.  In 1989 this process was extended to the State-sponsored bodies and in accordance with commitments <Col N="659" /> given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the monitoring process has been extended to the health boards and the local authorities. The Government and the public service have a role in giving a lead to the private sector.  In fairness, in recent years, there has been a realisation that this is the case. Within the private sector, a number of companies are operating positive action programmes, and support and guidance in this area are being provided on a practical basis by the ICTU and the FIE. There is some official support for the scheme in the form of the Minister for Labour's award, the Equality Focus Award Scheme.  The idea is at workplace level to focus attention on operating as a catalyst for change at this level.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to a particular type of discrimination which I regard as being odious.  This was discrimination which existed throughout the public sector by dint of artificially low age limits on public sector recruitment.  One of the good elements of this Bill is that it proposes to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of age except in specific circumstances.  As was said by the previous speaker, the Government have taken a number of very important steps in this area on a non-statutory basis and have moved to introduce more realistic age limits, thereby giving job opportunities to long term unemployed people and to women who may have left the labour force and wish to come back into the public service, without militating unduly against new entrants.  The Government are committed to equal opportunities in all areas of employment irrespective of age or gender.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for affording me the opportunity of raising <Col N="660" /> this matter in the House.  I am also grateful to the Minister for taking time to come to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not raise this matter lightly.  As well as being a Member of this House, I am also Mayor of Limerick and it was after some soul-searching that I as first citizen of the city, decided to raise this matter on the floor of Dáil Éireann.  It is a measure of my frustration as first citizen that I have been forced to raise the matter in this drastic way.</P>
      <P>This matter has been on my conscience since I became Mayor of Limerick eight months ago.  As a person who is concerned about housing working people in my native city I felt bad that I was unable to relet houses in Glenagross Park, Moyross. This weighed heavily on me and I regard it as an indictment of myself, my fellow councillors and my city that we have not been able to tackle this matter.</P>
      <P>Moyross is the largest housing estate in Limerick and is situated on the north side of the city.  There are more than 1,200 houses in the estate.  There are 294 houses in the Glenagross Park section of which 70 are boarded up.  These houses were built approximately 15 years ago and they would cost between £35,000 to £40,000 each on the open market.  This is an area of very high unemployment with about 80 per cent being unemployed and the percentage is even higher among early school leavers.  Glue sniffing is rampant. The young boys who sniff glue have low self-esteem and little self-confidence. They also drink wine and cider in the area.</P>
      <P>Approximately 70 houses have been vandalised in the area.  Some have been burned out and it is like a sight from Beirut.  The estate is situated in a lovely part of Limerick, in the shadow of the Clare hills, a very salubrious area bordering County Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than 100 families have been intimidated into leaving their houses.  A small group of young people who are usually high from glue-sniffing and the effects of intoxicating drink call on the occupied houses at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.  People have been forced to leave, especially women on their own <Col N="661" /> with young children.  In their efforts to stabilise the area, Limerick Corporation have decided that those who leave that estate will not be rehoused by the corporation and are put on the housing list. There are now more than 500 applicants on the housing list yet, more than 100 houses, including the 70 in Glenagross Park, are boarded up because they were vandalised.  This is a dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>The estate has been the subject of a number of press articles and television programmes.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, came to see me after one such television programme. The Minister was shocked by what he saw on television and asked for my advice on the matter.  I told him that it would be necessary to have a Garda presence on a 24 hour basis in the estate to discourage the young vandals and guarantee people that they could live in those houses free from intimidation and with security of tenure.</P>
    <P>The city council and the corporation support me fully.  The previous Minister said he would visit on two occasions to see the situation for himself and I now extend the same invitation to the Minister and I undertake to escort him.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices and influence with the Garda Síochána, who say they have not the resources, to give us 24 hour protection in that estate so that we can relet the houses.</P>
    <P>There has been a dreadful rat infestation in the area, it is the worst I have ever seen.  It has to be seen to be believed. The rats have congregated in the boarded up houses and this is causing great distress to the families in the area.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister helped us resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>The policing situation in Limerick as a whole and the Glenagross area in particular, is receiving continuous and special attention by my Department, the Garda authorities and the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meetings have been held in Limerick, about the Glenagross Park situation attended by senior Garda, Department of <Col N="662" /> Justice and probation service officials in recent months.  Further such meetings have been arranged in the coming weeks. Consultations have taken place with the city manager and local community interests in Moyross and initiatives are being taken in this matter by all concerned. These include, on my side of things, the following: the assignment of seven extra civilian staff since Christmas to Garda stations in Limerick to increase Garda presence on the streets &mdash; in fact the gardaí have a total of 19 full-time and one part-time clerical support employees in Limerick city and all vacancies in this category in Limerick have now been filled; the assignment of student gardaí to Limerick for street level experience purposes; the extra transport provision for Mayorstone station to improve the effectiveness of the neighbourhood gardaí working in Glenagross Park; the negotiations with the management of the community centre being provided in Moyross with a view to establishing a Garda clinic on the premises; and an ongoing review of probation service staffing in the Limerick area.</P>
    <P>The Southill area of Limerick has an Outreach programme in place since October 1990 where three Outreach workers are employed by a local committee funded by my Department.  These people operate day and night at street level, counselling young persons in the &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; category in this area.  Consideration is being given to a further community initiative of similar character in the Moyross area but it is far too soon to say what approach will be adopted in this regard as wide consultations will be required before such a step is taken.</P>
    <P>The Probation and Welfare Service is represented at full strength in Limerick.  It includes two senior probation officers and eight probation officers.  These professional staff are backed up by a clerical officer and two clerical assistants.  This service is under review from the staff point of view.  It has done tremendous work in recent years in the management reform and resocialisation of young offenders in the community in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Limerick is one of the most heavily <Col N="663" /> policed urban areas in this State if not in Western Europe.  It has 324 gardaí serving a population of 75,000 which represents 231 people for every Garda officer in the area.  This contrasts very well with the policing ratios in other parts of the country, including the Dublin metropolitan area.  For instance, the Tallaght Garda district has 107 members of the force and 62,000 population which is one garda for every 619 people.  Cork East Garda district has one garda for every 310 people.  The national average is one garda for every 335 people which is one of the highest police-population ratios in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>Referring specifically to the policing and crime issues of the Moyross area and Glenagross Park in particular, I have the following points to make: 59 houses and not 70, as the Deputy said are boarded up in Glenagross Park.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight criminals believed to be responsible for most of the vandalism in the area have been jailed recently. Mayorstone Garda station, which serves the Moyross area has four sergeants and 21 gardaí attached to it.  The fourth sergeant was added to the station last week. Four student gardaí are now working with the station party at Mayorstone since 2 March and it is intended to introduce shortly a three-relief system of policing in Mayorstone sub-district which will greatly enhance the effective policing of the whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am far from claiming that the situation in Moyross and Glenagross Park is acceptable.  I do want to put on the record that my Department and their agencies have been active in taking steps to address the situation.  The Interdepartmental Committee on Urban Crime Problems are looking hard at areas such as Glenagross Park.  While the committee have concentrated their initial investigations in the Ronanstown area of Dublin, on which I expect to receive a report shortly, I can confirm that the Limerick and Cork areas will be next in <Col N="664" /> line for their attention.  I intend to take up the Deputy's invitation next time I am in Limerick and I will talk with the Deputy about it.</P>

      <P>There are three post-primary education schools in Portlaoise, the Christian Brothers' school, the Presentation Convent and the vocational school with an attendance in excess of 1,100 pupils.  In the post-primary catchment area of Portlaoise there are approximately 2,400 pupils.  It is proposed to extend post-primary education to a six-year cycle.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight and bring to the attention of the Minister the failure of his two immediate predecessors, Deputy Davern and Deputy O'Rourke, to provide proper post-primary educational facilities in Portlaoise.  By their inaction and indecision, they caused serious damage to post-primary educational facilities in the town.  There is total confusion among parents, teachers and pupils over future developments in the town of Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>The Minister is new to his brief and I wish very briefly to bring to his attention the history of what has happened in Portlaoise. Because of the inadequate facilities and the unsatisfactory nature of the vocational school building, a formal decision was taken in 1981 to build a new vocational school in Portlaoise on a ten-acre site that was specially purchased for this purpose.  Planning work proceeded rapidly and working drawings were prepared by Laois Vocational Education Committee and lodged with the Department of Education in 1986.  The school was ready to go to tender for building in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Christian Brothers' school in Portlaoise was built in the last century and is <Col N="665" /> in a run down and dilapidated condition. Because of the necessity for new buildings, sanction was sought and obtained for a new school in 1985.  Planning and development work proceeded apace. Every section of the community in Portlaoise was happy at the progress and development and pleased that the high standards of education that has been the hallmark of the town of Portlaoise were going to be maintained, developed and, in fact, expanded.</P>
    <P>Following the change of Government in 1987 and with the stroke of a pen, in 1988 the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, wiped out the work of the vocational education committee and the Christian Brothers in Portlaoise and issued an ultimatum to the two schools to unite.  Not satisfied with this, the Minister then proceeded to amalgamate the three post-primary schools in the town.  The public outcry and opposition to these proposals was such that the Minister took no action and left matters in abeyance.</P>
    <P>Five years have passed and the situation is deteriorating on a daily basis.  I want to go on record as objecting to one huge conglomerate-type school in Portlaoise.  With the numbers in primary education and with a six-year cycle envisaged, it is likely that the numbers in post-primary education in Portlaoise could reach 1,400 pupils in the next few years.  A school of that size would be more like a factory than what should properly be a cradle of learning for our post-primary pupils.  With a school of over 1,100 pupils all personal contact in the school is lost.  There is no proper pupil-teacher relationship established and developed.  With huge class sizes the bright and very bright pupils may or may not develop to their full potential, but the mediocre and weaker pupils have no real scope for their education or character development.  In a school of 1,100 plus pupils not alone do the pupils not have the benefit of getting to become acquainted and friendly with their fellow pupils, but even the teachers have not the opportunity of getting to know one another.  I have spoken before and I <Col N="666" /> repeat here again tonight, that the majority of parents with children attending school in Portlaoise and the people in the town favour a two school development there.</P>
    <P>On 10 February 1992 the former Minister for Education sanctioned and approved a £20 million plan for schools across Ireland.  Of that £20 million, not one red penny was sanctioned or approved for County Laois.  Approximately 18 counties were allocated moneys but Portlaoise and Laois were left out. It is important that the Minister and his colleagues should use their influence in favour of a two school development in Portlaoise.  If they are not prepared to do so, I call upon the Government to move aside.  The current situation cannot continue and the people in Portlaoise are not prepared to tolerate this injustice any longer</P>

      <P>As a Deputy resident in Portlaoise, I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing on this most important matter.  I am appalled at the fact that the new Minister for Education is not present for the debate and I urge his Minister of State to take back a message to the Minister that a deputation is required on this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>The history of this unfortunate saga is well documented.  The matter has gone on for far too long.  Parents, teachers and children are very fearful of their uncertain future.  This Government are presiding over the running down of the educational system in Portlaoise.  The Minister has in the past, in reply to questions, looked for local consensus.  I call on the Minister tonight to make a decision, which is his duty, to alleviate the very serious level of anxiety, frustration and anger in Portlaoise.  Action is demanded. We have had sufficient talk on this matter over many years.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity of outlining on behalf of the Minister the present position <Col N="667" /> on post-primary education in Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>There are three post-primary schools in the town with a total enrolment in the current school year of 1,103 pupils. Major building projects had been mooted for two of the schools &mdash; the CBS and the vocational school.  In accordance with standard practice, discussions were initiated with the school managements on the issue of rationalisation.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation and cost-effectiveness are now key features of the Department's policy on the provision of post-primary schools.  The need for rationalisation arises as a logical associate of the following objectives:</P>
      <P>the need, without increasing expenditure, to make educational improvements and meet new challenges through more effective and cost-efficient use of available resources;</P>
      <P>the need to eliminate, in so far as possible, duplication and waste in the provision of capital and current facilities;</P>
      <P>to enhance the range of subject availability for as many pupils as possible;</P>
      <P>to promote movement towards greater equality of educational opportunity generally and in particular for girls;</P>
      <P>to promote co-education. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for rationalisation has been accepted by the managements of all three post-primary schools in the town and discussions and consultations amongst all the interested parties, including parents and teachers, have been conducted at local level.  Initial discussions at local level centred on the possibility of an amalgamation between the CBS and the vocational school, leaving the Presentation secondary school as a separate post-primary school.  However, the Presentation Order expressed a wish to participate fully in any rationalisation <Col N="668" /> initiatives, bearing in mind the long term post-primary needs of Portlaoise centre.</P>
    <P>In March 1991, the then Minister for Education Deputy O'Rourke, had separate meetings with representatives of the managements with a view to encouraging local consensus and agreement on the future provision of post-primary facilities in Portlaoise.  Unfortunately, however, such local consensus did not emerge and following full consideration of all aspects of the matter she decided last August to engage independent consultants to undertake a study of the required post-primary provision in Portlaoise.  It is unfair of Deputy Enright to blame any of my predecessors.  Every possible opportunity was taken by them to arrive at a consensus.  The purpose of the study is to determine the appropriate size of the school, having regard to the medium to longer term need for places in the catchment area.  The report of the consultants has now been received and a decision on the future provision for second level education in Portlaoise will be made in the light of the findings of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this urgent social problem not just as a representative of a Dublin city constituency but also as a member of Dublin City Council and chairman of the Housing Committee in that body, a position I took up last June, and which has brought home to me the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 the then Minister for the Environment embarked on a project of establishing, over a three-year period from 1990 to 1993, the national housing needs throughout the country.  Each local authority was requested to carry out a detailed survey and make returns to the Department of their estimate of the housing needs during the period.  Dublin Corporation compiled such a report in response to circular letter H 13/89 and sent it to the Department of the Environment on 6 February 1991.  I apologise for reciting figures because they are tedious, <Col N="669" /> nonetheless in respect of Dublin they are startling.  In the headings laid down by the Department of the Environment, Dublin Corporation provided the following statistics of the accumulated requirements at 30 June 1990 &mdash; the start-up period of the three-year review. The corporation indicated that 2,621 units were required and for the prospective needs of the city during the period 30 June 1990 to 30 June 1993 an additional 4,695 units would be required, giving a grand total for the operative period of 7,316.  In addition the corporation was requested and advised the Department that of the existing housing stock 7,201 were in need of essential work to prevent serious deterioration, 157 were deemed to be totally unfit for habitation and 1,362 was the estimated number of overcrowded housing units, amounting to almost 9,000 units in addition to the figure of 7,316.  If the total housing needs of the period are to be addressed the Minister will have to work towards dealing with 15,000 units.</P>
    <P>In 1991 Dublin Corporation were allowed to build 80 houses.  For the current year we have been advised that moneys will be made available to acquire or build 100 new units.  We have been told that 50 of those must be allocated to Sheriff Street for the purposes of the continued expansion of the Custom House Docks development project.  That means there will be 50 additional houses for the entire city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the social housing programme published a year ago and the fact that no additional housing of any significance has been provided for under the programme because the legislation to give it teeth is still awaiting publication, brings the problem into sharp relief.  In response Dublin City Council in January of this year unanimously passed a motion involving all parties, including Fianna Fáil, that Dublin City Council should be enabled to build a minimum of 400 houses per annum over the next five years to keep abreast of serious problems developing.  The Minister was advised accordingly.  The response was the paltry one I have outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> I acknowledge the Department are engaging in a programme of flat and house refurbishment, including areas in my own constituency.  By and large that addresses a population already occupying those units and rarely, if ever, provides additional housing.  I was advised in correspondence from the City Manager in February of this year that in Darndale estate in my own constituency, 150 families are on the housing list for that estate, whereas we have been informed that for the year as a whole the entire city will be allowed 100 additional units.</P>
    <P>There is a major rift between our understanding of what the Minister is attempting to do and the Minister's understanding of what we need to do in Dublin to bridge that gap.  I ask the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to meet with Dublin City Council, my committee, so that we can have a meeting of minds to examine the scale of the problem and the job that needs to be done.  I hope the Minister will respond favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital allocation notified to Dublin Corporation on 26 February last for their 1992 housing programme amounts to £12.89 million including expenditure on the provision of new housing and the refurbishment of existing local authority dwellings.  This allocation represents an increase of 22 per cent on the corresponding figure of £10.584 million for 1991.</P>
      <P>The result of the last statutory assessment of local authority housing needs showed that Dublin Corporation's needs had risen by 407 to 4,377 in the 18-month period since the previous assessment held on 30 September 1989.  This figure, however, is a long way short of the level of the corporation's housing needs in the early eighties when they had over 6,700 approved applicants on their waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 the corporation provided 95 additional units of accommodation with a further 66 units in progress at year's end. This year's allocation authorised 100 new &ldquo;starts&rdquo; or acquisitions in 1992.  In addition the allocation caters for a further <Col N="671" /> 83 new &ldquo;starts&rdquo; or acquisitions authorised but not commenced in 1991.</P>
    <P>The availability of local authority accommodation for renting to persons on the waiting list is not determined solely by the number of new units of accommodation provided annually.  It is worth noting that during 1991 the corporation had a high level of casual vacancies which enabled them to make about 1,500 lettings from this source.</P>
    <P>In dealing with capital for the local authority housing programme, the house building element of the programme cannot be treated in isolation.  Cognisance must be taken of the funds being made available for the other elements as well.  Dublin Corporation have been allocated £25 million to date under the remedial works scheme including £6.3 million this year.  This scheme is particularly beneficial as units of accommodation are upgraded and become available for reletting to persons in need of housing.</P>
    <P>Cognisance should also be taken of the increased contribution that my Department's voluntary housing scheme is now making towards social housing.  It is anticipated that in 1992 upwards of 300 units of accommodation will be commenced in Dublin city under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The needs of the corporation's house building programme must be seen against the significant reduction in demand in the corporation area since the eighties, the high level of casual vacancies still becoming available in the existing housing stock, and the level of expenditure on the remedial works scheme and the other elements of the local authority housing programme.  The further schemes introduced in the social housing plan, such as the rental subsidy scheme, the improvement work/extension of private houses, and the shared ownership scheme are also available to the corporation and should be availed of to their full potential to address social housing needs in the city.</P>
    <P>At the end of February, Dublin Corporation had received a total of 370 applications for the shared ownership system <Col N="672" /> of which only 27 transactions had been approved in principle.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities such as Dublin Corporation, including elected members, have a responsibility to ensure they discharge the new role given to them in the social housing plan.  It is only at local level that the various measures in the plan can be promoted actively and used in combined ways that best meet local and individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances and having regard to the fact that the capital available from the Public Capital Programme this year for the local authority housing programme nationally has been fully allocated I am not, therefore, in a position to increase the corporation's 1992 capital allocation.</P>
    <P>I have, however, indicated on a number of occasions that I would be prepared to meet corporation and local authority members throughout the country on problems where we can try to address and solve problems relating to housing and, indeed, many other areas.  In this context, I will make myself available to the corporation at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>This very serious problem has been ongoing for some considerable time and, unfortunately, has yet to be resolved.  The Minister stated last November that he was going to speed up the payment of beef premiums and gave a guarantee that they would be paid by Christmas.  However we were soon told that they would be paid by the end of January.  Then on 4 March the Minister stated that practically all payments would be made by the end of this month.  He also stated on that day that there were 14,000 problem cases where mistakes had been made.  These are the cases that I would like to address in my remarks tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out that approximately 500 to 600 of these problem cases are being dealt with by the office in <Col N="673" /> Enniscorthy and that no attempt has been made to make payments.  I am not blaming the staff because they cannot cope but I should point out to the Minister that farmers in the Wexford area are entitled to their money which has been made available by the European Community. The Minister's Department seem to have made no effort to assist the local offices in making these payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated in his speech on 4 March that he had asked his staff in cases where innocent errors had been made to pay the grants and only in those cases where a deliberate attempt had been made to defraud should they initiate an investigation.  I should point out to the Minister that there are 500 files in the office in Enniscorthy and that that office are now dealing with sheep grants and not with these cases.  Is the Minister prepared to give a direction or to provide some assistance to allow these payments to be made given that these farmers are entitled to this money which has been made available by the European Community? It seems that the system in his own Department has broken down and that he is unable to pay this money.  For the next three weeks at least his staff will be engaged in processing applications for sheep headage payments so these files will not be looked at.</P>
    <P>Given that it took the Department five months to make payments to 60,000 applicants, I wonder how long it will take them to make payments to the other 14,000.  I appeal to the Minister to pay out this money immediately and to show some sympathy for those farmers who find themselves in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter again in the House.  I should point out to him that every effort is being made and that I have asked my officials in the Department to pay promptly all those applicants who made innocent errors in submitting their applications and to get the money out to them as quickly as possible.  The difficulty is that the regulations governing the operation of the beef premium scheme have <Col N="674" /> been laid down in considerable detail by the European Commission.  Applicants for premium are required to observe a whole range of obligations, including the need to keep the animals for which premium is applied for a minimum period of two months from the date of application or until inspection if later.  Applicants must of course accurately state the number of eligible animals on their holdings.</P>
      <P>The penalties for failure to comply with the various requirements are also defined precisely.  These could involve losses of up to two years premium depending on the degree of non-compliance.  I have no discretion in relation to the application of either the obligations or penalties prescribed by the European Community for the beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>I am clearly committed to ensuring that all legitimate applications are accepted and paid promptly.  With this in mind a departmental task force was set up earlier this year to consider the problems associated with the male beef premium.  The task force recently presented an interim report to me dealing with problems arising in the case of the 1991 scheme.  The recommendations in relation to these problems have been accepted by me and as a result payment will be made in the coming weeks in a large number of cases involving innocent error.  This should reduce considerably the number of problem cases involved in the 1991 scheme. There is no doubt that some farmers will still be refused payment because they have made substantially incorrect claims in their applications.  As matters stand, the full penalties set out in the EC regulations will have to be applied in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the penalties to be extremely harsh.  Because of this, on the first occasion I attended the European Council, I availed of the opportunity to speak to Commissioner MacSharry about the problems connected with the operation of the beef premium scheme in Ireland. He has asked that the Commission should change the rules of the scheme so as to simplify its administrative arrangements and make the penalties under it more <Col N="675" /> commensurate with any offences committed.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the final report of the task force very shortly and I am confident that this will provide a solid basis for dealing with the 1992 scheme.  The recommendations in the final report are expected to propose a revised application form which can be filled more easily and more accurately by farmers as well as proposing a campaign to help farmers in completing those appications.  These initiatives should result in fewer problems with the scheme in the future.  In other words, we will have more user friendly application forms.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific matter raised concerning the Enniscorthy office, I will ask my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who I am sure is familiar with that office and location, to take a look at it to see if we can free the system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The Abattoirs Act, 1988 forced the county councils to appoint vets to fulfil the terms of the Act.  However it will also allow the county councils to charge for the services of these vets once regulations are made under the Act.  While Carlow County Council have spent £70,000, money which they cannot afford to spend, on vets and related expenses they are unable to recoup this money because the Government have failed to introduce regulations four years after the passing of that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first raised this matter on 17 May 1990 the then Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, said that &ldquo;further regulations are at present being finalised and are expected to come into operation in the near future&rdquo;.  Seven months later, on 5 December 1990, I raised the matter on the Adjournment when the present Minister, Deputy Walsh, said &ldquo;the regulations are receiving priority at present and I hope to introduce them in the near future&rdquo;.  When I raised the matter on 15 May 1991 under the grievance procedure <Col N="676" /> the then Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, said &ldquo;these regulations are in the final stages of preparation and I hope to introduce them shortly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is now almost 12 months since I raised this matter for the third time in May 1991 and county councils all over the country need this money.  I do not want to hear the Minister use phrases such as &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;, &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; or &ldquo;very soon&rdquo;.  If the Minister cannot name a date I suggest that he either withdraw the Abattoirs Act or else compensate the county councils for the money they have spent already, if he is not in a position to introduce regulations which will allow them to charge for these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I thank my colleague for raising this issue.  The Abattoirs Act, 1988, provides for standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local abattoirs supplying the home market which will be on a par with those applying at export plants in order to ensure that the domestic consumer can be assured of a quality product.</P>
      <P>Under the Act each premises is required to undergo annual inspection and licensing by my Department.  Since 1 September 1989 the regulations under the Act laying down the requirements for the construction and operation of abattoirs supplying the domestic market have been in force.</P>
      <P>The day-to-day supervision of the abattoirs will be under the direct control of the local authority veterinary inspectorate who will conduct the ante and post-mortem examinations to establish the fitness of meat for human consumption and apply the health mark to fit meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V of the Act, which provides for the collection of fees by local authorities in respect of veterinary examination of animals, cannot be commenced until regulations are introduced to provide for the ante and post-mortem examinations of animals.  A further complication has arisen in this regard as an EC Directive has been adopted which sets standard <Col N="677" /> charges to be levied in all slaughtering premises.  The implementation of this Directive will mean that the fee structure provided for by the Abattoirs Act will be superseded.  For cattle and pig slaughtering this will mean a higher fee and the fee for sheep will be slightly reduced. The fees will be regularly reviewed to ensure that the real value of the income from the fee is maintained.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the fees is linked to the introduction of the veterinary examination regulations.  These regulations are complex in that they have to state precisely how all stages of the ante and post mortem will be conducted and specify all the grounds on which animals may not be passed as fit for human consumption. Since the drafting of the regulations commenced they have had to be redrafted on two occasions to take account of the extension of EC standards to meat being produced for sale on the domestic market.  The regulations are now in final form and will be introduced shortly when final legal clearance for the draft is received.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that local authorities who do not have local by-laws for the inspection of meat have not received the expected revenue and I regret the difficulties caused.  There are no funds available to provide financial assistance to them over and above the revenue they will receive from the collection of fees.</P>
    <P>I want to assure this House that I am having the completion and introduction of these regulations treated as a priority and that the delay is attributable to the complexity of the regulations and the need to accommodate changes in EC legislation, during the course of their preparation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to assure the public that because of the high standards of our domestic butchers and the pride they take in the quality of their product they should not have concerns about the wholesomeness of the meat they purchase.  The application of the operational standards ensures, that the product is produced under the best possible conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the unacceptable <Col N="678" /> situation operating at present where the Office of Consumer Affairs do not have an office in any area outside Dublin.  Up to recently, the director had offices in Cork and Galway but he was forced to close them because of inadequate financing from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The explanation for this, when I raised the matter some years ago, was that the director had received a financial allocation to run his services and could run them as he pleased.  I was told that the decision to close the offices was made by the director alone; that was a monumental cop-out at a time when so much lip service is given to the rights of consumers, here and in the European Community.</P>
      <P>It is very unsatisfactory because at present anybody who has a complaint must submit it in writing to the office in Dublin or, alternatively, travel to Dublin.  In practice, a big percentage of people cannot put the details of their complaints comprehensively in written form, I know it is a problem with many of the people to whom I speak.  They would prefer to have an opportunity of meeting the director or his staff face to face.  I ask the Minister to give an adequate financial allocation to the Director of Consumer Affairs to enable him to extend the service to its original level, in other words, to have offices in areas outside Dublin.  Dublin is not Ireland and the centralist thinking in the Government must change as people outside Dublin must get the rights which they deserve.</P>
      <P>The Minister should allocate sufficient finance to the director to deal adequately with the complaints he is receiving and to extend the service into the cities and towns in the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Allen for raising this issue.  The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs have statutory responsibility for certain consumer related functions as laid down in the Consumer Information Act, 1978, and subsequent legislation.  The director is independent in the day-to-day performance of these functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Until July 1989 there were two inspectors from the director's office based in Cork and Galway, one in each centre. However, a decision was taken by the then director to transfer the regional inspectors to headquarters in Dublin. This decision was taken in the interests of operational efficiency and optimum deployment of resources.  The decision was also influenced by the fact that the director considered the operation of regional offices to be limited in their effectiveness for the following reasons: lack of support, training, briefing and supervisory services for the officers; costs involved in bringing the officers to Dublin for briefing and training; regional offices were not open to the public; complaints and inquiries which they received from the public were referred to Dublin for advice regarding follow-up action.  At the time, the director felt that he could not justify the re-opening of the regional offices unless they could be staffed by two or more people.</P>
    <P>On the question of the possible re-opening of regional offices, I have to say at the outset that no proposals in that regard have been received in my Department from the current Director of Consumer Affairs.  I am, however, aware from discussions with him that it is a matter which he is looking into and may well wish to do so if it proves to be <Col N="680" /> practicable.  It must be understood that this would probably require the allocation of additional staff as not all the staff required could be provided out of existing resources.  In addition, there would be accommodation and overhead costs although presumably these would be offset to some extent by way of savings in present travelling costs.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the funding of his office, I would point out that his overall funding has increased from some £148,000 in 1990 to £188,000 in 1992. Furthermore, the office's travel budget which is used primarily for inspections was increased from £63,000 in 1990 to some £97,000 in 1991 and has been maintained at this level for 1992.  Also in August 1990 seven additional staff were assigned to the office raising the total complement from 23 to 30.</P>
    <P>In the context of the difficult budgetary situation which has prevailed over recent years I would respectfully suggest to the Deputy that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs have fared quite well.</P>
    <P>If the director ultimately decides that it would be practicable to open regional offices and puts forward proposals to that effect the matter will be considered as sympathetically as possible but taking due account of prevailing budgetary constraints.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 March 1992.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="480" /> am, of course, aware of the worldwide concern that many of the nuclear power reactors in operation in the Commonwealth of Independent States do not meet international safety standards.  I am informed that the authorities in these countries have completed modifications to the design of some of these reactors, that improved operational procedures have been put into effect and that other improvements have also taken place to increase safety and reliability.  These improvements and ongoing work in co-operation with Western countries and with international agencies in the nuclear field reduce the risk of another accident of the Chernobyl type.</P>
      <P>The European Community has been active along with other relevant international agencies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency in the area of nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union, and Ireland is participating in ongoing nuclear safety discussions in those fora.  I welcome the fact that financial and technical assistance has been allocated by the European Community to reinforce the nuclear safety authorities in those countries, to strengthen co-operation at plant level and to perform safety reviews and implement internationally-agreed safety recommendations.  Ireland strongly supports the concept that nuclear safety should be an integral part of economic co-operation agreements between the Community and the CIF states.</P>
      <P>In the context of the European Energy Charter, which all members of the Commonwealth are expected to sign, Ireland is pressing for the maximum emphasis on nuclear safety in the protocol on nuclear energy, which is currently being negotiated. The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development in its recent energy policy document indicated readiness to assist with the rehabilitation of existing nuclear power stations.  Bank participation will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, however, having regard to the situation that the safety of existing stations varies considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IAEA in Vienna has recently completed <Col N="481" /> the first phase of a safety review of some of the older reactors and recommendations have been agreed in the areas of design and operational procedures. Overall, I find it a very positive development that the political changes in Eastern Europe have paved the way for western expertise to help in this very important area.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to take every opportunity at EC level and in other international fora to ensure that the question of nuclear safety in the Commonwealth of Independent States is given the highest priority.  We will continue to support all Community initiatives in this area, in co-ordination with all other relevant international agencies.</P>

      <P>A proposal to establish an International Convention on Nuclear Safety was one of the principal recommendations to emerge from a Conference on Nuclear Safety held under the aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna in September 1991.  The broad objective of such a convention would be to promote the adoption of legally binding safety standards throughout the nuclear industry.  The Government welcomes this proposal and fully supports it.</P>
      <P>The board of governors of the Vienna agency discussed this initiative last month and as a result a working group will immediately begin drawing up the details and structures of such an international convention.</P>
      <P>I will, of course, seek to have provision for independent verification by an inspection force included in the proposed convention. Ireland has been seeking the establishment of an independent nuclear inspection force for some time and has raised this matter repeatedly at international, especially EC, level.  I see verification and inspection as being essential to the effective implementation of any international convention in the nuclear safety area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>On 1 February 1992 the latest date for which figures are available, the national stocks of oil products reported to the EC were as follows: petrol 103 days, gasoil (also known as diesel) 104 days, and fuel oil 241 days.  This includes the allocation of crude according to the method approved by the EC.  The number of days supply held other than by the INPC was as follows: petrol 44 days, gasoil 54 days and fuel oil 215 days.  Records are kept to adhere to the requirement of the EC and IEA, which does not require records of stocks of LPG or jet fuel, nor is it necessary to make a distinction between operating and strategic stocks.  Kerosene, other than jet fuel, is included in the gasoil figure.</P>
      <P>The performance of the oil companies in relation to their stockholding obligations varies.  I am making every effort to improve the performance of those companies which are not meeting their obligations in full at present.</P>
      <P>Ireland continues to meet our EC and IEA obligations in relation to all specified stock categories, and it is my intention that we should continue to do so.  I have no plans for action to increase stocks, as I do not see any necessity for it.  The deregulation of oil prices has not affected Ireland's strategic oil stock policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may wish to note that the EC is reviewing the EC policy on methods of oil stockholding.  This is at a very early stage, but could in the future have a significant impact on national policies in this area.  My Department is participating <Col N="485" /> directly in these discussions within the EC.</P>

      <P>To date I have not received an application for a State mining lease to develop the deposit to which the Deputy is referring. Information regarding the extent of the level of reserves is a matter for the company concerned.  The results of an initial feasibility study carried out by consultants on behalf of the company are under consideration at present and further studies are planned.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this time to indicate when mining operations will commence. Obviously there are commercial as well as technical considerations involved.  However, I would be most anxious to ensure that should it be decided that development is economically viable, mining should commence as soon as possible provided that the required environmental and technical condition can be met.  In my view it would also be highly desirable that processing of the raw material be carried out in the locality but the Deputy will appreciate that ultimately this will be a matter for the company.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the serious unemployment situation in the area.  In considering an application for a State mining lease the employment potential of the development will be a major factor which I will take into account in arriving at a decision on whether to grant the lease.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The EC is committed to stabilising CO2 emissions in the Community as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000. This commitment was made at the joint Energy and Environment Council in Luxembourg in 1990 and reaffirmed in December 1991.  In so far as member states such as Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece are concerned, this joint commitment provides for differential treatment for the less developed economies of the Community.  Thus emissions are expected to grow in line with development up to 2000 while the energy efficiency of economic activities will be improved to minimise any increase in CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>In line with the joint Council of December last, a national programme including a comprehensive approach on strategies and targets for limiting CO2 emissions is being prepared at present by the Department of the Environment in consultation with other Departments, including Energy.  When completed the programme will be transmitted to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I am in agreement with the general view that energy conservation is the best method in the short term of reducing CO2 emissions.  Ireland has an ongoing energy conservation programme <Col N="487" /> and possibilities for expanding that programme are kept under review.  Measures being worked out at present under the Community SAVE programme to support energy conservation initiatives by member states will form part of our future conservation activities.</P>
    <P>In our view also the development of forestry in Ireland will play a role in limiting our CO2 emissions.  Forests absorb and retain large amounts of CO2. Our rapidly increasing forest area could absorb as much as one third of our expected growth in emissions.  Inclusion of sink capacity in calculating emissions of CO2 is a vital element of our national programme.</P>
    <P>One of the specific measures suggested by the Commission in response to the joint Council's decisions is to encourage energy efficiency and conservation through the introduction of a carbon tax. The joint Council has acknowledged that such a instrument is likely to be needed and has asked the Commission to carry out further studies.  The matter will be considered further when the studies are completed.</P>

      <P>The existence of radioactive material was detected in a consignment of scrap bought in by Irish Steel in September 1991.  The material was not processed.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel have acquired equipment to detect radioactive sources in incoming consignments of scrap steel.  In this instance the monitoring system detected slightly contaminated material from the fertiliser industry.  I must emphasise that the radioactive content of materials detected to date at Irish Steel would not cause a hazard to personnel.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy was a particular incident concerning the undeclared export of nuclear material from a fuel fabrication plant in Germany to the United States of America.  It involved an unintentional breach of the elements of the Euratom Treaty which deal with the safeguarding of nuclear <Col N="491" /> materials (to prevent diversion of material to non-peaceful uses), in particular Article 79 which requires detailed operating records to be kept in respect of the transport of nuclear materials.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, all the details and background to the case are contained in the Commission decision of 1 August 1990 (ref. 90/413/Euratom).  It is clear that this was an individual breach of the regulations and was dealt with by the EC Commission as the competent authority on that basis, in order to ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the future.  As such, this incident cannot have any specific implications for the operation of other undertakings in member states of the Community so long as they are not involved in a similar breach of the regulations.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that this matter was satisfactorily resolved and the outcome was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 22 February last.</P>
      <P>The incident had no relevance to safety issues or to our concerns relating to the operation of Sellafield.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available from my Department for the generation of electricity from natural resources.  However, under certain circumstances funds are available for research, development and demonstration in a number of areas including renewable energies under the European Community's &ldquo;JOULE&rdquo; and &ldquo;THERMIE&rdquo; programmes.  As these are Community programmes, the level of financial support secured by Irish projects depends on the total funds available <Col N="492" /> and on the quality of the projects put forward.</P>
      <P>Last year the price which the ESB pays for electricity supplied to the grid from non-fuel renewable energy sources was increased with effect from 1 June 1991. While the main beneficiaries of this increase will be private hydro electricity producers, it should also be seen as an incentive for those individuals or groups contemplating new development projects in other areas of renewable energies.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> Activities in the energy sector are kept under ongoing review with a view to improving efficiency and cost competitiveness. Specific initiatives currently under way include the major review on the future structure of the electricity industry, together with the gas interconnector with the UK.  The feasibility of an UK electricity interconnector is also being evaluated.  In addition I have been conscious for some time that at current energy prices, the price of milled peat is high.  Bord na Móna is carrying through a major restructuring programme designed to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Over time and as the Bord na Móna debt burden is reduced this should assist in bringing down the price of milled peat. In relation to the Whitegate Refinery discussions are continuing on an upgrade project.  Full evaluation of any proposals for an upgrade are essential to ensure the optimum overall benefit to the Irish consumer.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring, in the second part of his question, to the EC Commission's Three Year Action Plan of Consumer Policy 1990-1992. Under this plan, the Commission has brought forward proposals: to rationalise and improve food labelling requirements; to encourage comparative advertising; to ensure greater transparency in the provision of insurance services; to extend the rapid exchange of information system; on the liability of suppliers of defective services; prohibiting the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts; controlling &ldquo;mail-order&rdquo; and similar &ldquo;distance selling&rdquo; techniques and controlling time-share selling.</P>

      <P>Section 41 of the Finance Act, 1990, extended the duration of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing to the year 2010.  The section also defined the range of activities eligible for that rate.</P>
      <P>In their recent report, the Industrial Policy Review Group made comments on the corporation tax regime and on certain drawbacks associated with the 10 per cent rate.  However, the group confined their recommendations to saying that no indication should be given of any continuation of the 10 per cent corporation tax rate beyond 2010, and that the rate of activities to which it applies should not be extended.</P>
      <P>Since the Government have now set up a task force, which will report to the Taoiseach and a committee of relevant Ministers, to follow up on the recommendations in the review group's report, it would not be appropriate to comment further at this juncture.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the commercial vehicles on which he has reduced the excise duty in the recent budget by 6½ per cent; the exact TC of the vehicles concerned; if this applies to long-base or short-base patrols and jeeps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Prior to the budget, excise duty was payable on commercial vehicles at a rate of 6.5 per cent.  As a result of the changes announced in the budget, this rate was increased to 12.5 per cent in the case of commercial vehicles which are of not more than three tonnes unladen weight and which have a roofed area to the rear of the driver's seat, the floor of which is less than two metres long.  The duty on other commercials, which do not come under these criteria, was reduced from 6.5 per cent to nil.  These classification criteria for excise purposes apply to jeep-based commercials in the same way as they apply to other commercials and do not relate to customs classification and tariff codes.</P>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to particular vehicles which some motor distributors feel have been unfairly classified under the new provisions.  I am examining these cases at present.</P>

    <P>These variations are not regarded by the Commissioners as being significant and may have come about for a variety of reasons.  The number of taxpayers registered for VAT has tended to increase over the years.  More significantly, there are constant variations in the payment patterns of taxpayers which are, in turn, reflected in enforcement patterns. It should be noted that sheriff action is only one of a number of methods of enforcement and the choice of any particular method would depend on the circumstances of individual cases.</P>

      <P>Our current primary energy requirements are broken down approximately as follows: oil 47 per cent, coal 22 per cent, gas 15 per cent, peat 15 per cent and hydro 1 per cent.  The following is my policy under the headings specified by the Deputy: (a) Peat is one of Ireland's few indigenous sources of energy and forms an important element of the national energy mix, reducing our dependence on imported fuels and adding to fuel diversity.  I am conscious that at current energy prices, the price of milled peat for electricity generation is higher than comparative costs for other fuels.  Bord na Móna are in the process of implementing a major restructuring programme with a view to improving efficiency and reducing their debt burden.  Achievement of increased profitability should, over time, provide a basis for reducing the cost penalty associated with generating electricity from peat.  (b) Extensions of the gas grid are primarily a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann to decide in the light of their statutory obligation to earn a satisfactory return on capital employed.  My policy is to facilitate and encourage the board in that regard.  (c) The use of natural resources in the energy sector is kept under ongoing review with the aim of improving efficiency and cost competitiveness.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, in the recent proposals for the achievement of the internal market in the electricity and gas sectors, the European Commission identified the following as obstacles to the achievement of the internal market: (1) the obstruction of the arrival of new entrants to the supply of natural gas and electricity in member states (2) the existence of long term contracts with take or pay clauses in regard to natural gas and (3) the format of accounts of electricity and gas undertakings on a consolidated basis which limits the information available to the public on the efficiency and quality of management of the various operations of these undertakings; and the plans, if any, he has to change any of the practices of Irish electricity and gas undertakings to remove these obstacles identified by the European Commission.</Quest>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of European Commission's proposals for third party access to gas and electricity grids, and for the <Col N="510" /> removal of what are termed the obstacles to the achievement of the internal market.  While I am broadly in favour of the principle of third party access, particularly for major consumers, whenever practicable, and subject, of course, to security of supply considerations, the Commission's proposals in these areas have some way to go before they become effective, and there is at present no formalised right of access.  Consideration of the appropriate structures for the future of Ireland's electricity industry is already underway and I will keep the matter in relation to gas under review.</P>

      <P>No one has an exclusive right to import or export natural gas and electricity; we are not, therefore, in breach of our Treaty obligations in that regard.  I should add, however, that Bord Gáis Éireann does have the right, under section 37 of the Gas Act, 1976, to &ldquo;first refusal&rdquo; of gas discovered and produced within the jurisdiction. I am currently looking at proposals to amend that section but whether the section as it now stands is affected by the Treaty of Rome is a matter of legal conjecture.</P>
      <P>Future arrangements for the import/ export of electricity will be examined as part of my review of the structure of the electricity industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, unauthorised taking of vehicles or so called &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; was a major problem in the early eighties, particularly in the Dublin area.  A number of measures were taken to counteract it which included significant legislative changes and effective Garda action.  These measures have proved to be extremely successful.  In fact the level of unauthorised takings in 1990 has decreased by almost 50 per cent since the problem peaked in 1981.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that despite the success in dealing with this problem they are aware of the tragic effects which it can have for the community and are therefore continuing to give it a high level of priority.  The strategies adopted by the Garda to deal with this problem include identifying and targeting areas at risk, the intensive patrolling of such areas and the surveillance of persons suspected of being involved in such activity.  The Garda authorities also inform me that they liaise closely with local authorities on measures which can be taken by them to prevent high speed driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities also consider that the role of the public in protecting their vehicles is crucial.  In this respect they actively encourage car owners to take more care in parking vehicles and ensuring that they are locked and made as secure as possible when left unattended. Far too many cars are stolen every year because of failure by their owners to secure them properly.  The use of steering <Col N="513" /> column locks, car alarms and other anti-theft devices has been shown in recent international studies to have a remarkably strong deterrent effect.  For instance, 83 per cent of car crime offenders interviewed in a recent British Home Office study said they would not try to steal a car if they knew it was fitted with an alarm.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the onus is on the individual garda driver to decide if the circumstances of a particular case are so serious as to warrant undertaking the pursuit of a speeding &ldquo;joyrider&rdquo;.  This matter is the subject of detailed Garda operational instructions and the House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to disclose details of such instructions.  I can say, however, that the overriding principle involved is that pursuit should not be undertaken in a manner which creates a perceptible risk of death or injury as a result.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are continuing to monitor the joyriding problem and will take whatever measures may be appropriate to prevent and detect this dangerous and illegal activity.  In the interim I would appeal to the car-owning public to take more action to make their vehicles safe and secure.</P>

      <P>The provision of a new school was first raised in 1983 but did not proceed for a number of reasons, including the need to concentrate available resources on projects of higher priority. The project has now reached sketch scheme stage.  As this is an early stage of planning, the question of allocating funds during the current year does not arise.  It is my intention to provide the new school as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>&dagger; The normal fee for the Chairman of An Post is £2,400.  However, as an exceptional measure sanction was given to An Post in July 1991 for the payment of a gratuity of £7,600 to the current Chairman of An Post for year ending 15 February 1991 bringing the total fee for the year to £10,000 and for a total fee of £25,000 for one year ending 1 May 1992, when the matter will be reviewed.  The sanction took account of the major executive input of the Chairman in relation to the reorganisation of An Post. </P>

      <P>The issue of a medical card is a matter solely for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the Southern Health Board regarding the case mentioned by the Deputy.  The person in question had a medical card from August 1990 up to January 1992.  The health board reviewed the position in January of this year and found that the individual's average income during 1991 was some £26 per week in excess of the guidelines for eligibility for a medical card.  The income was made up of the unemployment assistance he had received in that year plus the income from the period of employment from May to August of 1991.</P>
      <P>Following a further review of this person's eligibility, taking into account his current employment status, the board have recently decided to issue a medical card to him.</P>
      <P>All health boards review the position of medical card holders from time to time, having particular regard to the income of the individual concerned and the guidelines which are issued regarding eligibility.  The Southern Health Board have indicated that the matter will similarly be kept under review in this particular case.</P>

      <P>My Department introduced a job sharing scheme in all health agencies in 1985. Hours of attendance and other conditions of service such as pay, sick leave, annual leave, superannuation, and so on, are based on 50 per cent of the amount applicable in the case of a full-time person in the same grade.  This scheme affords flexibility to staff and to management in providing an alternative to traditional full-time working arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the scheme provide that the operation and maintenance of job sharing arrangements in respect of specific posts are a matter for the management <Col N="527" /> of each health agency, and must necessarily depend on the exigencies of service, personnel and other relevant criteria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I am aware of the construction work which is being carried out on British Army permanent vehicle checkpoints along the Border.  I understand that the work will be confined to locations at or near existing permanent vehicle checkpoints.</P>
    <P>Issues arising from the operation of permanent vehicle checkpoints have been raised on several occasions with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast and at meetings of the Inter-Governmental Conference. The Deputy will understand that the details of these exchanges are confidential. I can however confirm that, while the Government appreciate the need for the British authorities to undertake appropriate security measures on their side of the Border, we have emphasised that every effort should be made by them to keep the inconvenience caused by these measures to the absolute minimum. I understand that the work which is currently being carried out will, <i>inter alia,</i> make provision for new traffic arrangements at the checkpoints so as to improve traffic flow and reduce delays.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that the work being undertaken represents a criticism of the Government's efforts with regard to cross-Border security co-operation.  Cross-Border security co-operation arrangements are working well and this has been acknowledged publicly and repeatedly by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef sector in Ireland has been experiencing market difficulties because of a number of external factors, namely an increase in imports to the EC market, a decline in EC consumption due to BSE, the closure of certain third country markets, also because of BSE, and the closure of the Iraqi market due to the Gulf War.  These factors have also affected the beef sector in other member states.  As a result, reliance on intervention has increased in Ireland and in the EC as a whole.  Without this intervention support, cattle prices throughout the EC would have fallen sharply.</P>
      <P>Ireland also has been consistently to the fore in expressing concern at the unacceptably high level of live imports into the Community in recent years, and with a number of other member states was instrumental in having a safeguard measure introduced in 1991 which limited live imports to 425,000 head.  This provision was again renewed this year at Ireland's request.  As an additional direct response to the difficulties in the sector, the EC Commission proposed, and the Council of Ministers agreed last December, that the suckler cow premium should be increased, on a once-off basis.  As a result, an additional supplement of £15.81 per head is being paid in respect of such cows in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> In addition, the arrangements for processors' margins implemented following the 1991-1992 prices negotiations led to a fall in cattle prices over the summer. Due to revised arrangements requested by Ireland, this fall was halted and reversed last August-September and cattle prices have remained relatively stable since then.</P>
    <P>At present difficulties with intervention have arisen because of the very high rejection rate being applied by the European Commission to quantities offered for intervention intake.  Because large quantities of bull meat are, for speculative reasons, being offered for intervention, the Commission has been forced to apply a 90 per cent/95 per cent rejection rate to these bids and has felt compelled to apply high rejection rates to steer meat also.  Following representations to the Commission by Ireland and by other member states, the Commission undertook to review the detailed arrangements for intervention with a view to removing the speculative aspects of the system.  This would enable a more realistic acceptance rate for quantities offered into intervention to be applied, and would afford a greater degree of certainty to the beef sector. Notwithstanding these difficulties, cattle prices have, as I already indicated, remained relatively stable since the new arrangements for processors margins were implemented last year.</P>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing discussions at EC level on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will determine the future framework of the beef sector for some time to come, my aim is to ensure that the interests of our primary producers are fully protected and that the processing sector can develop in a way that enables them to respond to market requirements.  I intend to obtain the best possible result for our producers by ensuring that the compensatory premia being proposed to offset the fall in the intervention price are at an adequate level and are in a form suitable to Irish production conditions.</P>
    <P>Prospects for exports of beef and cattle to the Middle East and North Africa are <Col N="542" /> better this year than in 1991.  The Iranian authorities agreed last November to reopen their market to Irish beef and this agreement was formalised last week during the first meeting of the Irish/Iranian Joint Commission.  Commercial negotiations on volume and price are underway.  Libya has also agreed to accept our beef and I hope that this will be followed later this year by an agreement on the resumption of cattle exports. Exports of beef to other countries in the region such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia are proceeding steadily.  The volume of exports will of course depend on commercial factors such as price and supplies on the international market and, in the case of Iraq, the framework for trade set by the United Nations.  Increasingly, trade depends on our being competitive internationally and we must plan for an industry which can take most of its returns from the market rather than from intervention.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of current financial difficulties affecting certain beef processing firms.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that beef processing in Ireland is inherently profitable and I believe that the industry has the capability and expertise to produce a quality product and make inroads on major export markets, thus ensuring a viable future for all engaged in this vital sector of the economy.</P>

      <P>Past experience with schemes of the kind referred to by the Deputy has been that, in addition to their high cost, it is particularly difficult to focus them on those in need, especially in view of the requirement that borrowers must meet the normal criteria of creditworthiness. There are no funds available to me to use for the purpose of subsidising such loans, even if it were possible to frame such action to be in conformity with Community rules of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of schemes do, however, exist which are specifically designed to support the incomes of beef producers. A total of £76.2 million was paid to producers throughout the country during 1991 under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes while a further <Col N="544" /> £65.1 million was paid to producers in the disadvantaged areas under the beef cow and cattle headage schemes.</P>

    <P>While 34 individual applications were submitted, many of them covered areas of more than one county as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  joint Cavan and Monaghan</P>
    <P>(b)  rural parts of Kildare, Meath, Offaly and Westmeath</P>
    <P>(c)  parts of Mayo and Sligo</P>

    <P>(f)  parts of Carlow, Kilkenny, South Tipperary and South Kildare</P>
    <P>(g)  parts of Cork and Limerick</P>
    <P>(h)  joint Kildare, Laois and Offaly</P>
    <P>(j)  off-shore islands of Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo</P>
    <P>(k)  parts of Galway, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo</P>
    <P>(l)  islands/coastal areas of Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Mayo  </P>
    <P>A total of 16 groups have been approved for funding under Leader as follows:</P>
    <P>Rural Resource Development Ltd., South Boundary, Shannon, County Clare.</P>
    <P>Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, f/ch Roinn na Gaeltachta, Na Forbacha, Gaillimh, Contae na Gaillimhe.</P>
    <P>Western Rural Development Co., c/o NCF, Ballina Road, Tubbercurry, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>Barrow-Nore-Suir Rural Development Ltd., 20 Patrick Street, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Ballyhoura Fáilte Society Ltd., Education Centre, Kilfinane, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Inishowen Community Development Group, Carndonagh, Inishowen, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Comhar Iorrais Teo., Belmullet, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Wicklow Rural Enterprises Ltd., Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow.</P>
    <P>Wexford Organisation for Rural Development Ltd., c/o Waterford Foods plc, Campile, New Ross, County Wexford.</P>
    <P>Cavan-Monaghan Rural Development Co-op Society Ltd., c/o Teagasc, Ballyhaise, County Cavan.</P>
    <P>Arigna Catchment Area Community Co., Drumduss North, Drumshanbo, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>IRD Duhallow/West Cork Leader Co-op., c/o Teagasc, Farranlea Road, Cork.</P>
    <P>South West Mayo Rural Development Group, c/o Castlebar Community Development Association, Moneen Enterprise Centre, McHale Road, Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Offaly County Development Team, Courthouse, Tullamore, County Offaly.</P>
    <P>CRESP South Kerry Action, Community Office, IDA Industrial Estate, Valentia Road, Cahirciveen, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Tipperary Enterprise, 43 Parnell Street, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The total grant aid involved is £35 million <Col N="549" /> (£21 million EC and £14 million national) which will be matched by a roughly similar sum to be raised by the groups themselves.  As the allocation of funds within their operational areas will be a matter for the groups themselves, it is not possible to give a break-down of grants on a county basis.</P>
    <P>The number of jobs to be created under the Leader programme will depend on the nature of the investments to be undertaken by the groups who will commence operating shortly.</P>
    <P>Leader is the EC's own initiative on rural development, which runs to the end of 1993.  Any similar initiative after that time will depend on an evaluation of the current programme.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme a weekly supplement can be paid towards rent and mortgage interest payments.  Such supplements may be paid where the rent or mortgage interest exceeds £3.50 per week.  As a general rule the supplement is calculated so that the person has, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance less £3.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the supplementary welfare <Col N="553" /> allowance scheme in the Dublin area, that the person concerned was refused a mortgage supplement as his income after mortgage interest payments, exceeds the appropriate level.</P>
    <P>Assistance with arrears of mortgage payments can only be given in exceptional circumstances.  The board has been asked to examine this question and to advise the applicants of the outcome.</P>

    <P>The figures for 1991 are estimates prepared by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady decline in the number of strikes and days lost since the early eighties and in particular since 1988. This clearly reflects the influence of the consensus-based approach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="556" /> Progress</i> which have helped to create a more positive industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>A number of other factors such as the difficult employment situation and the climate of realism which it has engendered, better communication between management and employees and the realisation of the need for greater efficiency and flexibility in a very competitive marketplace have also made an important contribution.</P>
