    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, these questions were originally to have been taken on Wednesday last and have since been overtaken, of course, by my statement on the economy in the House on Thursday last.  In that statement, I dealt comprehensively with the issues raised in the questions.  I do not, therefore, propose to repeat all that I said on Thursday last but I will highlight the following key points.</P>
      <P>Since 1987, as a result of the policies we have been so successfully pursuing, we have managed to restore the public finances and the economy to their present strength while, at the same time, we succeeded in increasing employment at an annual average growth rate that is seven times faster than the average for the past 30 years.  The numbers in employment now are higher than at any time over the past ten years, but that is not enough. We need to do much more.  We need to take heart from these considerable achievements and not allow ourselves to be overcome by self-defeatist attitudes.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken a wide ranging series of employment initiatives in recent weeks.  I provided details of these in my Statement in the House on Thursday last.  The Government has in this way shown its commitment and clear determination to take all possible measures to accelerate employment creation and reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>I already dealt with the useful meeting which we had with the social partners on 3 September.  Copies of the agreed press statement which was issued after that meeting have been laid before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the more important conclusions from this meeting is that the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are now examining, at my request, new strategies and measures within the framework of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase employment and will be submitting their recommendations to the Government by the end of this month.  For my part, I have <Col N="851" /> given an undertaking to the social partners that these recommendations will be fully, carefully and quickly considered by the Government as soon as they are received.</P>
    <P>The Government is, therefore, actively engaged in complementing and reinforcing all existing employment creation measures with new concerted efforts and strategies.  However, this must be and is being firmly set within the framework of the budgetary disciplines and policies we have been pursuing so successfully with the agreement of the social partners and with such good results since 1987.</P>
    <P>There can be no question of increasing Government borrowing, as has been suggested in certain quarters.  All of us in this House are aware of the disastrous consequences associated with such policies. I would hope that we are all resolved that these mistakes will never be repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very serious position facing every family in this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> unemployment would the Taoiseach clarify for the House in regard to the £100 million &mdash; in relation to which an announcement was made in early summer &mdash; and also in view of the deteriorating position occasioned by the currency crisis in recent weeks what, if any, amount of those £100 million have been drawn down, by whom and on what basis those sums of money will be made available to industry?  In view of the concern expressed yesterday by the EC Competition Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, perhaps the Taoiseach would say whether he is satisfied that the £50 grant per worker to exporting companies will be sustainable on the basis of the Government announcement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the marketing development fund set up last week comes within the rules and regulations of the EC; at least that was my information as of the other day.  In relation to the enterprise fund which was announced, not in early summer but on <Col N="852" /> 26 August at the first meeting of the Government after the summer recess, that is to be decided on and distributed as projects are brought forward through the enterprise partnership boards that will be set up in every county.  I might add that in some counties there will be more than one to ensure local community focus thereon.  I should say the whole structure has been worked out in consultation with the social partners, Departments and agencies concerned.  I expect that the first enterprise partnership boards will be set up early in November. As I have said already, that timetable stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate what steps the Government has taken to ascertain how the jobs training and subsidy schemes announced by Government a number of times can be improved so that the expected places will be filled?  I understand that to date a tiny fraction only of those places have been taken up.  Would the Taoiseach indicate what steps have been taken to improve those schemes and what has been their take-up compared with their targeted take-up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the training scheme I and the Minister for Labour had a meeting with all the social partners when both sides put forward their views on how the overall position could be improved, and it was pointed out that bureaucracy was standing in the way in certain circumstances.  We have already cleared that matter with Brussels. The scheme is now being implemented on the lines suggested by both sides.  Consequently, I expect its up-take will improve.  The subsidy scheme for employment is progressing fairly well. There was a quiet period in late July and the month of August, in the holiday period, but the uptake is accelerating.  I will obtain details later on and send them to the Deputy.  I should say that the employment take-up is in the region of 4,000 at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach <Col N="853" /> accept that we are at present confronted by an unemployment crisis of unprecedented proportions?  Would he say whether he has so far received any advice on the number of extra jobs that will be lost as a result of the recent 3 per cent increase in interest rates?  Does he accept that if we are to hold out any hope of turning the tide, a comprehensive approach to jobs is necessary and I should like him to comment on two aspects. First, does he see the need for a jobs Bill which would trawl through various previous Bills to remove unnecessary regulatory restraint on enterprise?</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is an appalling situation in regard to investment in enterprise. Virtually tax-free investment in special deposit accounts will be available from 1 January, meaning that anyone who wants to invest in enterprise would be lunatic, because of the attractions of these special accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked about seven questions.  I will try to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>His question was as good as the Taoiseach's long reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can see the size of the brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>And still no jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  The Deputy must not have been listening to what I said.  The numbers in employment now are higher than at any time in the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have succeeded in increasing employment at an average annual growth rate which is seven times higher than the average for the past 30 years.  As I said, that is not enough, we must do more.  That is a recognition of the size of the problem.  I always recognised it.  Every possible initiative &mdash; we have a list of them &mdash; will be taken. <Col N="854" /> Surely I do not have to go through them again.  The Minister for Finance has announced two years free from PRSI for employers to try to give some impetus to job creation.  We have implemented recommendations in the Culliton Report. There are increases in community development and vocational training and education schemes.  We are going through every Department to find what new initiatives can be taken and to take out any obstacles or hurdles or any over-bureaucratic procedures in creating a single job.  We have the enterprise fund which is filling a vacuum.  There was never a supportive environment for local enterprise to help people who want to create a small business that would give five or ten jobs.  There was consistent criticism that there was no equity in the supportive environment.  There will be, under the new partnership boards.  If any Member has any new ideas we would be only too delighted to have those ideas examined.  We would like to see the party opposite participate in the Oireachtas committee.  If they do not wish to participate, let them send any ideas they have to the committee for examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to interest rates, I am glad to say that sterling has stabilised again in the past couple of days. Today at lunchtime it was down to about 103.45 and it is continuing in the right direction.  The way to get down interest rates is the way we have been pursuing and no other way.  We must take a firm stand on our exchange rate policy, convince the markets and the investors that that is the way it is and that is the way it is going to be.  That is beginning to show results in the past few days.  In relation <Col N="855" /> to mortgage holders, the Minister for the Environment is engaged in continuing discussions with the building societies and banks to ensure that customers may be able to have additional payments capitalised. I expect the Minister will make an announcement in that regard in the next few days.  The number of jobs that may be lost due to the effects of the currency crisis is not determinable at this stage.  We will help exports in every way possible.  I do not have numbers, as I am sure the Deputy has not.</P>

      <P>Investment in equities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the negative impact which the increase in interest rates has on employment creation, is the Taoiseach sticking to his original view that the increase in interest rates is temporary? Can he give an outline as to when they might be reduced?  Will he confirm whether it is his view that Irish interest rates will not be reduced until German interest rates are reduced?  Is he aware that in his statement to the House last Thursday he referred to semi-State companies like Coillte as being active in job creation.  The opposite is correct.  Bodies like Coillte are shedding jobs and have been doing so for a number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was well aware that there were temporary lay-offs in various areas and many of those jobs will return again in the future.  In regard to interest rates, I have available to me only the information which is available to everybody else in trying to forecast where interest rates will go.  I have said that the decisive policy adopted by the Government is beginning to show signs of results this week.  If that continues we will get to the point where interest rates can be reduced.  It is unlikely that Irish interest rates can be reduced until the Germans bring down theirs, but if a situation arises where it is possible the Central Bank will undoubtedly take the opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach <Col N="856" /> agree that he is being selective in the quoting of figures?  Does he agree specifically that in three of the past four years employment has fallen?  Does he agree that unemployment has risen for 25 consecutive months?  Does he accept that youth unemployment has grown by 55 per cent in the past two years?  In reply to Question No. 70, will he specifically indicate what initiatives he proposes for the young unemployed, apart from the 143 people in the youth training scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that many of us feel that what he is saying on behalf of the Government about the jobs crisis is merely giving the appearance of activity rather than actual constructive action to cope with the crisis?  If he is so confident about what he <Col N="857" /> is doing, would he tell us his projections for unemployment for the next six or 12 months?  Then we might have some confidence or otherwise in this programme he puts before us as an answer to the crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement and the recognition of how much has been achieved in the past five years.  I also welcome the fact that the Taoiseach is inviting ideas as to where <Col N="858" /> employment could be created.  In taking up that invitation, I suggest that we could tackle two major social problems, unemployment and inadequate local authority housing, if we were to divert some of that £100 million mentioned by the Taoiseach, and also some of our savings in borrowings this year as a result of the very good budget brought in by the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the question of diverting some of the savings from the National Treasury Management Agency into job creation, we have already directed £50 million from such savings into the enterprise fund so the suggestion is being taken up in that regard.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there is widespread concern about the possible loss of jobs in many firms which have been affected by depreciation not just of sterling but the Italian lira and the US dollar?  Is the Taoiseach further aware that there is concern at the indication by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the proposed £50 per week scheme to help just those affected by sterling is possibly contrary to EC law?  Will the Taoiseach check the conflict between what he said today about that and what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said when he was announcing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had made it clear that the most recent advice I have, which is some days old, is that the market development fund is in accordance with EC policy.  I will certainly check it again to see if there are any further developments in relation to it.  The market development fund does not specifically refer to sterling.  It also refers to the <Col N="861" /> devaluation of the lira and the peseta or any other areas which have caused problems for exporters as a result of devaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that even though the European Commission might have no objection to the market development fund, it is possible for any exporter in another country who feels unfairly treated by our £50 per week scheme to complain to the European Court and that that can be a potential risk for us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard it as a serious risk at the moment although it is possible for anyone to complain to the European Commission about any policy being pursued by a member state.  I would draw the attention of the Deputy and the House to the fact that there is an employment subsidy scheme already approved by Brussels and the Commission to pay £54 per week to people in employment.  The criteria having been fulfilled, it is difficult to see how the market development fund might be outside the criteria.</P>

      <P>The Government agrees its legislative intentions for each session at the commencement of the session and the Government Chief Whip has provided the Opposition Whips with a list of the Government's proposals for this session.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the legislative programme is discussed by the Whips on a regular basis.  From time to time matters arise which require urgent attention and while the Government, in the main, works to a planned programme, account must be taken of developments as they arise.</P>

      <P>I specifically asked the Taoiseach in relation to the Norris case and the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights which judged we were in breach of the Convention on Human Rights.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when it is intended to deal with that issue?  I notice from the list of proposed Bills for this session that it is not listed at all, although there was a commitment given by the Irish Ambassador that it would be introduced by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter on a number of occasions in this House. The Criminal Law (Homosexual Offences) Bill referred to by the Deputy is in the course of preparation.  It is most unlikely to be finalised this session.  There is a long list of Bills being prepared by the Department of Justice at the moment totalling about 22.  I am sure the Deputy will be aware that priority is being given to Bills that have to be introduced in this House to fulfil the commitment of the House and of political leaders to the referendum in relation to travel and information and the substantive issue of abortion and in relation to the White Paper on Marriage Breakdown.  Apart from those three Bills, there are 19 other Bills to be dealt with.  The drafting of the Bill to which the Deputy referred will not be completed this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the Bill to be drafted? <Col N="863" /> It cannot be a very complicated Bill.  We are talking about the 1861 Act which criminalises homosexual acts between adult men. Surely it is not a huge drafting problem to produce a Bill which decriminalises homosexual activity between adult men.  Given that we are in breach of a Convention which we solemnly signed and ratified, surely the Taoiseach would regard that as a priority?  I would also point out to the Taoiseach that it is estimated that about 10 per cent of our population could be affected by this gap in our legislation. Does he not regard that as a matter of priority, accepting fully the matters he has outlined as being matters of priority? Can we at least have an indication that this matter will be dealt with before the end of the next session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this session is as I have already outlined to the Deputy.  There are Bills which have been given priority by the Government in regard to publication this session. There are also Bills in relation to family law that we want to see brought forward and processed through this House at the earliest opportunity.  This will not be taken this session, nor will it be ready to be taken this session.  The Government decide what priority must be given to different legislation before each session commences.</P>

      <P>In relation to this promised legislation, does the Taoiseach accept that this House, and the Government in particular, have obligations in relation to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights?  Secondly, can the Taoiseach assure this House that he, as Leader of Fianna Fáil and of the Government, is confident that his own party will accept, allow and provide support in this House for legislation to decriminalise homosexuality?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I visited the United States from 12 to 18 September 1992.  The primary purpose of my visit was to encourage increased US investment in Ireland across a range of economic sectors, including industry, tourism, technology transfer, as well as exports to the US.  To this end, I had meetings in New York, San Jose and San Francisco with business executives of major US corporations whose companies are potential investors in Ireland or are considering investment projects here.</P>
      <P>In New York I also met with the Board of New York University which is establishing a Centre for Irish Studies at the University.  I met with the Secretary-General of the United Nations for a discussion on issues of current world concern, including Yugoslavia and Somalia as well as the upcoming visit by President Robinson.  At a meeting with the Heads of our semi-State bodies in New York, I heard their views on development matters and I emphasised the Government's intention to proceed rapidly with the establishment of an Ireland House which would bring together in one location all our semi-State bodies and the Consulate-General. I regard this project as an important element in giving a greater focus in the United States to Ireland's attractions as a location for investment, tourism, trade, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my primary aims while in New York was to seek the co-operation and participation of a number of prominent Irish-American business people in the establishment of an Irish-American economic <Col N="866" /> advisory board which would help identify new opportunities and companies who might like to invest in Ireland in the industrial or services sectors, including tourism and financial services, or engage in technology transfers with Irish companies or be interested in purchasing goods and components from Ireland.  I explained to the group that, as well as helping the identification of such possibilities, I would like to see them help to develop these through their personal knowledge and contacts.  I envisage that the board would meet periodically, say three or four times a year, in the Irish Embassy in Washington under the Chairmanship of a Government Minister or the Irish Ambassador to the United States.  The State agencies based in the United States would attend these meetings to discuss and explore specific possibilities.</P>
    <P>Individual contacts could also be arranged outside the regular Board meetings. The Irish-American business figures warmly welcomed and readily agreed to my proposal which they described as one long needed.  The establishment of the advisory board is now being actively pursued by our Ambassador in Washington.</P>
    <P>The board represents an extremely powerful, influential and knowledgeable force which could help the United States economy to grow abroad and help the Irish economy to grow faster so that we can reduce the unacceptably high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In San Jose, I spoke to a large and influential grouping of Chairmen and Chief Executives of American corporations in Silicon Valley on the benefits to both the US and Ireland of US investment in Ireland, as a member of the European Community.  A number of these corporations are already in active negotiations with the IDA about setting up operations in Ireland and I expect some positive announcements over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>During my visit to San Francisco I addressed the American-Ireland Fund, the Commonwealth Club and World Affairs Council and performed the official opening of the Exibition of Old <Col N="867" /> Master European Paintings from the National Gallery of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The promotion of investment in the Irish economy was the primary aim of my visit to the United States.  I am satisfied that a sizeable number of new jobs will be created as a result of my visit.  I avail, of course, of every opportunity that arises during visits abroad to advance Ireland's economic development.  The visit to the US was my first with this as the primary objective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> As to the other countries I have visited, I should say that the same objective applies to my contacts abroad with foreign leaders and businessmen.  The countries I have visited since taking up office last February and the time spent on the visits is indicated in the following schedule. As Deputies will see, the countries include &mdash; in addition to the US &mdash; Britain, Brazil, Portugal, Finland and Spain.</P>

      <P>What is the membership of the board and who has appointed them, or can anybody join?  Is there any Government funding for this board and under what heading will funding be provided?

      <P>In regard to the advisory board, no funds are required for it. The people that I invited to discuss this idea with me are very prominent Irish-American business people.  I do not have to list out the names here; many of them would be familiar to all the Deputies in the House.  They will be called together in the embassy in Washington, the idea being that they have a lot of financial muscle and intelligence operations within their own companies; many of them are directors on other boards throughout the United States and would also have knowledge of developments that can take place.  They can be of immense help to the IDA or SFADCo by putting their weight behind them to get investment to come to Ireland.  At the end of the day, if we are as good as <Col N="869" /> the next it sometimes takes extra push, influence and muscle to try to get industries to locate here, and the same sort of pressure is exerted by other countries to entice international investment to their countries.  No funds are required in this regard.  They have all willingly said to me that they are quite happy to participate and be of maximum help to us in the difficult job ahead of us.  This is the first time they have been brought together to try to co-ordinate their efforts and to have free and open discussion between them as to how better results for Ireland might be achieved.  In relation to the question of announcements regarding specific projects, I expect announcements to be made over the next number of weeks in relation to some of the projects that I discussed with either the chairmen or the chief executives of some of the corporations I met.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach tell us if he sees some value in these whistle stop tours he has engaged in?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, is going out to visit the same people this week and we have the same sort of flurry around Saint Patrick's Day. I put it to the Taoiseach that all they are doing is boosting the high profile of the so-called job creation agencies abroad, that it is a good PR exercise and nothing more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can ask me that question in a couple of weeks time if, in the meantime, he does not see an announcement or two relating to substantial job numbers.  If the Deputy thinks that these visits are not necessary, he should talk to somebody out there who is trying to secure international investment against opposition such as the British Royal Family and top influential <Col N="870" /> people from any country.  We are trying to promote Ireland as an attractive location <i>vis-á-vis</i> other countries.  I can tell the Deputy that it is not a wasted effort and if he thinks that it is a holiday I invite him to examine my itinerary for that week on both the east and west coast of America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the specific strictures in the Culliton report on the approach we have adopted towards foreign industry, if on this occasion he took any special measures to ensure greater linkages of the companies we were endeavouring to attract and the economy?  May I ask him, specifically, if he is conscious of the fact that of all the companies based in Ireland the US companies have the weakest linkages and that only 19 pence out of every pound in export earnings from these companies goes towards either workers' wages or further orders for Irish business? Bearing that in mind, has the Taoiseach taken any special initiative to ensure greater linkages between American companies coming here and the Irish economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware that, since I took over this job, I have appointed a special economic adviser to my Department, and he has attached priority to the question of improved linkages.  He is tackling that area on the basis of the semi-State sector in the first instance and of attracting international investment to Ireland.  However I do not think we can point the finger at the United States companies who set up here.  Nobody could say that we, as a nation, have availed of all the opportunities that are available to us in relation to the question of linkages; there is much room for job creation throughout all the sectors involved in so far as US investment is concerned.  We must try to improve out performance.  In relation to goods and services we supply only 25 per cent to 26 per cent of the market. Thousands of jobs could be created in that area but we have to do this ourselves and should not expect companies coming <Col N="871" /> here to do it for us.  Everybody will cooperate with us but we have to get our act together.  We have not done that very successfully up to now.  In relation to research and development, American companies tend to concentrate this activity at one location.  However, we are making slow progress in some respects in that regard.  To complement that area we will have to improve our back-up infrastructure. Otherwise, as I said, the US will continue to keep that activity in the United States where they have everything together.</P>

      <P>In his initial reply the Taoiseach said it was not necessary for him to list the people involved in this advisory board.  May I ask him, therefore, what precisely is the status of the board?  Calling it a board implies some <Col N="873" /> official status.  Is this a private or an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement or, given that they are going to meet in the Irish Embassy, are they to have some official status?

They will meet perhaps three or four times a year at no cost to the Exchequer.  These people will be generous with their time though so far as they are concerned time is money.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with me, as someone who has been on trips like this, that while these are extremely useful exercises, it is entirely misleading to pretend that any jobs accrue to this country solely or mainly as a result of discussions either with Taoisigh or Ministers; that, instead they accrue as a result of painstaking efforts on the part of a large number of people? Would the Taoiseach agree also that while the value of such visits is important, it should not be overstated and certainly should not be associated with the promise of 1,000 jobs or with any given number of jobs as emanating solely from such a visit?  Such promises create cynicism and nothing more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course these visits are important.  The Deputy might talk to <Col N="874" /> Deputy Carey and convince him, too, that they are important, given that he does not seem to attach any importance to them.</P>

      <P>Industrial investment is attracted following much work by many people.  However, I cannot accept Deputy Bruton's assertion that a meeting between the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the head of the Government with the real decision maker cannot make a difference.  In my experience on some occasions this has made the difference. I will leave it to other Ministers to make their own judgment.  Certainly, on one occasion, during my last visit such discussion made all the difference.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the evidence given to the meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts on 9 July 1992, of the serious staff shortages in the Office of the Attorney General, as a result of which two retired barristers had to be recruited to assist the parliamentary drafting section; if it is intended to recruit additional permanent staff to speed up the drafting of legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sanction has been given for the recruitment of two additional Parliamentary Draftsmen and it is planned to hold the necessary competition within the next few weeks.  I am satisfied that these appointments will ameliorate the problem which was mentioned at the meeting of the Public Accounts Committee.  The two barristers referred to in the Deputy's question had formerly occupied the positions of head of the Parliamentary Draftsman's office and head of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation office, in the Attorney General's office.  Their unequalled experience&mdash;each has had some 40 years experience as a draftsman&mdash;has meant <Col N="875" /> that in addition to current drafting work they have been available to train more recently recruited staff and this is of considerable benefit to the State's drafting service.</P>

      <P>My purpose in putting down this question was not in any way to criticise the competence of the barristers concerned but simply to clarify what precisely is the Government's policy in relation to the drafting section.  For the ten years I have been in this House I have been constantly told that there is a backlog of work in the drafting office. Will the Taoiseach indicate how many people are currently employed full-time in the Attorney General's drafting office? Does he consider that the appointment of two additional personnel will be sufficient to deal with the backlog that exists?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under study in my Department and the Attorney General's advice has been obtained.  That advice indicates that the Supreme Court judgment, which prohibits the revealing of discussions occurring during the course of a meeting of the Government, applies to all documents of the type at issue irrespective of age. Since, however, it is rarely, if ever, that official files or the minutes of Government indicate the content of discussions at Government meetings, it is not expected that the judgment will place a restriction on the transfer to the National Archives or the opening to the public of such documents.  The only effect will be that this criterion of the confidentiality of Government discussions will have to be taken into account by Departments in their assessment of files for transfer to the National Archives.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the question of discussions or details of discussions are not normally included in the minutes of Government. Consequently the problem that he fears <Col N="877" /> will arise in relation to archives will not arise.  What we are saying in effect is that Departments, in preparing to send documents to the National Archives, have to take into consideration that aspect and ensure that the documents they are releasing do not contain details of discussions that took place at Cabinet.</P>

      <P>Because the National Association of Regional Game Councils sought a judicial review of the matter the Minister decided to withdraw the invitation to them to participate in the committee.

      <P>The Deputy has not the correct facts.  When I was re-appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for wildlife by the Taoiseach and the Government last February there was no wildlife advisory council in office.  I had several consultations and meetings with the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  I made a specific offer to a member of that association and I made a general offer to all the members of that body.  The individual offer was not accepted, the general offer was initially accepted and later withdrawn.  I proceeded to appoint the Wildlife Advisory Council, as is my statutory function under section 13 (7) of the Act, and I am satisfied that I was correct in doing so.

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that at a meeting on 11 March between the NARGC and the Minister, that association agreed to postpone the judicial review?  On 3 July, four months later, when nothing had been done they decided to re-enter their case and the Minister issued a letter to them in which he effectively booted them from the board.  He proceeded to set up a NARGC, made up of a hotch-potch of basically heritage people who in most <Col N="879" /> cases know nothing whatever about the remit of the NARGC.  There are 21,685 members in this association who contribute £500,000 by way of revenue in gun licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally reject what Deputy Higgins has said.  The members of the National Heritage Council are esteemed people in their various professions and contributors to public affairs.  The Wildlife Advisory Council are not made up of a hotch-potch of any group of individuals; they are very fine people.  Section 13 (7) of the Wildlife Act, 1976 states:</P>
      <P>The members of the Council shall be appointed by the Minister and shall include such number of persons, by reason of their knowledge or experience of, or interest in, agriculture, fisheries, field sports, the conservation of wildlife or some other science, as he considers will ensure that the Council will assist materially in the furtherance of wildlife conservation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that I have fulfilled all aspects of that subsection.  I do not know how the Deputy knows what went on at meetings between myself and the National Association of Regional Game Councils in either March or July.  Legal action was initiated by the NARGC before I was appointed to office.  On my suggestion at their March meeting the NARGC agreed to postpone action. However, they were not prepared to give me sufficient time to conclude my work and therefore I took my decision.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>the action, if any, he has taken, particularly in the light of the worsening economic situation, to implement the recommendations of the Culliton Report in so far as they refer to the reduction of the costs of energy for industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government has taken on board the broad thrust of the Culliton recommendations and established a task force to advise on the implementation of those recommendations and any further measures considered as appropriate by the task force.  In effect, the role of the task force is to develop with the Government Departments involved an action plan for the different policy areas.  A first report of the task force has been approved by the Government but does not include energy policy.</P>
      <P>Recommendations for an action plan in areas within my area of responsibility are included in a second report of the task force which is expected to be considered by the Government shortly.  It is not possible, therefore, at this stage, to supply the information requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not say why all the recommendations of the Culliton Report have not been implemented, beyond saying that a plan has not yet been prepared.  Will he agree that the terms of the Culliton Report threaten the continuation of the strong relationship which existed between the ESB and Bord na Móna and indeed the Whitegate Refinery?  If the terms of section 5.2 of the Culliton Report are implemented there will be a serious threat to jobs.  If we ignore the social implication in this section there will be a repetition of what happened in Lullymore where 100 jobs have been lost to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the recommendation in the report are being examined and the task force set up by the Government recently looked at the second report which covers the energy areas covered by Culliton.  These are still under discussion and, therefore, I do not <Col N="882" /> feel free to elaborate on what steps might be taken.  The matters raised by the Deputy were dealt with in the Culliton Report and they referred to the diseconomy arising from the mandatory regime operating at Whitegate and they raised the issue of the ESB subsidy to Bord na Móna for the supply of peat. These matters have been of concern to the Department &mdash; and to various Ministers who have held office &mdash; for some time and one should not jump to conclusions in regard to what steps will be taken.  The Government is fully conscious of its social obligations in regard to certain matters and I have confirmed, on a number of occasions, its commitment to the future use of peat in energy and in fuel mix.  It would be improper to raise unnecessary concerns at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister mentioned that consideration would be given to Bord na Móna, there is no reference to what might happen in Whitegate. Again, in section 5.2 of the Culliton Report, it is proposed that the ESB could import cheaper fuel, which undermines the whole thrust of Culliton; it is a contradiction because something which was set up to create jobs is now suggesting a means whereby jobs could be lost.  If there is not investment in Whitegate it is quite likely that they will not be able to keep abreast of developments in the petroleum industry.  This should be borne in mind when consideration is being given to this matter.  I also find it very strange&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the time factor.  It is strange that one Government Department has not dealt with the section of the Culliton Report which applies to them.  Other Departments have produced reports but the Minister's Department have not done so. It is not good enough for the Minister to <Col N="883" /> say that they have not yet looked at the Culliton Report.  I would have thought that somebody would have been detailed to examine it and to come up with an answer.</P>

      <P>I am merely informing the Deputy of the factual position in regard to the task force set up by the Government. I certainly did not intend to give the impression that my Department have not looked carefully at the Culliton recommendations in regard to energy. The areas which they identified have all been highlighted before now and the difficulties mentioned in the report are not new.  I have been occupied for quite some time trying to find a way in which to address these matters.  It gives a wrong impression to mention one part of the Culliton Report in regard to Whitegate and not to mention the other because the report refers to the need to give consideration to upgrading the Whitegate Oil Refinery.  I have indicated on numerous occasions in the House that we are attempting to do that and a subsequent question will refer to that very matter.  It is wrong to seek to create unnecessary fears in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 59, 68, and 99 together.</P>
      <P>My Department and INPC are continuing to seek a partner for investment in the refinery and Whiddy terminal with the objective of achieving commercial operation.</P>
      <P>The discussions with a specific party in relation to Whitegate to which I referred earlier this year, have not produced a satisfactory outcome.  As soon as I realised that these talks were not likely to produce agreement, I decided to widen the scope of our search.  INPC have, therefore, in conjunction with my Department, employed a leading adviser on merger and acquisitions in the European energy sector and particularly the oil industry to assist in identifying and negotiating with an investor/partner to invest in upgrading Whitegate and achieving commercial operation there.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Whiddy terminal, while every effort is being made to attract suitable investment which would enable its full reactivation, no realistic proposal has emerged to date.  However, over 200,000 tonnes of crude oil were placed there in late 1990.  Furthermore, extensive refurbishment work costing £1.88 million, and for which the EC has agreed to contribute 50 per cent, has been carried out over the past 18 months and is nearing completion.  This work will make the facility more attractive for investment.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply is very disappointing.  What happened to the finance raised from the sale of Tara Mines two years ago?  It was then indicated <Col N="885" /> that this money would be used to upgrade Whitegate.  Why has this not been done?  Is the money still earmarked for Whitegate?  Will the Minister also indicate the cost to the economy as a result of the delay in upgrading Whitegate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was estimated by the Fair Trade Commission some years ago that the diseconomy involved amounted to less than 2p per litre in the case of petrol and diesel, about £10 million per annum.  A Government decision is still in existence in regard to how the money obtained by the State on the sale of Tara Mines would be utilised.  The decision was that the moneys available would go towards the cost of carrying out an upgrading at Whitegate if and when such a decision was made.  I have indicated that the intention is to seek a joint investor &mdash; or an investor who may be interested in a substantial part of the plant &mdash; to contribute to the cost of carrying out this upgrading.</P>
      <P>The State's contribution, as determined by the Government decision, will be at least the $25 million which was then determined to be available.  However, the ongoing discussions to date have been disappointing because positive proposals have not emerged in the discussions we have had with different interested parties which I felt I could recommend to the Government or to this House.  In respect of whatever joint ventures were entered into, the House would expect me to ensure an equal sharing of the risks involved as well as any benefits derived from such an investment.  Until such a proposal is negotiated I shall not be in a position to come back to the House on the matter.</P>

      <P>Further to the Minister's reply, can he tell me when the new people were appointed to give him advice on this issue and when he expects to receive a report from them?  Can he give an assurance that no jobs at the Whitegate enterprise are under threat due to the delay in the upgrading of facilities there?</P>

      <P>There is certainly no immediate threat to any jobs in the Whitegate facility.  In fact, the purpose of my actions and my intent in this matter is the opposite.  I am seeking to ensure the continuation of the Whitegate operation and thereby ensure the security of employment at that facility.  The international firm of consultants were appointed some months ago &mdash; and I could provide the Deputy with the exact date if that is required &mdash; and I expect them to report to me either late in December or early in January.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>the level of energy savings that have been achieved in the public sector in the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The public sector, as the Deputy is aware, encompasses a very wide area and no overall survey has been carried out.  Rather than survey such a wide area, which I am not satisfied would be cost effectve, energy conservation work has been concentrated in selected areas.</P>
      <P>For instance, in my own Department, the installation of energy efficient light fittings has resulted in a 40 per cent saving on lighting costs in the past year.  Other initiatives included the surveying of hospitals which outlined the possibilities for energy savings in these installations. This was followed up by practical examples in our Lady's Children's Hospital in Dublin and University College Hospital in Galway.  Examinations have also been carried out in Central Government Buildings and universities, which highlighted the possibilities for savings in these areas too.  Nevertheless, there is considerable further potential for energy savings in the public sector and I will continue to press for the identification and implementation of such measures as are economically and technically feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example of the kind of action the Department has taken, tomorrow <Col N="887" /> week I will be opening a seminar on new energy technologies for commercial and public sector buildings, which has been organised on behalf of the Department of Energy by Eolas.  The ESB is also participating in this.  It is just one further example of the practical measures which I am encouraging to ensure that the energy conservation message is understood and implemented in the public sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Department of Energy organised an energy audit on activities of public bodies to identify areas suitable for savings?  Has the Department issued a directive to all public bodies to investigate the possibility of energy savings and to carry out such savings?  Is the Department prepared to provide the finance that may be necessary for public bodies to save energy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is continuously in touch with other Government Departments in the matter of the potential for energy saving.  It is in close consultation with the Office of Public Works in relation to specific proposals that may be followed and measures that may be taken to accelerate the implementation and achievement of energy conservation.</P>
      <P>Energy audits have been carried out on a sectoral basis.  The proposals and recommendations that emerged from examination of those audits are disseminated through the holding of seminars to others carrying out like activities in the private and the public sectors.  In this regard Eolas play a major role on behalf of the Department of Energy.  Of course, the Office of Public Works seek to achieve the highest standards of energy efficiency in all new buildings, and the new buildings regulations make a major contribution there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is room for substantial savings in the public and the private sectors.  Much greater action needs to be taken at personal level and local level on the part of each citizen, each commercial enterprise and each industry.  It is somewhat difficult to get <Col N="888" /> that message across at a time when fuel prices are low compared to what they have been in the past.  However, my Department continues to promulgate that message.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the pace of energy savings in Ireland been less than half that in other European countries?  Is the Minister prepared to make energy conservation a priority in his Department because of the damaging effect that the wasteful use of energy can have on the competitiveness of our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to warn the Deputy about the dangers of drawing conclusions from some of the international comparisons that have been recently quoted in the newspapers.  I should be pleased to communicate with the Deputy in relation to some of those figures and show her that the position in Ireland is better than it would seem.  As I have already indicated, there is still need for much improvement.  Energy conservation can be a very costly exercise and funds are not freely available at the present time in order to undertake much of the promotional work I would like to undertake or to introduce incentive schemes I would like to have in place in order to accelerate our energy conservation programme.  The matter will be kept under constant review.</P>

In that light I have to ask the Taoiseach why it was that he did not draw to my attention &mdash; and presumably to the attention of the other party leaders &mdash; the fact that the Government had been advised by the Attorney General, as we now know, that they would need to have substantive legislation to accompany their proposed amendment on the substantive issue?  Why is it that the Taoiseach who had that advice, and presumably was leading a Government who acted on that advice, did not draw attention to the fact that such legislation was being prepared and would have to be drawn to the attention of the other party leaders in the course of discussions which have taken place since last Wednesday?</P>

I went through that process last week.  I made it clear in this House at all times that I would be as informative and helpful to all the political leaders as I could possibly be, bearing in mind the constraints on me in relation to any discussions that led to the taking of any decisions at Government level.  Every Deputy, and every political leader, in this House knows that quite well.  I do not propose today to make any comment in relation to any story that appeared in any newspaper from an unattributable source.  Everybody knows exactly what is the position, that the document I gave was as informative and as helpful as it could be.  That is what I promised to do in the House and that is what I have done.

I am referring to the fact that the Attorney General advised him, as has been suggested by other leaders and myself, that legislation would be necessary and that legislation would be the only course of action that would remove the doubt from this issue.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could now reconsider his position and make that information available.  It is a fruitless situation unless that information is made available to us.</P>

      <P>I wrote to the Taoiseach yesterday asking if he would make a statement in the Dáil today clarifying the utter confusion that now reigns in relation to the Government's proposal. We have had a series of anonymous Government spokespersons, various Ministers and Ministers of State, all expressing different views as to the intentions of what the Government were about and, indeed, whether the existing wording that the Government propose will continue to be the Government wording. Will the Taoiseach specifically tell us the source of the briefing document which he submitted to myself and the other party leaders in Opposition?  Is the information in yesterday's report correct, that the purpose of including the exclusion of health as a reason for abortion was to avoid a life shortening situation as being a cause for abortion?  The Taoiseach will recall that I was assured by him that that was not the case.</P>

      <P>Do Deputies want me to answer or not?  First, the Government made a decision that this matter will be handled by means of a referendum and not by legislation.  Second, the intention is very clear.  What the substantive issue in the referendum is about is to ask the Irish people whether they want to accept the Supreme Court decision, as given in the X case, as the basis for legalised <Col N="953" /> abortion in Ireland.  Do they want to accept suicide, as a basis for legalised abortion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a simple question. The words, by and large in so far as they could be incorporated in this amendment, are taken from the Supreme Court decision.  When one seeks preciseness and certainty in so far as one can have it in relation to any words, you go to the people who will be the final arbiters of the constitutional amendment.  Incorporating as many of their words as possible into the amendment gives it the greatest level of certainty that one can give it.  The Irish people will decide the issue.  The Irish people are quite clear in their minds as to what is being asked.  We are not changing any iota the tests laid down in the Supreme Court decision.  We are asking the people to decide &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If they decide &ldquo;yes&rdquo; that will be incorporated as an addition to Article 40.3.3.  We all know the words of that Article.  If they vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, as I have said, and I expect it would be the view of most other people, we will have to proceed to deal with the effects of the court case by means of legislation.  That is it.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy John Bruton intervenes again may I say &mdash; and the House will agree &mdash; that I have given quite a good deal of latitude on the Order of Business to this matter in recent days because of its clear gravity. However, I cannot permit the Order of Business to be turned into a mini Question Time on the issue.  I am very conscious, as indeed Members must be, that the Bills in connection with these matters will be coming before the House, I understand, next week and Members will have full and ample scope to give vent to their feelings on the issues.</P>

I will not permit many more questions.

Would the Taoiseach agree that he gave me to believe at our meetings that the only legislation on the substantive issue he had in mind would be legislation which would be introduced if the people rejected the Government's proposed constitutional amendment?  Would he further agree that this conflicts directly with reports we now have that the Attorney General advised the Government that legislation would be needed even if the people accepted the Government's constitutional amendment.

In relation to the documents which he supplied, may I ask the Taoiseach whether these documents came from the Attorney General or whose advice they are?

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  In particular, I welcome changes in the legislation which will bring the Electoral Acts since 1986 up-to-date.  The most important change is the fact that the Minister and the Minister of State have stated that there will be changes in regard to the preparation of the register.  One of the most frequent complaints at election time &mdash; whether a Dáil election, local elections or a referendum &mdash; is the fact that people's names are omitted from the register.  I welcome the proposal to have a different timescale for preparing the register and provision for the publication of a supplement containing the names of qualified electors omitted from the register.  It is difficult to understand why so many mistakes are made when compiling the register, but the publication of a supplement with the names of those omitted will help to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the legislation that in future the Exchequer will meet three-quarters, rather than half, of the cost of preparing the register.  In the past, Government Departments and Ministers have made announcements that local authorities must foot the bill in this regard.  Therefore, I welcome the provision that there will be extra subvention by the Department in regard to the preparation of the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on the question of registration where a person has more than one address.  There are many <Col N="961" /> problems in this regard mainly because the majority of elections take place on Thursdays.  Indeed, the referenda which we have been discussing today are also fixed for a Thursday.  It can be a problem for people to travel long distances in order to vote in their local polling station. It would be advantageous if people were registered in the constituency in which they are studying or working, particularly at the time of a referendum, but I am aware of the Minister's reasoning behind the inclusion of this provision in the legislation. This raises the question why we must hold elections on a weekday.  I believe we should hold elections at weekends as is the case in most European countries where elections are held on Sundays.</P>
    <P>Details of schemes relating to polling arrangements are sent to local authorities every few years.  Under the legislation local authorities will be asked to review the schemes at least once in every ten years.  A number of directives have been issued by the Minister's Department over the past number of years and I remember, in particular, one statement in regard to taking polling stations out of private houses.  That was certainly welcome. We have also had changes regarding disabled voters.  Under this legislation, disabled voters will continue to be registered as special voters, but certain requirements relating to the submission of a medical certificate every year will not be necessary.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that from time to time the Department of the Environment may issue statements to local authorities on how schemes should be operated in the various polling districts.  For example, in 1986 the Department of the Environment issued a circular stating that polling stations should be in the parish or school catchment area concerned.  That would cause many problems in rural areas.  We cannot simply have all polling stations in the local national school.  Many national schools which are at present being used as polling stations are two or three teacher schools; in other words, they have two or three classrooms.  Therefore, a range of <Col N="962" /> polling stations could not be put into small schools.</P>
    <P>It is important that whatever scheme is devised should not impose undue hardship on the electorate.  In the first place, voters should be able to travel to their nearest polling station.  That is not the case at present, particularly in rural areas where voters may have to pass one or two polling stations to get to the polling station named on their voting card.</P>
    <P>In the circular issued in 1986 by the Department of the Environment it was also stated that 700 to 1,000 electors should be the general aim for each polling station.  If there was a requirement to have 1,000 electors per polling station in the Connemara area many people would have to travel at least 20 miles to get to their polling station.  If that requirement were in force in my constituency some people would have to travel ten to 15 miles in order to vote.  The criterion used should be the distance from the polling station and not the number of electors voting in the polling station and I ask the Minister to deal with that issue.</P>
    <P>In regard to the method of election, section 37 of the Bill states that the principle of proportional representation will be the method of voting used in regard to a single transferable vote.  This is probably a matter for further legislation or, indeed, a referendum, but the question of single seat constituencies must be addressed by the Government.  Before we talk of reform of the Dáil and the public service there must be reform of the electoral system.  That should be a priority of the Government.  If we had such reform, together with reform of the public service and the Dáil, we would have an opportunity to tackle the serious economic and social problems which exist.  There are many difficulties in regard to multi-seat constituencies, not only within the constituency but because the constituencies are changed so often.</P>
    <P>A strong case has been made to have the photograph of candidates placed on ballot papers.  I would favour this, although I hope it would not cause further confusion.  In the case of multi-seat constituencies the names of many candidates <Col N="963" /> may appear on the ballot paper. Sometimes there are too many names, bearing in mind the number of spoiled votes that occur at each election.  This places people who genuinely want to vote for a particular party in considerable difficulty, when somebody may insert three Xs in front of Fine Gael, or perhaps Fianna Fáil, candidates, or perhaps even inserting three &ldquo;Is&rdquo;.  One may know that person's intention but it creates a difficulty within a multi-seat constituency. There has been mention of photographs to help people encountering such difficulties.</P>
    <P>There arises also the problem of interpreting a voter's intention when more than one election takes place on the same day &mdash; to which Deputy Bell referred &mdash; in that a voter, or voters, might start voting 1, 2 and 3 and, on another ballot paper, continue to vote 4, 5 and 6. Returning officers may take different views in interpreting such markings, another matter that must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I note that the £100 deposit is being increased to £500, the former figure having been fixed since 1923, obviously necessitating a change.  There is proposed also a different method of determining what justifies the loss of a deposit, I suppose, to compensate for its increased level.  None of us likes to see people losing deposits.  While I find elections enjoyable I do not enjoy the count as much for obvious reasons.</P>

      <P>The 1986 circular I mentioned states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as possible, polling districts in rural areas should comprise complete district electoral divisions.  The district electoral division is the basic administrative unit used for the Census, for the revision of constituencies and local <Col N="964" /> electoral areas and for a variety of other official purposes.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is important to endeavour to achieve that objective, to have polling districts comprised of district electoral divisions but, unfortunately, in practice it does not work out quite like that.</P>
    <P>There have been changes in many constituencies. At the last revision of constituencies 4,000 electors from my constituency of North Galway were transferred to East Mayo and another 4,000 electors transferred to West Mayo whereas, in the previous revision of constituencies, 5,000 electors from North Galway were transferred to the Roscommon constituency.  I shall not go into the reasons therefor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the reason; so do we all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>One clear result of that revision was that district electoral divisions were split.  Current registers give a list of townlands in each constituency, showing that perhaps district electoral division A is included except for, say, X, Y or Z which is most confusing.  This means that one must revert and examine the townlands and district electoral divisions that had obtained prior to that division; in other words townlands should not be defined by exclusion.  It should be clearly stated what are the townlands included in a particular constituency rather than saying &ldquo;all but...&rdquo; Had we not our noses so close to the ground sometimes we might not know exactly which constituencies or counties we represented. Therefore, I agree entirely with the Department advocating that we endeavour to maintain a polling district within the overall district electoral division. This would mean that, in the case of future revisions of constituencies, an entire district electoral division could be transferred into an adjoining constituency or, as in my case, hopefully remain in County Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do not agree with all of the proposed changes.  Usually the basic problem encountered is that the Department <Col N="965" /> tend to treat rural areas as if there were a huge population located there and that there must be, say, between 700 and 1,000 electors to comprise what the Department would regard as a viable polling area.  That criterion will not work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other important changes proposed and wish the Minister and his Minister of State well in their task in revising our electoral laws and system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like so many other Members, I welcome this long overdue Bill.  It is a substantial consolidation Bill dealing, within 123 pages, with a range of issues in regard to how we conduct elections and referenda.  One realises the scope of this Bill when one observes the number of Acts referred to on page ten, some dating back to 1851.  In other words, it will be good to have all of our electoral laws encompassed within this Bill once passed.</P>
      <P>Its main features deal with electioneering at polling stations, the issue on which most attention has been focused.  It is also proposed to increase the deposit from £100 to £500.  Its provisions change the ruling on an elector being registered in more than one constituency, refer to opinion polls and specify the date by which one should register.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provisions of sections 13 to 16, inclusive &mdash; having to do with the register of electors and the changes proposed in this Bill &mdash; our current system of registration of voters has left much to be desired causing voters much bewilderment, particularly first time voters whose 18th birthday may fall after April whenever there is an election pending.  Such voters have not understood why they could not grab the opportunity to which many of them had looked forward for quite some time, to exercise their franchise and who are prevented from so doing because they have not been registered.  It was a slow, cumbersome system that did not allow any flexibility and, in the view of most politicians, had enormous build-in frustrations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions I have observed many otherwise moderate, good humoured, mature people get into <Col N="966" /> a state of awful fury on discovering that their names did not appear on the current register of electors.  All of us will have observed this occurrence many times, which happens through some extraordinary process.  Sometimes we public representatives will discover this when canvassing.  Of course, its rectification will then be too late for that election.  It is even worse when one is approached by a vote at a polling station who is greatly frustrated because he is unable to exercise his franchise.  The vote cannot be restored to such a person at that time, when it becomes an issue of great annoyance. I have always felt that to be enormously unfair given that usually such people could validate their identity, demonstrating they were eligible to vote, had been living in the same house perhaps for the past 20 or 30 years and so on.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered why it was so difficult to restore the vote to such people given that their name had been removed from the register through some bureaucratic mistake.  Of course, many people believe in the conspiracy theory &mdash; that perhaps it was a competing party who removed their name from the register or some sleight of hand that led to their being deprived of that important right to vote.</P>
    <P>Hopefully such instances will be a thing of the past with the development of computers, their usage, print-outs and so on enabling quicker registration of voters which should also eliminate the hitherto necessity for draft registers, awaiting checking and so on.  We should be able to look forward to greater streamlining of our register of electors.  It makes sense to amend existing lists only and to do away with the nonsense of draft registers. Hopefully this new practice will mean that an elector can have his or her name inserted on the register within the duration of any election or referendum campaign and be able to vote.  I am not sure if that is the intention but it would be my hope that that is what is meant, that such registration could take place within, say, three weeks of polling day.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope also that such <Col N="967" /> change would be accompanied by an intensive advertising campaign calling on people to register for voting purposes during an election campaign or, if possible, well before any election date.  It is very tempting to reflect on the idea of making voting compulsory as is the case in other EC countries but I accept that it is not the best way.  Given the nature of some Irish people, they might see it as an opportunity to defy the law.  Short of making it legally obligatory to vote, every incentive should be used, particularly at second level education, to motivate young people to use their vote on every occasion.  This would include education on the PR system and how best to use it. Many of them are still confused and do not understand how the system works.  I have no statistics to show it but I believe young adults do not vote in large numbers. That is an indictment of all of us. They should be made to understand that there is a real link between what happens to them, to their families and community and the way they vote in elections.</P>
    <P>One incentive would have been Sunday voting.  Why was this not considered? It could also be held on a Saturday but Sunday would be the ideal day. It would give a special status to polling day.  It would facilitate working people, so many of whom are discommoded by having to rush home to vote.  It would make it possible for students, commercial travellers and others who are away from home during the week to get back to their own constituency.  It would mean that schoolchildren need not miss a day at school.  It would be a much more sensible arrangement.  If it has not been considered, why?</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this Bill deals with the circus outside polling stations, the hassling of voters when literature is pushed at them by people who sometimes block their way.  The requirement that canvassers must stay 50 metres from the curtilage of a polling station is welcome. I hope this requirement will prove so frustrating for canvassers of all parties that the habit will die a normal and natural death.  I suspect, however, that ways <Col N="968" /> and means will be found to get around the regulations and that some unfortunate people living at the 50-metre remove may be under siege on polling days in the future.  Old practices die hard and years of habit have set a firm trend.  It is a most distressing experience for many voters, such as people who are shy and retiring and do not want to be involved with canvassers seeking their vote.  It must put a lot of people off.  Candidates engage in this practice because the other party do.  If we had a bit of sense we might come to an agreement that we would not do it.  That would be for the better.</P>
    <P>Regarding the increase in the deposit, I accept the reality that the £100 fixed in 1923 is out of line in terms of today's values.  I am pleased that the Minister did not opt for the sum of £3,000 but opted for the more reasonable amount.  I note that conditions for refund of the deposit have changed from one-third to one-quarter of the quota.  I note the various views expressed on this section.  Some people feel that the amount should be higher than £500 in order to discourage candidates of a frivolous nature.  Who is to say what is frivolous?  A matter might be frivolous to us but quite serious to somebody else.  Some years ago some people might have regarded a Green candidate as frivolous.  The same could apply in the future to individuals who would have strikingly unpopular platforms.  We have to be careful in making rules of this kind.  Nobody goes through the process of registering as a candidate and canvassing for three weeks without good intent.  In 1977 when I first became a candidate I went to register and was amazed at how easy it was to be a general election candidate. I have not been really involved in politics until then.  I was pleased the deposit was only £100 and I found everyone involved very helpful and supportive. It must be left as open as that.  Anyone who has a point of view and wants to stand for election should not be debarred by financial considerations.</P>
    <P>I welcome other changes introduced in this Bill.  A candidate is no longer required to have an election agent.  The Bill could have provided for photographs <Col N="969" /> on the ballot paper.  This issue has been discussed many times.  For people who are illiterate or not very literate a photograph would be ideal.  The practice of listing the candidates in alphabetical order should be reviewed.  Perhaps we should look at some system of random selection.  Under the present system there is an inbuilt advantage for candidates whose surnames begin with A, B or C or other letters from the beginning of the alphabet.  Those at the lower end of the alphabet have a more difficult time.  We should look at an alternative to the current system.</P>
    <P>Students in Dublin and the other university cities face a dilemma at election time.  I am sure they all want to vote but it is quite impossible to do so on a week day.  Would it not be a good idea to have some kind of rail pass or other travel concession to give them an incentive to exercise their franchise?  It is important to develop the habit of voting and I am concerned that so many students cannot vote.  It would take a great degree of commitment and involvement to get students to leave their college and to go home to their constituency to vote.</P>
    <P>I regret that this Bill does not deal with the Seanad elections, which should be examined seriously.  We need a more humane system.  Having been a candidate after 1987 in the Seanad elections I was quite exhausted after the campaign.  I wonder why we have not brought about a more realistic election process.  We cannot justifiably continue maintaining in the NUI votes an elitist electorate leaving out Limerick University and DCU graduates and perhaps other third level votes. I hope there is legislation in the pipeline to amend this to give graduates from all third level colleges an opportunity to elect their Senators.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the main changes in the Bill.  I welcome the changes for disabled voters, the change in the register and the change in the electioneering process. It will mean an end to a lot of frustration and I hope it will make election day at the polling station more enjoyable than it has been when I have been a candidate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome the Bill.  Almost all speakers have commented favourably on it.  Many speakers have wanted other issues to be included but, by and large, all the changes, many of them long overdue, are welcome.  When I first got the Bill I was surprised at the number of Acts covering the electoral process.  It is time to rationalise the system.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of this Bill relates to the register of electors.  Many of us have campaigned for changes in this area.  It was appalling that people travelled long distances to a polling station to find that their names had been deleted from the register and they had no comeback.  We were always suspicious that this occurred when the Opposition were in control in certain areas.</P>
      <P>Recently, when I checked the draft register in a rural town in the company of three others, I was amazed to find that 23 people who should have been included on the draft register were not on it.  With the exception of five, they were all young people, first time voters, although a number of them were as many as three years older than the required age.  That is something to worry about and I welcome the change in the register.</P>
      <P>Some speakers in the Seanad were over-critical of the electorate and felt that the electorate should make a greater effort to ensure their registration.  People tend to think that the State has control of this and that they will be automatically included once they reach the required age.  A lot of money is spent at the moment to get people on to the register but the system has not worked well over the years.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by the Minister, Deputy Wallace, that the system is not as deficient as is sometimes suggested. However, it is heart rending to observe people who may have travelled 200 miles to register their votes being told they cannot vote.  I welcome the change.  I agree with the timescale and everything else.  This change was long overdue and I commend the Minister, Deputy Wallace, on piloting this Bill through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now we have had a very liberal <Col N="971" /> system with regard to prospective candidates. The system was held up to ridicule by one candidate who ran in 12 or 13 constituencies for a cost of something a little over £1,000.  I do not know the rationale behind that but that candidate made a mockery of the system.  Once that sort of thing started the onus was on the State to act immediately.  I welcome the change there.  The figures are reasonable. The lowering of the quota at which point one can get a refund of the deposit maintains a balance when increasing the sum to £500.</P>
    <P>Some speakers referred to compulsory voting.  I would oppose that.  Part of the democratic process is the right of every person to opt out of participation in the system.  We would be pushing things too far in insisting that people go to the polling stations to register their opposition on a ballot paper.  We should defend their right to opt out.</P>
    <P>With regard to the right to vote, a query raised recently with me centred around the right of non-nationals to vote in general elections but not in, for instance, a presidential election or a referendum. I would like the Minister to look at that issue.  It might be outside the scope of this Bill but that rule might be changed to ensure that once a person is granted a right to vote here he will be able to vote in all elections or referenda unless it is not feasible due to some internal situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of inconvenience for some of the electorate. That is a point I would like to reinforce. The majority of people when drawing up this type of legislation did not think of rural areas.  During the recent referendum I found that people in Cork south-central had to drive perhaps 20 miles to and from a polling station to register their voters.  This is asking a lot from the electorate.  In the city we would be up in arms until we got polling stations located closer to where we live?  I ask the Minister to consider the point raised by Deputy Kitt <i>vis-à-vis</i> the required number of people needed to warrant a polling station, in a district and we will <Col N="972" /> have to differentiate between rural and urban constituencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt touched on the problem of a candidate finding himself or herself isolated from the general electorate that he or she had served a number of years. This could happen in a five seat constituency, for example, if the Boundaries Commission, for one reason or another, draws a line through a constituency.  This is one of the unsatisfactory aspects of the present system that needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>Generally, people are reluctant to change the rules under which they were elected.  However, most people would agree that there is a need to look at this situation.  I am not saying that we should have change for the sake of change but there is a need for a meaningful and constructive discussion on the topic.  It might be decided eventually to keep the present system or to institute a standard three seat or four seat constituency throughout the country.  This would, of course, require a referendum but it is something we should discuss.</P>
    <P>The item in the Bill that got most public attention is the question of canvassing at polling stations.  There is a general acceptance among all the people involved in elections that this is a total waste of time and people are merely flying the party colours.  People are agreed that canvassing at polling stations is a nuisance, a waste of money producing leaflets, and a source of litter.  This change will be widely welcomed.  Again, there will be some diehards who will miss the excitement but, broadly speaking, even the people who had to stand at the polling stations were at the point where they would have looked for a change once it was applied across the board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in regard to handicapped voters.  An important aspect was the question of registration with the Garda.  A number of people brought to my attention the security aspect; they were worried that they were being highlighted, particularly in isolated areas, by virtue of the fact that they were on the register in a particular category.  I welcome the change in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> The question I would like to ask the Minister is how long a person must be absent from home before his or her name is deleted from the register.  Many who move to the States or to England on a temporary basis presume that their names are left on the register.  A problem has arisen in such circumstances when elderly people have submitted an application for a waiver of charges and have been told that their application does not conform with the voters' register.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify how long a person must be away from the residence before his or her name is deleted from the register?  What is the legal position?</P>
    <P>I understand that central funds will now pick up three-quarters of the cost of the preparation of the register.  Some people say there are only pennies involved but in Cork city the estimate of the cost of the preparation of the voters' register is over £110,000.  The changes the Minister is introducing mean that we can cut that cost quite substantially and that is to be more than welcomed because there was a certain waste of public funds as a result of repetition.  Recording additions and deletions should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Apart from the one or two questions I have raised, I agree with everything in the Bill.  I am particularly pleased that a colleague who has so much experience of elections is steering it through.  The Minister, Deputy Wallace, has had the experience of being at the wrong end of a decision and will be aware of the importance of every aspect of this Bill. I am sure he will be able to answer anything raised here.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to get a debate going on the size of constituencies as soon as possible with a view to making a decision one way or the other within the next few years.  I appreciate that some of the smaller parties and minority groups might disagree with this and say we are trying to gerrymander the constituencies. The change in 1974 which was implemented to give a certain result backfired, and the same would happen in the future if any party tried to gerrymander the system.  I appeal to the Minister to make this the next item on his <Col N="974" /> agenda once he has successfully put this Bill through.  In the meantime I congratulate him on his work to date and wish him well with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle. I want to pay tribute to the Members of the Seanad where this Bill was initiated.  People from other countries think our electoral system is confusing. However, anybody who has ever been involved in a Seanad election, and more particularly in a Seanad count, will agree that proportional representation is probably the fairest system of voting in any democracy.  We are very proud of it.  A Seanad count is a time when the variations of proportional representation came into play and is well understood by those elected to the Seanad and by those involved in the counting procedure.</P>
      <P>As the last speaker said, there is none of us who has not had experience of winning or losing an election.  We have all gone through the process and it is appropriate that we should at times recount our experiences in the election process under the system of proportional representation. The Bill introduces some changes, some of which are welcome. Indeed, it could have gone further in some respects, particularly in regard to voting rights for emigrants.  I hope to deal with that matter later.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to the county registrars, returning officers and those involved in the counting process at local elections, general elections, presidential elections or referenda.  The dedicated staff of local authorities have built up much expertise through the years on our system of voting and counting. Indeed, nine times out of ten candidates encounter no difficulties during the counting procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like however to draw attention to the section which forbids candidates, or their agents, from handling ballot papers.  As the Minister is aware, during the counting process ballot papers which are questioned or are to be declared null and void by the returning officer are presented to the candidates or their election <Col N="975" /> agents for inspection.  A dialogue ensues and, in general, consensus is reached between the election agents and the returning officer as to whether a vote should be allowed.  I would be reluctant therefore to consider the issue as being black or white.</P>
    <P>Section 153 states that a candidate or the agent of a candidate who handles a ballot paper during the counting of the votes at a Dáil election shall be guilty of an offence.  Given that ballot papers which are questioned are handled in the presence of the returning officer, the Minister might consider whether this should form part of the counting process if it occurs in the accounting officer's room.  We are trying to ensure that the decision of every voter is interpreted correctly by the candidates, their agents and the returning officer.  At that stage one vote either way will not make much difference but we must always ensure that each voter gets a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>In general, the Minister will agree, there is a high level of authenticity throughout the constituencies and the various polling stations.  There are some legends about what happened in the past; about how everyone on the register managed to vote.  Some of these stories were repeated here last year.  It was even suggested at times that the dead had voted. In general people are conscientious; indeed they are so conscientious that if their name is mis-spelled or the initial is incorrect they bring this to the attention of the returning officer.</P>
    <P>I note that a provision has been included in this legislation which gives the returning officer discretion where an incorrect entry had been included in the register provided the person concerned can satisfy him that they are the person listed on the register.  This provision is welcome because in the past we have been extremely rigid when it comes to the voter's register.  This legislation will permit a supplementary register to be prepared so as to ensure that those who have been excluded, through no fault of their own, from the register of electors which is compiled each year by the local <Col N="976" /> authority, beginning on 15 January with revision courts in April, can be re-entered.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions which deal with the special voter's list, which I will comment on later, and postal voting. In general we should, as legislators, ensure that people are given every opportunity to have their names included on the register and to exercise their vote which was hard won.  Even in the era of the computer errors can still be made. Indeed, people who have been living in the same house for years and who had no reason to check the register suddenly discovered on election day that they had been excluded.  Heretofore this had created endless problems for all of us at polling stations when people requested that they be allowed to cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I have complimented the staff of most polling stations throughout the country but there is one exception.  I remember the theme music &ldquo;Arise and follow Charlie&rdquo; being played at a polling station. Indeed, the loudspeakers were hooked up to the polling station and the instrument was located within the station&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a few.  Needless to say when the matter was brought to the attention of the returning officer he took action immediately.  In a way this was quite extraordinary but probably was the norm in those parts of rural Ireland where they could not see the difference and at a polling station where those who used to rise and follow Charlie were more plentiful.  That was the only episode of that kind I came across and I have long experience of elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some changes in the Bill in connection with the registration of special voters about which I am concerned. The registration of such voters is normally carried out in the month of October.  Usually the disabled and the handicapped want to vote but some of the language used in the declaration that has to be made in compiling this special register, a major innovation, is offensive. <Col N="977" /> For instance, they have to declare that they are of sound mind and this declaration must be signed by a medical practitioner. While some slight changes have been made in the procedure I note that this declaration will still have to be made.</P>
    <P>We should avail of this opportunity to remove any words which may be seen to be offensive to people in this special category who would like to vote and who are now demanding, rightly so, proper facilities such as ramps, so that they can gain access to polling stations.  We should ensure that every facility is provided for them if they want to vote given that the adrenalin flows on election days.  Certainly, we should not make it difficult for them to have their names included on the special voter's register by using offensive language.</P>
    <P>Given that this register is compiled at a different time of the year they may forget that they need to reregister. Above all others, they like to think that they are part of the decision-making process. The Minister should therefore take this opportunity to look again at the interpretation of &ldquo;a special voter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the question of postal voting.  Members of the security forces, including the Garda Síochána and the Army, have always had a postal vote. This right is now being extended to members of a mission; in other words, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Under section 12, &ldquo;a qualified person&rdquo; means a citizen of Ireland who has reached the age of 18, is a civil servant, a member of a mission and who, for the time being because of the requirements of his duty, is serving outside the State.  I honestly believe, and many speakers from all sides of the House have stated this, that there are other categories of people who, by the nature of their work, are obliged to be outside the country or outside their constituency on polling day and, as a result are precluded from voting.  This begs the question, should we alter polling day?  Perhaps we should decide a day when people hope to be at home &mdash; Sunday.  Some of us hold constituency clinics on Sundays.  Generally speaking people are at home on <Col N="978" /> Sundays and weekends and if we had polling on Sundays it would result in an increase in the numbers of people casting their votes as many would take the opportunity to do so on their way to or from Mass.</P>
    <P>We broke with tradition in holding the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on a holy day.  Some priests objected to this from the pulpit and in some cases the parish priest disagreed with the curate, but in spite of that &mdash; hopefully the pulpit will never be used for political reasons &mdash; voting on Sunday would be welcome.  It would facilitate many people who are away from home during the week &mdash; commercial travellers, etc.  The Minister should consider this suggestion.  This is major legislation which addresses the problems which have faced us for a number of years.  This is a golden opportunity to make it as easy as possible for people who want to vote to do so.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill for a review of polling stations &mdash; Deputy Kitt referred to this matter &mdash; and this is important.  This morning before I came to the Dáil I attended a meeting of a sub-committee of the council in my area which reviewed the position of polling stations.  It is important to locate polling stations, particularly in rural Ireland, as conveniently as possible for voters.  By reducing the number of polling stations we would be forcing people to travel a further ten or 15 miles.  If we chop and change the location of polling stations too often that would create confusion.  At times we have to offer incentives by way of transport when canvassing to ensure that the majority of people vote.  It is our obligation to provide every facility for voters and the location of rural polling stations is important.  The requirement is that polling stations are reviewed every ten years but even if there is a major change in population numbers in certain areas, polling stations should not be relocated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of banning the extraordinary practice of campaigning at or near polling stations.  On polling day one would think it was <i>mardi gras</i> outside polling stations because every campaign <Col N="979" /> worker likes to be present, but candidates and people responsible for legislating in this area would be happier if canvassing was prohibited from midnight the night before an election, even from the curtilage &mdash; to use Deputy Fennell's words &mdash; of the polling station.  People may decide to canvass at the nearest crossroads but if that happened the whole concept of what we are trying to do would be defeated.  People should not be allowed to hand out campaign literature on election day.  We know from experience that by the time the person goes to vote he has already decided for whom he will vote.  People are often offended at being interrogated and obstructed by canvassers. I would welcome the banning of all campaigning from midnight the night before an election.  I am glad that in the legislation we have moved from the idea of precluding the publication in newsprint of polls and media comments on how the electorate feel on particular subjects. Matters arise during election time which reflect people's changing attitudes.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the section of the legislation that deals with the death of a member who is nominated to contest an election.  As I understand it, if that happens after the issuing of the writ any votes cast in that area are null and void and a new election will take place on another day.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that in his reply.</P>
    <P>In the remaining minutes I would like to re-emphasise the Labour Party's commitment to the concept of votes for emigrants &mdash; Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan moved a Private Members' Bill on this matter.  It is unacceptable that Irish nationals, be they in England, America, Australia or Europe, are unable to vote in elections at home.  This is an emotive subject for emigrants.  All other nationals vote in elections at home.  I know there is a commitment from the two Government parties to move down this road.  In two weeks' time I will address a Tipperary/London reunion group who will say that we forget them when they emigrate.  It is appropriate that our emigrants <Col N="980" /> have an input into the affairs of their country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to take on board the suggestions I have made which will help to tidy it up, particularly the question of postal voting for people who are away from home.  In other countries the voting paper is unimportant until it is authenticated. It can be picked up at post offices and other public offices, and it is only when the vote is cast in the presence of a designated person that it becomes an authentic vote.  Procedures should be devised whereby people would not necessarily have to attend on the day to cast their vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, well in his portfolio.  As a man with extensive knowledge I know he will effect change.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Bill is essentially a consolidation and modernisation measure designed to restate existing law in a more convenient form and a clear and more modern idiom.  That is basically what has been done in this Bill.  Most of the changes, which are long overdue, are welcome.  As individuals and parties we have been requesting such changes for many years.  As regards the registration of electors, this is a area of great frustration, particularly on polling day when people find their names are not on the list of voters.  I welcome the introduction of a supplementary list to which names could be added at any time during the year.</P>
      <P>In many areas people depend on political parties to keep lists up to date.  It is very frustrating for members of political parties to find that names are omitted through clerical error or otherwise.</P>
      <P>A man's vote is not important until he is denied it, which makes him very frustrated and concerned, even though he might not have thought it worth while to notify the authorities that he wished to be registered to vote, particularly if he had moved to a new area.  Therefore, it is very important to use the supplementary list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> Over the years the local authorities did a good job compiling a voters' list and it has been streamlined in many areas.  The previous speaker referred to postal votes in relation to people in the public service, Garda and Army who work outside the State.  However, long distance lorry drivers are also denied a voting facility. Many of them drive to the Continent on a continual basis; this is a relatively new phenomenon as 30 years ago you could count on the fingers of one hand the number of people who travelled abroad regularly.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with having polling day on a Sunday but I am in favour of holding an election on a Saturday.  It is a question that should be examined because many people go home to rural areas for the weekend, where many of them are registered to vote.  If an election is held on a weekday these people are unable to get home to cast their votes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision that disabled electors be registered as special voters, it is proposed that the requirement that applicants for inclusion in the special voters' list be certified to be of sound mind will be repealed; the same applies to the requirement for a medical certificate.  I welcome this provision in the Bill.  It was a problem for a disabled person to have a certificate signed by a doctor and the repeal of that provision is very important because people who are housebound are very anxious to vote. The process will now be simplified.</P>
    <P>There are also powers in the Bill to deal with interference or obstruction of electors outside polling stations by canvassers. I am glad canvassing in the immediate vicinity will be prohibited. Perhaps interference at polling stations is not rampant in many areas but anyone in the political arena in the eighties in Border areas knew all about interference and intimidation.  Indeed, many voters preferred to return home when faced with barracking and intimidation outside polling stations.  At that time I requested that this matter should be dealt with and I am glad the provisions are included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Now that there is so much emphasis on <Col N="982" /> tidy towns, the litter problem should also be tackled.  There should be a big reduction in half sheet posters; in the constituency which I represent we have moved over to hoardings which, admittedly, are expensive and hard to store between elections but they solve the problem of litter.  I hope, in the years ahead, this system will be common to all constituencies because people driving at 50 miles per hour see very little on a poster on a telegraph poll.  There is also provision in the Bill for the candidates' deposit to increase from £100 to £500. We cannot really quibble with that provision or the changes in regard to the quota.</P>
    <P>Several speakers referred to the single seat constituency.  I suppose it will not be in operation for a while but I am sure the idea appeals to many, especially those who have spent much of their political life in five seater constituencies where competition is intense, even between members of the same political party.  All these changes are welcome and they will improve the Bill.  The Bill also states that local authorities will be required to review their polling schemes at least once every ten years and the Minister will be given power to take the initiative where it appears to him that polling arrangements should be revised.  I am in agreement with the revision of polling arrangements. One polling station should cater for at least 400 people and perhaps isolated areas could be amalgamated for the purpose of voting.  Political parties have plenty of manpower at their disposal and they can help in this area.</P>
    <P>There are many good provisions in the Bill.  I welcome the changes and wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dennehy, I wish the Minister well.  He has excellent experience in his own constituency and he knows how elections are run because he has been in politics for many years. He is the right man to steer this Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because any legislation which helps elections to become more efficient and accessible to the electorate <Col N="983" /> is timely.  During the passing of the measure through the House every effort should be made to improve it if at all possible.</P>
    <P>In this country we are fortunate to have a system of elections which must rank as one of the fairest in the world.  Our system offers a wide range of choices. At times up to 12 candidates may offer themselves for election in a constituency. Voters number the candidates from one to 12 in order of preference &mdash; and all candidates, including the Minister and myself, hope to have many voters allocating No. 1 to them.  Voters are able to select those people who they deem would represent them best at either national or local authority level.  Some commentators would claim that the system of proportional representation does not produce the best politicians but I tend to disagree.  Those commentators might say that the politicians elected are messenger boys, clinic operators or those who are always stuffing letter boxes with unwanted literature &mdash;&ldquo;drops&rdquo;, as they are known out my way.</P>
    <P>Although our system is not perfect, I should like to speak in its defence because I believe it to be absolutely fair. Deputy Leonard made the case for single seat constituencies.  The Irish people get excellent representation from our present system.  My constituency has four TDs, all of whom work very hard on behalf of the constituents.  Under our system there may be a lot of competition but, in my opinion, through that competition the constituents get the benefit of good service.  All of the ensuing activity may place unwanted burdens on the elected representatives, but such activity brings the public representatives closer to their constituents.  The representatives are given greater opportunity to ascertain the views of their constituents on matters relating to legislation and on local issues that affect the wellbeing of the public.  It is my experience that on a regular basis constituents offer views on matters affecting the environment, planning and housing.  As their public representative, I am thereby <Col N="984" /> enabled to put forward their views at local council level and at Dáil level.  It is a two-way process and I am able to report back to my constituents on progress made.  By attending constituency clinics and meetings, a public representative is made aware of different views and circumstances that can be represented both at local council meetings and in the House.  I find our present system very helpful and I hope that it continues for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>One group often forgotten when legislation such as this comes before the House is the party activists.  We all have party activists &mdash; the Minister's party have the cumann members and my party have branch members, and one is usually able to identify the party to which activists belong when one is told that they belong to the local cumann or the local branch.  Some of the best ideas to come before the House have originated at a local branch party meeting or a meeting of a local constituency executive.  In my constituency of Dublin North East the activists of my own party are frontline people.  They are the people who are out at local level working very hard on our behalf and they are often the people who can tell us just what our constituents feel. I often think that most of the time of party activists is wasted on fundraising activities &mdash; selling tickets, running functions, raffles and so on.  That should not be the role of party activists.  Our party activists should be able to make a contribution in other ways such as by finding out what is happening in the constituencies and by having an input at meetings and reporting to us.  They should have an input on the issues of the day, such as legislation that may be going through the House.  Such feedback can be very valuable.</P>
    <P>One often finds that the agenda of a party branch or cumann meeting is taken up by financial issues.  Finance is usually the first item on the agenda and much of the meeting is taken up in discussing fund-raising ideas following receipt of a letter from party headquarters that urges members to hold raffles or draws or find other ways to raise funds.  That is not right. <Col N="985" /> In this regard, I am trying to make a case for the funding of political parties.  Parties should be funded at national level.  In Germany a political party receives funds the amount of which is determined by the number of votes gained.  From memory, I think that for each vote gained at national level a party gets one Deutsche Mark.  A system such as that operated in Germany should be put in place in this country.  As I have already said, too much of the time of TDs and party activists is taken up by fund-raising.  At local level there are people who have good ideas to contribute and it is wrong that their time should be taken up with projects that try to raise funds in order to keep a party in operation and to meet the expenses incurred at the time of local and national elections.</P>
    <P>Party activists could make a better contribution to democracy and to this country by identifying the issues in a constituency and by commenting on issues to come before the House.  People go out to join parties not to raise funds but in order to have an input, and it is my view that much talent is being wasted. All political parties are experiencing a falling off of numbers at branch and cumann meetings.  I have spoken to people on the Minister's side of the political divide who have agreed that this is happening.  People are discouraged from attending the meetings because they know that they will either be asked to pay money by way of subscription or be asked to go out and raise money.  Our party members should not have to do that, they have a more important role to play.  As I have said, people go out of their way to join a political party because they want to have an input into democracy and into the running of this country. At this stage we should consider the case for making money available to political parties.  In fact, funding should be filtered down to local level so that party members are enabled to carry out research and surveys.</P>
    <P>We live in an age in which the environment is of paramount importance. Elections should not pollute our environment. There would be a great improvement were posters and electioneering <Col N="986" /> literature strictly controlled at election time.  I have just spoken about party activists and the way in which they have to raise money.  Much of the money raised during the years in between elections is put towards the publication of posters and literature.  The whole issue of electioneering literature needs to be examined. In my own constituency we found other ways of doing things during the most recent local authority elections. Posters can pollute a constituency.  Party activists go out on the streets and put up posters and a few days later after a stormy night, one finds damaged posters all over the place.  Posters become an annoyance to residents.  People are often put off the thought of elections by the evidence of so much waste and so much paper pollution. At the time of the most recent local authority elections all parties in my constituency met and decided that we would not erect the traditional posters we had used over the years but would instead use the local newspapers and the local radio stations to get the messages across.  I found that process worked very well.  My own party decided to give individual candidates their own choice of what kind of advertisement was put in the local papers.  My area has two excellent papers, the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> and the <i>Northside People</i>, and we chose advertisements that included an individual candidate's photograph, asked for a No. 1 vote and requested people to carry their votes on to one's party colleagues.</P>
    <P>That is the way to go about putting across a written message at election time. Most of the free publications are delivered to every household in an area and people do read them.  Perhaps a party or an individual candidate incur expense in inserting advertisements in the newsletters and papers but that is money well spent.  Surely it is better to put a message across in that way than to pollute our environment.  What about the time wasted by party activists in putting up posters which may be found on the ground the next day?  That time could be better employed by party activists canvassing people, putting the issues to them and being positive about the election. <Col N="987" /> The electors would thank us were we to carry on our business in that way.</P>
    <P>Most contributors today referred to activities outside polling stations on election day.  I welcome the provision in the Bill in regard to this aspect.  I believe the polling station should be the domain of the general public on election day.  I welcome the provision whereby there should be 50 metres between the polling station and what is happening elsewhere but the provision could go further.  As Deputy Leonard said.  There will always be people who will say: &ldquo;I can set up shop beyond 50 metres and I can erect banners, posters and loudspeakers and I can have the usual razzmatazz that takes place.&rdquo;  There should be no razzmatazz in the vicinity of the polling stations &mdash; it should be banned from the night before &mdash; as provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As candidates over the years we all know from watching people arriving at the polling station that they have literally to run the gauntlet before they achieve their aim of getting inside and casting their vote.  Fine Gael supporters are on one side and Fianna Fáil supporters are on the other side and they are trying to outdo the other on election day.  The night before the election they are out erecting posters and banners and it all seems such a waste of time.  In my opinion the activists are people who should be out there putting the issues on the doorstep. When election day arrives it should be a free day; it should be for the electorate and no one else.  All electioneering should cease the night before and the polling station should be free so that people can get in easily and cast their vote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill whereby a supplement to the register of electors can be formulated up to 12 days before polling day.  At every election in which I have stood &mdash; approximately eight between local authority elections and general elections &mdash; I have met people who say they are not on the register and ask why that is so.  Quite an amount of time is spent in ascertaining why they are not on the register and in <Col N="988" /> reporting back to them after the election. I am aware local authorities do their best. I notice in my own household that Dublin County Council have had people checking the register door to door.  That is not an easy job because they may find many people are not in and may have to call back but it is the only way it can be done. The register must be right.  However, no matter how thorough you try to be someone will always slip through the net.  I welcome the fact that a supplementary register can be compiled up to 12 days before polling day.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to commercial travellers who have missed out on voting down through the years.  Following the last budget many commercial travellers called to our clinics; in fact, I had some of them here on a deputation in relation to the taxes they were being charged. They pointed out also that they very seldom have an opportunity to get back to vote because they are travelling in the country and, indeed, nowadays many are travelling outside the country.  Special provision should be made for commercial travellers to have a postal vote.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency there are many fishermen.  The fishing business in Howth has become specialised nowadays and fishermen are at sea for two or three days at a time.  More often than not, elections in this country, are held on a Wednesday and fishermen are not always able to get back on time.  I am aware &mdash; and I am thankful to them &mdash; that on one occasion they broke their trip and came back on a certain day and voted for me.  They should be considered as should sailors who often have to sail across the Channel, and sometimes further afield.  I have had representations from them from time to time as to why they do not have a vote and I would like to make a special case for those three groupings I have met over the years who have been deprived of a vote.</P>
    <P>It is important at election time that only serious candidates offer themselves for election.  We should make sure the ballot paper is not confused with entries from spurious candidates and the Bill provides for that aspect.  I have some <Col N="989" /> reservations about the increase in the election deposit from £100 to £500.  I note the Bill reduces the number of votes to be obtained from one third to a quarter of the quota.  That is a welcome provision but we should examine the idea of reducing it to, perhaps, a fifth or a sixth of the quota which would allow those with limited means to contest an election.  If democracy is to work, money should not be an inhibiting factor for anyone standing for election.  However, we must ensure that spurious candidates do not cause confusion.  At local elections, which are basically very different from national elections, there will be many people seeking election on local issues, sometimes from the local residents' association or various community groups.  The deposit of £100 should remain because it allows people to participate in local elections.</P>
    <P>During the past few months I have received representations from the people under reference D on the register of electors. Recently I received a letter from a constituent regarding the fact that she was born in Liverpool of British parents and had arrived here when she was three months old.  She married an Irishman but she was unable to have a vote in a recent referendum and was most perturbed.  She stated that after living here for 65 years, paying taxes, being married to an Irishman and having had two children here she was most upset over the whole matter.  She asked whether she should pay her taxes in Britain as she is no longer a citizen of this country.  She appreciated the help I gave because I raised the matter with the relevant Department but she want on to say she has requested that her name be removed from the register of electors.  That is the case of a person who arrived here when she was three months old, lived here all her life and paid her taxes here.  Her husband, who was a civil servant, paid his taxes here and yet when an issue like the Maastricht referendum came up she had no vote. We should examine that issue and try to accommodate such persons.</P>
    <P>I support the vote for emigrants, many of whom have put much effort in helping <Col N="990" /> this country.  It is not their fault that they have had to emigrate; some day they may wish to come back and be part of the process here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as happy about this legislation as everyone else appears to be.  Basically, it is consolidating many other Acts but it does not do much more. It has failed to grasp the nettle.  The idea of requiring people to move back 50 metres from the polling station is ludicrous. I would have hoped in this day and age that as politicians, we would have been mature enough to know that when people go to a polling station they know exactly what they want to do.  It is disappointing to think that in 1992 people can be waylaid on their way into a polling booth.  The Government had an opportunity in this legislation to correct that.</P>
      <P>When I was in Paris a few months ago there was an election.  I was not aware of that until when walking around on a Sunday morning I noticed people going into a rather nice building.  As it was Sunday morning, I thought it was a church.  When I approached the building I discovered it was a polling station.  I went in I found it was completely peaceful, people were going about their business and there were no <i>gendarme</i> in the vicinity.  That was a civilised way of conducting an election.  Nobody questioned me as I walked into the polling station to have a look and nobody outside assailed me by asking me to vote in a particular way or by stuffing pieces of paper into my hand.  It is probably a very French way of doing things but it was very civilised.  I thought this was the way we should carry out elections in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew this legislation was being prepared; it was mooted when we were in office some years ago.  There was a genuine desire at that time to introduce Sunday voting and I wonder why it has now been decided not to go down for this road.  Consideration should be given to the introduction of Sunday voting.  I know that some people who attend church on Sunday might find this a sensitive issue.  Indeed, I would not blame them for having doubts about the introduction <Col N="991" /> of Sunday voting when one considers some of the dog fights one sees outside polling stations.  Two polling booths in one part of my constituency are directly across the road from each other. Approximately 7,000 people are entitled to vote in one station while approximately 6,000 are entitled to vote in the other station.  One does not have to be too bright to understand what this gives rise to.  At around 6 p.m. on the evening of an election people run back and forth across the road to stuff literature into the voters hands.  I presume many people would be opposed to the holding of elections on a Sunday on the basis that such activity would be contrary to what the sabbath is all about.  However, I do not think anyone would object to the holding of elections on a Sunday if they were run in the civilised way they are run in Paris.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the proposed 50 metre limit.  Many years ago I was told the limit was 150 feet.  I never saw this in writing but I was told it was the law.  If it was the law, I do not think it was ever observed. If this provision is to be implemented the Garda Síochána will have to spend the entire day moving people back to the 50 metre line.  I ask the Minister to look again at this provision.  It is time we took a bold decision in regard to this matter; people are enlightened nowadays and do not require prompting by any of us when they are on their way to vote.  As any of us who have stood outside polling stations know, people are harassed on their way to vote.  Even if we stand 50 metres back from polling stations people will continue to be harassed.</P>
    <P>The holding of elections on a Sunday would enable people to vote at their leisure for example, after church.  It would mean that people who work late during the week would not have to make a last minute dash to vote and would eliminate the need for the presiding officer to help people who are unable to exercise their own vote as the two hours before the close of poll would probably be very quiet on a Sunday evening.  These are obvious changes which need to be introduced in our electoral system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> I wish to refer to the practice whereby political parties put up posters on poles. Attempts have been made by political parties to reach agreement to bring this practice to an end.  I though the Department of the Environment, who are supposed to be sensitive to the environment would have dealt with this issue in a Bill such as this.  As Deputy Cosgrave said, if it is a bad, windy night posters may end up on the ground the following day. Alternatively, an enthusiastic supporter of another political party may think the posters would be better on the ground. The practice of putting up posters may have been all right 20 or 30 years ago when the communication systems were not great, but there is a myriad of communication systems nowadays, for example, local radio and free newspapers which are delivered in certain areas. Indeed, many people do not have time to pull one piece of literature in through their letterbox before another is put in by somebody else.  Nobody can tell me that people have to look at posters on lamp posts in order to decide who they will vote for.  This practice has become part of the psyche of our political system. We should look at this issue in a more intelligent way and realise that people know what they are doing.  Some people may say that posters on a lamp post give an area an atmosphere at election time. These posters do not add anything to areas like Dublin where much has been done to improve the image of the city over the past number of years.  The practice of putting up posters on poles is self-perpetuating: a person who sees the posters put up by another political party can get terribly upset and decide to put up posters supporting his party.</P>
    <P>The Government had an opportunity in this Bill to change such practices.  I am disappointed at this legislation.  Nevertheless, there are some good proposals in it, for example, the introduction of a supplementary register to which people can add their names very quickly.  We need to ensure at all times that people have access to voting.  As long as they do not infringe the law, we should make this as easy as possible for them.  More <Col N="993" /> consideration should be given to the extension of the postal voting system to cater for company representatives and people who work away from home.  I know that this system is open to abuse. However, there has been a history of abuse in the voting system.  This is regrettable, but nowaday people are not as inclined to break the law because they know there is a greater likelihood of their being caught.</P>
    <P>I would increase the penalties for people who break the law in this way. There should be more stricter rules about the production of identification in polling stations and anybody who attempts to abuse the system should be arrested and heavily fined or imprisoned.  This would minimise the amount of abuse.  In a democracy we should not try to impede people from exercising their democratic right; rather we should be trying to help them.</P>
    <P>The same applies to disabled people. Given the number of polling stations which must be provided to allow people cast their votes as close to their place of residence as possible, it is not easy to cater for everyone, but we should ensure that facilities are provided for disabled people and for anyone who requires assistance in order to vote.  If that means erecting temporary accommodation that should be done.  We must do everything possible to make disabled people feel they are part of the system and that they are not at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of the financing of political parties and of how much Deputies should expend on canvassing at election time. A case in this respect is being heard at present in a place not very far from here. We should try to ensure that candidates should not be allowed spend the earth, that there should be a limit to their spending on election campaigns.  It is important that, as far as possible, people have an equal opportunity when putting themselves forward for election.  The funding of political parties is a delicate issue.  We have all seen the kind of publicity political parties have received in regard to <Col N="994" /> funding from businesses.  I would consider it legitimate for parties to receive some such funding but we must ask whether there is a better way of funding political parties.  There is the danger that because a company subscribe to a certain party, they might consider they had some sort of line on that party and could expect to be granted a favour should they request it.  Political parties ought to be above that kind of thing.  There is need at this stage for something more than talk about this issue.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the election system could be dealt with by an all-party committee of the Dáil, or some other committee.  The multi-seat constituency system has been fairly successful up to now but I wonder whether it has outlived its usefulness.  What we ought to have is a single seat constituency and transferable vote system, such as operates in other European countries.  We might have also a list system, so that smaller parties with a certain percentage vote, would not be denied representation in the House. When we are talking about electoral reform and legislation in that regard, we should examine all aspects of the matter, and this House, particularly, should have an opportunity to express its views.</P>
    <P>The question of electoral reform was raised in our election manifesto in 1987. I know that the senior partner in the Coalition Government raised this matter also.  We should be mature enough to look at all systems from time to time to see if they are serving the country well and not suspect there is some kind of plot when the idea of change is mooted.  The present system is a little outdated.  It creates the clientelism that we all tend to condemn and causes competition within parties.  That selection process contributed politically to the demise last week of a Member of this House.  I am not saying that would happen across the board, but the present system creates competition that has no relevance to national politics.  Its only concern is local politics and how one can serve his or her constituency.</P>
    <P>People who might be interested in serving in public life decide sometimes that it <Col N="995" /> is not for them, given the salary structure and the time consuming nature of our not very efficient system.  It is time we reconsidered the system with a view to change.  This might cause problems, but it could be examined objectively.  The fact that a particular party have a majority in this House does not mean they should railroad a system through. That is not the type of process I am talking about, I am talking about a process of examination.  To use the much abused phrase in this House of late, we should get consensus on it.  We should look at the system objectively to see if it is good for Parliament and for the country. We would attract a greater range of people into public life if a different system was in operation.  We have all attended residents' meetings.  There might not be 12 people at the meeting, but there would be perhaps five Dáil Deputies and, perhaps, six councillors. This is democracy but is democracy going too far?  Those Deputies and councillors would all them write to the relevant Department or whatever in relation to the same problem.  One must ask if this is the way we should be running our business.  We are now entering the mainstream of European politics, and the single seat constituency system operates effectively in Europe.  It is not seen as undemocratic or curtailing the smaller party because of the built in system of percentage voting which applies if a party get the necessary number of votes.</P>
    <P>While this Bill contains many sections and is necessary, its provisions do not demonstrate any great sense of imagination, any vision or real desire to change the position obtaining.</P>
    <P>The Minister should grasp the nettle and eliminate canvassing outside polling stations.  I do not honestly know what prohibiting canvassing to within 50 metres of polling stations will achieve. There has been much mention of voting taking place on Sundays.  If canvassing were eliminated we could reach consensus on polling on a Sunday having consulted the various groups involved.</P>
    <P>All political parties would agree with <Col N="996" /> the elimination of postering.  One may well ask why it has not been eliminated before now.  There should be a committee established to examine the methods of election, the funding of political parties and so on.  If only we tackled those issues we would be eliminating some current problems rather than merely tinkering with them as we have done to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the opportunity it affords us to speak on what is, after all, the very basis of our democratic process, the method by which we public representatives are elected. Given its limitations, I welcome this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One criticism I would level at the Bill is that, in some instances, its provisions do not go sufficiently far.  I listened to some previous speakers contribute. There appears to be general consensus on the part of the spokespersons of the different parties that one of its most progressive features &mdash; the limitation of canvassing at polling stations on polling day &mdash; should be extended to total elimination of canvassing throughout the entire polling day.  I might instance the case of, one polling station, that in Lower Rutland Street, in my constituency.  I predict the provisions of the Bill will mean that, rather than voters being harassed by large crowds of what can be described very loosely as political canvassers at polling stations themselves, that harassment will take place at the bottom of Lower Rutland Street.  Because of the geographic structure of the area the vast majority of the electorate approach Rutland Street from one end which, as it happens, is located approximately 50 metres from the polling station.  I am thinking of polling stations throughout mine and other constituencies.  I predict that that type of difficulty will be replicated in the case of many polling stations.  I predict that, specifically in that area of Rutland Street in my constituency, what will happen will be that interference with the electorate en route to voting &mdash; which the provisions of the Bill endeavour to eliminate &mdash; simply will take place further down that street.  I am fairly certain that is what will happen in <Col N="997" /> the case of that polling station.  If that takes place in other villages, towns and cities nationwide one may well ask: what is the objective of the proposal that canvassing be confined solely to within 50 metres of polling stations?  I predict it will not achieve its objective.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister, as Deputy O'Brien and others have done already, that on the remaining Stages of this Bill he would seriously consider banning canvassing entirely on polling day nationwide because there is no necessity therefor.  After all, other European countries, such as France, have done so.  It is time we realised we are living in the nineties, that the electorate do not want it, that it serves no useful purpose and, if anything, merely acts as a deterrent to people voting.  In addition, in a country in which up to 40 per cent of the electorate do not vote, the last thing we should be endeavouring to do is create further deterrents to their approaching polling stations and voting.  Rather we should be divising every possible method of attracting people to vote on polling day.</P>
    <P>In addition to banning canvassing, or any other such activity outside polling stations, or anywhere else, on polling day I would concur with the many suggestions made that polling should take place on a Sunday.  All Members of this House will be aware that, after tea on polling day, people who will have worked all day rush home for tea and then rush out to vote, the largest percentage of the electorate actually voting after 6 p.m.  If polling were to take place on a Sunday, obviously that would not happen and it would be an incentive to people to come out and vote.</P>
    <P>Though the introduction of this Bill presents an opportunity to achieve many other objectives &mdash; to which I will refer later &mdash; if it achieved nothing else but give people the incentive to vote it will have been worthwhile and should be welcomed by all Members.</P>
    <P>I have strong views on this issue because, in the course of the last local elections at the polling station to which I have referred already, that of Lower <Col N="998" /> Rutland Street, the street outside was virtually taken over by a semi-thuggish element.  They could not be described as anything less.  On that occasion, people who were coming along to vote legitimately were intimidated either into voting for a particular candidate or not voting at all.  I was not there all day or when this occurrence was at its worst in the evening; it appeared to worsen as the day progressed.  I learned of the matter later and reported it to senior Garda officials.  Those reports were made known to me only after polling had ceased when it was too late to do anything about it.  Indeed, in the course of that occurrence, a particular untaxed car was driven to and from a local public house, not by the Government party, although I will not specify which party or who were the people involved.  That is the manner in which people were taken to that polling station on that occasion.  This meant that the ordinary voter who wanted to travel up the street to vote experienced enormous difficulty in endeavouring to do so.  Indeed, many elderly people were turned back and deterred from voting because of what occured on that day.  I have no problems about the numbers of votes I received in that election.  I received the highest vote in the country and I am very proud of that achievement. I am ashamed at the type of activity that went on in Rutland Street in the constituency I represent and I hope that it will not happen again and that the limited measures in this Bill will prevent it.</P>
    <P>I will make one further reference to Rutland Street and what happened there in the evening.  I have been told that named individuals went round the blocks of flats in the area asking people if they had voted and, if not, asking for their polling cards.  Particular individuals then went to the polling station, to this group who had literally taken over the street, with bundles of polling cards.  I do not have to describe what happened then. Deputy O'Brien spoke about the offence of voting in somebody else's name.  That should be dealt with by all the rigour of the law.  If there were stiff enough penalties they would prevent it happening <Col N="999" /> again.  I do not want to dwell on that although it is perhaps the most important aspect of the Bill because it could change the nature of electioneering and have a dramatic effect in increasing the number of people who vote.  That in itself should be one of the prime objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I suppose I would be expected, as an independent, to refer to the increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 and expected to be instinctively cautious that even the appearance of such a Bill might represent an attempt by the dominant political parties to consolidate their control of the democratic process.  I must say in fairness that it is my view that this Bill does not attempt to do that, although there are specific sections which obviously make it more difficult for smaller parties.  The increase to £500 is one of these.  That is the practical reality.  If it was £100 in 1923 there is an obvious case for an increase but that increase should not in one dramatic swoop be five-fold. It is suggested in the explanatory memorandum that it may discourage &ldquo;frivolous candidates&rdquo; but it would be sufficient to increase the figure to £250. If we are genuine about small parties and about minorities, which is what democracy is supposed to be about, we must remember that a small party fielding two candidates in one constituency will have to fork out £1,000 before they do anything. If that is repeated in constituencies around the country, it makes it impossible. I hope the figure will be amended to a lesser sum.</P>
    <P>There are almost 300,000 members of the electorate unemployed and it is quite reasonable to expect that there will be candidates who will wish to represent specifically the unemployed, as distinct from the interests of any political party, community group or other group.  It is quite legitimate that they should do that in the next election.  For democracy's sake it might be quite essential.  If that is the case, and I would argue that it is, then this increase in the deposit would make it extremely difficult for an unemployed <Col N="1000" /> group to organise and participate in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>One could argue that this is a direct and deliberate attempt to prevent such groups as the unemployed or poor communities from electing their own representatives. Initially my whole electoral base was in what is regarded as the poorest urban community in the entire State.  I found it extremely difficult.  I did not have the advantage, nor do I want it, of cheques from beef barons or any other business interests to help organise my campaign.  Nor did I, as apparently some other political grouping did, counterfeit and print money to finance my political campaign.  I ran a political campaign on a virtual shoestring and I suppose in those circumstances I can count myself lucky for having been elected at all.</P>
    <P>If we are truly interested in democracy we should be facilitating all groups to participate in the electoral process.  Anything that would seem to act as a deterrent should be thought about a second time.  I would ask the Minister to consider amending his own proposal and reducing the deposit from £500 to £250.  This is a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>The issue of special voters has always interested me.  It is a nonsense that a disabled person has to go through the process of registering as a special voter, requiring a member of the Garda and returning officer to visit individually and personally that disabled voter and every other disabled voter who so registers. We should not countenance the fact that disabled people, people in hospitals or in prisons are disenfranchised.  There is no logical reason for preventing any citizen from voting.  We should be trying in this Bill to provide incentives for people to vote and to remove deterrents.  Elderly people living in homes or hospitals and people who are in prison should be as entitled as anybody else to vote.  Like members of the Garda and the Army, they should have some form of postal voting system.  I do not expect that this will be done in this Bill but the debate gives us an opportunity.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak but the remarks made by Deputy Gregory have brought me into the debate.  One would think that Deputy Gregory was elected to this House as the representative of the unemployed.  He left a job as a teacher to come into this House.  He was not unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">

      <P>They were, in 1956 by a man called Mr. Murphy who was elected to represent the unemployed.  Sadly, the poor man was harassed so much he had to run out of the place and go to England. He resigned because of the pressures put on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain Deputies in this House think they have a monopoly on sympathy for the unemployed.  All of us feel wretched about unemployment.  My sympathy does not extend only to young people but to people in their forties and fifties who feel they will never get a job.  The situation is tragic for them but there is an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment and as far as I am aware there is no problem with providing deposits for people who wish to stand for election to this House. The 1923 deposit of £100 is equivalent to a deposit of £3,000 today.  The £500 is worth considerably less than the £100 deposit introduced in 1923.  The Deputy's argument that we are trying to keep the poorer sections of the community out will not carry much weight.  As Deputy Gregory said, he has no difficulty in getting <Col N="1002" /> voluntary donations to run his campaign and put up his posters.</P>

      <P>I will.  There is a certain level of hypocrisy evident and it is difficult not to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measure to restrict campaigning immediately outside the entrance to polling stations.  The Bill refers to people not coming within 50 metres of a polling station.  Canvassing <Col N="1003" /> should not be allowed on polling day. People should be free to cast their votes without harassment.  There is nothing wrong with members of political parties assisting people to get to polling stations by driving them but it should be left at that.  People should not have to walk through a crowd of canvassers putting unwanted literature into their hands in order to vote.  Those who have the interest to come out to vote know for which party they will vote and they do not change their minds between the time they arrive at the polling station and go into the booth.  On polling day one sees people distributing literature who never participate in the political process and who are never seen between elections. That is unacceptable.  If on Committee Stage an amendment is put down to prohibit canvassing on polling day I hope the Minister will give it earnest consideration. The Garda will have their work cut out trying to get people to stay 50 metres from the polling station.  It is about time we accepted that when people come out to vote they have made up their mind about their voting intentions.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we do away with the idea of putting posters up all over the place and use hoardings like they do in Italy and other places.  During the last local elections Deputy Gay Mitchell and I agreed on behalf of our parties not to have any postering on poles.  The agreement was honoured and the constituency looked better for it.  Perhaps the local authorities could make space available on hoardings.  There might be some way of giving a subsidy towards this method of advertising for political parties.  It could be in proportion to the number of candidates a party is fielding or on some other criterion.  That would be up to the people who organise these things.</P>
    <P>I repeat we should do away with harassing people and making them walk through lines of canvassers in order to vote.  One sees more fights between members of the same political parties over this sort of thing.  Will the Minister consider banning canvassing on polling day so as to let the people vote in peace? <Col N="1004" /> The people are not idiots.  They know how PR works although the other day I heard of a case where a person addressed a politician and told him that he had given him his highest vote, No. 12.  However, the vast majority of people know the value of the No. 1 vote.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Those who criticise the increased deposit of £500 should remember that there is no comparison between that and the original £100 introduced in 1923.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lucky in Counties Leitrim and Sligo and in rural Ireland generally that we do not suffer from the severe harassment that apparently goes on outside polling stations in urban areas.  I appreciate what the Deputies have been saying about this particular difficulty.  This electoral Bill should try to outlaw canvassing on polling day.  The proposal that canvassers should be at least 50 metres from a polling station will not be effective because they will still be within the jurisdiction of the polling station.  To do away with canvassing on polling day completely one would have to increase the limit to about 500 metres.  They would probably then canvass outside the local church or the local pub but at least they would not be beside the polling station.  If canvassers are 50 metres from the polling station we will have the same problems.  This is something the Minister of State should take into consideration.  If he wants to outlaw canvassing he should do it properly and extend the distance that canvassers must stay away from polling stations.  Otherwise let him leave it as it is because 50 metres will not make much difference one way or the other.</P>
      <P>From my experience of elections, short though that is, I would be in favour of allowing a certain number of people outside a polling station &mdash; the number could be restricted.  That is my opinion but the vast majority of Deputies who live in urban areas seem to think that harassment would cease by moving people from the polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general.  There <Col N="1005" /> are a number of good proposals in it.  I would like to congratulate the Members of the Upper House on the way they dealt with all stages of this Bill.  They used their expertise to get the Minister and the Government to make some very worth-while changes.  I welcome the Minister's change of heart in regard to opinion polls because his original proposals was a disgraceful attempt to suppress information. I am glad he has taken the view that opinion polls should be allowed within seven days of polling.</P>
    <P>There are a number of changes in regard to the registration of electors which I welcome.  There are particular difficulties in rural areas in this regard. Many young people from rural constituencies work or go to university in Dublin, Cork or Galway, or they attend colleges which are not in the constituency they come from.  These young people are automatically taken off the register and sometimes political parties are blamed for this.  This has been going on for years and it is something that should be dealt with under this legislation.  People should be given every encouragement to exercise their franchise.  People who have left their area to work in a large city may feel they should be entitled to vote in the area from which they originally came.  They should not be refused this option because if they have an interest in their area they are entitled to vote there.  If, in the future, they settle in Dublin or Cork or anywhere else, their interest will be in that area rather than in their home area. As things are at the moment, many young people have been done out of their democratic right to vote.  Our forefathers paid a heavy price to get the vote for us and we should be encouraging people to vote. As things stand, people are discouraged rather than encouraged to vote; that is something that should be taken up with county registrars.  My information is that county registrars have proposed guidelines as to who should be allowed on the register.  That is an area of legislation that should be tightened up dramatically.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill on the publication of electoral lists which provides for changes to be made, for <Col N="1006" /> instance, in the case of a typographical error.  People will be allowed back on the register if they can prove that their name was omitted through an error.  That is a worthwhile provision.</P>
    <P>A further change provides for a contribution by the State to the registration authorities of 75 per cent of the cost of producing the register; at present it is 50 per cent.  That, too, is to be welcomed. County Leitrim, the county I represent, is one of the last counties to compile the register manually and the amount of time and effort put into that is enormous.  We are not able to provide a computerised system because of lack of finance.  The job of those in County Leitrim who work so hard to bring the register up to date would be much easier if there was enough money to computerise the procedure.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the registration of political parties.  The Government have missed an opportunity in regard to funding political parties.  This is a thorny issue but I feel there should be State funding for political parties in view of the fact that in all democracies in Europe the State funds political parties.  This amounts to a funding of democracy which is very important.  This country needs such funding urgently.  Without going into the pros and cons of the matter, what is taking place in Dublin Castle is an off-shoot of it.  If political parties were adequately funded by the State people would be encouraged to become politically involved and join political parties if they wanted to see changes in our laws and make this a better country for every individual.  It is wonderful that those people believe in a certain political ideal and they should be encouraged but when political parties are trying to raise funds to survive certain people within parties become totally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you.  They end up spending most of their time trying to raise funds for the party rather than making suggestions which would be of help in developing the party and the country.  The Government should take <Col N="1007" /> this opportunity to provide funding for political parties and if at all possible, we should base our system on the German model.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have made the point that there should be Sunday voting, and serious consideration should be given to this suggestion.  I cannot understand the reason we adhere to the British system. We inherited our system from them and, apart from Britain, this is the only country in Europe where people do not vote on a Sunday.  Holding elections on a Sunday would encourage people to vote and make it easier for them to do so.  I would support anything that would make it easier for people to exercise their franchise, and every politician should try to encourage this.</P>
      <P>By having Sunday voting, we would also facilitate students whose names have been left on the register at home and those people who work, say 100 miles away from home, such as commercial travellers who have to make an extreme effort to get back before 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. to vote.  They should be given every opportunity to vote.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I wish to raise the question of voting rights for emigrants. Emigrants should be entitled to vote and given an opportunity to exercise this right.  Most European countries allow their emigrants to vote.  While there would be logistical problems, the principal outweighs the difficulties in getting civil servants to produce a worthwhile scheme.  While a number of Government Deputies share the view that emigrants should be allowed to vote, unfortunately the Government do not give the issue the same priority.  The Minister of State should take this suggestion on board.  He is acutely aware of the number of people who have emigrated from the part of the country he comes from and that they wish to participate in elections here.  They should be given every opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with special voters.  However, disabled people find it difficult to gain access to a number of polling stations.  This should be taken <Col N="1008" /> into account by the local authorities when selecting polling stations.  In my own constituency, a person has to climb five to ten steps at a number of polling stations. Therefore, a person in a wheelchair who arrives at the polling station will encounter difficulties.  They may be entitled to a postal vote but many disabled persons would prefer to go out on polling day and vote.  If polling stations were more accessible they would certainly go out to vote rather than avail of a postal vote.  I do not think this point has been addressed adequately in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse a number of the proposals in the Bill, particularly those that would lead to restrictions being placed on activity on polling day around polling stations.  The 50 metres limit is not adequate.  Some Deputies have proposed that all activity should be banned on that day but I could not agree with them entirely, given that it is important to get people out to vote. If there was no activity on that day, things would be very quiet and people would not be encouraged to come out to vote. However, political activists should be kept at least half a mile away from the polling station.  It is important that there be some activity on polling day to alert people to the fact that it is polling day and encourage them to vote.</P>
      <P>I agree with the idea that there should be a supplement to the register of electors. It is an excellent idea given that numerous problems are encountered at each election.  In some cases, people who had been on the register of electors for 20 years suddenly discover that they were no longer included because a form had been lost in compiling the register.  Furthermore, the vast majority of people do not inspect the register at post offices or Garda stations.  Indeed, the vast majority of people do not know when the register is being compiled, no matter how often one tells them and how often it is advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that there should be a list of additions and deletions is also an excellent one.  However, all the registers would need to be computerised.  The <Col N="1009" /> existing system would need to be computerised initially to ensure accuracy.</P>
    <P>I would endorse many of the proposals in the Bill but I object in particular to the proposal that the deposit should be increased from £100 to £500.  I congratulate Deputy Dukes on his excellent speech on this issue in which he explained that certain interest groups or organisations may find it necessary for a particular purpose at an election to use the electoral process.  He instanced the recent example of the Army spouses. Many other groups may wish to use the electoral process and should have this right.  The previous speaker made the point that the country needs democracy. It certainly does; indeed it needs more, not less.  This increase in the deposit from £100 to £500 will lead to the elimination of many groups.  The obvious example is the unemployed who were able to put up a candidate in the fifties and have him elected.  This gave them a great boost.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the neglect by the Government of the Midlands, as evidenced by the serious population decline in rural areas, the loss of employment in natural resource-based activities, the total lack of a structure for planning for the future use of cutaway bogs and the fact that no concrete action is likely to result from the review of the disadvantaged areas before mid-1994 at the earliest;</P>
      <P>Calls on the Government immediately to put forward proposals whereby local communities will get access to State funds to develop plans for their areas which would</P>
      <P>&mdash;exploit the potential of cutaway bogs, including conserved environmentally sensitive wetland areas;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" />&mdash;develop industrial, tourism and service growth centres and</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in proposing this motion in my name and that of nine of my colleagues from the midland counties.  The reason we put down this motion, which is not concerned only with rural development but in a much wider way with the development of the midland counties, is that in debates about regional development the midlands tend to be overlooked.  There may be reasons for that which we all understand but they are not reasons we should let pass in the interests of the people who live in the midland counties and who face a series of problems that are almost unique to their situation.</P>
      <P>The future of the Irish midlands is bleak unless the Government adopt the kind of strategic planning approach called for in this motion.  Our demand for an integrated approach to the planning and development of the midlands is entirely consistent with Fine Gael's approach to regional development, an approach we set out in detail in January 1989, which concerns the kinds of structures needed in all the regions of the country to promote and inspire the process of development. We set out an overall approach at that time which would devolve to regional authorities functions and responsibilities in relation to planning and development.  It is very clear that that approach is urgently needed today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wealth and the wellbeing of the midlands were traditionally based on their natural resources, peatlands and agriculture, and the industrial and commercial life of the majority of midland towns and intimately linked with agriculture and peat extraction.  Industries and services connected with those natural <Col N="1011" /> resources provided the basis of almost all economic activity and the source of almost all employment in the midlands. For much of our history, the products of the midlands have been food, beer, spirits, leather goods and energy products. The supply of raw materials, machinery and other inputs for these activities was accordingly an important part of the economic life of the area.</P>
    <P>This continued to be the position in the midlands for much of the period during which we attempted to accelerate &mdash; and in many cases succeeded in doing so &mdash; industrialisation in other parts of the country.  For that reason less attention was paid to modern industrial development in the midlands than in other parts of the country.  That might have been understandable at the time but the results could now prove to be very damaging for the midlands and for the people who live and work there.  Today the two principal activities of the midlands are in serious decline.  If present policies continue, agriculture in the midlands faces increasing difficulties.  Prices of tillage products are coming under very severe pressure as the European Community moves towards what are popularly and wrongly called world market prices for these products. Farmers in the midlands will have very little choice but to become involved in the set aside programmes provided for under reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, driven largely by American interests, which have not been sufficiently or successfully resisted by Commissioner MacSharry and the European Commission.  Even one of the palliative measures proposed by the present Government &mdash; the review of the disadvantaged areas scheme &mdash; which has led to all kinds of expectations throughout the midlands, is not likely to make a contribution of any kind to the income or structure of agriculture in midland counties before the middle of 1994 at the earliest, and that is a very optimistic expectation as to when we will see results from that scheme.</P>
    <P>The effects of these restrictions on agriculture, which will become more severe <Col N="1012" /> on the life of midland towns, are already to be seen.  Towns which once had a thriving industrial and commerical life based on their rural hinterlands are now literally crumbling at the edges.  In any midland town one can see factories, mills, stores and houses deserted and decayed. Peat production and its related activities, once the mainstay of rural employment in huge areas of the midlands, are in decline and employ fewer and fewer people in a very different structure from that which we knew up to a few years ago.  Electricity generation based on peat from our bogs is being restricted, with further restrictions in employment.  All over the midlands there are unemployed men who will be the last generation to have worked on our bogs.  All over the midlands there are townlands when entire households are unemployed or where all the young generation are gone and are employed elsewhere in Ireland or, in too many cases, overseas.  We are seeing in a very real sense the disappearance of one of the main pillars of the economic infrastructure of the midland counties.</P>
    <P>Many people fail to realise the depth of the problem or the significance of the decline.  The average traveller between Dublin and the major centres of the south, the mid-west, the west and the north-west will probably be aware only of the increased ease of travel over roads across the midlands which are being upgraded with the assistance of Structural Funds from the European Community and of the ease of getting around previously congested towns by means of the new by-passes.  However, what the average traveller does not realise is that, once you leave the main routes, access to many parts of the midlands is extremely difficult because the roads are so bad, and economic life is gradually coming to a halt.  I intend no criticism by this but the average traveller who enjoys the upgrading of, for example, the Naas by-pass is totally unaware that a mile off the Naas by-pass in either direction the roads remind you of nothing more than a stormy night on the Irish Sea.  I know the Minister knows perfectly well the road <Col N="1013" /> for example, from Edenderry to Rathangan, a road that would take all the teeth out of your head if you did not have a firm grip on your seat or steering wheel and did not keep your speed to less than 40 miles an hour.</P>
    <P>In spite of all that, there is great potential in the midlands.  Around the bogs there are rich mineral soils that could continue to produce a very good living for the population if the Government could persuade their European Community partners to adopt an agricultural policy for the Community that is properly articulated to the needs of the regions and that takes proper account of the different levels of dependency of different regions of the Community on agriculture and the products associated with it.  In a world where non-renewable energy resources are being irrationally used and even exploited, a properly integrated national energy policy in this country would attach an importance to our peatlands much higher than that accorded to it by our current haphazard, piecemeal national energy policy.</P>
    <P>We have barely started to think coherently about uses for our cutaway bogs, yet an immense amount of work on potential uses for those bogs has been done.  An excellent and thought-provoking report was produced at the beginning of last year for the Department of Energy by a committee set up in February 1990 by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy. Although this report deals with a great many issues and outlines a great many areas where decisions will have to be made, I have seen no statement of policy of any kind from the Government nor any indication of conclusions drawn from this report.  Yet that report makes a number of points very clear.  If we have the political will we can now determine how much cutaway bog will become available and at what rate over the next 20 years.  That is a decision that is entirely within our choosing.  We can decide how much of it becomes available, where it becomes available and when.</P>
    <P>We could plan its use in agriculture, in forestry and in recreation if only the Government had the will to do that, but <Col N="1014" /> there is no sign of that yet.  The enormous intrinsic riches of our natural wetlands as habitats for a variety of flora and fauna are very well known and documented. Yet, there is no indication of any coherent planning for the conservation of our unique environmental assets or for their use either for scientific or amenity purposes.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, and I keep in touch with these matters, the only coherent planning activity for the conservation of any of our wetland habitats is being undertaken either by voluntary or local groups that are being supported by FÁS. That is not what FÁS are there for although I am delighted resources are being made available in that way. However, there is no coherent strategy for the identification and the conservation of any of these wetland habitats.</P>
    <P>I was astonished and appalled to read the other day that there is now a serious threat to the survival of the curlew in parts of this country.  I am not suggesting that curlews were ever widespread in the midlands, but this threat is indicative of the type of problems we are meeting. Almost unknown to us that species is in serious danger of becoming extinct without our having made any decision about it and without our saying what steps should be taken to conserve those habitats.</P>
    <P>Given the decline in agriculture and in peat extraction as economic activities, we can now predict the course of rural depopulation and we can predict the course of industrial and commercial decline if no new action is taken along the lines we have set out in this motion. We should be setting out to designate centres of industrial and commercial growth in the midlands and to adopt the infrastructural and development policies that are needed to make them again thriving centres of economic activity.  It may be that if we go into that process of planning and development we may have to come to the conclusion that not every major town in the midland areas can be a pole of growth, but if that is what we have to decide, then so be it.  Let us at <Col N="1015" /> least make a conscious decision which towns we will designate so that we do not allow all of them to continue to slide into the state of slow and genteel decay into which most of our midland towns have now lapsed.  We need a consciously directed policy to make any of those towns the centres of thriving industrial and commercial activity which they were in the past.</P>
    <P>In proposing this motion my colleagues and I have two objectives.  The first is to draw attention to the economic, social and environmental dangers which we clearly foresee for the midlands and to stimulate a response that will avert them. If the Minister of State reflects on this, and he and Deputy Power will know what I say when I, and my colleagues, contend that what we are facing is nothing less than the economic devastation of huge areas of the midlands unless action of the kind we propose is taken.</P>
    <P>Our second objective is to underline once again the need for an enlightened approach to the process of regional development and the need to give the regions themselves real and clear functions in shaping their own futures.  That is very much a part of what all parties in this House promoted during the recent debate on the Maastricht Treaty as the principle of subsidiarity.  I would like to see the principle of subsidiarity being applied to our midland regions so that the people who live and work there, and who want to raise their families there, have a role in deciding what their future is going to be and can have a real expectation that there is an end to the involuntary, unplanned and unwanted decline to which they have been subject for far too many years.</P>
    <P>Before I give way to my colleagues I make a final plea to the Government to withdraw the amendment that has been put down in the name of the Minister of State because the amendment says nothing about any policy or direction that the Government would take.  It refers to &ldquo;all of our rural areas including those in the midlands&rdquo; as if there were nothing to distinguish the rural areas of the midlands <Col N="1016" /> from any other part of this country.  I am saying they are different, and there is a lesson in that for regional development in every part of this country.  All of our regions are different.  There are specific problems in the midlands, just as there are in the mid-west, the west and the north-west.  They need to be addressed specifically and that is why we put down this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I agree with Deputy Dukes that the Government should withdraw their amendment and accept our motion.  It is not a contentious motion and the Government should recognise that we put down this motion in the interests of the people of the midlands.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention briefly, some of the major problems we are facing in the midlands. First I will deal with housing, a matter I addressed very recently.  There are serious problems facing some of the counties in the midlands.  In Offaly there are arrears of £700,000 owed to Offaly County Council by people residing in small dwellings.  In Laois, more than 700 families are in arrears with their loan repayments, which represents approximately £380,000.  Recently, the Offaly county manager instructed the council's solicitor to write to 46 families, seeking legal redress for non-payment of their housing loans.  I will give examples of some cases that have come before a number of the courts in the midlands. At Nenagh Circuit Court, recently, there were 16 case in which applications were made seeking respossession of houses; at Portlaois Circuit Court there were 15 applications and at Tullamore there were 13 applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that these are ordinary people and one of the greatest assets of any family is a roof over their heads.  It is a sign of how serious the economic situation is when a family is unable to meet its housing loan repayments. We have seen and read about many home repossessions in Britain and it is with sadness I say that many houses are being repossessed in Ireland.  I represent the midlands and it is my duty to <Col N="1017" /> highlight that fact but I do so with sadness because I realise the trauma suffered by those families when they are threatened with losing their homes.  These examples are proof of how serious the economic situation is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food is probably aware that between 1971 and 1990 there has been a decrease in the numbers of people employed in agriculture from 276,800 to 168,500.  The midlands are very heavily involved in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the courtesy of his letter, but its contents were disappointing.  He wrote in connection with the inclusion of counties in the midlands in the seriously disadvantaged areas.  It is time the Department of Agriculture and Food sought to have our whole country declared severely disadvantaged, which is part of Fine Gael policy.  It is with sadness that I have to say we have not been fighting our case in Brussels as hard as we might have done.  The French Minister for Agriculture and the French Government seem to be putting up a far better fight on behalf of the farmers they represent compared to our Government. They have not been strong enough in that regard and the Minister and the Commissioner are a disappointment.  If the whole country was declared severely disadvantaged, it would help to stem the flow of people from agriculture and would maintain existing jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food should give an incentive to anybody taking on an employee in the agricultural sector.  He should ask the Minister for Finance to ensure that PRSI will not be paid by anyone taken on to work in farming; indeed, any incentive to farmers to take on workers would be of benefit in getting people involved in agriculture. I ask the Minister to seriously consider that.</P>
    <P>The economic well-being of the midlands is very heavily dependent on Bord na Móna.  I read, with interest, the report of the independent expert committee on the future uses of Bord na Móna in dealing <Col N="1018" /> with cutaway bogs.  However, the committee failed to say where the necessary funding will come from to provide for their development.  However, I agree with the general tenor and approach of that committee.  It is important for the Government to recognise that Bord na Móna will not survive unless their financial structure is sorted out.  They cannot trade out of their present difficulties and that matter will have to be seriously examined.  In 1987 Bord na Móna employed 4,200 people but that figure has now been reduced to about 1,600 people.  Their problems stem from debt; their sales last year amounted to £123 million and yet their debts are £180 million.  Unless they are restructured, Bord na Móna will be crippled in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes outlined how important Bord na Móna have been to the midlands, they are interwined with the ESB and the economic well-being of both is essential.  The Government should look at a number of areas apart from agriculture and Bord na Móna.  Moneys need to be spent on our canal system and the Shannon to develop them and there should also be an examination of the whole question of rail services.  The train services coming from the west passing through Tullamore and Portarlington have problems which need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I fully support this motion and I ask the Minister to withdraw his amendment. This is not a political motion, it has been put forward by the Fine Gael Party on behalf of the people of the midlands, I hope the Minister will recognise that and will not make it a political matter by tabling an amendment.  He should be generous and fair in accepting our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  I come from the heart of the midlands and I am aware of and concerned about the matters raised in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the need to develop our infrastructure.  The Dublin-Sligo line <Col N="1019" /> is in an intolerable and scandalous state. This line is a very important spur into the midlands and further west.  Through no fault of Iarnrod Éireann the service has been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that passengers cannot be sure of what day they will get to their destination, never mind what time they will reach it.  Despite repeated calls from my colleagues in Fine Gael in areas from Sligo to Mullingar, very little Government investment has been committed to this line.  It is essential that this railway line is given priority treatment to benefit Counties Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon, Sligo and Donegal.  It was interesting to note, when the Donegal team were returning home with the Sam Maguire cup, they travelled on the Dublin-Sligo line, which indicates its importance to that area, right up to Donegal.</P>
    <P>This line has been completely and utterly run down but there is now an awareness among public representatives &mdash; and indeed the public &mdash; of the danger of losing it.  I hope the Minister responsible will act urgently to have this line updated and that he will commit Structural Funds in future for its maintenance. This is where we slipped up in the past because all the emphasis was on roads structure, not on the railways.  One of my colleagues told me today that in the former East Germany there is a huge investment in railroads; the same applies to Poland.  It is very important that this infrastructure to the midlands and further west is seen as a priority and is not allowed to be run down.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has always been an important part of industry and income in the midlands.  Last Sunday evening I was watching the news on RTE and I heard the announcer say there had been a 10 per cent increase in the agricultural sector incomes.  I tested the controls because I thought I was tuned into another country&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Sky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even higher.  The Minister's <Col N="1020" /> remark regarding the 10 per cent increase in income was a good headline but it was not true.  That night I happened to be in the local public house and three farmers asked me what was wrong with the Minister for Agriculture and Food. They wanted to know what he was suffering from because they said their incomes were down.  One of them is a sheep farmer and nobody could say that his income had gone up this year.  I do not want to be uncharitable but it is clear this Minister is not in touch with reality. The farmers are extremely annoyed about his remarks.</P>
      <P>Another issue in my area is Abbeyshrule Airport.  Unfortunately, in the past few years the Government have not recognised the importance of Abbeyshrule as a regional airport for the development of the midlands.  Abbeyshrule is situated convenient to Mullingar, Athlone, Longford, Roscommon and Tullamore &mdash; all populated areas.  A map of Ireland will show that around our coast are regional airports and that there is no regional airport in the midlands. The midlands have been neglected.  I was a member of the Midland Regional Development Organisation, one of the regional development organisations abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; who do not seem to consider regional development as being too important. During that time the organisation spent 12 months asking RTE to appoint a midlands correspondent.  The first response to our request was almost, &ldquo;where are the midlands?&rdquo; It was if they had never heard of the midlands.  They had heard of Dublin, of the west and of the south but not of the midlands.  Athlone, eventually, got an RTE midlands correspondent, and that was welcome.  The midlands have been fortunate that the correspondents appointed there so far have done an excellent job in promoting the area and the motion before the House tonight is another attempt to put emphasis on the midlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, time does not permit me to say all I would wish.  This motion is the first step in bringing to the floor of <Col N="1021" /> the House an awareness of the midlands and how the midlands have suffered due to the decrease in Bord na Móna employment, the agricultural decline and other issues.  Plans must be made for the future of the midlands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion in the names of several Fine Gael Deputies deals not only with the vitally important issues of jobs, hospitals, housing and agricultural incomes but also with the very future of towns in my constituency. I speak of towns such as Edenderry, Portarlington, Mountmellick, Rathdowney, Daingean, Mountrath, Ferbane and Kilcormack.  The very fabric of those towns has been torn apart for the want of planning on the part of the Government. Within a few miles of each of the towns I mentioned, Garda stations, primary schools, post offices and public transport services are all under the threat of withdrawal or closure, thus imposing hardship and suffering on already hard-pressed communities.</P>
      <P>Unemployment throughout counties Offaly and Laois is at an extraordinarily high level, with little alternative activity for those living there.  Figures from the CSO for the year May 1991 to May 1992 show a higher increase in the level of unemployment in County Laois than in any other part of the country.  What has happened in recent times in counties Offaly and Laois has had the same effect on those areas as the closure of an active coalmining pit in the Welsh valleys.  We require from the Government special intervention and special status.  There is no Government action plan for the area and there are no job or employment opportunity targets.  The area is completely ignored.  The midlands are hanging on on a daily basis, putting off the evil day when further massive redundancies can be expected in the ESB, Bord na Móna and the agricultural industry. Local authorities in the midlands do not have sufficient resources to deal with the infrastructural problems and they have no direction to use the scarce resources at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> I should like to share the following quotation with the House:</P>
    <P>The problems of poor agricultural land, often linked with the problems of cutaway bogs, Shannon flooding and other hindrances to development, are compounded by a relatively undeveloped urban structure and under representation of Government and other services, agricultural crisis, significant job losses and a failure to attract manufacturing investment.</P>
    <P>That quotation does not come from an Opposition party election manifesto but from the recently published second draft of the Midlands East Post-1993 Structural Funds submission, and I defy the Minister of State, or any member of his party, to challenge the validity of that statement.</P>
    <P>In the few minutes at my disposal, I should like to deal with the tourism industry in the midlands, in which there is considerable potential and which has so far been ignored by the Government. Major attractions in the midlands include the River Shannon, the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the Royal and Grand Canals, the cutaway bogs and many ancient monastic settlements of considerable consequence. A recent development strategy published in my county, entitled <i>Tourism in County Laois</i>, highlights the lack of tourist infrastructure by stating that road access to many tourist sites is so inadequate that their promotion as features of interest for tourists would be irresponsible. Poor road surfaces and potholes need urgent attention in several areas.  Signposting in so many areas is either missing, damaged or pointing the wrong way.  The tourist offices are open only two to three months of the year.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry must be treated in the same way as other job creation sectors such as manufacturing.  Industrial policy must be extended to include tourism.  It is the belief of Fine Gael that the Department of Industry and Commerce should be reconstituted as a department of trade and enterprise in order to incorporate the tourism industry. More emphasis needs to be placed on <Col N="1023" /> stimulating private sector projects and focusing on investment in marketing than has happened to date.  We have not adequately examined the Structural Funds with particular reference to tourism. It is important that funds be used to support enterprises through the regional development structure.  If the Government chose to shift the tax burden away from work and enterprise to the tourism sector that sector would gain considerably because of its labour-intensive nature.  Any tourism policy should set and achieve clear goals and targets.  We must identify and overcome obstacles to growth and help tourism enterprises to tackle the deficiencies which restrict adequate performance.  Marketing efforts must continue to attract growing European and UK business.  We must explore the possibilities in Far Eastern trade in conjunction with other European Community countries.</P>
    <P>In the recently published document, <i>Toward the Jobs Economy</i>, Fine Gael put forward proposals for helping investment in tourism projects.  There is merit in a proposition that the business expansion scheme be reviewed to help smaller ventures survive.  The Government should consider the introduction of a 10 per cent tax rate on tourist traffic undertakings competing internationally as a means of promoting investment.  A new Irish trade and tourism board should be set up to encompass the role of Bord Fáilte and the Irish Trade Board in developing market capabilities in tourism and allied sectors. Not only do the current regional approaches to tourism not receive any funding, the tourist task force recently set up by the Government have not been funded.</P>
    <P>It was outrageous on the part of the Taoiseach to abolish at the stroke of a pen, and without consultation, all the regional tourist boards, the importance of which, I understand, will be mentioned in the report of the tourist task force, due to be published shortly.  The initiative must be put into the hands of the people rather than handing down blue prints from central Government.  The Fine Gael <Col N="1024" /> approach favours the giving of responsibility to local communities to devise strategies for the development of tourism in their own regions and assisting them in that task.  The midland region has its own rich tourist environment, being different from other areas historically, archaeologically, architecturally and culturally.</P>
    <P>The midlands has not reached its full potential from developing its tourism products and the area is grossly under-exploited. The bogs, wildlife, rivers and lakes of the area are resources that a strategy-devised regional plan could harness to better effect than a centrally determined policy in Dublin.  I may be wrong, but it seems that the butter is being spread so thinly on the county tourism structure as to be completely ineffective.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I urge the Taoiseach, as head of the Government and a midlands man, to acknowledge his failures in this region and put in place a policy that will halt the continuing devastation there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government in its efforts to develop and secure the vitality and economic well-being of all of our rural areas including those in the Midlands and recognises the contribution being made by State and EC Structural Funds towards the achievement of these objectives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with all Deputies in this House their concern for the future development of our country and, particularly, as far as this motion is concerned, the development of the midlands region in which I have a particular interest.  I do not accept the political implications of the Opposition motion which reads: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the neglect by the Government of the Midlands,..., even though Deputy Enright mentioned that it should not become a political issue.  I <Col N="1025" /> do not accept for one moment that this Government have neglected, or will in the future neglect, any rural area in this country.  I can say categorically that as far as we are concerned there will not be any neglect of the midlands region, be it in relation to rural or urban development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the fact that the Taoiseach is from the midlands. I should like to say that both he is and we are more acutely aware than any previous Administration of the need for development, particularly rural development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the need to develop all our natural resources, the need to create and encourage an enterprise culture which, I am sure Deputies opposite would not question, and to assist our people in achieving their goals in getting small and medium sized employment potential projects off the ground. That in essence is what rural development should be about.</P>
      <P>I propose in the short time available to me to deal briefly with these initiatives. Before doing so I want to put on the record that the primary and only objective of Government policy, under all headings, is to create an economic climate in which we can tackle our unacceptably high level of unemployment. This Government have been more successful than any of our EC partners in creating that economic climate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Our success in stabilising our economic base and our determination to continue to do so has been demonstrated by our courageous response to the present currency crisis. The Government's response to what, <Col N="1026" /> hopefully, will be a short-lived situation for those individuals most vulnerable to the crisis has been demonstrated by the putting in place of a special fund which indicates the alertness and the sensitivity of Government to these industries and particularly to the threat to employment.</P>
      <P>In supporting this amendment I should like to refer at the outset to a number of significant favourable economic factors because one cannot isolate regional development from what is taking place at national level.  While I agree in principle with the point made by Deputy Dukes that different regions have different development requirements, nonetheless all that development has to take place within the confines and the ambit of an overall national development programme. Unless we get the national programme right and unless we create the environment in which expansion can take place there will not be development in any region.  That is the reason, the Government have concentrated, over the last number of years on trying to get the basics right and in trying to create an economic climate where the maximum number of jobs can be created.  Despite getting many of these economic factors right we have not, unfortunately, achieved the level of new jobs we had expected from that stabilisation of our economy.  It is a matter which is being addressed seriously by the Government who are responding in a number of positive ways to create the economic climate in which jobs can be created.</P>
      <P>In the past five years our economy has improved significantly as compared with the preceding period of income stagnation and excessive public sector debt. I do not have to remind Deputies on the opposite side that one of the major problems confronted by the Government was the question of dealing with the national debt, a debt which doubled during the period of the previous Administration.</P>

      <P>I did not introduce politics into this debate &mdash; in fact Deputy Enright said politics should not enter into the debate &mdash; I am not making political points, I am merely responding to political comments from the far side of the House.  I was making the point that our progress to date has been the result of a successful economic management policy. The period has seen gross national product growth resumed after stagnation in the first half of the decade of the eighties, the level of inflation reduced very considerably and the current external balance of payments move into surplus.  That transformation of the economy and the public finances was brought about by the consensus approach taken by the Government and the social partners representing employers, trade unions and farmers.  I shall return to the general economic situation later, with particular reference to the Government's most recent initiative in job creation in which I have a particular interest.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes correctly referred to the fact that agriculture is of significant importance to our economy, to our towns and villages and to the potential to create and generate employment.  Therefore, what happened as a result of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was of paramount importance and will be seen as being of paramount benefit to the agricultural economy and individual farmers.  Regardless of the comments from the far side of the House, it is recognised that the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy reform as far as Ireland is concerned was one of resounding success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of agricultural production, none of us would like to see limitations or restrictions placed on farm output. The Deputies opposite must realise that the growth in the level of over-production of most agricultural products meant that some reforms had to be introduced.  The best deal possible was secured for Irish farmers at extremely difficult negotiations. We are now in a position to plan the future development of Irish agriculture so as to enable farmers to maximise the benefits which can be derived <Col N="1029" /> from the reforms which have been introduced and maximise the profitability of the farm enterprises in which they are involved.  While we have negotiated a good national deal, we now face the task of ensuring that the national quota which we negotiated is distributed as fairly as possible throughout the agricultural industry and the various sectors within that industry.  I wish to assure farmers that that matter is being addressed effectively by the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I do not accept the criticisms which were levelled at him by Members on the far side of the House.  It is generally recognised that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, together with Commissioner MacSharry, delivered to Irish farmers the best deal that could be negotiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to the disadvantaged areas scheme. I accept that the disadvantaged areas scheme is one of the most important schemes so far as rural development and securing the livelihoods of individual farmers are concerned. I wish to refer to this scheme in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is one of the main instruments available to the Government in their efforts to protect rural areas and to limit population decline in these areas. This scheme, which has been in existence for many years now, is specifically designed to encourage farmers to stay in farming in these regions by compensating them for some of the natural handicaps which are associated with living there. The scheme recognises that permanent natural handicaps such as the poor quality of the soil, the degree of slope of the land etc., place such farmers at a competitive disadvantage compared with <Col N="1031" /> their better situated counterparts and that, unless some form of compensation is provided, many of these farmers will be forced to abandon farming altogether.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Government attach considerable importance to the scheme as a significant income supplement to farmers.  I think it is fair to say that income from the various headage arrangements payable under the scheme is a significant proportion of the income of sheep and cattle farmers, particularly the smaller farmers.  For example, in 1991 some 82,000 farmers received payments amounting to £60 million under the cattle and equine headage scheme, some 15,000 farmers received approximately £10 million under the beef cow schemes and a further 34,000 farmers received approximately £12.5 million under the sheep and goat headage scheme.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, substantial payments under these schemes to farmers in the eight counties represented by the Deputies who put down the motion.  In County Roscommon, some 9,100 farmers received payments amounting to £5.7 million; some 3,400 farmers in County Longford received approximately £2.4 million and 2,100 farmers in each of counties Offaly and Westmeath received payments amounting to just over £1 million. Approximately 1,350 farmers in County Laois were paid £900,000 and about £2.5 million was paid to 3,600 farmers in County Tipperary.  In County Meath some 933 farmers received just under £500,000 and some £152,000 was paid to 196 farmers in County Kildare.  I hope that the Deputies concerned will agree that these are considerable sums of money which contribute very directly to the development of the local economy.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the disadvantaged areas scheme was extended in 1991 to cover an additional 1.9 million acres.  This extension was the largest secured by Ireland since accession to the European Community and its effect was to increase the percentage of the land area classified as disadvantaged from 60 per cent to 72 per cent.  The extension covered 6,000 townlands in 15 counties <Col N="1032" /> and some 15,000 farmers became eligible for the various headage schemes for the first time.  The financial effect of this was to increase headage payments in 1991 over 1990 by approximately £16 million. I am pleased to be in a position to say that farmers in the eight counties represented by the Deputies who put down the motion also benefited significantly from this extension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, 1,900 farmers in County Tipperary became eligible for the first time and received headage payments amounting to £1.1 million.  in County Longford 520 newly eligible farmers received £0.9 million; 730 newly eligible farmers in County Roscommon received £1.2 million and in County Kildare approximately 120 newly eligible farmers received £82,000.  Some 750 County Laois farmers received headage payments of £0.5 million for the first time and in County Offaly some £840,000 was paid to approximately 1,650 newly eligible applicants.  Some 1,900 farmers in County Westmeath received additional payments and in County Meath 620 farmers were paids further £0.3 million.</P>
      <P>In the 1991 review, disadvantaged areas in the midlands region, comprising Counties Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Laois, Offaly, Meath, Kildare and Tipperary, were extended by 1,095,000 acres.  In the same review, 464,750 acres were reclassified to more severely handicapped status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel has received numerous appeals from areas in the midlands region which were not included in the recent extension and reclassification.  The current position with regard to the extension appeals is that all data from the survey of 40,000 farms are now being validated. When that validation is completed, the panel will assess the results and make recommendations to my Department as to the new areas to be classified.  When the panel's recommendations have been <Col N="1033" /> examined steps will be taken to submit to the EC a formal request to extend the present disadvantaged areas in Ireland. The EC Commission will, in turn, scrutinise the submission in detail and, if satisfied, prepare a proposal listing the townlands to be classified as disadvantaged for approval by the EC Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The processing of appeals in respect of reclasification will proceed as soon as the review of the two criteria in respect of income and working population has been completed by my Department.  In connection with its review, the Department are awaiting the release of relevant data from the 1991 census of agriculture and census of population which will, I understand, be available from the Central Statistics Office later this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that the 1991 extension, for which the Government worked very hard, is an indication of the importance which the Government attach to rural development, the maintenance of farm incomes and the preservation of employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We regard the reclasification and further extension of disadvantaged areas as a matter of extreme importance to all farmers who, I hope, will benefit under the provisions of the reclassification scheme and its extension.</P>

      <P>Arising from reform of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; because of restrictions on production in relation to the core industries in agriculture &mdash; it is important for us now to put in place and develop as best we can alternative farm enterprises.  In doing so we must endeavour to put in place effectively a worthwhile rural development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite referred to the failure of Government to do anything to <Col N="1035" /> put in place a programme which would help in resolving the many problems confronting rural Ireland.  I might remind them of at least four very positive actions taken by Government relating to the Leader programme which, Deputies opposite will be aware, is operational in 16 areas nationwide.  For example, there is the small community enterprise scheme which is effective throughout the country. Then there is the latest Government initiative in the establishment of county partnership enterprise boards.  Therefore, for the first time in the history of this State, a positive step has been taken by Government to afford local communities the opportunity of identifying their potential for development and allowing individuals in local communities to identify the potential for the development of local projects.  More importantly, funding is being made available by Government to assist in getting these worthwhile enterprises off the ground.</P>
    <P>The last Government initiative taken, that of establishing community enterprise boards, surely deserves recognition by the other side of the House and should receive the support it deserves in terms of allowing local authorities and local development committees to get worth-while development programmes off the ground at county level.</P>

Here, as in the rest of Europe, the challenges confronting rural areas are characterised by the following general trends; first, a continuing decline in the importance of agriculture in the rural economy and in the numbers employed in agriculture; second, a population decline in many rural areas; third, the fragmentation of the rural economy and, fourth, on the <Col N="1036" /> one hand, threats to the environment from the abandonment of the land and, on the other, from intensive farming. These trends are a cause of serious and urgent concern not just for those people who find they cannot maintain a livelihood in rural areas but also for all those who live in increasingly congested urban areas.  We must remember that a healthy rural economy and environment is an important part of the quality of Irish life.</P>
    <P>In the European Community context, in the past rural development policy was virtually synonymous with agricultural policy.  A thriving expanding agricultural sector could be expected to maintain the rural economy.  However, the year 1985 marked the beginning of a new era in the Community.  For the first time, steps were taken to bring structures policy into line with market policy and increasing emphasis was given to measures to bring production into line with the requirements of the market.</P>
    <P>The publication by the EC of the discussion document <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> in 1988 also marked a watershed in current thinking.  That document contained an analysis of current developments and trends in the rural areas of the Community, identified common problems facing the Community in launching development initiatives and listed broad areas in which the Commission saw potential for worthwhile initiatives.</P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in <i>The Future of Rural Society</i> was the recognition that a fundamental requirement for rural development is to ensure that all action be fully integrated &mdash; development strategies must be dovetailed into a coherent overall policy.  This thinking is certainly evident in the approach of member states and the Commission to the reform of the EC Structural Funds, one of the major policy developments of recent years.</P>
    <P>Rural development features prominently in the new Structural Funds regime &mdash; to which I adverted earlier &mdash; introduced in the Community in 1989. Two of the five objectives for action have the development of rural areas as their aim.  Objective No. 1 &mdash; promoting the <Col N="1037" /> development and structural adjustment of the regions whose development is lagging behind &mdash; includes rural measures among a comprehensive range of initiatives whereas Objective 5 (b) &mdash; promoting the development of rural areas &mdash; specifically covers rural areas not in Objective 1 regions which require special attention.</P>
    <P>We are currently implementing an operational programme for rural development which complements the other elements of the Structural Funds package.  This programme provides for the diversification of agricultural production through alternative farm enterprises, including agri-tourism and small community enterprises, for infra-structural measures such as rural roads and fishery harbours and for assistance for training and education services for agriculture and fisheries.  Some £100 million will be spent in the period 1991-1993, with the EC contributing about £60 million. To date, £700,000 has been paid in grants in the midlands under the agri-tourism and other farm diversification measures.</P>
    <P>The EC has also placed particular emphasis on local initiatives for integrated rural development.  The prosperity and success of rural areas depend, above all, on the initiative and commitment of local people themselves.  The Commission has put in place a Community initiative to which I referred earlier, the Leader programme, under which funds are allocated to local development groups, through the European Community, who have themselves designed integrated rural development plans for their local areas.  I am pleased to say that 16 Irish groups from areas such as Offaly and Roscommon have been approved for funding of £35 million, of which the EC will contribute £21 million.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the importance of forestry development and the potential of the peat areas of the midlands.  I agree with the views expressed in terms of their potential and I will be working towards the implementation of a programme which will assist in that overall work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on this matter because of my responsibility in the Labour Party for the area of agriculture and food.  Basically the amendment claims that there is another dimension to Ireland outside the Pale.  It starts at Newlands Cross and stretches into the midlands and beyond.  The midlands is the heart of the country.  It is not totally independent but depends on other areas for its survival.  It is dependent on the port of Dublin and on rural parts of Munster.  Farmers from the midlands are good customers of the dairy producing sector in the Golden Vale and north Tipperary in particular.  There is an interdependence among the areas which lie beyond Newlands Cross.</P>
      <P>The motion identifies areas of neglect which are peculiar and specific to the midlands.  The midlands are rich in many natural resources &mdash; peat, minerals and good agricultural land.  They also have disadvantaged areas.  The Labour Party do not have any problem with this motion in principle.  We already have a stated public policy on the treatment of cutaway bog and its future importance for horticultural production.  This has been espoused by us over a number of years, not just in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government amendment disappoints me in that it asks all of us to support their efforts to develop and secure the vitality and economic wellbeing of all rural areas, including the midlands. With the exception of the Minister's specific responsibilities, particularly in relation to the Leader programme, on which I have publicly commended him, I have seen nothing in Government policy to indicate a commitment of any hue to the development of rural Ireland.  We have seen over the years a diminution in the importance of rural Ireland.  We have seen a flight from <Col N="1039" /> the land.  The Minister recently admitted in reply to a question from me that 120,000 people have left agricultural employment since we joined the EC some 20 years ago.  It affects all of us.  It affects all electoral areas, all businesses and people working in tourism and service industries and so on.  If councils and development authorities are to succeed we must have a vibrant policy for the development of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to this philosophy, coming as he does from the midlands.  I commend the Leader programme.  Some bureaucracy was beginning to creep into the administration and it took the Minister's inervention to deal with the dead hand of bureaucracy.  After 18 months of pontificating, some programmes are going forward with local involvement, local community support and local funding.  If this filters down as an example of what should happen in rural areas, then the Leader programme will be of sufficient importance to attract further EC funding to assist rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also touched upon the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiated by his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I have advocated that people should adjust to the fundamental changes which are about to be made. It will take quite a while before people accept the change from product support to income support.  People in rural Ireland are happy when they are doing something, not when they are idle.  If we support their income while they remain idle, they will not be happy.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary indictment of all our policies that in a period of widespread hunger and misery in places like Somalia and Ethiopia we have a policy of disincentive to produce food which would save millions of lives if we could allow market forces to come into play, allowing production in its natural form in Ireland to be used to feed people in Somalia. People do not understand why we are stopped from helping hungry people in Africa.  If people in receipt of income <Col N="1040" /> support in rural Ireland still want to be involved in production at some level, some assistance should be given to make sure that their product will get to places where it is most needed, not into the intervention ships sailing around our coasts, or factory storage which makes millionaires out of beef barons.</P>
    <P>We must move away from the concept of floor level guarantees and give food to people who need it.  This would give producers some semblance of sanity and satisfaction.  By all means let us make sure that their income support is protected. We can go down that road with a certain amount of understanding and support for each other's principles without too much debate on political ideology. This is a question of feeding poor people who are unable to feed themselves. We are precluded from growing food in the best parts of Ireland, whether in the midlands or the south-east.  One would question why there was a need for an appeals system because some of those areas should have been included without appeal or political intervention.  In some areas people find it difficult to survive and in extreme weather conditions it is almost impossible to survive, but they are happy to live there if they can just get the sustenance they require.  I hope their claims for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme will be successful.</P>
    <P>Loss of employment, particularly in the midlands, can be traced directly to savage Government cutbacks in local authorities, in health boards, in Bord na Móna and in the disbandment of regional development organisations.  The Labour Party do not call for favouritism for a particular location with regard to public service employment, but we support the concept of decentralisation of Government offices as far as is practical.  We need to take offices from Dublin, which is bulging at the seams, and locate them in areas of high unemployment.  The relocation of a CAO office in the Minister of State's constituency is a gesture but it is not enough.  The people of the midlands want a pro-employment policy pursued by the Government to try to reverse the wholescale reduction in jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> It is stated Government policy to prepare for privatisation of the ESB.  Telecom Éireann, Bord na Móna and An Post.  The taxpayer has put hundreds of millions of pounds into Telecom Éireann to make it technologically advanced. Now that it is ripe for the picking and is making money for the State it is proposed to privatise it.  That is contrary to Labour Party policy, to job creation and to the responsibility of the Government to ensure that successful semi-State organisations should be allowed to generate money for a return on the taxpayers' investment.  Such companies should not be sold off to enable certain members of staff to go outside the restrictions on the public service embargo on salaries.  That is what happens.  The idea of privatisation first comes from those with a vested interest in the privatisation process.</P>
    <P>The privatisation policy would turn the midlands into an economic and social wasteland.  Rationalisation of functions and the introduction of the commercial principle that only financially profitable branches of companies will survive, will mean the loss of thousands of jobs in the midlands and other parts of rural Ireland. It would be a cruel joke if the new enterprise boards heralded by the Taoiseach and the Government under the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Treacy, are expected to generate increased employment and investment while operating under the threat of privatisation for semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>These enterprise boards will undermine some of the existing structures at local authority level.  How will they be operated to ensure that vested interests in the farming organisations, the trade union movement or the business sector are accommodated?  The Taoiseach said today that there might be two enterprise boards in some counties to make sure that everyone is satisfied.  I want to make sure that these boards will work.</P>
    <P>UK experience suggests that privatisation results in the death of rural communities.  Bord na Móna are to the midlands what the coalfields are to the north of England.  The British Government have decided to close the majority <Col N="1042" /> of the coalfields in England at the cost of some 90,000 jobs.  This is being done by a Conservative government who are bankrupt of ideas when privatisation has failed.  If our Government are committed to an employment policy they should publicly repudiate privatisation of major State enterprises and utilities which are successful as a result of taxpayers' money.  Otherwise, these enterprise boards will effectively become dole offices in the midlands and in other regions.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are facing a potential crisis.  I share Deputy Enright's concern about it.  Bord na Móna have a dynamic management and have ensured that many changes have been accepted by the workforce but unless the financial structuring of the company is changed they will not be able to continue.  That would be a tragedy for this effective, efficient industry which is using natural materials and adding value to them.  The profits of this company should not be gobbled up in trying to pay debts incurred under their present regime, a regime which it is almost impossible to overcome.  Bord na Móna shed over 2,000 jobs mainly in the midlands without improving their financial situation.  There is no guarantee that further job losses would improve their position.  They might become viable if they shed more jobs but they may not and then they may have to shed even more and the industry would be lost. Previous Governments, including one in which Deputy Dukes was a member, ensured that this natural industry was supported and protected in all the regions.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year we highlighted the imminent threat to 100 jobs in the Lullymore briquette factory in County Kildare.  These jobs have now been lost to the community in Kildare and the State has to sustain the families of the workers who lost their jobs.  In 1991-92 109 permanent jobs in Lullymore generated £1.6 million in spending power and contributed £0.6 million to the Exchequer. What is the logic in taking that kind of money out of the Exchequer and out of the area?  The loss of these jobs has increased the burden on social welfare, <Col N="1043" /> and the Minister for Social Welfare, who lives in the midlands, announces further cutbacks every week to try to come to grips with the escalating numbers of people unemployed, some of whom are unemployed as a direct result of Government action as in Bord na Móna, forestry and the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>This issue concerns the loss of not just the 330 jobs in Island-bridge but around Dublin and right around the country.  Don Bluth Entertainment Limited came to Ireland as Sullivan Bluth because of the outstanding talents available here in Ireland for animation films.  In the field of animation this company are second only to the Walt-Disney Company.  They have made such box office hits as <i>An American Tail, The Land Before Time</i> and <i>All Dogs go to Heaven,</i> all of which were huge successes.</P>
      <P>They have brought together young Irish artists from many of our art schools and colleges around the country.  Don Bluth himself has fully co-operated with and assisted the principal of the senior college in Ballyfermot in establishing Ireland's first school of animation where diplomas can be obtained in areas such as computer animation, graphics etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 330 young people who are employed in Don Bluth Entertainment, and whose average age is 23, have completed another film, <i>A Troll in Central Park,</i> are in the final stages of another called <i>Thumbelina</i> and have a third film in production, <i>The Pebble and the Penguin.</i> Very little money is required to bring what also appears to be an outstanding film &mdash;<i>A Troll in Central Park</i>&mdash; to completion.  Only a couple of hundred thousand pounds is required to finish that.  The young people in that company have worked for six weeks without any pay to try to keep that company <Col N="1044" /> going.  In fact more than half the staff came in the day the liquidator came to see if there was any hope of staving off the closure.</P>
    <P>I am here to ask what the Government are doing about this.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that the priority of this Government is jobs, yet we have not heard even a murmur of concern about the fact that 330 jobs are lost here.  I have not heard of any Minister flying to the Netherlands to meet the three main directors to try to get them to agree to a joint venture with Merlin Films which I think could be brought to fruitation if the IDA, the Minister and the Government got their heads together to do that with the assistance of the Revenue Commissioners who are one of the creditors. Perhaps the Minister can tell us that something of that nature is being done.</P>
    <P>I have heard no Ministers crying out nor any bishops thumping from the pulpits about the loss of 330 jobs in Dublin. Of course, it is only in Dublin and that is probably why; it does not cause the same concern as job losses elsewhere in the country.  I am concerned not only about the 330 jobs but about the senior college school of animation where young people are preparing for and expecting jobs in Don Bluth Entertainment after their years of study there.  There are far more applications than there are places available in that school of animation.  This is a growth industry, not just one factory. It is a growth industry for this country sand could be of enormous benefit to our young people.</P>
    <P>What precisely has the Minister been doing and what assistance is she getting at Government level, to ensure that this company is kept as a going concern?  The Dutch directors did not even come over to attend the meeting.  Is the Minister in touch with them?  Are the Government or the IDA in touch with them and have they been in touch with Boorman and Merlin Films?  What other offers have been made for the purchase of this company? If moves are not made within the next few days I expect that the company will go into liquidation, the films will be taken over by the Dutch directors to <Col N="1045" /> cover their expenses.  Would the Minister let us know precisely what she has been doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for raising this matter on the Adjournment. He has given the background. There is therefore no need for me to go into it except to say that in May of 1986 there were training and employment grants worth £4.2 million with a target of jobs which was exceeded by the company, and the IDA received for no charge a 4.7 per cent equity share in the company.</P>
      <P>The studio completed four full length animation films in Ireland.  They did not own the rights to those films; they only recouped the production costs.  The company decided that to get an adequate level of profit they needed to own the rights of the films they made.  With this in mind, in December 1989 they reached agreement with a Belgian company to invest up to $15 million to fund the next film.  Then there was a major cost overrun in the making of that film and they got into serious financial difficulties in the early part of 1991.  As a result the company entered into a series of negotiations with various parties the end result of which was the injection of substantial funds into DBE by a Netherlands Bank. This money was used to purchase the rights to one of the films made by DBE, pay off the outstanding loans, make a payment to existing shareholders and provide for operating costs since autumn of 1991.  The operating costs include the development of two films, the two the Deputy mentioned.  However, the funds again proved insufficient to meet the company's needs until the significant revenues from the distribution of those films started to accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An examiner was subsequently appointed on 27 August of this year.  The company had experienced severe cash flow problems as a result of a dispute between its financial backers, Mr. Jan Dirk Paarlberg through his company Pearl Equity Investment.  MKB bought <Col N="1046" /> out the main shareholder and acquired 93 per cent of DBE and the dispute centred on attempts to obtain security for loans in the form of a charge on their film assets.  The company's directors refused to agree to this and MKB refused to make any further advance available to the company. The examiner was unsuccessful in his attempts to secure additional investment for the company.</P>
    <P>On 9 October just last week, a provisional liquidator Mr. John MacStay of Ernst and Young was appointed on the recommendation of the Revenue Commissioners who are owed, in this instance, £700,000, and Mr. MacStay has received permission from the courts to advertise the sale of the business without waiting for next month's formal winding up petition from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Let me come to what action is being taken on the matter.  The IDA are working closely with the liquidator and is also seeking to identify potential purchasers of the company and to convey any relevant information in this regard to the provisional liquidator.  The liquidator's powers are limited by the court to safeguarding the assets of the company for the benefit of the creditors until such time as a liquidator is appointed.  Being provisional, he is not in a position to sell the company's assets but will be providing interested parties with information. He has already been contacted by several interested parties since his appointment.</P>
    <P>The company's major assets are three partly completed animation films, two studios and its team of trained artists. Deputy Mac Giolla is quite right in saying that there are very fine people of all ages but particularly young people trained professionally to the very highest standards in the college of which he spoke. They are imbued with determination and the skills they learned at college.  They have had an opportunity to use those skills in the studios.</P>
    <P>It is believed that, in the event of a liquidation, an attempt will be made to sell the assets as a package to an investor who would wish to complete the films at <Col N="1047" /> the Dublin studio using the company's present workforce.  It is too early to say if the efforts now being made will secure the future of the company.  However, I can assure the Deputy, and the House, that every effort is being made to save the company and the jobs.  It is my wish, and that of the Government, that the various inquiries and efforts now being made, and the liaison between the IDA and the provisional liquidator, will lead to a fruitful result to the talks and negotiations. It is my wish, and that of everyone in this House, that the story of the animation studio and the fine people who work there will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this very important issue this evening.  It has often been said that the best way to evaluate the society in which we live is to look at how we treat and care for the elderly.  There has always been a tradition here to respect age and I hope that tradition will continue but in recent times there has been a dramatic escalation in violence towards the elderly. That must be condemned out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Horrific crimes have been carried out by a ruthless criminal element who have little respect for human life or dignity.  It is now a fact of life that elderly people living alone are scared to open their doors at night.  This applies in both urban and rural areas and it is an indictment of the type of society in which we live.  Old people have been beaten, raped and even <Col N="1048" /> murdered by thugs who, knowing their circumstances, take advantage of their vulnerability.  While acknowledging the fact that there are various schemes in vogue at present encouraged by the Garda, such as community alert and neighbourhood watch, I suggest that the time has come when we must examine all the ways of giving the elderly some security in their homes.</P>
    <P>There have been reports that the Department of Social Welfare intend to carry out investigations into claimants who are drawing benefits from the Department and who are not living alone.  I suggest to the Minister of State that far from suspecting fraud in these cases he should realise that many of these old age pensioners bring some of their relatives or near relatives, such as nephews, nieces, grandsons or granddaughters, to live with them for protection. They should not be penalised for doing so.  It is shabby, mean and unacceptable that old age pensioners, many of whom are sick and invalids are being treated as criminals because they have brought someone to live with them for their protection.  Many of those people should be in nursing homes but, because of the crisis in the health services, we are unable to give them that service.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on the State to protect all its citizens particularly the weak in our society and where it can be proven that an elderly person needs protection at home these should be given benefits such as a free television licence, free telephone rental, free electricity and so on.  It is a sad indictment of our society that old people who are afraid to live alone are being targeted as criminals.</P>
    <P>Groups dealing with the elderly have highlighted this anomaly and in Cork Paddy O'Brien, who has given his lifetime to meeting the needs of the elderly, has backed this stand of not penalising the old for the breakdown in law and order.  This change in the system would not cost the State an extra penny.  I ask the Minister of State, taking into consideration the times in which we live, to make the strongest representations to his colleague in the Department of Social <Col N="1049" /> Welfare that the rule governing such benefits should be abolished so that the elderly will have peace of mind without loss of benefits.  In many cases these people have contributed all their working lives to gain these benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy O'Sullivan carefully, even though I am not the judge of such matters, I thought his contribution was in many respects more appropriate to the Department of Social Welfare but he has made an interesting suggestion which I undertake to pass on to my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general topic, let me say that both the Government and I view with great concern attacks against any member of our society but attacks against the elderly must rank as the most abhorrent and appalling of crimes.  It must be an inviolable principle of our society that the vulnerable among us are protected and cared for.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that it was during 1984 that the problem of attacks against the elderly first emerged.  There was a swift and effective Garda response to this problem at the time and all possible measures were put in place to detect and apprehend those responsible and bring them to justice.  I am pleased to say that the measures taken by the Garda authorities to deal with the problem at that time have proved to be very effective in that the 1991 level of such attacks was only a fraction of the level recorded in 1984 when the problem was at its peak. While the 1992 figures are not yet available, the indications so far are that there has been no change in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention these figures only in the interest of balance because I will never accept that any level of attacks against the elderly is acceptable.  The Garda authorities strongly share this view and they are determined that the necessary measures to deal with this problem will be taken in a resolute and continuous way.  Measures taken include the patrolling of areas deemed to be at special risk, manning of checkpoints and carrying out <Col N="1050" /> spot checks on suspect cars.  Gardaí also visit elderly people most at risk and advise them on ways of improving their personal safety and the security of their homes and property.</P>
    <P>The new rural policing arrangements introduced last year at 100 rural Garda stations have enabled gardaí to spend more time on operational duties including, in particular, visits to the elderly.  In addition, the Garda authorities in conjunction with Muintir na Tíre, are continuing to promote the community alert scheme in rural areas which was launched by &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; Muintir na Tíre in 1985 in response to the number of despicable attacks on the elderly which were taking place at that time.  This scheme involves local people maintaining contact with elderly people in their area who live alone and who may be at risk and reporting any suspicious or unusual activities to the Garda.  The community alert scheme plays a vital role in preventing attacks against the elderly and its success can be gauged by the continuous support and enthusiastic involvement by the community in it.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are now 415 community alert schemes in operation nationwide involving every Garda Division.</P>
      <P>Despite the commitment and concern of the Garda for the elderly members of our community &mdash; this only needs to be stated to be obvious &mdash; the Garda cannot be everywhere at all times.  The community's role in helping our elderly is, accordingly, vitally important.  I would therefore like to pay tribute to the caring members of community alert schemes throughout the country and indeed to the like-minded members of neighbourhood watch schemes in our urban areas who do so much to look out for the elderly members of our society.  I would also wish to emphasise the need for all of us to play our part, to be ever vigilant and report any suspicious happenings to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> With such community action weaker sections of the population can be allowed to live their lives in the peace and security which is their inalienable right.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the problem of attacks against the elderly is being effectively tackled but they have assured me that they will continue to monitor the situation very closely to ensure that everything that can be done on the law enforcement front will be done to keep our elderly people safe from attack.  The Garda authorities have the fullest support of the Government in that regard.</P>

      <P>During the past two weeks more than 1,000 cases have been either thrown out of court or adjourned because of the unavailability of judges to hear cases. While this problem is apparent right across the country the situation is especially serious in the city of Dublin. In Dublin over the past few weeks there has been total chaos in some of the District Courts, with courts being adjourned without notice to any of the parties involved in the cases.  The following are a number of reasons for the problems that have arisen in our District Courts. First, there has been a major increase in family law cases, with the vast majority of these cases being heard in District Courts.  Second, there has been a marked increase in the District Court jurisdiction in civil cases from £2,500 to £5,000.  Third is the major increase in crime that has occurred across the country including Dublin, in the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> On Friday last in the City of Dublin a large number of defendants, members of the Garda Síochána, solicitors and barristers found when they attended courthouses in Smithfield, Dolphin House and Morgan Place that notices had been pinned on the doors by the District Court clerk stating that the cases had been adjourned &mdash; Court No. 3 in Morgan Place was closed for the second day in a row.  Even with a full complement of judges the Dublin courts are short two judges.  The position has been aggravated because of illness of judges and there is now a crisis.</P>
    <P>Under the 1948 District Court rules, in the absence of a District Court judge to hear a case the district court clerk has authority to pin a note to the courthouse door stating that the court has been adjourned.  As far as I am aware, these adjournments have never been contested by any of the defendants.  It is highly probable that in the event of such an adjourned case being contested by the defendant the hearing would be ruled by a High Court judge to be invalid because it was adjourned by the District Court clerk.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis responsibility for this problem rests on the shoulders of the Minister for Justice.  It is an abuse of the legal system to treat litigants in such a cavalier and shabby fashion.  People who are charged with offences have to take time off from work and mothers with young families have to make arrangements to attend hearings.  A considerable amount of taxpayers' money is wasted in having members of the Garda Síochána attend courts only to discover they have been adjourned without adequate or proper notice.  I can well understand and appreciate the annoyance and frustration of members of the Garda Síochána who have diligently prepared cases, having carried out all the necessary research and formalities and served summonses on defendants, to find on attending court that they have been adjourned without any notice whatsoever.</P>
    <P>With the rapid increase in family law cases the Minister should consider establishing special family law courts in every <Col N="1053" /> county for the hearing of such cases.  This is one area where specialised training is essential.  Any new district court judges appointed should receive special training in this area.  Similarly, probation officers should also receive similar special training. With skilled district court judges and probation officers many marriages could be saved.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the Minister study the existing problems in the light of the present crisis.  The full complement of judges should be immediately appointed as well as a number of additional judges to help clear up the backlog.  This problem is not unique to the District Court. Some years ago there was a backlog of two years in High Court cases.  Under the prudent management of the President of the High Court the waiting list was reduced to six months.  However, due to the absence of Judge Hamilton who is presiding over the beef tribunal, the waiting time in Dublin has again reached two years.  I understand there is a backlog of three to four years in High Court cases in Cork.  It is essential that the Minister ensure that the problems in our district courts are resolved.  There is a crisis at present and it must be tackled.  I ask the Minister to treat the matter with the urgency and attention it deserves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright made an interesting suggestion to the effect that adjourned hearings would be deemed by a High Court judge to be invalid &mdash; I presume he meant on constitutional grounds.  However, Deputy Enright quoted no legal basis for his argument. Perhaps he did not have the time but in the absence of that I cannot deal seriously with the matter.  I would first make the point that the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the District Court is a matter for the President of the District Court.  The sole involvement of the Minister for Justice is to authorise temporary assignments of judges after consultation with the president.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present difficulty arises primarily from the fact that an unusually high number of district court judges have been on sick leave.  Accordingly, the president <Col N="1054" /> has had his difficulties in allocating judges to ensure coverage of all sittings.  This has resulted in the cancellation of a number of scheduled sittings in Dublin and in provincial venues.  My information is that where possible advance notice that the proceedings were adjourned was given to defendants, solicitors and others who were due to appear in court so that no unnecessary inconvenience would be caused to them.  I accept Deputy Enright's point that everybody did not receive notice but I assure him that every effort was made to ensure that people received notice.  I reassure the Deputy that the business of the cancelled courts will be heard at the adjourned hearings and, save for some minor road traffic prosecutions in the Dublin Metropolitan courts, proceedings have not been struck out or dismissed.  The present circumstances are exceptional, and it is expected that sittings of the court will be back to normal very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the illness of a judge is something that cannot be foreseen and while every effort is made to ensure that court sittings will continue no system can be set up that will cope with every possible eventuality. Deputy Enright has also rightly pointed out that there are two vacancies on the Bench.  That statement is out of date and he will be delighted to hear that these two vacancies are now in the course of being filled as a result of decisions taken by the Government today.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Finance. I propose to call on the Deputies I have selected in the following order: Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Cotter in respect of two matters, Deputy Nealon and Deputy Finucane.  Each Deputy is entitled to two minutes in respect of each matter and each of the statements will be followed immediately by a two minute <Col N="1055" /> reply by the Minister or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue.  As regards the recent legislative provision pertaining to publicans, I must state from the outset that it is the most ill-conceived and ill-thought-out sections of the Finance Bill.  This is causing problems around the country.  A number of my constituents have found great difficulty in having their tax assessed in order to renew their licences.  At present publicans are in purgatory in that they do not know whether they will be allowed to continue in business.  The local tax office in Sligo has been very helpful to these people but the publicans are unable to get tax clearance in time to have their licences renewed.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take into consideration that this country was built on small family-run businesses.  In some cases publicans also run grocery stores and hardware shops but they are discriminated against in that they need a tax clearance certificate in order to get a licence for the pub.  Otherwise the pub is closed down.  This is a retrograde step at a time when 300,000 people are unemployed and we are trying to create jobs. Business people, particularly publicans, are in a quandary and the problem should be tackled in the second Finance Bill which the Taoiseach has said will come before the House in November.  I am not saying that people should not pay their taxes but they have not been given sufficient time to have matters clarified.  The Minister should rescind this tax to enable people to be given at least a year to get their tax affairs up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tax clearance procedures have been in operation for public contracts and grants since June 1986 and March 1988, respectively.  The basic aim of the scheme is to ensure that <Col N="1056" /> persons or groups who benefit from public funds must first produce evidence that their tax affairs are in order.  This evidence normally comes in the form of a tax clearance certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>In the last budget, the Minister announced that the Finance Bill would contain provisions to enable me to extend tax clearance to licences such as those for pubs, dance halls, employment agencies, bookmakers and so on.  It was decided to concentrate initially on liquor licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners. Accordingly, the Finance Act, 1992, provides for the presentation of a tax clearance certificate before an intoxicating liquor retailer's licence may be granted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The licences concerned relate to the sale of spirits, wines, beers, etc., by pubs, off-licences, supermarkets, hotels, theatres and restaurants, and were due for annual renewal on 1 October.  The Minister for Finance and I have been contacted by representatives of the publicans and arranged that they meet the Revenue Commissioners to discuss any concerns which they may have with the tax clearance requirements.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed us that the response from publicans and other intoxicating liquor licence holders to date has been very satisfactory.  The Revenue Commissioners have made suitable arrangements to ensure that the minority of applicants for tax clearance, whose tax affairs are in arrears, will not be adversely affected should they require some time to bring their tax affairs up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special section has been established in the Office of the Collector-General to deal with licence holders who have difficulty in immediately discharging their accrued tax liability.  An open approach is being taken.  Traders are being given time to put their affairs in order without undermining the viability of their businesses.  As part of this approach agreements are being entered <Col N="1057" /> into, where appropriate, for the discharge of arrears by instalments.  Once an acceptable agreement is reached for the payment of the arrears a tax clearance certificate is issued.  The commissioners are confident at this stage that the number of applicants who cannot satisfactorily arrange to discharge their liabilities and obtain a tax clearance certificate will be relatively small.</P>
    <P>The processing of applications will take several weeks.  No action will be taken against licencees who are still in the process of sorting out their tax affairs, but those who do not apply for tax clearance or who are refused a tax clearance certificate run the risk of penalties for illegal trading.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that the tax clearance requirement does not impose any additional charge or tax on applicants. Neither should it lead to any extra administrative workload if applicants have their tax affairs in order.  Its sole purpose is to ensure that those in receipt of these licences have discharged their tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the operation of this scheme seems to be progressing smoothly.  Most applicants have encountered no difficulty in obtaining tax clearance. An open, sympathetic approach is being taken with the others, most of whom will reach acceptable agreement with Revenue.  These arrangements will cater for all except a relatively few `hard' cases.</P>
    <P>This extension of tax clearance to applicants for liquor licences has been a considerable success and the Minister for Finance sees no reason to rescind it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the dissatisfaction felt by customs officers at the relocation policy which has resulted in officers meeting their fellow workers travelling in <Col N="1058" /> opposite directions to work each morning. I strongly protest at the way the Minister's relocation policy is working.  I know he had the best intentions in this regard but it is not working out the way he had hoped.  For example, an officer living near Dundalk was appointed to the mobile control based in Castleblayney while, at the same time, officers from Castleblayney, who live in the area, will end up travelling to work in Dundalk each day.  I know the staff in Castleblayney and it is insulting to suggest that none of them was suitable for the local position.</P>
      <P>I request the Minister to fully investigate the appointments with a view to rectifying the situation in favour of justice and fair play.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules regarding the rates of exchange used in determining the customs value of imported goods are governed by EC regulations.  In reports issued in November 1990 and February 1991 the Revenue Commissioners indicated that a potential surplus of approximately 600 Customs and Excise staff would arise as a consequence of the planned completion of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 and in particular the elimination of fiscal frontier controls between member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the issue of these reports the commissioners have been working on proposals aimed at reducing the surplus staff figure.  The commissioners issued a revised report in July 1992 which showed a net potential surplus of approximately 60 staff.  The reduction in the surplus figure has been possible because of Government decisions to give Revenue responsibility for the collection of EC trade statistics and the new VAT information exchange system post-1992 and for the administration of the new motor vehicle registration tax.  This new work will provide substantial employment opportunities for Customs and Excise <Col N="1059" /> staff, the details of which were made available to staff last July.</P>
    <P>The revised report also identifies the commissioners' staffing requirements for the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service, especially the strengthening of the common external border, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post-importation audit work.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as the Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech, the commissioners intend to redeploy surplus Customs and Excise staff to other areas of Revenue work, particularly work related to the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the Customs and Excise structures and staffing levels to cater for the post-1992 environment is well underway.  The commissioners have made every effort to distribute the new and expanded work in a manner which will provide productive work for surplus staff at particular locations.  In the assignment of staff, priority will be given to staff serving in the locations in which posts have been made available.  A prime objective of this restructuring is to avoid domestic upheaval of staff if at all possible.</P>
    <P>Staff will be notified this week of the provisional outcome of assignments within the reorganised Customs and Excise structure.  Staff will also be informed that an ongoing process will continue to identify employment opportunities in or close to their present locations for the remaining surplus staff numbers.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not at present aware of any situations in which officers are meeting their fellow workers travelling in the opposite direction to do similar work.  The commissioners have made it clear from the outset that human and domestic factors will be kept to the forefront and following <Col N="1060" /> the publication of the new assignments they will be available to answer any questions and to give any assistance they can in bringing about a satisfactory conclusion for all concerned.</P>

      <P>I call on Deputy Cotter to make his two minute statement on another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to draw to the Minister's attention is the huge cost to importers of goods from the UK by the imposition of a fixed exchange rate of sterling £1.0239 against the punt for the purpose of calculating VAT at point of entry during the month of October 1992.  It is clear to me &mdash; and to importers &mdash; that the Minister for Finance is, in effect, creaming off millions of pounds of excess VAT at point of entry due to the weakness of sterling.  By applying a fixed rate of sterling, £1.0239 against the punt, for October the Minister has already made a killing at the expense of importers of goods from the sterling area.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers using imported raw materials for re-export to the sterling area and retail traders in the Border counties who are suffering heavily from the effects of weak sterling are the real victims of the Minister's excesses.  The Minister should heed his own advice by passing on the full value of sterling to importers.  On Friday, 2 October, when sterling was trading at £1.075 against the punt importers were paying an effective 22 per cent VAT at point of entry.  The situation got worse and on Monday, 5 October, the rate was in the region of 22.6 per cent.  The Ministers actions have helped to increase costs unnecessarily and is therefore putting people out of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering his advice to the business sector the Minister is acting like a hypocrite in this instance.  I urge him to make further representations to the EC at once to ensure that he is in a position to fix a daily exchange rate which is equitable and fair, which would go a long way <Col N="1061" /> to assist the people to whom I referred earlier, those who are importing raw materials and re-exporting to the sterling area, and the very hard pressed traders in the Border counties.  I hope the Minister will make a sensible response in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject entirely any insistence or allegation that the Minister for Finance is a hypocrite or acts like a hypocrite at any time.  In this matter he is controlled by European regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules regarding the rates of exchange used in determining the customs value of imported goods are governed by EC regulation.  As VAT at import is treated as a customs duty these rules are also used for determining the rates of exchange for applying VAT at importation.  These EC rules provide for fixed rates of exchange, valid for a calendar month, for determining the import value for the purpose of applying customs and VAT charges.  The objective of <Col N="1062" /> having fixed rates of exchange is to simplify matters for both traders and Customs and the regime of fixed monthly rates, which replaces an earlier weekly regime, was introduced in 1991 following representations to the EC Commission by trade interests.  Anybody who understands trade and the mobility of trade knows that if one was to move goods with an import rate per day it would be very hard to remain with business practices.</P>
    <P>The terms of the EC rules dictate the manner in which the exchange rates are determined and do not provide scope for any flexibility at national level.  In the normal course, the actual exchange rates applying on the second last Wednesday of each month are used to fix the rates to apply for the next calendar month.</P>
    <P>There is continual monitoring of the actual exchange rates and, under the EC rules, if they differ by 5 per cent or more from the rate already established for the month, this fixed rate is changed to reflect the actual rate; all monitoring is carried out by reference to the actual rate applying at close of business on Wednesdays &mdash; and where an adjustment applies, it applies from the following Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Since the UK left the ERM, the 5 per cent variation occurred on one occasion only, namely, at the end of September, and the September rate was adjusted to stg. £1.0239 to reflect the actual rate.  The October rate, also stg. £1.0239, has not yet fallen to be adjusted under the 5 per cent rule and the need for adjustment will next be considered by reference to the actual rate applicable at close of business on tomorrow, Wednesday, 14 October 1992.</P>
    <P>The exchange rate rules have no bearing on determining the price paid by the importer for his goods and are relevant only for the purposes of calculating VAT at importation.  It is also important to note that VAT payable at importation may be reclaimed by registered traders. Furthermore, in practice, arrangements for the &ldquo;deferred payment&rdquo; of VAT at import, which allow for deferring the <Col N="1063" /> payment until the middle of the month following importation, mean that the period for which a trader is out of pocket is usually of the order of one to six weeks and the only effect for traders is one of cash flow.  On this occasion, importers have claimed that the fixed rate system is penalising them as sterling weakens against the Irish pound.  It should also be borne in mind that these same importers will reap the benefits of the system in a situation where the opposite is the case and sterling strengthens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Pleas for the drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow rivers in County Sligo have been made many times by many Deputies in Dáil Éireann.  The first such plea to this House was made more than 50 years ago.  Still the rivers remain undrained.</P>
      <P>The flooding there during the past few months was just about the worst in all of those 50 years.  It was not the spectacular summer flash floods of some other years but something much more damaging &mdash; a persistent, consistent, continual flooding from the end of July to the middle of September.  The flooding was ruinous for the meadows, for the pastures and for the second-cut silage.  The round plastic bales saved many a farmer this year but not the farmers in the low lying areas of the Owenmore and Arrow because they did not have amphibious tractors to go with the balers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, after all this, one of the worst seasons in memory, today I got the news from the Minister of State, in reply to a parliamentary question, that the Owenmore and Arrow may never be drained. According to the Minister, present indications are that it will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to formulate any scheme which would give an economic return for the investment involved.  That is bad news &mdash; drastic news &mdash; for the farmers of the catchment area.  The Minister went on to say that the possible <Col N="1064" /> drainage is still under review but the signals he is giving are very negative.</P>
    <P>We all know the catchment areas that have qualified under the cost-benefit analysis and we can make our own comparisons. How have some of those areas got through and why is the drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow now in doubt? Have the rules been changed because the Government do not want to do any more arterial drainage, because they want to save the money?</P>
    <P>The total catchment area of the Owenmore and Arrow is 140,000 acres, one-third of the land area of County Sligo. Of that land, 29,000 acres are subject to flooding.  The duration of floods have increased from 12 days to an average of 21 days &mdash; and, as the Minister of State knows, the duration was much longer this year.  The livelihood of 3,000 farmers is at stake.  We are talking about small farmers; the average size of farms is 42 acres. The farmers need the drainage desperately and they have waited for a long time.</P>
    <P>I now appeal to the Minister of State &mdash; and I am sure that in this regard I have the full backing of his own colleague, Deputy Mattie Brennan &mdash; to ensure that the drainage starts and starts quickly. That can be done.  We know that the Owenmore and Arrow should qualify because we know what other river catchment areas have qualified.  All that is needed is the political will to put the dredgers in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the extent of flooding that can occur in the Arrow-Owenmore catchment area.  A review of the results of the environmental impact assessment and the cost-benefit analysis, together with consultations with local groups, is being carried out.  Until that is complete it is not possible to say whether an economic scheme can be designed.  Therefore, the question of a financial allocation does not arise at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Nealon that the rules <Col N="1065" /> have not been changed so far as the present Government are concerned, or so far as my colleagues and predecessors were concerned.  However, the Deputy should remember that his colleagues in Government did change the rules in 1986, when the priorities attaching to arterial drainage by name and location were changed when the funding and the mechanism for funding the occurence with Europe were terminated and the farm modernisation scheme was suspended. The European Commission took a decision not to support any more arterial drainage as a result of the Government decision here.  However, as a result of the appointment of Deputy Nealon's colleague of the time, then the Minister for Finance, now Commissioner MacSharry, the Arrow-Owenmore area got priority and the Government are now in a position to be able to progress until we can conclude the study and make an absolute decision.</P>
    <P>I have had several discussions with Deputy Nealon's Oireachtas colleagues, Deputies Brennan and Ellis, in relation to this matter.  On numerous occasions they have impressed on me the urgency of the issue.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the results of the aforementioned studies will be available towards the end of the year and the Government will do their utmost to make a decision as quickly as possible thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to talk about the wildlife rangers.  There are 48 wildlife rangers nationally and they do tremendous work.  Their duties are in accordance with the 1976 Wildlife Act and in carrying out those duties they often encounter much danger and are suspect to such things as the illegal netting of hares, pheasant shooting out of season, the shooting of deer out of season and a common place practice classified as bird trapping.  People may be surprised at what I mean by bird trapping.  It is the practice in which someone would put a <Col N="1066" /> tacky substance on a tree and use a decoy bird in an attempt to attract birds such as goldfinches, chaffinches and linnets. There is a thriving export market in that business.</P>
      <P>Although our wildlife rangers may be deployed around the country, they have scant resources.  The Department will not supply them with even a pair of binoculars.  They have no distinctive uniform by which they may be identified and, on top of that, they have no radio control in their cars.  In many instances wildlife rangers encounter danger when looking for serial numbers of guns being used illegally yet they cannot even contact one of their fellow colleagues, something that I feel places them at severe risk.  The wildlife rangers attached to the Limerick office cannot be contacted because the Limerick office is not manned.  These people should have an identity and they should be respected. In order to achieve that identity and respect, it is incumbent on the Minister to provide the resources for them to adequately fulfil their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed at the tremendous interest shown by Deputy Finucane in this matter but I should have to take issue with him on several of the statements he has made. All wildlife rangers employed by the Office of Public Works are issued with anoraks, waxed cotton jackets, waxed cotton pullovers, green sweaters, wellingtons, waders and boots.  There are no plans at present to provide the rangers with a uniform as such, and I think that if Deputy Finucane took into account the type of work done by the rangers he would realise that if we were to uniform the rangers or to give them special transport and other distinctive identity they probably would not be so successful in doing their job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great regard for our wildlife rangers.  During the past year I have supported the recruitment of many rangers, which has been done.  I have travelled <Col N="1067" /> with the rangers myself.  They have vehicles at their disposal in various parts of the country and they have binoculars at their disposal in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>When with my Department before, I was responsible for ensuring that the office in Limerick has a lovely secretary available all day, five days a week, to answer the telephone, to do the necessary secretarial work and to provide a backup service to the wildlife people, the architectural people and the other staff of the Office of Public Works based at the Limerick office.  I am confident that that service is very good and that the staff <Col N="1068" /> there are doing an excellent job.  I have met all the staff and have been in to see the facilities for myself.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the resources available, the extra recruitment that has been carried out and the fact that the rangers are provided with special clothing and other facilities and utilities, we must be reasonably satisfied with the level of service being given by the State in the provision of equipment to staff at a time when resources are reasonably scant.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 October 1992.</P>

      <P>Following Government consideration of this matter, guidelines were prepared by the Minister for Finance on the governance of State bodies.  I have brought these guidelines to the attention of the chairman and members of each of the State bodies under the aegis of my Department and have requested that they be given immediate implementation.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt that the board of each State body is adhering to these guidelines, particularly in the area of ensuring that no conflict of interest arises.  However, I am keeping a careful watch on the efficacy of these guidelines and if, in the light of experience, I feel that more is necessary, I will bring forward proposals for improvements for consideration by Government.</P>

      <P>The incident the Deputy is referring to occurred on 2 March 1992, when a van was stolen in Tallaght from outside a business premises.  The van had on board an industrial radiography source.  The Garda Síochána instituted an immediate <Col N="890" /> search for the vehicle which was located and the container recovered intact, with no leakage of radioactive material and consequently no danger to the public.</P>
      <P>Transport of radioactive materials is only permitted by or on behalf of companies which hold a licence from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII).  The licence stipulates that transport must be in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency Regulations for the safe transport of radioactive materials.  These regulations lay down exacting standards for the design of packages containing radioactive materials and requirements in terms of the labelling of both the package and the vehicle used to transport them.  In this case, the carefully laid down procedures were not followed.</P>
      <P>In the light of this incident the Institute has decided to amend licence conditions relating to transport to include a requirement that all vehicles used to transport radioactive materials be fitted with an alarm which shall be set whenever the vehicle is unmanned.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the House that I am satisfied that the arrangements in place for transporting radioactive materials will continue to maintain the excellent safety record in this area.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to make valid comparisons between energy prices in EC member states as figures will not necessarily be determined on the same basis.  Any comparison requires care, not only because of fluctuations in exchange rates but also because of differences in product quality, marketing practices and market structure.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the burden which the recent interest rate increases have imposed on many households.  These increases arise from the severe disruption of foreign exchange markets internationally which has occurred in recent weeks.

As market conditions return to normal interest rates will fall.</P>

The estimated cost of this relief in terms of tax forgone, before the recent interest rate increases are considered, will be £184 million in the 1992-93 tax year.  This is a very significant cost, and I could not consider measures which would add to this cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the major financial institutions either have so far been able to postpone increasing mortgage rates or are prepared to make special arrangements to <Col N="896" /> postpone the immediate impact of the increase, for those who wish to avail of them.  It is, of course, up to individual mortgage-holders to decide whether it is appropriate for them to opt for a postponement of the impact of the increase. The interest rate on local authority house purchase loans has not been increased and Housing Finance Agency loans are not affected.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 81 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government while fully recognising the overall benefits of the Single Market for Irish firms, is very much aware of the threats which the Market poses for certain areas of employment <Col N="897" /> such as customs clearance in intra-Community trade.</P>
    <P>While there are no specific arrangements in place to compensate customs clearance agents directly for loss of earnings due to the internal market, there is a broad range of training schemes available from FÁS, as well as advice and grant support schemes from industrial promotion agencies, which is available to individuals and firms wishing to diversify into other areas of business.  The EC Commission has put forward proposals for assistance in this area both through the existing Structural Funds and through further <i>ad hoc</i> measures.  The Commission has included a one-off budget heading of ECU 30 million in the preliminary draft budget for 1993 for the special measures throughout the Community. These proposals concentrate on retraining and assistance for developing new businesses and for local development initiatives.  There are no proposals for compensatory grants or income supplements.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies that Ireland has made every effort to ensure that the proposed EC funding is geared to Irish needs and that the State Agencies will provide whatever assistance is feasible through their existing training and industrial promotion schemes.</P>

It was decided to concentrate initially on liquor licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners.

      <P>I have been contacted by representatives of the publicans and arranged that they meet with the Revenue Commissioners to discuss any concerns they may have with the tax clearance requirements.</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the response from publicans and other intoxicating liquor licence holders to date has been very <Col N="899" /> satisfactory.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 85, 86 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="900" /> The Owenmore/Arrow Catchment is No. 16 of 28 catchments on the priority list of major catchments (catchments over 100,000 acres in extent) being considered for treatment under the Arterial Drainage Acts.</P>
    <P>The field studies in connection with the environmental impact assessment have been completed and studies in relation to the cost benefit analysis were also undertaken.  In the context of this analysis it was necessary to examine a variety of options before determining the optimum scheme.  Present indications are that it will be difficult, and may be impossible, to formulate any scheme which would give an economic return for the investment involved.  In the circumstances, the local drainage committee was consulted by the Office of Public Works in an effort to ensure that all potential benefits were identified. They subsequently listed a number of additional areas which they considered might benefit from the scheme and these areas have now been examined. However, until a review of the results, currently in hands, is completed it is not possible to say if an economic scheme for the catchment might be formulated and therefore the question of a financial allocation being made this year does not arise.  The results of the studies will be available shortly.  If and when it is decided to proceed with a scheme there is a lengthy, statutorily required, exhibition and consultation process to be followed. As a result of all investigations carried out to date I am aware of the extent of the flooding which can occur in the catchment area.  I regret the hardship caused by such flooding but can give no definite commitment at this time in relation to a solution to the problem.</P>

      <P>Under Sections 5 and 6 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 the Commissioners of Public Works are obliged to publish notice that they have prepared a drainage scheme and to send a copy of the drainage scheme to the relevant county councils which in turn must make it available for a period of one month for public inspection by any interested parties.  A county council may submit observations in regard to a scheme within three months of publication. Simultaneously with publication of a scheme, notices are served on individual landowners to be affected by the proposed scheme and a period of one month is allowed for receipt of their observations.</P>
      <P>After consultation with various Ministers all objections and observations received by the Commissioners must then be examined in detail and they may make such alterations to the scheme as they think proper prior to submitting it to the Minister for Finance.  In effect, therefore, the exhibition process usually takes considerably longer than the statutory period provided in the Act.</P>

      <P>Since the formal introduction of cost benefit analysis of arterial drainage schemes in 1970, one scheme, the Finn Lacky, which was selected for consideration under the E.C. sponsored Cross-Border drainage programme, was rejected by the Irish and British Governments on economic grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of formal cost benefit analysis, the best available economic indicator of the merit of a drainage scheme was the estimated increase in market values of benefitting <Col N="902" /> lands, and these are still used to scale the projects.  Using this method, four schemes were rejected as being uneconomic. These were the Erne, the Cahore, the Quin and the Owenkeagh.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the answer I gave the House on Tuesday, 31 March 1992 on the subject of staffing of the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>In that answer I explained that I was endeavouring to fill certain priority posts in the boards, and that includes the deputy manager posts.</P>
      <P>However, it is necessary, in accordance with Government policy, owing to restrictions on public expenditure, and by extension recruitment to the public service, to explore the possibility of filling these posts by redeployment from within the Public Service.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have completed their restructuring of the Customs and Excise Service and as a result of this they have identified surplus staff in certain areas.  They expect to be in a position to offer redeployment to these surplus staff on a targeted basis. This process will commence later this month.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards have been given priority regarding the reallocation of redeployed staff and I expect that there will be staff available in the near future for redeployment to the fisheries boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a previous parliamentary question, it has been recognised for some time that a substantial amount of freight traffic which might have been expected to travel via the central and southern corridors travels instead through the northern corridor.</P>
      <P>This diversion of traffic is attributable to a number of interwoven factors which operate in favour of the northern ports, including shipping costs, frequency and capacity of shipping services, port charges, and lower costs of Northern Ireland hauliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These problems are being tackled, <i>inter alia,</i> through a major programme <Col N="919" /> of investment in transport infrastructure under the operational programme on peripherality.  A key objective of this investment is to reduce the transport cost disadvantages which Ireland's unique peripherality and island nation status imposes on Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>On the initiative of the Government, KPMG Management Consulting were commissioned to examine and make recommendations on the whole area of access transport to and from Ireland.  The consultants who reported in July 1990 found that while investment in internal transport facilities was necessary, it was not sufficient to cater for Ireland's unique peripherality problems.  Substantial additional investment in access transport services was needed.</P>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of the consultants' findings, my predecessor made a formal application on behalf of the Government on 27 May 1991 for EC grant aid for initial specific priority investments on direct Ro/Ro and Lo/Lo services to mainland Europe.</P>
    <P>On 18 December 1991 the EC Commissioner for Regional Affairs indicated that the Commission was not in a position to agree to Ireland's proposal.  Among the reasons cited by the Commission were difficulties in relation to distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>Following direct personal intervention by me, the Commission agreed to consider a renewed application which would address, <i>inter alia,</i> the concerns which had been expressed by the Commission. The renewed application was forwarded to the Commission in April 1992.</P>
    <P>There have been further extensive discussions between my officials and the Commission.  Arising from these it was agreed to update aspects of the access transport study.  The Commission are at present considering the updated study and their response is awaited.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House earlier this year, my Department, as part of its input into Phase 2 of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI), appointed consultants to undertake a detailed examination of the possibilities of a light rail system for Dublin.  That work was completed and conveyed to the DTI itself.  Phase 2 of the DTI is now almost completed and an interim report is expected to be available within the next few weeks.  This report will form an integral part of the input into negotiations on EC Structural Funds for the period after 1993.</P>
      <P>I expect that the DTI Report will contain radical proposals involving bus and light rail options to resolve Dublin's traffic congestion problems.  Without wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the DTI, I believe that there are many advantages for Dublin in light rail technology and that as part of an integrated public transport strategy, light rail offers an innovative way of addressing some of the major transport problems of Dublin, including traffic congestion, pollution and a decline in the inner city heart of Dublin.  However, it is clear that such a major investment is beyond the capacity of the Exchequer, even allowing for the possibility of some investment by the private sector in the development of a light rail system.  Any light rail option would be dependent on the availability of substantial levels of financial assistance from the EC authorities for the proposed investment and I intend to pursue that approach in the months ahead.</P>

      <P>As more than a year had elapsed since the birth, the local registrar needed the authority of the Registrar-General to register the event and the application to his office was in respect of that authority. The initial application did not include all the appropriate documentation and it was necessary to write to the parents on several occasions before all the required documentation was completed and returned. Once that occurred, the application was processed in the normal way and the necessary authority to register the birth has now issued to the local registrar.  A birth certificate may be obtained from the latter as soon as one of the parents comes forward to register the birth.</P>

      <P>The Shankill-Bray by-pass was designed to minimise, in so far as possible, the effect of noise on residential areas.  Noise abatement measures, such as the provision of mounds, walls and other landscaping, have been provided by the local authority and have been funded from road grants for the scheme.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council have submitted a number of requests to my Department for funding towards the provision of double glazing for houses adjacent to the by-pass.  The local authority was advised that compensation is only payable to property owners where property is compulsorily acquired and that, in such cases, compensation, in default of agreement, is determined by arbitration under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
      <P>In a recent noise survey carried out on the council's behalf by the Eastern Health Board, noise levels in excess of 68 dB(A) were recorded at two properties. In both of these cases, accommodation works were agreed as part of the compensation paid to the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>An Bord Glas has published comprehensive five year development plans for the ware and seed potato sectors and these programmes are now in operation.</P>
      <P>Lack of storage, leading to market over-supply situations in the early part of the season and scarcities towards the end of the season, has been identified as a weakness in the potato sector.  This problem is being addressed by two schemes co-funded by the EC and the Exchequer, namely the Operational Programme for Rural Development and the FEOGA scheme of aid for the processing and marketing of agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, the provision of 40,000 tonnes of additional high quality storage and 15,000 tonnes of improved storage has been grant aided under these schemes.</P>
      <P>Potato quality, which primarily depends on variety, growing conditions and post harvest handling and grading, is generally satisfactory.  A recent Bord Glas consumer survey showed over 80 per cent satisfaction with quality.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service Commission has advertised a competition for agricultural <Col N="940" /> officers with closing date of 17 September 1992.  Applications are being processed at present.  The number of posts to be filled will be determined by the work situation in this Department in the next few years.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officers are the technical staff employed by the Department to implement its various schemes.  They must have a knowledge and understanding of the Department's policies in relation to these schemes and are required to ensure that the controls and regulations set down by the Department are adhered to.</P>
      <P>Duties of the grade range from supervision of slaughtering and production in meat plants, advising farmers with regard to disease control and checking that claims submitted under the farm development schemes and livestock schemes are correct.  Other duties involve cereal, grass and potato seed certification.</P>

      <Quest>if the Wildlife Service has been instructed to grant licences to snare and shoot badgers in TB blackspot areas; if there is compelling scientific evidence linking badgers with bovine TB and if he will give details of such evidence; if it has been brought to his attention that, when licences are granted during the breeding season, badger cubs are left to starve underground when their nursing mothers are eradicated; his views on whether the capture of badgers by snares, especially during the lactating period, is justifiable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may only be removed humanely for research purposes, strictly in accordance with conditions specified in licences issued by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the bovine TB eradication scheme my Department applies <Col N="941" /> for such licences where tuberculosis infected badgers have been identified in areas with high levels of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>It is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB and there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.  This was the consensus view expressed at the Royal Irish Academy Conference on &ldquo;The Badger&rdquo; which was held last year.  In addition, a review by the Economic and Social Research Institute entitled &ldquo;Badgers and Bovine T.B. in Ireland&rdquo;, published in 1989, states that in many parts of the country it may not be possible to control bovine TB without controlling the badger population.  The experience of other countries where tuberculosis became established in wildlife supports this view.</P>
    <P>It is also recognised that wildlife is just one of a number of sources of TB infection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Analysis revealed levels of an antibiotic of the tetracycline group exceeding the levels set-down in Commission Regulation 675/92.  As required by the European Communities (Control of Veterinary Medicinal Products and their Residues) Regulations, 1988 and 1990, this finding required that the veterinary inspector deem the carcase to be unfit for human consumption.  When the supplier <Col N="942" /> became aware of the positive finding it was queried with the veterinary inspector, who confirmed the positive result with the laboratory.  The factory management was informed that the carcase had been deemed unfit for human consumption. It was then denatured and subsequently sent to the skip, thus removing it from the food chain.</P>
