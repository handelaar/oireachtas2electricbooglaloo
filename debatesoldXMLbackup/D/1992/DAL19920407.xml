      <P>As has been indicated already to the Deputy in a reply to her question on 22 October 1991, the seven interim recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women were accepted in principle by the Government immediately after publication of the commission's first statement in April 1991.</P>
      <P>The only recommendation of the commission which has yet to be addressed by the Government refers to the appointment of a woman as a member of the Top Level Appointments Committee who select candidates for the top posts in the Civil Service.  I have, however, invited a suitable candidate to act on the committee, and to give effect to this recommendation. I am awaiting her reply.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and I would refer him to recommendation No. 1 of the report which calls for legislation to be introduced to give an equal right to women to the family home.  This has not been implemented.  Could the Taoiseach give me an idea as to why there is a delay on this since we now have the judgment of the Supreme Court, waiting for which was holding up the legislation when I last asked about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work has been proceeding on the drafting of a family home Bill which will correct the situation, and the Supreme Court decision merely confirmed that legislation is necessary to address this issue.  The draft heads of a Bill are currently with the parliamentary draftsman, although the Attorney General has given a lengthy opinion criticising some of the draft provisions.  The Bill may be introduced before the summer recess and will be if possible.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on 4 March the Attorney General had expected that his examination of this case would have been completed within the following two weeks.  The Attorney General informs me that in the event this has not proved possible because of the <Col N="659" /> other matters of urgent public importance which he has been obliged to deal with during that time and since. However, he is hopeful that he will be in a position to complete his examination very shortly.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach ensure in the public interest and in the interests of the Tallaght Two that there will be no further delay?  This matter has been pending for a long time and it is unsatisfactory in the public eye.  Would the Taoiseach assure the House that when the report comes to hand it will be immediately published?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>I have always tried to make it clear that any change in Protocol 17 to the Treaty, as it was signed on behalf of all member states of the Community in Maastricht on 7 February last, could only be made with the agreement of our eleven partners. That is why, since the question first arose, we have been making strenuous and consistent efforts, at all levels, to get the agreement of our partners to an amendment of the Protocol.</P>
      <P>The whole issue was considered at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg yesterday.  There, the Council did not agree to amend the Protocol.  They concluded that they could not reopen the Treaty or its Protocol since to do so could leave the way open to pressures in the other states for other amendments.  I should emphasise that all were sympathetic to our case and indicated that they would be as helpful as they could to Ireland in resolving our difficulty, in ways, including perhaps a formal Declaration or Interpretative Statement that did not reopen the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Government intend to consider the options open to them in the light of this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate, in the context of Question No. 3, the persons who were consulted with regard to the original drafting of the Protocol and will he confirm that if the <Col N="661" /> Maastricht Treaty is put to the people with the Protocol still in place it will in effect copperfasten the ban on travel and the difficulties in the information area that we currently have?  Would the Taoiseach agree that if the Protocol was removed, rather than amended, it would have the same impact in the area of travel and information as the amended Protocol proposed by the Government?  Have the Taoiseach or the Government suggested to the other member states, if they cannot agree to an amendment of the Protocol, that they might agree to a deletion of it on the basis that it would not add anything new to the Maastricht process, but would resolve the difficulties of travel and information in the European context and allow us address them at home by way of a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All the appropriate persons were consulted in relation to the drafting of the Protocol in the first instance.  With regard to amending or withdrawing the Protocol, the case is the same in so far as we have been informed that both represent a reopening of the whole Treaty.  Consequently it is not open to us to do either.  That is the position as it stands.  The 11 member states are sympathetic to our position but the reopening of the Treaty would involve pressures in various member states and one has to be extremely careful in relation to Maastricht.  It is most important for the future of this country.  While the other items are also important, we must look to our domestic situation to see how we can correct the problems which have arisen as a result of the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the Government fully support the concept of the full right to travel, the right to give information and the provision of non-directive counselling and that the Government will take urgent steps to change the law in Ireland, whether by way of legislation or referendum, as a matter of urgency, having regard to the fact that those rights as the law stands are severely curtailed or are <Col N="662" /> totally prohibited as the case may be? Can the Taoiseach give some kind of timescale as to when the necessary changes in the law will be brought in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My best advice at present is that it is not possible to clarify the right to travel or information by legislation. Now that the Community will not accept any change in the Protocol in accordance with the approach we have been adopting, it will have to be considered in the domestic situation by a constitutional amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Taoiseach has said that the option of deletion of the Protocol is ruled out on the basis that we cannot amend without the agreement of the 11 partners.  Is the only option now a referendum, on the basis of the advice available to him at the Cabinet meeting this morning?  Could he make that advice available to other parties in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not have a Cabinet meeting this morning.  We had to attend the State visit of the King and Queen of Sweden.  The question of how we clarify the position in relation to travel and the provision of information will be controlled by this Oireachtas, and I indicated last week that it appeared a constitutional amendment would be required.</P>

      <P>Is the outcome of recent discussions at EC level in accordance with the findings of the soundings taken over the past weeks when, it is understood, agents of the Government approached the EC partners with a view to determining what would or would not be acceptable?</P>

    <Col N="663" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that over a number of weeks we have been extremely busy on the diplomatic front in relation to this problem.  Initially member states were very understanding and sympathetic towards our position.  The question then arose as to how the matter could be resolved and whether a reconvened Intergovernmental Conference could be considered.  That was ruled out.  A majority of the member states have also set their face against a new meeting of the IGC with a short agenda.  We are extremely gratified at the assistance and help we received from all the member states and the permanent representatives in Brussels in getting as far as yesterday, when Foreign Ministers of the member states made their position clear.  It is now up to the Government to look at all options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the original intention of the Protocol was to ensure that the Maastricht referendum would not become entwined in the abortion debate?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the effect of the Protocol is to enmesh the referendum on Maastricht into that debate and that because of this a referendum needs to be held to address the issues of travel and information in advance of the referendum on Maastricht?  When the Taoiseach stated to the House that the appropriate persons had been consulted about the wording of the Protocol, did he include within the category of appropriate persons Senator Hanafin?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Protocol <Col N="664" /> was to give protection to the wording of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and to protect the constitutional position from being superseded by European law. We signed an international treaty on 7 February and the position is the same as it was then.  The Supreme Court have interpreted in a specific situation Article 40.3.3º and consequently it raises a problem.  After yesterday it begins to look more likely that we must address the problem in the domestic situation. Europe is not prepared to reopen the Treaty either to amend or to delete the Protocol.  It is up to us to make up our minds as to where we are going.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not quite clearly reply to my previous supplementary, although perhaps it was implicit.  Are the Government fully committed to the right to travel and information? I should like the Taoiseach specifically to clarify Government support for those issues.

All our efforts over the past weeks have been to try to find a way to clarify the position in relation to travel and information.

      <P>What does the Taoiseach regard as being the primary opinion in the debate that is likely to take place between now and the Maastricht referendum, European Community requirements, the decision of the Supreme Court and their interpretation of the Constitution or the need to comply with the Constitution as amended in 1983?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand what question the Deputy is trying to ask.  We approached this matter on the basis of keeping in close contact with the services in Brussels.  At all times we were guided by advice at home as well as by advice available to us from the services in Brussels to ensure that what we are attempting complies with European law.  Of course, we were also conscious of the fact that we had to comply with our domestic position.  There were times when what was right in Europe was wrong here and <i>vice versa</i>.  It is a question of trying to find a way to intermesh the two.  All of that is now more or less out of the way in terms of the conclusion of the 12 Foreign Ministers yesterday.  We are considering what they said in relation to this matter and we will revert to them very shortly.  It is becoming clearer with each day that passes that we will have to find our own domestic solutions to the problems because Europe is not prepared to change the Protocol.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the thinking of the Government with regard to the offer of a solemn declaration? Are we to take it that he does not regard such a declaration as an adequate way of dealing with the questions that have arisen as a result of the Supreme Court decision and complicated by the Protocol?  In addition, will he indicate his view or that of the Attorney General as to the likely impact on the Protocol if an amendment to Article 40.3.3º is carried either before or after the Maastricht referendum?  In other words, would a change to Article 40.3.3º, regardless of when the referendum is held, not nullify the Protocol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Protocol as it exists relates to Article 40.3.3º.  I want to make it abundantly clear that any changes we make to Article 40.3.3º will not have the protection of the Protocol.  When considering the various options we must consider the existence of Article 40.3.3º and the Protocol as they stand.  Any changes to Article 40.3.3º would not have the protection of the Protocol unless the 11 <Col N="667" /> member states agree to change the Protocol, which they have refused to do up to now.  Therefore, when we are talking about a new or amended Article, unless the member states agree the Protocol will not be changed.  In relation to the question of a solemn declaration or an interpretative statement, it is generally accepted that that does not carry the full legal strength of a protocol.  Consequently, I have asked the Attorney General to examine both the interpretative statement and the solemn declaration to see whether they can be helpful to us.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that what this party said a few weeks ago has been borne out by what has happened in the intervening three weeks?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs said in a radio programme this morning that the door is still slightly ajar.  Has something happened since this morning to change that position?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On several occasions in the course of his replies the Taoiseach referred to the Attorney General and his advice.  In view of the fact that all these events which are now causing such anguish flowed from the <Col N="668" /> original decision of the Attorney General to injunct a 14 year old from leaving the country, may I ask the Taoiseach if he still has confidence in the Attorney General and his advice?</P>

      <P>In relation to a reply by the Taoiseach a moment or two ago, may I ask him whether, if a constitutional amendment were introduced taking the form of an additional clause following Article 40.3.3º along the lines, &ldquo;nothwithstanding the contents of Article 40.3.3º the right to travel and to information is protected&rdquo;, the protection afforded to Article 40.3.3º by the Protocol might still remain in respect of that subclause of the Constitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Danes have decided to hold their referendum on 2 June and other administrations are engaged in the process of ratification.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the five year period 1986 to 1991 there was an estimated net outward migration of approximately 1,600 persons from County Leitrim and 3,100 from County Meath.  These figures are derived as a residual by subtracting the natural <Col N="674" /> increases in the population of the relevant counties, that is, the number of births less the number of deaths, from the corresponding changes in population as measured by the 1986 and 1991 Census of Population.  It is not possible to disaggregate these figures by year.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the figures quoted represent the net effect of all movements into and out of the counties of Leitrim and Meath, not only to or from abroad but also to or from other parts of the State.  They therefore correspond to the net of two gross flows &mdash; outward and inward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What exact number of the figures given, 3,100, relates to each of the years?  Surely we should have an idea of the annual number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, it is not possible to disaggregate these figures on a yearly basis.  It is not possible to do that between two censuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>How many births were there in County Leitrim in the three years mentioned, in that the figure is obtained by taking the number of deaths from the number of births?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if it is helpful to the Deputy I can provide the following figures: the population of County Leitrim in 1986 was 14,205 males and 12,830 females, a total of 27,035 persons.  The figures in 1991 were 13,190 males and <Col N="675" /> 12,107 females, a total of 25,297 persons. The change in population, therefore, showed 1,015 fewer males and 723 fewer females, a total of 1,738 fewer persons. The number of births in the period referred to was 935 males and 909 females, a total of 1,844.  Deaths amounted to 1,175 males and 813 females, a total of 1,988 persons.  The natural increase, taking births from deaths, showed a fall of 144.  Taken with other figures provided, net migration is calculated at 1,594.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 21, 28 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>I recently informed the House that I met Professor Dermot McAleese, chairman of the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, and received an advance copy of the development plan for Dún Laoghaire.  In the course of our meeting we discussed the future development of the harbour and the board's role in assisting me in achieving and overseeing that development.</P>
      <P>The Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board were appointed in January 1990 to advise on the management and development of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  The board will report to the Minister for the Marine until such time as a harbour authority are established on a legislative basis.</P>
      <P>The board prepared a draft development plan for Dún Laoghaire harbour in April 1991.  A public exhibition of the details of the draft development plan was mounted, which included a scale model of the harbour.  This display took place over a series of special public exhibitions in Dún Laoghaire.  Almost 7,000 people visited the exhibition and 500 submissions were received by the board in response to the draft plan.</P>
      <P>Since then the board have been engaged in a careful examination of the submissions received.  The development plan represents the outcome of the board's deliberations and the decisions taken following a thorough examination of the comments and valuable suggestions received on the initial draft.</P>
      <P>This plan should serve as a blueprint for the development of Dún Laoghaire harbour for the remainder of this decade and well into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already sent the plan for publication and expect it to be available within a few weeks.  At present my departmental officials are considering its contents.  When the plan is formally launched and available to the many groups interested in the development, I shall bring forward proposals as to how its recommendations can be progressed. Any proposals for development will fall <Col N="677" /> to be considered in the context of the 1994 to 1997 round of EC structural funding.</P>
    <P>I shall consider permanent arrangements for the operation and development of Dún Laoghaire harbour, including legislative changes in the context of the report of the Review Committee on Harbour's Legislation, which I expect to receive shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 20 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that existing harbours and pilotage legislation is no longer appropriate to present day needs. The Harbours Act, 1946 was based on the report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal of 1930.  The pilotage legislation dates from 1913.  It was for this reason <Col N="678" /> that the Review Group on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation was set up.  The review group includes a broad representation of interests associated with ports &mdash; the Port Authorities Association, the Confederation of Irish Industry, a transport economist, a local authorities representative, a SIPTU representative and a representative of my Department.  The task of the group is to evaluate critically existing legislation and policy in the light of modern requirements and to make recommendations for a revised legislative code and an up-date of policy for commercial ports and pilotage.  The review group, which has been in session since January, 1991, have now almost completed their task and should shortly be in a position to present their report and recommendations to me.</P>

      <P>May I first remind the Minister that, at his last Question Time, he said he would have that report by the end of March?  Since reports are only reports will he agree that it is totally inappropriate that harbour authorities, who must operate within a competitive arena, are limited by bureaucratic constraints, requiring ministerial approval for changes in, for example, harbour dues and rates for different types of harbours? Given the complexities of pricing structures, would the Minister say whether he would immediately examine changing this procedure by regulation to allow greater flexibility to individual ports?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy, in general terms, that it is important that as many functions as possible be devolved to the ports and harbours authorities and that they be given freedom to get on with the job.  It is in that context this whole study has been conducted.  I expect to receive the report shortly.  In fact I understand it will come to hand quite soon, when the Deputy will have an opportunity to consider its contents and the <Col N="679" /> best way to proceed thereafter.  I agree there is quite a number of anomalous conditions which should be cleared up and which should be devolved to the ports authorities themselves, giving them more control over their activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 39 together.  A statutory inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Acts is being carried out into this incident by a marine surveyor of my Department.  In addition, I asked the French authorities to carry out a port state control inspection of the vessel on its arrival in Roscoff on the day after the incident.  The French authorities carried out their inspection and reported to me that some minor deficiencies were discovered. These were not sufficiently serious to warrant detention.  Therefore, the vessel was allowed to proceed from Roscoff to Plymouth.  Also the Bahamian authorities &mdash; the flag state for the vessel &mdash; were notified by me of the incident. That administration are conducting their own investigation in full co-operation with my Department.  My own Department's inquiry involves interviewing of crew members and passengers.  Newspaper advertisements have been placed inviting passengers who were on the <Col N="680" /> vessel and those with specific knowledge of the incident to make submissions to my Department within one month.  When these submissions have been received and assessed the marine accident investigation report will be made to me.  I would expect to receive the report in about two months time.</P>
      <P>When I have completed the examination of the report I will take whatever action I think is necessary based on the findings.  Preliminary advice suggests that this incident is not one in which it would be appropriate to hold a full public inquiry.  Fortunately, there was no loss of life and no serious injury has been reported to me as a result of the incident. I would envisage the release of a report, following a thorough statutory investigation by a technical expert from my Department who will have heard all witnesses, as being the most appropriate approach in this instance.</P>
      <P>As I recently announced to the House, I have decided that from November, 1991 a report of investigations into marine accidents will be released and made available to the public.  This new policy will, therefore, apply to the incident to which the Deputy refers.  I have taken the decision to publish a report in future in the interests of maritime safety and in order to allay public concern about such accidents.</P>

May I ask the Minister a further question: would he agree that, in certain instances, the lashings on the ship in question to chain down trucks were deemed to be faulty?  Will the Minister say whether that will be taken into consideration in the full investigation to be carried out?  Furthermore, if a public inquiry is deemed to be necessary will the Minister say whether he will facilitate those people who have called for such a public inquiry?</P>

      <Quest>if he will clarify the effects of the proposed liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling on the deep sea section of Dublin port; if he supports the proposals by the Dublin Port and Docks Board; if he will outline the steps if any, he will be taking to ensure continuity of service for shippers and ships agents of deep sea freight using Dublin port in the short term future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the High Court appointed a liquidator yesterday to wind up the operations of Dublin Cargo Handing Ltd &mdash; Dublin Cargo Handling &mdash; in the deep sea sector of Dublin port.</P>
      <P>The management of Dublin port is a statutory function of the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  Responsibility for industrial relations matters and decisions in relation to the structure of stevedoring arrangements in the deep sea sector are a matter for the board and their now liquidated wholly owned subsidiary, Dublin Cargo Handling.  The board considered all the options available to them to improve the competitiveness, profitability and reliability of the stevedoring service for port users before reaching their decision to proceed with liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling.  I was disappointed that my initiative to bring both sides back to the table for discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission last week, while successful in so far as Dublin Cargo Handling and the workers agreed to participate, regrettably, failed to resolve the matters at issue and avoid the liquidation of Dublin Cargo Handling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the continuity of service for shippers, I am advised by Dublin Port and Docks Board that the liquidator will <Col N="682" /> endeavour to have new stevedoring structures in place as soon as practical.</P>
    <P>I understand ship operators have in place alternative transport arrangements which are serving their needs and the needs of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin port accounts for over 50 per cent of the value of our sea trade?  Therefore, would he agree it is vital there not be a prolonged dispute at this port?  In addition, is he aware that the liquidator will render all 218 staff redundant this afternoon?  In those circumstances what steps will the Minister take to avoid dispute by ensuring that the £4.5 million redundancy and compensation package on the table last week remains on the table as opposed to mere statutory redundancy? Furthermore, would he agree that a prolonged dispute would greatly erode the importance of and need for a secure and competitive Dublin port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, very concerned about the present and future conditions at Dublin port.  I am particularly anxious to ensure that the port will be free to develop to meet the rapidly changing needs of the present day.  So far as the liquidator is concerned, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the courts have appointed the liquidator and naturally it would be premature for me to become involved in the issue immediately.  As soon as the liquidator has had an opportunity to assess the situation I will seek an early meeting with him so that I can make known my concerns. In any event, we can spell out our concerns about the port very clearly here today.  Dublin port is one of our major ports and it serves the central corridor.  I am primarily concerned about retaining jobs, restoring the service to port users in the deep sea sector and maximising the development and employment potential of the port through a high quality service which is competitive, economically sound, profitable, reliable and efficient. I want Dublin port to be capable of availing of the opportunities which exist. We now have an opportunity, within the <Col N="683" /> European Community and with the Structural Funds which are available, to develop to meet the challenges which are on offer there.  I am very anxious to see this taking place and to see Dublin port developing.  The Deputy can be assured that I will do everything I can to meet the concerns which he has expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute related to 26 per cent of the port &mdash; the Dublin Cargo Handling element, the deep sea section. Will the Minister ensure that the remaining 74 per cent of the port &mdash; the terminals which deal with oil, the B &amp; I terminal and other individual terminals &mdash; will not be affected if there is a dispute?  Will he also ensure that the enormous trade there which is vital to the economy will be preserved come what may?  Will he give a commitment that the Government will ensure that that is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will accept that the Government will do everything possible to maintain the port, particularly that part of it which is not directly affected by the dispute.  That will certainly be our objective.  There was a certain amount of goodwill during recent days but unfortunately it was not possible to find a solution to the dispute.  On the basis of the goodwill which existed, I hope solutions can be found.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This project has been submitted for Structural Fund assistance under the Operational Programme for Rural Development.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer Deputies to my statement on this subject in the House on the occasion of the Committee Stage of the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991.</P>
      <P>In the statement I said that the preliminary findings indicated that the matter required further investigation by the Garda Síochána and that the papers had been referred to the Garda Commissioner. A senior Garda officer was appointed to investigate the matter and the investigation is now under way.  When this investigation is completed the Garda Authorities will decide whether or not a file should be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this stage.  I have also been advised that in view of the Garda investigation it would be inappropriate at this stage to publish a report based on the inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1948.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage of the Merchant Shipping Bill, 1991, I announced to the House that on an experimental basis my Department would, unless legally debarred from so doing, release a report of marine accident investigations undertaken by the Department of the Marine.  I took this decision in the interest of maritime safety and to allay public concern about marine accidents.</P>
      <P>My new policy will have implications for the conduct of inquiries by the marine surveyors of my Department and work has already begun to devise a new <i>modus operandi</i> for future investigations.  This new policy will apply to the <i>mv Kilkenny-mv Hasselswerder</i> collision in November last and to all subsequent marine accident investigations conducted by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that there will often be a time lag between the date of an accident and the date of publication of the related report.  Delays may occur in cases where the pursuit of legal proceedings arising from a casualty effectively <Col N="688" /> prevents release of a departmental report until after the completion of the legal process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taken aback by the Minister's reply.  The Minister received quite a lot of credit and support from all sides of the House when he announced that he would publish the reports of accidents. However, he has now received the report but has said he will not publish it because the Garda are examining it.  Will the Minister say why the public are not entitled to this information?  The Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda can draw their own separate conclusions but this is an issue of public importance and accountability because I have been advised that certain parties were culpable in relation to this accident in Dublin Bay: two boats were in the same lane, which should not have happened.  Safety procedures are in place and it is vital to publish the report.  Will the Minister confirm that, although he has the report, he refuses to publish it?  If so, his new policy is a sham.</P>

      <P>I made it very clear that certain questions were being referred to the Garda authorities and that is the way the matter stands.  The purpose of the report is to find out what happened in relation to regulations and other matters concerning the incident.  It is not the function of the Department of the Marine &mdash; nor would they have the authority &mdash; to attribute culpability to anybody.  I have given an undertaking that a report will be produced on any future incidents.  I have explained to the House what I did in relation to this incident and why I did it.</P>

Will he indicate whether any matters arose from the inquiry which do not involve a reference to the Garda and which can now be made available to the public?

The Deputy may have seen a statement in the newspapers recently to the effect that the investigations had been concluded but that was later denied by the Garda press office.

If he says that the report will not apportion blame how could it then infringe or prejudice Garda action in any way?  The Minister said that he has not seen the report.  Will he make it his business to do so to enable him to conclude whether it should be published or whether there is a smokescreen or unnecessary delays in regard to its publication? I am far from happy with the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>When the report has been fully completed, obviously it will then come to me.  However, one of the difficulties is that we changed our policy following an incident.  I said in the reply that my Department are looking at a new <i>modus operandi</i> in relation to reports because questions of confidentiality arise in relation to statements made.  People should know in advance that their statements will be published.  That causes complications in regard to this report; <Col N="690" /> the new <i>modus operandi</i> will be that, following future incidents, people will be told that this is the way the report will be conducted.  They will know exactly where they stand and matters will be clarified at the outset.  It is not clear in this instance because, as I said, we changed the policy following an incident.</P>

      <P>When the Minister announced that he would publish reports it was welcomed by all sides of the House, indeed many Members wanted the policy to be retrospective.

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the success of the Naval Service regarding the arrest and conviction of foreign vessels in our territorial waters, he will outline his views on whether the fines imposed are adequate; if he has any plans to look for a substantial increase in order to pose a real deterrent for illegal fishing activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, penalties of up to a maximum of £100,000 are prescribed under the Fisheries Acts for fisheries offences in Ireland's economic zone.  The Acts also provide for the forfeiture of the catch and gear.  In addition, where persistent offenders are concerned, the courts have discretionary powers to confiscate the offending boats.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the courts to decide what level of fine should be imposed in any individual case and this will vary from case to case.  The average fine in recent years would be of the order of £18,000. In some cases fines have been as high as £51,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These penalties constitute a major deterrent to potential law breakers. Indeed, from information recently made available by the EC Commission, it appears that the penalties provided for in current Irish legislation are tougher than <Col N="692" /> those applicable in any other member state of the Community.</P>
    <P>I am, however, conscious that within the industry there is a view that the powers of the courts need to be amended to provide for the mandatory confiscation of boats convicted of serious fishing offences on more than one occasion. While I fully understand the concerns of the industry, I am advised that for constitutional reasons it seems most unlikely that such offences could be made mandatory.  Nevertheless, I have asked my officials to examine this issue in more detail in the context of work currently under way on draft proposals for certain amendments to the Fisheries Acts.</P>
    <P>While dealing with the issue of penalties for fishing offences, I think it relevant to mention that, in an EC Commission discussion document on monitoring implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy, presented to last week's Fisheries Council, the Commission has suggested the possibility of harmonising within the Community the judicial procedures and financial penalties for fishing infringements.  This suggestion will be considered as a matter of urgency within my Department.  While I would not wish to prejudge the outcome of this exercise, my overall concern in relation to any possible harmonisation will be to ensure that it would not in any respect dilute or diminish the range of penalties currently available to our courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Minister has given a very comprehensive reply. Would he not agree that out of the 55 foreign vessels arrested off our coasts and in our territorial waters last year, 38 were Spanish?  It appears they consider the fines to be derisory and it is profitable for them to risk being caught.  Is the Minister about to take any action, through his EC counterparts, against the Spanish authorities to restrain their fishermen from fishing in our territorial waters because it appears the fines are no deterrent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the fines one has to bear in mind that in some instances <Col N="693" /> there is the possibility of the gear and the catch being confiscated.  In 1990, £647,000 was given in lieu of gear and catches confiscated, and in 1991 the figure was £441,000.  I appreciate the importance of the point made by the Deputy about those who are fishing from Castletownbere, the south and south-west areas and along the west coast.  I will be examining that question very closely because it is one we need to keep abreast of.</P>

      <P>The provision of a research vessel on the lines suggested by the Deputy would cost up to £20 million.  The immediate priority in this area is to apply available resources to upgrading the existing national research vessel, the <i>Lough Beltra</i>.  Some £700,000 will be invested over the next two years in equipping the <i>Lough Beltra</i> to the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>This much needed investment is one of the key marine measures under the STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe) Operational Programme for Ireland.  The expenditure, which is being 75 per cent funded by the European Regional Development Fund, will involve the provision of specialised navigational, measuring and sampling equipment for the <i>Lough Beltra</i>.  This will greatly improve the scope and quality of the ship's marine data collection capability and will enable more efficient and cost effective use to be made of the national research vessel by Irish marine interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without in any way seeking to take from the excellent work the staff and crew of <i>Lough Beltra</i> have sought to achieve to date, would the Minister not agree that the vessel is totally <Col N="694" /> inadequate for the proper research and development of our fisheries and fishery resources?  Would he not accept that as an estuarial and coastal vessel of a little over 60 feet it does not measure up to what a country that retains over 25 per cent of the fishery resources of the EC requires?  Can the Minister indicate whether the 75 per cent funding available under STRIDE or elsewhere for the development of the <i>Lough Beltra</i> would not equally be available to the Minister for the acquisition of a vessel along the lines suggested in my question?  Finally, would he not accept that whatever capital is spent in this direction would be readily recouped to the Irish Exchequer through the development of adequate fisheries resources?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is talking about £20 million; it may be £16 million or £17 million, but a very substantial sum. Last Friday in Luxembourg I made the point raised by the Deputy concerning the size of our resource, the need to base our conservation policies on sound information and the fact that we need greater assistance if we are to do this job properly.  I am very conscious of that point and I would look to the Marine Research Institute to take up this question and examine it on our behalf.

It would be inappropriate to divulge these measures at this stage.  As of now there are no difficulties.</P>
      <P>As for the impact of the dispute on the economy, it is too early to give a clear assessment.  However, it would appear that banking services are being maintained and so long as that position continues, the impact of the dispute will be limited.</P>

      <P>In his reply the Minister did not refer to the arrangements which are being made with regard to the payments for social welfare recipients. As I understand it, public servants may use cheque books and the so-called <Col N="696" />&ldquo;hole-in-the-wall&rdquo; facilities to gain cash but the vast majority of social welfare recipients do not have cheque accounts. Will the Minister indicate what arrangements are being made to ensure that those who receive cheques from the Department will be enabled to cash them so that they will have money to feed themselves at the end of this week?</P>

      <P>Assuming that there is no significant change, the payment of salaries by way of electronic transfers will operate as normal and standing orders will be met.  Approximately 50 per cent of salaries are paid by way of electronic transfers.  With regard to the remainder of salaries which are paid by cheque no problems are anticipated in cashing them in the banks that are open or, if people would prefer not to go to those banks, in the other network of banks.  The same will apply in the case of pensions paid by cheque to Civil Service pensioners; no difficulties are foreseen in cashing them at this stage.  With regard to social welfare payments, I was in touch with the Department of Social Welfare this morning and they have confirmed that this dispute will not cause any great difficulties in continuing to make payments through the normal network.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; I presume that is the Department he is referring to &mdash; have indicated that they do not foresee any difficulties but as there are tens of thousands of social welfare recipients who do not know at this stage where they will get cash to pay for groceries and so on at the end of this week will the Minister indicate what arrangements have been made?  I presume some contingency plans have been put in place and I should like to know <Col N="697" /> what will be done to ensure that these people will have money at the weekend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy De Rossa is aware, the majority of the Department's cheques in any normal week do not go through the banking system so the normal arrangements will apply so long as there is cash in circulation.  There will be no difficulties in regard to that matter. With regard to social welfare and other statutory cheques &mdash; we have been monitoring the position every few hours &mdash; while there is no need to go through the figures a large proportion of the banks are still open.  In the case of the two main banks, the AIB and Bank of Ireland, close on 500 banks are open.  Should there be a major or significant change and the banks are unable to cope contingency arrangements have been made; the other network of banks could be used.  The details of the contingency arrangements, if they are to be successful, must remain confidential and, if necessary, they will be put into operation within a matter of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed that despite long and intensive negotiations a solution to this dispute could not be found before the ultimate step of strike action was taken.  Apart from the hardship to the community and potential damage to the economy the Government are concerned that in a situation where we as a country need foreign investment our image abroad could be adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This dispute has a particularly long history and has been the subject of investigation by two bank tribunals before <Col N="699" /> eventually being the subject of a Labour Court recommendation.  Prior to this the Labour Relations Commission were involved and have been involved more recently.  The Labour Court in their recommendation did not concede the IBOA claim for a straight salary increase but recommended an alternative approach under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which involves a 6 per cent increase from 1 May, 3 per cent basic and 3 per cent local bargaining, a lump sum of £750 and an extra days annual leave in return for extra opening hours.</P>
    <P>The recommendation was not accepted by the IBOA and in an effort to break the deadlock further discussions were held in the Labour Relations Commission but despite their best efforts a settlement was not achieved.</P>
    <P>As I said on a number of occasions, a resolution of this dispute must rest in the end with the banks and the IBOA and third party intervention can only be as effective as the parties to the dispute will allow.  I regret to say that at present I do not see any real desire by the parties to enter meaningful dialogue but I would again call on both sides to sit down immediately and open discussions in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation.</P>
    <P>I am keeping in close contact with the situation and monitoring developments hourly.  Deputies can take it that I will spare no efforts to help bring about a resolution of this dispute.</P>
    <P>Meetings with the Federation of Irish Employers and ICTU have been arranged for tomorrow and I will review the situation following these talks.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the view of the general public the Government and himself, as Minister for Labour, have sleep-walked themselves into this dispute by failing to take any action to prevent a strike and by <Col N="700" /> failing to do anything about it since it happened?  Has the Minister met the IBOA or members of the banks' standing committee and, if not, has he any intention of meeting them within the next few days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject utterly the contention that the Government have been passive in their attitude with regard to the damage that could be caused by this dispute.  I should remind the Deputy that when it became clear last Thursday that the dispute had escalated I immediately called on the parties to sit down together and emphasised that the Labour Relations Commission would be available to see if the dispute could be sorted out.  As we are all aware, despite their best efforts, the Labour Relations Commission were unable to resolve the dispute over the weekend and the strike commenced yesterday morning.</P>
      <P>Second, I should make the point to the Deputy that the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and I are available to the parties at all times should they so wish but, until there is evidence of trust and goodwill between the parties it will be difficult to find a solution to this dispute.  I have kept a close eye on the situation at all times and have emphasised that the Labour Relations Commission are available to the parties.  They are experienced officials and are involved in the resolution of disputes weekly. Unfortunately, we have not been successful so far but that machinery is still available should the parties wish to avail of it.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the banks are currently engaged in a campaign of intimidation and are among other things, taking cars back from managers who refuse to sign declarations that they will not participate in the strike; that officials who were in fact granted examination leave have been transferred in such a way that they no longer qualify for it and that what is at issue, from his point of view as Minister for Labour, is the defence of the fundamental right of <Col N="701" /> people to organise themselves in a trade union?  Is the Minister aware the banks are engaged in constructive dismissal, which is in breach of the Unfair Dismissals Act?  In view of the gross intimidation that is now occurring in one bank, of which I have documentary evidence, will he open a confidential telephone line in his Department to enable harassed bank officials to report instances of intimidation that are occuring on a daily basis?</P>

I agree that to organise and take free decisions is a fundamental right of every employee in any industry or service industry.  My Department have made staff available to take these reports, and I am concerned about them.  I regret that this is happening.

      <P>As far as I am concerned, any complaints that come to the notice of my Department can be dealt with. However, let me point out that if we are interested in resolving this dispute it is important that I do not get involved in recriminations or counter-recriminations. I am trying to ensure that an atmosphere of goodwill and trust prevails in order to resolve this dispute.  The chairman of the Labour Court referred in the Labour Court recommendations to the very poor industrial relations atmosphere which has been a dominant feature of the banking system for some time and stated that when this dispute is resolved &mdash; hopefully shortly &mdash; that issue should be taken up in detail by the Labour Relations Commission.  In the interest of seeking to resolve this dispute, which is our primary objective at present, I am <Col N="702" /> anxious not to heighten tensions but to try to create an atmosphere in which the dispute can be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that he should get in touch with both sides, the banks and the union, to point out that the Members of this House will do everything in their power to ensure that intimidation or any such practice does not continue and if either the banks or the union engage in these practices they will get no support from the Members of this House?  Would the Minister not agree that it would improve the atmosphere if the spokespersons for both sides were taken off the airwaves?  We do not want to listen to a war of figures every hour on the hour.  It would be far more in their line if they sat down around a table and tried to resolve their differences rather than trying to score points off each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, of course, at the Deputy's request, as I have been doing in public statements, indicate the view of the Members of this House to the parties concerned.  Second, I agree &mdash; and I stated this publicly last night &mdash; that if as much energy were to be directed by the parties concerned to the resolution of this dispute as to the war of words over the airwaves, perhaps we would be closer to a settlement.  Although I understand that during the strike both sides need to give their version of events, I have continually indicated to both parties the need to desist from such activity and pursue the line referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister I understand that all his hard work to date has consisted of making public statements to the press, and the words attributed to him in a report in this morning's paper where he talked about &ldquo;a trial of strength&rdquo; and &ldquo;war of attrition&rdquo; were not very helpful.  Did the Minister at any stage communicate his views directly to either party to the dispute, because from what he has said he seems to have failed to do that?  Does he agree that it is the Government's <Col N="703" /> responsibility to ensure that we have a proper banking system in this country and what is he going to do about that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute is a long-running matter and we have spent the past three weekends between the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission trying to resolve it.  These people are highly qualified in industrial relations procedures.  Let me say also that the Labour Court pointed out in their recommendations that the problem arises as much from the deep-seated attitudes of the parties as from the procedures or lack of them, and that it is a symptom of an overall problem which must be resolved in any event.</P>
      <P>I would not accept that any public statements I have made have in any way heightened the dispute, quite the contrary. I have been seeking to indicate to the parties that the people and the Government, given the wider implications of the dispute, wish to see the matter resolved.  A cornerstone of our industrial relations procedure is a voluntary approach, which has been adopted, and the need to respect the arbitration either of the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the need for the Minister to be seen to be acting objectively, but when he said there was no disposition to settle the dispute was he referring specifically to the attitude taken up by the banks' management?  Does he acknowledge that the public generally do not accept that the banks should use their power to try to break the union and specifically to prevent the union from having any say in the shape and structure of future services due to the pervasive impact of technology?  Will he ask his Department to conduct an investigation <Col N="704" /> into the allegations of intimidation; such as &mdash; and I wonder is the Minister aware of this &mdash; people on full-time study leave in Limerick being threatened with withdrawal of their scholarships; an assistant manager whose wife is on temporary contract being threatened that her temporary contract will not be renewed if he persists; people who have refused to sign forms being reduced to tears by management in one-to-one interviews; and a particular manager in the Bank of Ireland advising his staff that he will see to it for the remainder of his days in office that they would never be promoted if they support the IBOA action?</P>

I will monitor those allegations to see how well founded they are.  My primary objective as Minister for Labour is to resolve this dispute.  As Deputy Rabbitte has said, it is important that a measure of objectivity on the general issues be maintained so that we can bring the parties together to resolve the dispute. In relation to the other matters I would ask the Deputy to take what I have said in good faith.</P>

Mitchell: whether the Minister for Justice intends to immediately take action to deal with the problem of gangs of youths intimidating citizens in Dublin; (3) Deputy Cotter: the need to re-open the jam making plant, formerly Lairds Foods in Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, considering that a number of growers in the north east have no market for their respberries and strawberries; (4) Deputy Lee: the current controversy over the delay in providing coronary artery by-pass surgery; (5) Deputy McCartan: the inadequate police resources and police numbers assigned to the J district of the Dublin Metropolitan District Area and the need for urgent attention to be given to the rising crime rate and related problems of the residential areas of Dublin north east; (6) Deputy G.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach remember any major legislation that has been put through the Dáil in the last year every section of which was properly discussed on Committee Stage?  Again, today, we have decided to put through legislation the bulk of which will not be discussed section by section.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that there is some urgency in establishing a system of standing committees to deal properly with every section and every amendment of every Bill rather than have a charade of a parliamentary process, as will be the case this evening in regard to this legislation, where the bulk of the Bill will not be discussed?</P>

May I ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Social Welfare has issued regulations curtailing the availability of pay-related benefit to many workers who are on short-time work, for example, in places such as the Waterford glass factory? I believe the Department have made a statement to this effect.  Does the Taoiseach realise the difficulties for workers in that there will be further restrictions on their take home earnings?</P>

Legislation in this area has been promised session after session, the last promise that it would be taken before the end of March.  I understand there are other pressures on the Government, but that will always be the case.  Could pressure be brought to bear to ensure that the one constitutional officer who works for this House is given the powers he should have?

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Employment) consisting of 15 members of Dáil Éireann and 4 members of Seanad Éireann (none of whom shall be a member of the Government or Minister of State), be appointed</P>
      <P>(a) to examine and make recommendations on all aspects of economic and social policy which have a bearing on employment creation and which can contribute to alleviating unemployment and</P>
      <P>(b) to consider and make recommendations on any other issues or subjects which the Joint Committee considers relevant to its task</P>
      <P>and report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas at least three times a year.</P>
      <P>(2) That the Joint Committee shall have power to appoint subcommittees (which may consist of members of the Oireachtas who are not members of the Joint Committee) and to delegate any matter comprehended by paragraph (1) to a subcommittee.</P>
      <P>(3) That the Joint Committee shall have power to nominate persons who are representatives from interested bodies to assist each subcommittee in its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Joint <Col N="842" /> Committee shall have the power to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it or any of its subcommittees in their consideration of any matters comprehended by paragraph (1).</P>
    <P>(5) That, where a matter which has been delegated to a subcommittee under paragraph (2) is to be considered at a meeting of the Joint Committee, members of that subcommittee shall be notified of such meeting and shall be allowed to attend and take part in the proceedings thereof without having a right to vote; and persons nominated under paragraph (3) may be invited to attend such meetings to assist the Joint Committee in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>(6) That provision be made for the appointment of substitutes to act for members of the Joint Committee (and members of subcommittees who are members of the Oireachtas) who are unable to attend particular meetings.</P>
    <P>(7) That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote; and shall appoint from among the members of each subcommittee a member of the Oireachtas to be the Chairman of that subcommittee.</P>
    <P>(8) That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(9) That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make shall, on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith, whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report, together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(10) That the quorum of the Joint Committee shall be four, of whom at least one shall be a member of Dáil Éireann and one a member of Seanad <Col N="843" /> Éireann, and that the quorum of each subcommittee shall be three.</P>
    <P>The Government have put unemployment at the top of their agenda and their economic and social policies have been geared accordingly.  The establishment of the joint committee now offers the Government and Opposition the opportunity to adopt a consensus approach to a problem which, to a greater or lesser degree, has dogged policy makers for decades.  The joint committee gives the Oireachtas the opportunity of contributing to the job creation process. In addition, the committee through its sub-committees will be able to avail of the experience, advice and energy of parties and individuals interested in the question of employment and unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our employment performance compares unfavourably with those of our EC partners.  Between 1980 and 1991 Ireland's unemployment rate rose from 7.3 per cent to 20 per cent.  Most of this took place in a surge between 1980 and 1984 and was attributed to the prevailing level of real interest rates, UK demand shocks, and increased participation in the labour force.  The economy was affected by adverse factors which were roughly evenly split between those affecting labour supply and labour demand.</P>
    <P>The rise in unemployment during the past year is attributable to the global recession and the related occurrence of a dramatic decline in the numbers emigrating. During the 1980s emigration started to increase after a decade during which the upward trend had been reversed.  In the three years April 1987 to April 1990 average net emigration was 35,000 persons per year.  The countries to which Irish people traditionally emigrate, Britain and the United States, were experiencing expansion of their labour markets, making them attractive destinations for Irish people seeking jobs. After peaking in 1989-90 emigration has declined sharply until in 1990-91 it amounted to only 1,000 in net terms.  The Irish demographic situation is such that <Col N="844" /> the labour force has the potential to grow by between 2 and 2.5 per cent a year.</P>
    <P>Last Friday's unemployment figures were the highest ever recorded by the live register.  At present, one in five of all persons who would like to work are for one reason or another unable to find a job.  If this continues unchecked the cost to the State in terms of hardship, social exclusion and wasted human potential, drained financial resources and weakened future growth prospects will be immeasurable.  These figures add an increased urgency &mdash; if any were needed &mdash; for us all to act together in the interests of increased employment.</P>
    <P>Rising unemployment is not unique to Ireland: it is, unfortunately, part of a global trend.  Since the beginning of 1991 unemployment has risen by over 2 million in the USA.  Australia, Canada, Finland and the UK have all witnessed similar percentage increases in unemployment to that recorded here.  From a situation where many governments believed two years ago that they had solved the unemployment problem, unemployment has resumed its place at the top of governments' agendas.  In addition, many of these countries are not experiencing the same growth in the labour force or the phenomenon of returning emigrants as Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has performed very well over the past four years and is continuing to do so, despite the protracted worldwide recession.</P>
    <P>In starting its task, the committee can look to the following achievements of recent years: GNP growth has averaged over 4 per cent a year (7.5 per cent in 1990); we have maintained one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe; we have a stable exchange rate; and rates of personal taxation have been significantly reduced, particularly for the lower paid, and the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of 1992 show a rise of nine per cent in revenue receipts compared with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>The OECD have forecast that growth in Irish GNP will be of the order of 2.5 per cent in 1992 and 3.3 per cent in 1993. <Col N="845" /> This compares favourably with growth predictions for other OECD countries.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these achievements to point out that the economic foundation for the work of this committee has already been laid.  It is vital that we hold our nerve and do not allow ourselves to be pushed into panic action for the sake of political expediency or just to be seen to be &ldquo;doing something&rdquo;.  This view is supported by the ESRI and OECD.  Last year the ESRI stated:</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discover measures which could ameliorate the unemployment problem in the short term without exacerbating it in the longer-term ... To increase the budget deficit further in an attempt to combat unemployment arising from international economic trends would be foolhardy and could jeopardise the economic strategy on which sustained employment growth depends.</P>
    <P>The OECD, in their 1991 commentary, concurred:</P>
    <P>Persistence with the considerable policy efforts already embarked upon provides the best chance for the continuation of the impressive economic performance achieved over the past three years.</P>
    <P>But we cannot be happy with merely saying that our employment performance is no worse than other countries; giving a list of the measures taken by Government; or referring to progress on many domestic economic &mdash; but non-employment &mdash; measures.  This is essentially the reason for setting up the joint committee. As I have said, the committee provides for the Oireachtas an opportunity to contribute in a structured way to the job creation debate.</P>
    <P>The joint committee has my wholehearted support.  Under the Constitution the Government and Ministers are responsible to the Oireachtas and it would not be the intention of Ministers to participate in the role of the joint committee.  The Dáil reforms proposed by Deputy Bruton adopted a similar position in relation to the appearance of Ministers. <Col N="846" /> The committee will start their work with a number of advantages.  They will have: a basis in the broad agreement reached between all parties following hard but constructive preparatory work: a sound economic basis &mdash; I have already referred to this &mdash; a number of recent reports on the employment situation; the work and output of a number of committees and task forces interested in employment; the capacity to adopt a broad-based approach to the employment problem transcending institutionals divisions of responsibility and work; and the good will of all our people.</P>
    <P>The release of the Culliton report together with the various submissions to that group has given us an analytical and prescriptive basis to approach the employment problem.  This report, together with the reports of the National Economic and Social Council, particularly <i>Strategy for the Nineties,</i> will provide background material for the committee's deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report contained recommendations under a number of headings: taxation; infrastructure; education; technology; industry-support; and the food industry.  Culliton was also critical of the lack of an enterprise culture in Ireland. The development of such a culture and the inculcation of the positive attitudes towards more business starts and expansion will be an important task for the committee.</P>
    <P>The Tansey Roche report for Culliton on industrial training in Ireland contains a number of recommendations which we will need to consider.  These include: the role of the education system in producing modern, high-level skills support competitiveness; training of those at work: and the role of FÁS.</P>
    <P>There exists a number of committees and institutions to deal with different aspects of the employment issue.  The central review committee with responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have devoted a considerable amount of their work to the question of how to increase employment and reduce unemployment.  The Task <Col N="847" /> Force on Employment are representative of employers' organisations, trade unions, individual employers and official agencies and were set up a year ago.</P>
    <P>The task force have made a series of recommendations to Government on specific actions that could be taken to increase employment levels or reduce unemployment levels.  These include: commercial State bodies producing components and products to supply the demand of the multinational companies in Ireland; third-level institutions creating additional places; that courses provided by the private third-level institutions be recognised as appropriate, for the higher education grants in order to improve access and the new job training scheme.</P>
    <P>There now exists a Government committee comprising the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance and the Environment and myself to follow up on the recommendations of the Culliton Group.  This committee of the Government are supported by a committee of Departmental secretaries and others.</P>
    <P>Much of the work of the National Economic and Social Council which is representative of agricultural interests, industry, employers, the construction industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the National Youth Council have concentrated on the employment problem.</P>
    <P>The joint committee will have to build on the advice and recommendations available from previous consultancy and research work and existing institutions. They will have to develop an &ldquo;employment strategy&rdquo; incorporating relevant elements from the reports of the Industrial Policy Review Committee, the Task Force on employment, the NESC and the work of various Departments.  This would recognise the inter-dependence of different policy initiatives in the employment generation process and would achieve greater cohesion, consistency and co-ordination among them in order to achieve maximum employment growth.  The effects on employment of <Col N="848" /> the tax system, industrial incentives, social welfare payments, education and training and other policies will have to be looked at.  We must avoid any conflict between policies.  All policies and programmes must support our job creation effort.</P>
    <P>The committee must ensure that Ireland's record on employment generation is as good as the past EC standards. While the employment level increased by 40,000 since 1987 and a further 6,000 net new jobs are forecast for this year this growth is not enough to accommodate the numbers of people out of work and those entering the labour market.</P>
    <P>We must attempt to identify those conditions specific to Ireland which adversely affect the Irish labour market.  We must reach a consensus on those features of the Irish economy which differ from other more successful economies and adversely affect our capacity to generate jobs.  In addition, the committee will have to take account of future radical changes in the labour market, including: increased global competition; the accelerating pace of the application and diffusion of new technologies; the further replacement of manufacturing by services; the increased liberalisation of trade, capital and labour coinciding with the completion of the Single European Market; increased attraction of the EC free movement of labour provisions for our young, well-educated labour force; increased demand by foreign employers for such labour; and the shift in economic equilibrium caused by the recent developments in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to expect a sudden flow of jobs sufficient to resolve the unemployment problem.  In that respect, I recently negotiated with the EC the terms of two schemes with a target take-up of 25,000 which should help relieve some of the pressures on the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme is now fully operational.  To date, there have been approximately 1,400 jobs approved and 210 employees have been <Col N="849" /> recruited.  In brief terms, an employer will receive a subsidy of £54 a week in respect of each additional worker taken on above a base level of last November if the worker has been two months minimum on the live register.  Payments will be made in arrears.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme launched in March, represents a major breakthrough in support for training by employers. FÁS studies indicate that well over half of Irish employees receive no training of any sort in a year.  Figures for training by Irish employers show that only 20 per cent of trainees receive formal off-the-job training each year.  In addition, there has been little increase in the amount of employee training in Ireland over the last number of years.  Under the scheme, trainees will receive the appropriate FÁS training allowance and the firms will recoup 75 per cent of that expenditure. The scheme represents a major improvement in our training arrangements, one on which we will build in the future.</P>
    <P>The transfer of EC Structural Funds has significantly contributed to the development of our economy.  The development of our human resources aided by these funds has been a central element in our national development programme since the mid-sixties.  Over the period, the quality of the Irish workforce has improved.</P>
    <P>Following Maastricht, the Government are looking for a doubling of the Structural Funds in the five-year period after 1993 as a contribution to cohesion in living standards throughout the European Community.  This doubling should include the allocation of additional financial resources for training.  An increase in the level and quality of training could have a significant impact on the unemployment rate in Ireland.  All the evidence suggests that the better trained get jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise the importance of the committee and wish the chairman and his committee well in their work.  The issues involved are difficult and complex.  If unemployment was easy to solve we would have solved it by now given the amount of time, effort <Col N="850" /> and energy devoted to the problem.  No doubt the issues will give rise to debates and discussions.  It is my hope that this debate will be constructive and that whatever recommendations we arrive at will add significantly to the prospects of Ireland's future generations.  I can assure committee members that their submissions and recommendations will be taken seriously by Government.</P>
    <P>I look forward to commenting on their reports when they are laid before the House.  Since we indulged in considerable preparatory work for the establishment of this committee I hope we can now proceed, affording Members of both Houses an opportunity of contributing positively to what is the biggest social problem of our time.</P>

      <P>First, I should move amendment No. 1 in my name and that the Leader of the Opposition, which proposes the deletion of the words which appear in brackets, in lines six and seven of the motion before the House, that is:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1), to delete &ldquo;(none of whom shall be a member of the Government or Minister of State)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is particularly regrettable that the Government are proceeding to set up an employment committee without endeavouring to reach all-party agreement on the matter.  In February of this year the Fine Gael Party drafted detailed terms of reference which were rejected in their entirety by the Government.  The terms of reference proposed by the Government today do not meet any of Fine Gael's requirements.  Throughout recent weeks negotiations have taken place between the Government and Opposition on amended terms of reference.  It is most disappointing that none of the Fine Gael proposals was considered favourably by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> In that respect let me remind the House of our six requirements for a meaningful, workable committee.  The first was the attendance at and full participation by Ministers, particularly those holding an economic brief; second, a forum with permanent representation on the part of the social partners and the unemployed, not merely representation at sub-committee level; third, an adequate and sufficient budget for such independent consultancy as may arise from time to time; fourth, the chairmanship of the forum to be independent of Government; fifth, that proceedings be broadcast and witnesses empowered to speak under privilege; sixth, reporting by the Government directly to the forum on the Government's own progress on jobs.  In the course of our deliberations Fine Gael were prepared to considerbly reduce our demands in the hope of reaching the often quoted consensus of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The reality of a third of a million of our people on the dole, rising by the day, must warrant a greater response than the establishment of a mere Oireachtas Joint Committee.  At all times, Fine Gael were anxious to reach agreement on the matter.  In an effort to achieve consensus five of our original six demands, to which I have referred, were dropped.  The requirement that Fine Gael believe is of fundamental and paramount importance is that dealing with ministerial involvement in the proceedings of the committee. For example, active participation in and regular attendance by Cabinet Ministers constitutes a means of focusing the attention of the committee firmly on the road to action rather than merely indulging in talk.</P>
    <P>A new approach to employment, as envisaged by the concept of the forum, should cast party political prejudice aside, thereby rising above party politics. Had the Taoiseach any real interest in achieving the full support and backing of the social partners and the unemployed alike he would have engaged in meaningful consultations in advance of the establishment of this committee rather <Col N="852" /> than reacting, as he did, by a rush of blood to the head on the eve of his party's Ard-Fheis.  The extent of the jobs crisis needs to be brought home to everybody, with everybody being involved in its solution. The forum-type approach envisaged by Fine Gael must have the support of all interest groups within the community and be sufficiently dynamic to generate immediate action.</P>
    <P>Anything worth doing is worth doing properly and suggestions by the Government in recent days that they would see how the committee operate for three or four months and then change the terms of reference as they go along is insulting to the hundreds of thousands of people on the dole queues.  Under the proposal before us, the committee will be totally under the control of the Government with an inbuilt majority and the perk of the chairmanship will be given to a party loyalist.  Surely this does not constitute a fresh approach to tackling the jobs crisis. In the context of the present Oireachtas committee system we must not ignore the fact that the entire agenda of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies was dictated during the Greencore controversy by the Fianna Fáil chairman.</P>
    <P>The fact that the committee being proposed in the motion before us will not have the power to invite Ministers to appear before them will render them impotent in many ways and mean they will lack any real authority.  While the subcommittee structure has the merit of at least providing an ear to the unemployed and the social partners it does not compensate for the necessity for Ministers to answer directly to the committee about what they are doing in regard to job creation.  Under our system of parliamentary democracy, Ministers are the people who have the power.  They are the people who can initiate the type of action necessary to create a climate for greater employment opportunities.  A committee without ministerial involvement would be seriously handicapped.</P>
    <P>The proposal before us for the setting up of an Oireachtas joint committee is much less than what Fine Gael believe is <Col N="853" /> necessary to make a meaningful contribution to this national crisis.  It is sad that Cabinet Ministers from both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will boycott this committee presumably on the basis that attendance is regarded as a gross intrusion in the duties and functions of Government, a shallow excuse to avoid responsibility.  Since the Taoiseach took office some weeks ago he has offered no direction on a course of action which might provide hope, particularly for young people.  The most radical proposal todate is the one outlined by the Minister for Labour this afternoon to open FÁS offices abroad and thereby encourage participation by Irish people in the greater European jobs market.</P>
    <P>The original proposal put forward by Fine Gael would, if accepted, harness the expertise of all the social partners, other interested parties and the unemployed by inviting them to sit around the same table at the same time.  This would at least allow for the opportunity of achieving a common purpose towards addressing the unemployment problem.  It is regrettable that this concept is being rejected.  A mere backbench committee will not allay the level of despair throughout society about the problem of unemployment. Neither will it halt the ever increasing numbers of people joining the dole queues.</P>
    <P>We in this House must not be blind to our failure over the past number of years to deal with this problem.  In a final effort to resolve the impasse in reaching all-party consensus on a jobs committee and in the hope that agreement can be reached, I again repeat the Fine Gael proposal that Ministers be allowed to attend the committee on three occasions during the course of their deliberations. It is surely in the interests of everybody that there is some level of ministerial involvement in this committee.  Such involvement would not only be useful to the committee but would also be of benefit to the Ministers themselves.  It would not in any way dilute the role and function of the Executive <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Legislature.  I urge the House to accept the proposal put forward by Fine Gael. <Col N="854" /> If the Government fail to do this we will have no alternative but to oppose the motion before us.  If the Government do not see fit to accept our amendment a great opportunity to reach consensus will have been lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, I regret the decision of the Government to go ahead with the establishment of a jobs committee without having reached consensus. Fine Gael have made brave efforts in regard to the establishment of this committee.  We proposed the setting up of a jobs forum because unemployment had reached crisis level and we considered the problem so serious that action was needed, action which would result in something being done about the problem instead of continuing to talk about it.  Fine Gael are deeply disappointed that the Government are still insisting that we talk about the problem through their proposal today to establish a jobs committee without the involvement or participation of the key people who can help resolve this major problem, that is, Ministers.  I wish to stress that for the past 12 months Fine Gael have been proposing the establishment of an all-party forum to tackle the major problem of unemployment.  If our proposal had been accepted 12 months ago perhaps some solutions would have been put in place by now.  The fact that our proposal is once again being rejected and dismissed here today means we cannot even hope to see any solution to this grave problem within the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the participation of Ministers in any forum or committee which deals with so urgent and serious a problem as unemployment is vital.  I cannot understand the determination of the Taoiseach to keep his Ministers at arms length from this all-party committee who will deal with the unemployment problem.  This raises a serious question in regard to the Government's commitment to solve the problem of unemployment and the depth of their willingness to tackle the problem.  If the Taoiseach does not see fit for his Cabinet Ministers to be involved in a jobs forum, despite what <Col N="855" /> the Minister for Labour said in the first line of his speech today, the Government do not regard unemployment as a priority.  It is appalling to think that people who have time to tour around the country unveiling plaques and cutting ribbons do not have time to participate in a forum charged with the greatest responsibility of our time &mdash; finding a solution to the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, under the leadership of Deputy John Bruton, were the first party to identify unemployment as the most serious issue facing this country.  No effort was spared by our party Leader in impressing on the Government that this crisis was facing us straight in the face and that it needed urgent attention.  Every single element of our proposal for a jobs forum, as outlined by Deputy Flanagan, was turned down by the Government.  In view of the seriousness of the problem, we conceded, co-operated and said at all stages that we were not inflexible.  We co-operated as far as possible.  In many cases, perhaps we even ignored our best judgment.  However, this party cannot concede on the issue of ministerial involvement in this committee because we honestly believe that without such participation this committee will not make any real progress and no long term solutions will be found.</P>
    <P>The issue of unemployment cannot be adequately addressed by an all-party jobs committee.  The issue is such that extraordinary measures are needed to investigate it, tackle it and put forward proposals which will have a long term effect in reducing unemployment.  Unfortunately the Government have decided to treat this extraordinary problem with a very ordinary solution.  The proposals put forward by them here today, will mean that sadly, the poverty, misery, and emptiness which have resulted from an unemployment level of approximately 280,000 will continue.  It is incredible that the Government, presiding over the worst unemployment figures in our history, are determined to oppose and undermine what we consider to be a realistic and fair proposal to deal with <Col N="856" /> unemployment.  We wanted all-party co-operation, a crusade made up of all parties, to tackle this urgent problem. Unfortunately, the Government have missed a golden opportunity to do this.</P>
    <P>The country is crying out for leadership in tackling the problem of unemployment. We tried desperately to offer that leadership.  We did this in a spirit of co-operation, flexibility and of accommodating the views of all the other parties. Unfortunately, that approach has been dismissed and turned down by the Government.  This is a sad day for the country.  It is sad that we have not been given the opportunity to have an input into the setting up of a realistic jobs forum which could find long term solutions to a very serious problem.  I believe that it will take time for the Government to realise their mistake.  While the Government may have time, sadly those on the unemployment register do not.  Fine Gael were fair and put forward a good proposal which unfortunately for reasons unknown to us and which we cannot understand has been rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is tragic that the Government are proceeding to set up this committee without the customary agreement of all parties.  When my party were in Government for five years, I did not act on any attempt to set up a new committee until there was agreement from the then, Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in my memory that a Government party proceeded to establish a committee without having first got the agreement of the main Opposition party in relation to the terms of reference.  It is doubly tragic in regard to the very serious issue of unemployment. The House does not need to be reminded that every year 25,000 more people leave school than the number of people reaching retirement age.  Taken over a ten-year period we could have an extra 250,000 people unemployed by the end of this century unless there is a major change in the way our society operates in so far as employment is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our social structure is profoundly anti-employment; for example, 50 per cent of <Col N="857" /> our savings are gone into pension funds, not to risk investments where jobs would be created.  They are being diverted to areas which create very little employment. Our tax structure does not encourage equity investment in enterprises which will create jobs; our tax structure does not encourage people to provide employment.  I quoted this statistic many times but it bears repeating: the cost to an employer who wants to take on somebody extra is 57p in the £ in tax over and above what he will pay the employee simply for the privilege of taking him on. Nothing one would buy in a shop is taxed as highly, with the sole exception of cigarettes. Our tax system is profoundly anti-employment.</P>
    <P>I do not believe agreement can be reached on changes in the tax system, all of which, obviously, would be extremely unpopular because the money would have to be raised in some other way.  It is not possible for this side of the House to reach agreement with the Government side about the difficult decisions which might have to be made to change the tax system to make it more pro-employment because, as I said, the money would have to be raised from somewhere else, if we are merely dealing with Government back benchers who do not have any authority. It was to reach a consensus in the House on difficult issues that we wanted a committee of this kind.  However, you cannot reach agreement if the people on the other side are not those who have responsibility.  The Government are essentially saying that they will not appoint anybody with responsibility to this committee, they will appoint people who do not have any responsibility within the structure of the Government parties for anything, people who need some form of consolation will be put on this committee. We cannot be expected to reach agreement with people who do not have any power.  For that reason, we wanted &mdash; in our view it is essential &mdash; to have Ministers on this committee.  The Government said that there was not a precedent for appointing Ministers but we have never faced an employment crisis of this magnitude before.  We <Col N="858" /> needed unprecedented action if we were to show urgency in this House in regard to unemployment.  What we intended to do needed to be unprecedented. However, the Government are wrong in relation to precedents because there are precedents for Ministers being involved in committees previously.  The informal committee on the Constitution and the informal committee on inter-Irish relations are two examples.  The latter committee, during the 1973-77 period had three Ministers from the then Coalition Government on it.  Anyway, precedents should not matter, this problem is so severe that Ministers should have been prepared to take part.</P>
    <P>The absence of Ministers on the committee will mean that they will waste a lot of time.  For example, the committee will start doing a report on a particular subject and officials present will probably not be sure of the Minister's view on a certain topic.  The committee will then prepare recommendations on something and when the report is finalised and brought into this House it will be discovered that the Minister is not even interested in the ideas.  If, as Fine Gael proposed, the Minister was brought in at the beginning when the committee were commencing a report on training, there could be a discussion between them and the Minister.  He could be asked his opinions and the committee could then produce a draft report to which the Minister could give his reaction.  The committee could then finalise the report in the light of the Minister's reactions.  This procedure would save a great deal of time and much better recommendations would emerge because they would have been based on a knowledge of what the Minister was prepared to accept and on an understanding of the practical problems which the Minister might see.  The Government do not seem to believe that the Members of this House are intelligent enough, constructive enough or concerned enough about the unemployment problem to warrant Ministers coming before them and talking constructively in a proper atmosphere about how best to proceed.  The Ministers want to stay a <Col N="859" /> hundred miles away from the committee until a report is eventually presented in this House and perhaps they will then comment on it.  However, by then six months will probably have been wasted.</P>
    <P>The reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are never discussed in this House.  They gather dust as they are not even read.  There are other examples of similar reports, in which Ministers were not involved in drawing up, gathering dust.  Nobody pays any attention to the reports of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies, they are just presented and that is the end of them.  If, on the other hand, the Ministers involved participated in preparing those reports &mdash; as we propose in this case &mdash; there would be a much more meaningful dialogue between Parliament and the Executive and a much greater meeting of minds between the Government and the Opposition.  There would be a continuity of policy even if a Government changed because there would be a mutual understanding between Government Ministers on one side and the Opposition Front Bench on the other.  I hope nobody seriously expects that an Opposition party would put their Front Bench members on to a committee if the Government Front Bench did not think it was worthwhile taking part.  It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>We made a proposal today to break the deadlock, we said that it would not be a case of Ministers having to appear before the committee every week.  We said they would just have to come in at the beginning of the preparation of the report, at the draft stage and then at the final stage.  As a last ditch effort we made this modest proposal to try to reach agreement but it was rejected out of hand.  It was said that there would not be any ministerial presence on the committee. That is the attitude of the Government.  We have reached a very sorry stage in this Dáil, for the first time in the histroy of the House a Government are proceeding in this fashion, simply <Col N="860" /> ignoring the main Opposition party's views on a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that Fine Gael will not take part in this committee because it is not a serious one.  The Government, by deciding that Ministers will not take part in any way in the deliberations of the committee, are showing clearly that they do not themselves regard this committee as serious.  Fine Gael, however, will campaign on the jobs issue quite independently of this committee.  We have already had all the consultants who prepared reports for the Culliton committee before our Front Bench to present their reports over a two-day session.  We are arranging for our Front Bench to visit every unemployment centre in the country over the next two months to talk directly to those who are unemployed and to those helping them, so that we can bring forward our own ideas.  We have our own proposals.  The Government may proceed with this time wasting committee if they wish but I assure them that they will not deter the Fine Gael Party from carrying out their responsibilities in this matter.  We will ensure that the unemployed have a proper voice in this House and will soon have a proper voice in Government when the parties opposite &mdash; who do not consider ministerial participation in a committee on unemployment to be important enough for them &mdash; have been put where they belong, on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will support this motion because we see it as a potentially useful way of building and maintaining a consensus around agreed strategies to address the crisis of unemployment. The Labour Party have worked hard to bring this committee about and to make it as representative as possible.  It would be objectively acknowledged that our input to the development of the terms of reference and the structures of the committee has been considerable. We did that for only one reason, we do not believe that the crisis of unemployment can be effectively addressed unless there is a wide degree of consensus across the community about <Col N="861" /> strategy which, in this context, may well include sacrifice or, at the very least, a recognition that those of us who are employed have a responsibility to those without work or without hope of work.</P>
      <P>We do not see this committee as a forum for recrimination or point-scoring. We do not see it as a place where people will be called to account.  There are many other ways the Government can be tackled and criticised for their lack of performance on the issue of unemployment. I assure the House that because the Labour Party are prepared to work constructively on the proposed committee, does not mean we are prepared to allow the Government off the hook on the question of their failures. The key word is consensus.</P>
      <P>There is a spirit throughout the community that we can address and resolve our problems.  That spirit has never been tapped into; the dynamism, the ideas and the energy have never been effectively mobilised around the issue of unemployment. There is an opportunity now for politicians, working side by side with the social partners and with groups who are intimately involved with the crisis of unemployment, to begin to mobilise that spirit.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret that the Fine Gael Party have decided to hold themselves aloof from what is being attempted here and, frankly, I fail to understand that decision. When we are close to having 300,000 people unemployed, it seems to the Labour Party that every possible avenue and opportunity must be availed of to try to address this problem in some way. Every forum and opportunity must be availed of by any responsible party here. It will look awfully strange that when there is a proposal to set up a jobs committee to give people the opportunity to come together and talk about the problem, either with or without Ministers, the Fine Gael Party say&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;no, we will visit the unemployment centres, we will not participate <Col N="862" /> but remain outside it all as there is nothing we can usefully say there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not object to Ministers being present; indeed, I would welcome their presence and, perhaps, would wish they be present.  However, that is different to saying that because the Ministers will not be attending for whatever reason, we should wash our hands of the whole affair.  We have things to say to that committee. We have ideas on how employment could be created and how the issue of employment has gone drastically wrong here down the years.</P>
      <P>Our views differ radically from those of both Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and, indeed, Fine Gael.  We regard it as essential that our views be presented to the committee, reported on to this House by that committee and responded to in this House by the Minister responsible.  The Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Bruton, said that proposals may be put forward which the Minister has no interest in.  I do not care whether he is interested or not but it is our responsibility in the Labour Party to put forward our policies and ideas on employment creation, to state our views on the need for an interventionist policy by the State, and its agencies, on the creation of employment.  The Minister may not be interested, indeed no Fianna Fáil Minister, Fine Gael Minister and, certainly, no Minister from the Progressive Democrats showed an interest in that.  That is not the point; we are obliged to put forward our theories and suggestions and have them discussed by the committee members.  We will argue our corner as to why that aspect of employment creation is so important.  Its neglect was one, if not the major reason for the appalling fix we are in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say he is not interested, but we will insist that that point is made in a report to the House and we will argue the point again and again in this House.  Perhaps we will be able to persuade some Members and achieve something; we intend to try.  If we do not succeed in having our policies implemented, at least we, unlike the Fine Gael Party, will be able to say that it was <Col N="863" /> not for the want of trying.  We intend to give it our all.  If our suggestions are not taken up by the Government they carry the responsibility, just as they carry the responsibility for the present appalling situation.</P>
    <P>In opening this debate the Minister said that &ldquo;Australia, Canada, Finland and the UK all witnessed similar percentage increases in unemployment to that recorded here&rdquo;.  That is of no interest.  Their percentage rate of unemployment is a paltry fraction of our rate of unemployment.</P>
    <P>They bear no resemblance to our figure.  What comfort is it that unemployment has risen in those countries from 5 per cent to 7 per cent or from 2 per cent to 4 per cent when the rate of unemployment here is 21 per cent.  It is not good enough that the Minister said in his speech that the committee can look to the following achievements of recent years: GNP growth has averaged over 4 per cent a year; we have a stable Exchange rate; rates of personal taxation have been significantly reduced and that the Exchequer returns for the first quarter of 1992 show a rise of 9 per cent in revenue recipts compared with the same period last year.</P>
    <P>What good is that to the 300,000 who are unemployed?  Why does the Minister give all these examples when they are not producing a result?  Why set forth this list as though it meant something in reality? What good is a stable exchange rate to a person who is unemployed and has no prospect of employment for himself and his family?  Does he care about GNP growth rate or even revenue returns?  To that person they mean nothing.  They will only mean something if they produce the jobs the unemployed and their families are waiting for.  If they produce jobs we are in business and are doing something worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted the following from the ESRI report:</P>
    <P>To increase the budget deficit further in an attempt to combat unemployment arising from international <Col N="864" /> economic trends would be fool-hardy....</P>
    <P>Are we putting the blame for our position on international economic trends?  That is not the case; they may account for some element but international economic trends affect Britain, the US, France and Italy and not just Ireland.  Why are we so honoured that our unemployment rate is 21 per cent which is more than double the average in the EC?  Why are we so special that we have the honour of having more than 21 per cent of the workforce unemployed?  International trends affect all countries, not just Ireland.  There must be something radically wrong.  Something different is causing our problems and I suggest it is the utter over-reliance on private enterprise and our neglect to pay attention to State agencies, semi-State agencies, Government companies and intervention in the economy to create employment.</P>
    <P>That is the Labour Party position and we will be advocating it as strongly as we can in the committee whether Ministers attend or not.  When the report is debated in the House we will tell the Minister precisely the same thing.  To tackle this problem it is essential that we first recognise there is a crisis.  The most recent figure is 279,200 unemployed and to that must be added a further 11,000 people excluded from the live register because they are on special pre-retirement schemes.  That means that the real number of unemployed, ignoring emigration completely, is over 290,000.  In other words the recent prediction of the Minister for Finance that unemployment was heading towards 300,000 is coming true even more rapidly than might have been expected.  What does it all mean?</P>

      <P>I was referring to the position that arises from this appalling <Col N="866" /> increase in unemployment, which means that the budget, announced in this House less than six weeks ago, is already seriously off target.  By the end of the year I predict that an extra £40 million to £50 million will have to be found for unemployment-related payments.  I want to warn here and now that the Labour Party will resist any effort to find that money on the backs of the under-privileged. That has been the way of this Government in the past and it has never been acceptable.</P>
      <P>There is a human dimension to unemployment which has never been fully grasped by the political system; there is a cause and effect relationship between unemployment and poverty, between unemployment and crime, between unemployment and health costs, between unemployment and family breakdown. There is a cause and effect relationship between poor education and unemployment. In other words, unemployment ought to represent a core issue for the political system because it is at the core of so many other problems of inequality and disadvantage.  No matter what way you put it, unemployment represents failure; it represents a failure of the political system since our independence. It is long past the time that the political system as a whole should recognise that failure and resolve that there will be no more failure on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As will be known, the committee being established today will operate through three subcommittees.  The first subcommittee, about which I want to say a brief word, is on job creation.  It will be our aim and hope that that subcommittee will be active in promoting a national consensus.  The way to create jobs in Ireland is through creating markets for Irish products of the highest excellence delivered on time to the customer.  That will mean changing attitudes.  It is not a coincidence that economic studies in the past have found that Ireland is at the top of the league when it comes to giving out grants, hand-outs and incentives but it is near the bottom when it comes to quality, reliability, marketing skills, research and <Col N="867" /> development.  We have seen reports, articles and analyses on the giving of grants to create jobs, all of which suggest a dramatic, drastic and appalling failure over the years.  I hope this committee and its constituent subcommittees will examine that history with a great degree of intensity, analyse where we went so badly wrong over past decades with those policies, and devise some new ways of using the available money to introduce intervention directly by the Government into the job creation market.  There is plenty of money available but it is being thrown away.  Millions of pounds is being wasted on foreign firms year in year out that created 200 jobs for two years, closed down and left 50 jobs.  The number of jobs left in these firms is a pittance and is pathetic compared to the amount of money invested.</P>
    <P>The private enterprise class in this country, unfortunately, have never lived up to expectations and have never created the quality of employment we need.  We do have world beaters in that class when it comes to speculation and manipulation but, unfortunately, we lag behind the rest when it comes to the kind of management and entrepreneurial skills that are fundamentally important in turning wealth into work and jobs.</P>
    <P>I hope the committee will also concentrate its efforts on building a consensus around the notion that the most successful economies in Europe are those in which working people have a high degree of influence and a high degree of participation in the success of their enterprises.  There will be those who will argue that the way towards job creation is through lower rates of pay and more flexible approaches to employment.  We do not want &mdash; and do not believe it is in Ireland's interest &mdash; to press for an economy built on low pay, part-time and casual work and low motivation.  The economies we are competing with in Europe &mdash; and will be competing with in the future &mdash; are mostly economies which value participation and that should be the goal of our endeavours too.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe that <Col N="868" /> the time has come to seriously address a whole range of choices available for people who are without work.  For example, it is surely a ludicrous anomaly with 300,000 people out of work that a person on unemployment assistance cannot afford to take the risk of doing a second or third level full-time course in education in case they lose their only means of subsistence.</P>
    <P>In overall terms we believe the subcommittee on unemployment must set out priorities; it must single out those groups who are most in need of policy change &mdash; long term unemployed and young people &mdash; and it must highlight the need for specific policies which would prioritise them.  This, too, will call for a change in attitudes as well as Government policies.  Solidarity with people who are long term unemployed requires us to look long and hard at issues such as excessive overtime, excessive use of voluntary redundancy, working hours and so on.  We will be submitting ideas in those areas to the subcommittee as part of our overall approach.  We do not intend to abandon the needs of those who are without work.  For that reason I pledge, on behalf of the Labour Party, the utmost co-operation in these committees in the work they will do.  We want to see these committees succeed.  Even more than that, the 300,000 people out there in our community and their representatives need to see this committee succeed.</P>

      <P>The proposal before the House today is, I must concede to Fine Gael, dramatically different from the concept of a jobs forum which my colleagues and myself initiated during the 1977 general election and which has subsequently come to be supported by the other Opposition parties.  However, having regard to the sheer scale of the <Col N="869" /> crisis that confronts us, I think it is very difficult for us to seek to justify &mdash; as politicians elected to this House &mdash; abandoning the mechanism now being put in place to seek to address our greatest social and economic problem.  When the idea was mooted, short of the proposal which is before us today, there was general agreement on the need for a national body, established with adeqate resources, that would be, and would be seen to be, capable of tackling the jobs crisis.</P>
      <P>While it will be important to maintain the supremacy of the Oireachtas, the main interest groups involved should be included in the jobs forum as originally mooted.  The reason for this is that vested interests have to be overcome and the best way to do this is to have each of them included in the major decision-making body.  Anyone who has studied the Culliton report in detail or carried out an examination of the problems that he has avoided &mdash; the more thorny issues &mdash; will recognise that these vested interests need to be overcome if we are to make any progress.  Therefore, it was the intention that the jobs forum would include a number of Deputies from each party, a representative from each of the main interest groups represented on the NESC and, specifically, from the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed.</P>
      <P>It was modelled on the concept of the New Ireland Forum and was to have an independent chairman of outstanding calibre, with a manifest commitment and zeal to making the forum work.  That is a particularly critical dimension of the proposal before us.  I do not know who the Government propose should take the chair but to a large extent the success or otherwise of this committee will be determined by the time devoted and back-up provided to the chairman in guiding the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in particular have drawn attention to its defects, including the question of the attendance of Ministers. Before today I have said in the House that the attendance of Ministers would provide a boost for the committee. Notwithstanding these defects I do not <Col N="870" /> think we in this House have any choice but to seek to make the committee work. That is the decision taken by my party. We have taken this decision because it is our conviction that it is only by a massive diversion of the nation's resources, financial, human, organisational and institutional, away from their current uses towards a concentrated and single-minded effort to create Irish-based industrial structures that we will be capable of establishing secure and stable foreign markets for our goods and passing the benefits to be gained on to the population at large in the form of jobs and a comfortable standard of living for all.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the committee hold out the hope that agreement will be found on a strong political mandate for radical action to tackle the unemployment crisis. It is clear from the Culliton report that unless we radically change direction &mdash; it should be said going on past performance that no Government have changed direction &mdash; and this new departure in relation to industrial and economic policy is underpinned by a mandate from parties in this House, this is not likely to happen. The nub of the hope that the committee hold out for the unemployed is that there is a possibility &mdash; I would put it no stronger than that &mdash; that we in this House, will agree on a plan of action designed to make a serious impact on the scale of the unemployment problem.  It seems that there is now such a prospect and if the Government get such a political mandate from the House there will be no excuse for not implementing whatever strategies are agreed to by the committee.</P>
    <P>The Committee could be used to mobilise public support for a set of strategies designed to tackle the unemployment crisis.  We have allowed the problem to get worse during the past decade because officially they were incapable of taking the recommendations of the Telesis report on board.  The Minister will say that ten years later many of the recommendations of the Telesis report have been implemented and that is true &mdash; many of them have been implemented belatedly &mdash; but the fact that it has taken us the best part of a decade to <Col N="871" /> implement some of the recommendations of the Telesis report forms part of the explanation why our unemployment problem is getting worse.</P>
    <P>This raises the critical issue of implementation.  Even though we have had the benefit of a number of outstanding reports in recent years our ability in relation to the implementation of the recommendations, especially those which had earned a broad measure of consensus, has been poor.  I am not entirely satisfied, and I would like the Minister to address this point, that there is a mechanism to ensure, if conclusions can be reached reasonably speedily by the all-party committee, that they will be acted upon and implemented without undue delay by the Government because this has impeded us in the past.</P>
    <P>I should say also when one talks about the need for consensus and argues that there is a prospect of agreement between the parties in this House and that this does not mean that our analysis of the unemployment problem is shared across the board.  For example, I have the most serious difficulty with the analysis that suggests that the scale of our unemployment problem is due to demographic forces; that market conditions, which are characterised by high outflows and low inflows, have led to a situation where until the end of this century we must live with the fact that there is a population bulge and that because of this, no matter what any Government do, the unemployment problem is going to get worse or at best stand still.  While I do not accept that analysis I accept that it is shared by many of the parties in this House and by many of the pundits and commentators outside it, but it is too convenient and it ignores the critical question of competitiveness in the economy.  We are fooling ourselves if we conclude that our unemployment problem is due solely to the peculiar demographic structure in society during this decade.</P>
    <P>We have a fundamental underlying competitiveness problem in the economy and that is one of the questions that I would like to see the committee examine. <Col N="872" /> This is something that we have tended to overlook and we have convinced ourselves in preparation for Single Market conditions that industry has shaken itself, slimmed down and is preparing to exploit the opportunities that will be made available. I do not think that that is the case nor do I accept that we have a high growth economy.  What we have is a high growth enclave in the form of the modern IDA attracted sector.  There is no doubt about that and it seems to be performing exceptionally well but the performance of the indigenous sector is still way below par.  This has to be taken on board by any committee who seek to address seriously the scale of the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In tackling this question of competiveness we will have to go for a radical shake up of our education and training policies.  The existing education system pays too little attention to this aspect of investment in training and to the necessity to develop a bank of skills for the future.  We are reluctant to accept that we are now part of a modern economy although at least we are trying to turn into one.  We need to look at the focus of FÁS.</P>
    <P>FÁS must be examined because currently it distracts from the need to invest in an upgrading of skills of those actually in employment. Too much of the focus is on make believe schemes for the unemployed and too little on the upgrading of skills of those in the workforce thus leading to a problem in retaining jobs.  While we are talking about tackling the unemployment crisis we are still losing jobs and that is because of the skills deficit in this economy.</P>
    <P>Whereas I am arguing and committing my party to making this all-party committee work, I sincerely hope that is also the disposition of the Government, that we are not merely setting up a committee that will take us from here to the date of the next general election to be used to score party political points.  The problem is far too serious for that.  If the Government commit the resources and are determined to seek a mandate for <Col N="873" /> such a national plan as I have described, that will be forthcoming from the other parties who have indicated their willingness to participate.</P>
    <P>I would want to put on the agenda of an all-party committee a number of analyses which will differ from the conventional analyses in this House.  I have referred to the question of investment in training and the fundamentally important question of competitiveness.  I have, on a number of other occasions, dealt at length with the need to restructure and refocus industrial policy and the enormous <Col N="874" /> sums of money which we have devoted over the last 25 years to industrial development and to the creation of tax shelters which in the last year, for example, cost us more than £1,400 million.</P>
    <P>I have here a table from a paper presented recently to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland by a trade union colleague of mine, economist, Paul Sweeney, dealing with the scale of tax expenditures over the last decade.

    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> This table shows, for example, the expenditure of £1.4 billion in various shelters and reliefs over 1989-90 alone, totalling £7.3 billion over the decade.  Last Sunday the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> took up this particular paper and dealt with some of the facts in it.  I know the Minister will be advised by his departmental colleagues that the net contribution would obviously have been a great deal less than that because some companies were attracted here who would not otherwise be here, and I accept the validity of that argument. Nonetheless we are expending an enormous amount of money and we are not getting value for that money in terms of jobs created.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me refer with regret to the apparent imminent closure or disbandment of the Irish Productivity Centre.  Speaking for my own party, if we were to seek advice in terms of additional back up for the work of this all-party committee, one such institution that I would go to is the Irish Productivity Centre.  That organisation has a long and creditable record over the last 30 years in providing various services to small business development, to various organisations, and fostering better relationships at work.  In all its activity it enjoys a unique mandate from the social partners, the FIE and the ICTU.  In addition, it embraced in recent years the challenge of Europe, winning numerous assignments against tough competition and, indeed, has been retained by the European Commission itself in an advisory capacity.  It is ironic that the success of the Irish Productivity Centre has led indirectly to a need now for some restructuring.</P>
    <P>With the changing skills, knowledge and attitudes now needed to serve its substantial client base, the centre has to face up to change and renewal, and my understanding is that both the workforce and the management are prepared to do precisely that.  The IPC grant aid was reduced last year from £721,000 in 1991 to £500,000 in 1992, a reduction of over 30 per cent, and that deficit is in no small way contributed to by the fact that there are outstanding wages due to the workers there which they are not seeking to claim. <Col N="878" /> Yet it seems it is being used as an excuse to wind up the centre.  It is regrettable that it should be allowed to close since partnership is the cornerstone of what we are seeking to do here and the <i>raison d'etre</i> of the Irish Productivity Centre.  I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to intervene at this late stage to ensure that the liqidator is not sent in and that the Irish Productivity Centre is not wound up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputy Rabbitte for facilitating me.  I will not delay the House too long.</P>
      <P>I would like first to point to the terms of reference of this committee which clearly are to examine and make recommendations on all aspects of economic and social policy which have a bearing on employment creation and which contribute to alleviating unemployment.  If I thought for a minute that this committee would, in fact, do this I would be in favour of it.  Unfortunately, I have to oppose the setting up of yet another committee to deal with this problem when it must be obvious to everyone what the real solutions are.</P>
      <P>If this committee is set up it will go over old ground again and come up with the tired solutions that have clearly failed in the past and are likely to do so in the future.  There will be a lot of talk about further integration in the EC, about Maastricht and all that kind of thing.  It is absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is &mdash; and it has to be faced &mdash; that the Luddites were right.  The dispossessed factory employees of the 19th century who smashed machines were absolutely right; that has to be said.  Technology has killed jobs; advanced technology has killed jobs.  A study in Germany recently established beyond doubt that the more money one invests in industry the more unemployment there is; the more money the IDA invest in jobs the fewer jobs we have.  Does no one connect them?  Will anyone refer to the headlines in the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> last Sunday week which stated that the jobs creation scandal has cost the taxpayer <Col N="879" /> £4.58 billion?  It has cost us £0.5 million to create 7,000 jobs in the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The solution is so blindingly obvious that people refuse to face it.  The solution is two tier and is the policy of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas. First, jobs must be shared around: we must reduce working hours, job share, introduce early retirement and career breaks.  These are areas we must approach.  It is a radical solution which will create an immense upheaval but that is the way it will have to be.</P>
    <P>Another thing we would like to see which would facilitate the first objective is a basic income for all that would enable people to work as well as draw the dole, it would also enable people to grow vegetables in their gardens instead of having to buy them in the supermarket.  Did you ever see such rubbish over the weekend when the social welfare inspectors in the west were going around to see if people were growing vegetables in their front gardens?  Have we really come to this?  Is this to be the way forward?  What we are saying to the unemployed is that we will pay them provided they do nothing.  That is the message the people are getting. They may not even grow vegetables in their gardens.  It is so ludicrous it is beyond understanding.</P>

      <P>I hope the Green Party proposals for a 20 hour week is to apply to Deputies and Ministers of State as well.  I would go along with that. I apologise to Deputies who have spoken for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who has to attend the Government meeting.  The Minister asked me to convey his apologies to those Deputies who have contributed.</P>
      <P>I thank speakers for their contributions. I acknowledge the efforts made by the Whips with whom I dealt in the course of the negotiations on this committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the proposals before the House for an Oireachtas joint committee on employment have received so much support in the House and outside it. <Col N="880" /> Deputy Ahearn in the course of her speech regretted that the Government were going ahead without consensus.  The Government also regret that we could not get consensus but in that regard we have been trying for almost the past four weeks.  We have been very reasonable and have leaned over backwards to try to get Fine Gael to agree to the proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals before us deserve that support because unemployment is so grave an issue that any proposals which give a prospect of finding new ways and measures to increase employment should be supported.  We are facing the highest unemployment level we have ever known and that fact should encourage us all to co-operate constructively to try to reduce that appalling situation.</P>
      <P>The proposals deserve support also because the Government have made a generous and sincere effort to accommodate their original proposals to the views of other parties.  The amendments made include fuller participation by the social partners in the work of the committee, a system of subcommittees with specific terms of reference and financial assistance to the participating parties to enable them to undertake necessary research.</P>
      <P>That covers the point made by Deputy Rabbitte in relation to his party wanting to submit different analyses of the problem. The financial assistance to his party and to the other parties will help to put forward those ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these amendments to the original proposals have resulted in a structure, unique in terms of such committees and show clearly the desire of the Government to enable the committee to function <Col N="881" /> effectively and efficiently in accordance with views expressed by Opposition parties; and those outside the Houses.</P>
    <P>There is one amendment to the original proposals which, however, the Government could not accept.  Fine Gael proposed that Ministers should attend the committee.  It is quite clear that what is involved in that proposal is to make Ministers responsible and answerable to the committee for unemployment. Instead of the committee developing their own ideas and proposals for employment, the Fine Gael proposal is to have Ministers up before the committee to account to them for what they are doing or not doing.  The answer of the Government to that native proposal is that Ministers are fully responsible to the Dáil for what they do or do not do. There is, therefore, no question of Ministers shirking their responsibilities.  All reports and recommendations of the committee will be fully considered by the Government and the relevant Ministers will respond to the House as regards the feasibility and implementation of any such reports and recommendations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in the course of his remarks seemed not to be aware of this, when he said that the report would be gathering dust.  That is not what is proposed here.  It is proposed that the reports will be published, will come before the House and will be responded to by the Government.  The Government will have to give specific commitments here in the House on measures they wish to take to implement the recommendations.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Constitution Ministers are answerable to the House not to a committee.  We have said this time and again but I emphasise that they will respond fully to the House in response to any proposals the committee make.  This is not only the constitutional position.  It is also the practice and the precedent in these matters.  Reference has been made to attendance by Ministers at committees dealing with specific Bills.  That is clearly not relevant since it is a proper function of a Minister who is sponsoring a Bill to discuss that Bill with a committee formed expressly for that <Col N="882" /> purpose in order to facilitate the work of the House.  Reference has been made to committees established in 1967 and 1973 with Ministerial membership, to consider the Constitution and Northern Ireland respectively.  Deputy Bruton referred to these, but they were informal committees set up by the political parties and were not committees of the House set up by motion of the House.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition has cited his attendance as Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses in 1984-1985.  The record shows clearly that he was strongly advised that he should not attend but should deal with the matter when it came before the House. He agreed with that advice.  He did, however, on one later occasion meet the chairman and members of the committee in early 1985, in response to an invitation to an informal meeting, to discuss the status of the committee's reports.  This is no precedent for the suggestion that Ministers should attend regularly meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment to account for their work in combating unemployment.</P>
    <P>Failure by Fine Gael to support this motion will be seen by all impartial observers as Fine Gael running away from the concept of a jobs forum which would involve political parties.  The Government regret that Fine Gael could not agree to the proposals now before the House.  I would urge them to accept that the proposed committee cannot but make a worthwhile contribution to solving the grim unemployment we face.</P>
    <P>I would ask them to give the committee a try, and to participate fully in it.  I am not inflexible in this matter and neither are the Government.  Fine Gael would do well to send the right message to the unemployed by becoming involved in this committee.  By saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the committee Fine Gael are saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>If they do not support this motion, one must question their sincerity in putting forward their original proposals last year. One may be forgiven for thinking that it was put forward as a cynical party political <Col N="883" /> ploy to be seen to be offering to assist the unemployment problem in the expectation that their offer would not be accepted by the Government.  Now that it has been accepted in generous measure by the Government and the other parties, they should not be seen to distance themselves from it so as to avoid having to disclose whether or not they have any worthwhile proposals to make about creating employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many efforts are being made to solve this problem.  The Government have taken the following specific actions directed at creating employment:&mdash; They have set up the Task Force on Employment combining the views of the social partners, Government Departments and the commercial State companies. The Culliton report is being implemented by a committee of Ministers, chaired by the Taoiseach and a task force mainly composed of departmental secretaries, to make proposals to the ministerial committee.  There are new EC-assisted employment and training schemes for 25,000 persons on the live register.  There is a task force on tourism. Twelve area-based companies have been set up throughout the country under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  There is an EC funded study being organised by the NESC into the connection between economic growth and employment.  The macro-economic policy pursued by the Government has created the conditions of low inflation and cost competitiveness which are the only basis on which our economy and employment can grow.  Dramatic tax reform is already far advanced to encourage enterprise which is the motive power which will create greater employment. All these measures have been taken by the Government in trying to tackle unemployment. What are lacking are the insights and ideas of Members of the House, whether in Government or <Col N="884" /> Opposition parties, who could contribute to solving the enormous unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The Government think that it is most important to give this opportunity to Members of the House to contribute their ideas and proposals on how to increase employment.  I can promise that the Government will carefully consider all proposals that the committee make and will fully implement every proposal which is feasible and practicable.  The relevant Ministers will come before the House, and will respond to each and every proposal the committee make. That is ministerial involvement.  I had hoped that the prolonged negotiations which have taken place in regard to this Committee would now bear fruit in all parties agreeing today to establish and participate in the committee.  The decision taken by Fine Gael will be a great disappointment and discouragement to the unemployed who look to this House in hope and expectation that we can combine, across party divides, to identify measures which can alleviate the deprivation the unemployed suffer in our society.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael talk about being serious regarding these proposals.  The initial proposals I put to Fine Gael were rejected through the media within hours. The revised proposals I put forward were again rejected through the media within an hour.  At the third attempt I requested the parties to outline the difficulties and suggest proposals to overcome those difficulties. I got six demands from Fine Gael within 20 minutes of putting that forward.  The latest proposal by Fine Gael concerning ministerial involvement arrived yesterday morning.  There is no question that the Government are serious about this.  The question mark is certainly over Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 19 and 20, to delete &ldquo;Part I (other than section 18 (1)), Part II (other than section 43), Part IV (other than section 93) and Part VI will come into&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Parts I, II, III, IV, V and VI will commence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are in excess of 300 amendments to be dealt with on Report Stage in the space of about two hours and therefore, I do not propose to take up a great deal of time on this amendment.  We had a long debate on Committee Stage on the parts of the Bill that should be brought into effect immediately and the Minister agreed to come back on Report Stage with an amendment on this matter.  I am very glad that the Minister proposes to commence Part III of the Bill, which deals with the functions of the agency, with the other parts of the Bill.  That is certainly acceptable to me and therefore I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 20, before &ldquo;Part IV&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;Part III,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage that it was my intention to ensure that the agency had as many functions as possible delegated to them and that as much of the legislation as possible would come into effect very quickly.  I undertook to reconsider which parts of the Bill could be brought into effect on the establishment of the agency.</P>
      <P>I accept the point that was made by Deputy Gilmore and other Deputies on Committee Stage.  Deputy Gilmore said that the functions of the agency should be with the agency from day one.  I am happy to propose this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to implement some of the Bill's provisions from day one.  For example, section 18 (1), which repeals part of the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, cannot be brought into effect until noise regulations have been implemented. Otherwise, there would be no law in relation to noise, and, whatever about the unsatisfactory position that might exist, I am sure all Deputies would agree it would not be appropriate to leave a vacuum.  Likewise, section 43, which relates to the establishment of regional environmental units, cannot be brought into effect on day one.  That will take time as the agency will have to determine precisely where they require those units before the units can be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I could, I have brought all parts of the legislation, with the exception of Part V, under the commencement provision.  It is envisaged that the functions in relation to inquiries and the transfer of powers under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act and the Air Pollution Act will be given to the <Col N="889" /> agency in time but it is not necessary that they be given on day one.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputy Gilmore has withdrawn his amendment and I appreciate the support for my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 15, after &ldquo;1987,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as amended by the Third Schedule,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to take too long on these early amendments as I wish to get into the meat of the debate and I feel that we have a long night ahead of us.  I understand that the Minister changed the definition of &ldquo;pollutant&rdquo; in the Third Schedule.  That has a consequential impact on the definition of &ldquo;emission&rdquo;. This amendment, which stands in my name and that of Deputy Kavanagh, seeks to regularise that.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister's word for that.  I presume that the consequential changes will be incorporated in the final draft of the Bill.  Is that what the Minister is implying?  We have had a very short time in which to examine the Committee Stage approved Bill so it is difficult for us to consider the way in which amendments slot in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make a general point, I consider that it is a bad procedure to try to guillotine a great number of issues in a complex Bill in a very short time.  I remonstrated at the Whip's meeting last week about <Col N="890" /> the completely inadequate time given between the completion of Committee Stage and the introduction of Report Stage.  I take the Minister's word and I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is identical to my amendment No. 4 on Committee Stage, so I shall not go through the arguments I put forward then.  Several Deputies, including Deputies Howlin and Gilmore, supported the amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister did not hold out any real hope in the reply on Committee Stage and I am disappointed that she has not had second thoughts.  It appears that my pleas are falling on deaf ears, so rather than waste any further time, I shall withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I feel that the definition of &ldquo;emission&rdquo; is not an all-embracing definition and that the words &ldquo;ionising radiation, electro-magnetic radiation and other radiations (light and heat), or residues (salts and pesticides)&rdquo; should be included in that definition.  Has the Minister considered whether or not this addition would be helpful to the definition or does she believe that they are already covered under the definition of &ldquo;emissions&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, radiation is already the responsibility of what is to be the Radiological Protection Institute.  It would not be appropriate to have two national bodies duplicate responsibilities in this regard and it is obvious that the institute would be the appropriate body to have responsibility for matters relating to radiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Residues (salts and pesticides) are already included in the definition of &ldquo;emission&rdquo; if discharged as polluting matter, sewage effluent or trade effluent within the meaning of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977; if emitted into the atmosphere as a pollutant within the meaning of the Air Pollution Act, 1987; or if included in the disposal of waste.  Therefore, there is no <Col N="892" /> need to include specific reference to those matters.</P>
    <P>In relation to electro-magnetic radiation and other radiations (light and heat), I am assured that they are already covered under the definition of environmental pollution in section 4 (2).  In that definition &ldquo;environmental pollution&rdquo; includes &ldquo;air pollution&rdquo; for the purposes of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  &ldquo;Pollutant&rdquo; as defined in the 1987 Act includes, as well as specific substances specified in the First Schedule to that Act, any other substance or energy which may cause pollution.  I am advised that that definition includes electro-magnetic radiation and other radiations (light and heat) and therefore this part of the proposed amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following: &ldquo;(e) an urban district council or a town commissioner,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill as drafted the definition of &ldquo;Local authority&rdquo; is defined as comprising county councils, city councils and the Borough Corporation of Dún Laoghaire with no mention of urban district councils or town commissioners.  In view of the considerable anxiety obtaining on the part of urban district councils and town commissioners about their possible demise within the context of the second phase of local government re-organisation I found it somewhat strange that they should have been excluded from the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.  I wonder whether the Minister of State knows something the remainder of us do not about the fate of urban district councils <Col N="893" /> and town commissioners.  Perhaps she would either accept my amendment or clarify the position for us regarding the reasons for their exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore's amendment would extend the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the Bill from the 33 existing local authorities covered by the existing definition &mdash; which is the standard in practically all environmental legislation &mdash; to over 100 in all.  Such extension would not be justified in all cases.</P>
      <P>For example, it has been the practice in environmental legislation to confine the powers conferred by that legislation to the major local authorities.  The principal reason for this is that only the major local authorities would have the resources, including the requisite level of expertise, to implement the provisions of the legislation.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the definition in the Bill should remain unchanged.  However, it is recognised that in some instances the wider definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; would be appropriate.  For example, in the case of advice given by the agency under the provisions of section 56, the performance of their statutory functions under section 61 and agreements to provide services to the agency under the provisions of section 45.  In these cases the definition is extended and in every other section where the wider definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; would be appropriate.  These references take into account the resources, functions and capabilities of the various local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>My amendments arise from a detailed review of the use of the words &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the Bill when studying Deputy Gilmore's amendments tabled for Committee Stage.  While having indicated I am generally satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; it is apparent that the use of planning authority rather than local authority in section 89 would be more consistent with the remainder of Part IV.  These amendments provide the necessary alterations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; being used in this Bill is in line <Col N="894" /> with the recommendations of the report of the Barrington Committee on Local Government Reform which quite specifically said that the county council was the most appropriate body for the implementation of major environmental legislation, capital works programmes and matters of that kind.  It would not be possible &mdash; I think I made this point on our Part IV discussion the other day &mdash; to extend to town commissioners and to urban district councils additional functions in relation to environmental protection in that they do not have the resources or expertise.  It would not be possible to provide those.  Were we to widen the definition in this Part of the Bill to include town commissioners and urban district councils we would be diffusing the position rather than providing a central, coherent body that would help to streamline the way we organise our environmental protection activities, which is the whole purpose behind the establishment of this agency.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment. However, where advice may be forthcoming in the performance of their statutory functions and so on, obviously the agency will have a role to play in relation to all local authorities, including urban district councils and town commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long debate about subsidiarity on Committee Stage. I have no intention of re-opening that topic.  However, it does not augur well for the future of urban district councils and town commissioners that, in the body of environmental legislation going through this House, they should be excluded from the definition of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;. I contend it takes on an added meaning in the context of what we now know about the Government's intentions, or at least those of the Minister of State's party, with regard to the future of those bodies.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 21, after &ldquo;structure&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, portion of the sea or seabed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was not satisfied with the Minister's explanation on Committee Stage in relation to this amendment.  Therefore I have re-entered the suggestion that, after the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; we should insert &ldquo;, portion of the sea or seabed&rdquo; because it seems to me that it clarifies beyond doubt that such places are covered by some parts of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must inform the Deputy that my advice is similar today, that the &ldquo;seabed&rdquo; is covered by the present definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; by virtue of the inclusion of &ldquo;land&rdquo; whether or not that land is covered with water.  It is clear that the jurisdiction of the agency is within the State which includes the territorial waters of the State.  It is also clear, from the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo;, within the meaning of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, that the agency's area of jurisdiction applies to tidal waters which is defined as including the sea and estuaries.  I might add that I sought the advice of the parliamentary draftsmen in relation to whether or not fish cages might be covered by the term &ldquo;structure&rdquo;, which may be one of the reasons for the Deputy having tabled his amendment.  I am assured that they are covered by the reference to &ldquo;structure&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did mean to cover one of the points the Minister referred to in my amendment.  My advice is that it is far from clear that the Bill as drafted covers all of the sea, all of the seabed, or all structures or features of the sea or seabed; that it would be better to clarify that part of the sea or seabed is included. For instance, under the Foreshores Act, I know that the &ldquo;land&rdquo; is the land which appears at low water mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> The Minister is now contending that &ldquo;land&rdquo; is land under territorial seas, which definition is certainly not replicated in the Foreshores Act.  I am surprised to hear the Minister say that her advice is that land under territorial seas, is included in the legislation obtaining. Certainly it is a surprise to me to hear that fish farms, floating or submerged platforms are covered by the present definition because my advice is that they are not.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Finance to re-establish Fóir Teoranta and, conscious of the difficulties being experienced by examiners appointed under the terms of the Companies Act, 1990, further calls on the Minister to extend the powers of Fóir Teoranta on its re-establishment to mandate it to provide examiners with the working capital they need to carry out their functions so as to avoid unnecessary liquidations and consequent loss of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As unemployment moves inexorably towards a level of 300,000 and the Government fail to put forward any real initiatives to provide jobs it becomes imperative that everything possible be done to preserve existing jobs.  Every day we hear on radio and television and read in the newspapers about firms folding <Col N="897" /> up with massive job losses.  Bad news in regard to jobs is now so frequent that the fact is merely reported and comment has almost dried up.  The closure of factories is now treated by the media like shootings in Northern Ireland &mdash; inevitable and unfortunate but beyond comment.  The victims are treated with a similar fatalistic shrug &mdash; what cannot be cured must be endured.</P>
    <P>The Government have stood idly by and watched the spiralling unemployment figures.  They have rejected all proposals made by the Opposition parties and, in particular, by Fine Gael, to solve the problem.  They ignore the best advice given in reports commissioned and paid for by them, as they have done in the case of the recent Culliton report.</P>
    <P>I wish to confine my remarks tonight to the preservation of existing jobs rather than the creation of new jobs.  One essential weapon in the armour of the State in the preservation of jobs is a State rescue bank.  This is why I am calling for the re-establishment of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in 1972 and until their abolition did sterling work in rescuing thousands of companies and maintaining jobs.  As their mandate only allowed them to invest in companies which were in trouble they were involved in the riskiest of risk capital businesses, yet their record in this area was good.  Up to the date of their abolition, £85 million of their investments had to be written off.  However, they had rescued hundreds of companies and saved tens of thousands of jobs.  Many household names in Irish industry today owe their strength to the intervention of Fóir Teoranta in their hour of need.  The Taoiseach's family business, C &amp; D Petfoods, was the beneficiary of a Fóir Teoranta rescue in the eighties.</P>
    <P>Naturally Fóir Teoranta had their losses.  The very nature of their business ensured that they would have losses, but taking all things into account, their contribution to Irish industry and the preservation of jobs has been positive.  On a value for money basis, I believe the country has got as much value from the <Col N="898" /> investments by Fóir Teoranta in failing companies as it has got from the investments, by way of grant aid, by the IDA, SFADCo. and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the figures in the last annual report produced by the company which reviewed their activities for the last five years they were in business. In 1984, 93 firms were approved for Fóir Teoranta investment and the number of workers in the firms approved was 7,800; in 1985, 86 firms were approved and the number of workers was 6,600; in 1986, 58 firms were approved and the number of workers was 5,600; in 1987, 51 firms were approved and the number of workers was 2,130 and in 1988, 46 firms were approved and the number of workers was 2,500.  In all, just under 25,000 jobs were involved over that five year period.  In present circumstances with the unemployment level spiralling towards 300,000 the interventions of Fóir Teoranta in rescuing companies and saving jobs are missed.</P>
    <P>The sectoral analysis table in the annual report dated 31 December 1988 shows the spread of investment through the different sectors of the economy. They are also worth looking at.  Of the total invested by Fóir Teoranta, £6.6 million or over 21 per cent was invested in the food processing industry; £6 million or 19.6 per cent was invested in pharmaceuticals, plastics, rubbers and chemcials; more than £5 million or 17 per cent was invested in engineering; £4.2 million or 13.7 per cent was invested in clothing and textiles; £2.4 million or 7.9 per cent was invested in glass, pottery and domestic ware; £2.4 million or 7.8 per cent was invested in print and packaging; £2 million or 6.6 per cent was invested in building materials; £500,000 or 1.5 per cent was invested in footwear and leather and £1.2 million or 3.9 per cent was invested in other industries.  The total invested was £30.5 million.  This investment was spread right across all the sectors of the economy and made a contribution.  That was a reasonable record.</P>
    <P>When the then Minister for Finance, the present Taoiseach, introduced the <Col N="899" /> Bill to abolish Fóir Teoranta he gave a number of reasons for his actions.  He said first that the economy had picked up and there was very little demand for Fóir Teoranta's interventions.  It is self-evident that that is no longer true, if it ever was true, as the economy is in crisis, job losses are mounting on job losses and the Government do not have a single shot in their locker to deal with the unemployment problem.  The recent UMP example is merely the most high profile example of the haemorrhage which has been bleeding jobs out of the country for the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>Some progress was made when Fianna Fáil came to power in 1987.  A certain number of extra jobs were created at the time of the Tallaght strategy.  However, since mid-1989 progress in job creation has been very weak and our unemployment level is absolutely catastrophic. To use the argument that we no longer need a State rescue bank because Government policy has stimulated the economy out of its difficulties to the degree that a State rescue agency is no longer needed is certainly not true in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The second reason given by the then Minister for Finance for abolishing Fóir Teoranta was that venture capital was freely available for viable firms.  That was not the case at that time and it is not the case at present.  By and large the banks are not in the business of giving venture capital; they are not interested in providing venture capital.  They want all their lending to be backed by fixed assets.  If a company do not have fixed assets they look for personal guarantees on the personal assets of the business person, including the family home, before they will provide money.  There is no venture capital industry in the country.  The amalgamation of NADCORP and the IDA meant that the State agency which provided some venture capital was done away with.  Fóir Teoranta, the State agency which provided risk capital for companies in difficulty, has also been done away with.</P>
    <P>There is no money in the commercial <Col N="900" /> sector to invest in companies in trouble. Indeed, there is very little money in the commercial sector to invest in companies where the investment is not backed by fixed assets.  This is particularly true in the knowledge-based industries.  Many bright young graduates who want to set up, for example, software operations, are not being backed to any great extent by the banks because they do not have the fixed assets to back the loan; the banks are not prepared to back ability, skill, brainpower and entrepreneurship.  They are simply not interested in doing this. We do not have a venture capital industry here.  To say that there is sufficient venture capital available from other sources to make State agencies such as Fóir Teoranta or NADCORP redundant is to miss what is happening in the economy and the point of bank policy in recent years.</P>
    <P>The third reason given by the then Minister for Finance for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta was associated with this point.  He said that the business expansion scheme would provide an alternative source of finance.  The Taoiseach knocked the stuffing out of the business expansion scheme in the last budget he introduced as Minister for Finance. Whatever potential there is still in the scheme for the provision of small amounts of venture capital to viable companies or companies with stong potential the business expansion scheme will not provide a single pound for ailing companies in risk of liquidation.</P>
    <P>That is what Fóir Teoranta did and to suggest that the business expansion scheme is a substitute for the activities of Fóir Teoranta is a total misunderstanding of the system.  There was some merit in the argument when the business expansion scheme applied to the tourist industry and certainly BES money was used to improve the balance sheets of many hotels in trouble.  However, it no longer applies to the tourist industry and BES money is not going into ailing companies in the appropriate amounts.  Anyway, the amounts now appropriate for an individual BES scheme have been capped by the actions of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance and the amounts <Col N="901" /> available for a company in difficulty are so small as to make the argument which he put forward at the time he abolished Fóir Teoranta irrelevant at present.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason advanced by the Taoiseach when he abolished Fóir Teoranta was that the Examiner provisions of the Companies Act &mdash; which were not even enacted at the time &mdash; would provide an alternative mechanism to ensure that ailing companies could be treated out of difficulty.  The courts would protect the company from their creditors and the Examiner, after a preliminary examination, would have the protection of the courts while he drew up a scheme of arrangement for creditors and commenced to trade the company out of difficulty. Very briefly, that was the intention of the Examiner sections.  This was fine in theory but, after the initial success of the Examiner provisions in coping with the Goodman debacle, serious doubts have recently emerged about the efficacy of the Examiner provisions as a rescue mechanism.</P>
    <P>The difficulties in the provisions were pointed out when the Bill was going through the Dáil by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy John Bruton and by Deputy Seán Barrett.  There are a number of problems but the key problem in the context of what I am saying is that if an Examiner fails to trade a company out of difficulty and the company are subsequently liquidated, expenses incurred by the Examiner have first call on the company's assets.  Consequently, banks who provide credit to an Examiner are moving themselves to a lower preference category in respect of any debts due to them prior to the introduction of the Examiner.  This brings me to the second part of my proposal, Examiners appointed by the courts must have access to independent funds.  A re-established Fóir Teortanta is the best vehicle for the provision of such funds; there would be no risk to Fóir Teoranta or the State as, under the Companies Act, expenses incurred by the Examiner would have first preference on the company's assets. It would also ensure that Fóir Teortanta would, as in the case of consultants, be <Col N="902" /> asked to give a second opinion on the viability of the company in question which could strengthen the Examiner provisions and at least a bank could decide whether the Examiner's report was worthy of investment and if a business could be traded out of difficulty.</P>
    <P>Many commentators believe that the Companies Act needs to be amended to meet the growing discontent, especially from creditors who operate under the Examiner's provisions.  This is probably for another day and another debate but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 29 March 1992 where Mr. Michael Ford examined the Examiner sections of the Companies Act and referred to the difficulties involved.  He said:</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties is the ease of appointing an examiner.  Once there is some prospect of saving the company, albeit a slim one, the courts tends to appoint an examiner.  A case could be made for a higher burden of proof to be overcome.  However, if it was required that there should be a stronger likelihood of a successful outcome, it is questionable whether the usual court procedures are the appropriate way to deal with that question.</P>
    <P>He went on to talk about the veto on re-possession and said that security cannot be enforced on re-possessed goods or forms of execution put into effect without the Examiner's consent. He also mentioned the problems of a debtor in possession, the automatic progress to a second stage and that, after 21 days, when the Examiner comes back to court it seems that he inevitably progresses to trading the company out of difficulty even though it might not be justified.  He also talked about the Revenue's preferential debt and the problems of secured creditors, with which I have dealt already. He mentioned the Examiner's expenses, the way they are treated and funding the expenses.  The article is well worth reading to appreciate the latest thinking in regard to the various gaps in the law in relation to companies. Certainly there is merit in the recommendation <Col N="903" /> that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should look again at the recently passed Companies Act; in particular, he should look at the provisions which were introduced as a separate Bill in August, 1990 in response to the Goodman crisis.</P>
    <P>The Companies Act has a very long history; as a matter of fact it was the last Bill I published when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Dáil had gone into recess and it was introduced in the Seanad.  The late Frank Cluskey and Deputy John Bruton were involved in putting it together; it was very complex legislation.  It was on my desk for one year and was published just before we went out of Government.  It was four years later before it became law having been thoroughly scrutinised by a special committee of this House.</P>
    <P>Curiously, the Examiner provisions which were lifted out of the main Companies Bill and introduced here as a separate Bill in response to the Goodman crisis did not receive much scrutiny, which is obvious from the debates at the time.  While people on our side of the House pointed out certain difficulties there are major gaps in that law which are now emerging in practice.  We all know of the difficulties the Examiner faced in relation to UMP.  There were also difficulties in relation to a north Dublin company.  Was it called Portacabin?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At any rate, the Examiner proved inadequate, taking all the circumstances into account, because the appointment did not lead to a rescue.  Curiously, in the Goodman case, the Examiner succeeded in bringing about a situation where the Goodman group of companies are still trading and seem to be doing so out of difficulty. It is now very questionable whether the hopes which the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, pinned on the Examiner provisions in the Companies <Col N="904" /> Act as a substitute mechanism for rescuing companies, which made Fóir Teoranta redundant and subject to abolition, were realised.</P>
      <P>I call for the re-introduction of Fóir Teoranta because there is a gap in the armoury of weapons which the State has in rescuing companies and in protecting jobs.  When they are re-established, they should be given the additional mandate of providing working capital for Examiners appointed by the courts under the terms of the Companies Act.</P>

      <P>The escalating crisis on the jobs front and the closure of businesses has focused our minds on the necessity of re-establishing Fóir Teoranta. This motion is timely and opportune and recent events within United Meat Packers, which have focused all our attention on the economic devastation on communities in Sligo, Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen and &mdash; near my own constituency &mdash; Charleville, has shown the limitations of the protection afforded by the appointment of the Examiner.</P>
      <P>It was orginally envisaged that when the Examiner approved cheques they would be honoured.  We are all aware that the farming organisations are, rightly, extremely agitated because of farmers not being paid.  This also applies to the hauliers who purchased expensive trucks and who have been left high and dry with hire purchase commitments.  I hope after the High Court sitting that sanity will prevail, that priority status will be authorised for the farmers and hauliers and that they will be paid for liabilities incurred for the duration of the Examiner.  It is imperative also that the Government honour their commitments to the workers and that the plants are opened as soon as possible.  Although tenders for the plants have to be submitted before 10 April 1992, it is obvious to everyone that bidders will not submit their bids while the company have outstanding debts to farmers.  Therefore, it is important that this matter be resolved and it is now recognised that the legislation to appoint the Examiner is flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister for Agriculture and <Col N="905" /> Food was asked by Deputy Deasy, the Fine Gael spokesperson for Agriculture and Food, if the farmers would be paid, I recall that he assured him that they would.  When pressed further about treating them as preferential creditors, he would not give such a commitment.  It is now time for the Government spokespersons to stop talking, that the debts be paid and the jobs be restored.</P>
    <P>It is hard to accept that Goodman Ltd. are seriously considering bidding for these plants.  It should be firmly pointed out to Mr. Goodman, even at this stage, that under the monopolies legislation this would not be tolerated.  We already know of the financial failure of this enterprise and the large rescue package put together by the banks.  Already, the Goodman organisation are having difficulty meeting their commitments under the financial package as their profits are not what they were in the past.  One does not need to be an economic wizard to know the reasons for that.  It would be dangerous for the industry and would not be beneficial for the farmers if Goodman were successful.</P>
    <P>It is indeed ironic that when Fóir Teoranta were being dissolved in May 1990 the present Taoiseach, who was the then Minister for Finance, piloted their dissolution. Fóir Teoranta were set up in 1972 with the purpose of helping existing potentially viable industries when the financial institutions would not support them when they encountered financial difficulties.  Many companies trading today, including the Taoiseach's company, C &amp; D Petfoods Ltd. are still trading because of Fóir Teoranta's assistance. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, announced in February 1989 that Fóir Teoranta were being wound up because the Companies Bill provided for the appointment of an Examiner by the courts in order to protect a potentially viable company from going into immediate liquidation.  I have already elaborated on the fact that this has not worked out, as the recent UMP saga proves.</P>
    <P>When the Bill to abolish Fóir Teoranta was going through the Dáil, the Fine <Col N="906" /> Gael spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated that the Minister should not proceed as it was &ldquo;ill-conceived and untimely&rdquo;.  There is a need for Fóir Teoranta now more than ever because of the jobs crisis which bedevils our country. Many companies in the high tech area may get into financial difficulties in their early years.  Their best asset is the brain power of their staff.  Fóir Teoranta provided experienced personnel who could be most helpful during a growth phase. There is a need for a rescue agency to assist empires that run into difficulties and emergencies when their viability is threatened.  It is essential that we try to preserve jobs when we run into extreme difficulties.  As we are aware, the banks and financial institutions are ultra cautious when giving loans to industry and are not in favour of providing risk capital.</P>
    <P>As we are aware from past experience, banks are not prepared to facilitate companies that may be experiencing short term difficulties.  There is a need for a body such as Fóir Teoranta and never was it more warranted than in the present jobs crisis.  There is an urgent necessity to create jobs.  Indeed, there are many existing worthwhile jobs which would not now exist except for the intervention of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Since the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta no financial institutions have been involved in helping companies.  For that reason it is essential to re-establish Fóir Teoranta.  This would help to provide an injection of funds to companies to help them get over short term difficulties. These difficulties can often arise due to an increase in interest rates, increased raw material costs and other emergencies that may crop up from time to time.</P>
    <P>Our interest rates remain stubbornly high and this places a tremendous burden on industry.  I call on the Minister to support this motion and restore Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 is flawed.  I would not sell any of my cattle to a meat factory when an Examiner is in control and I certainly will never advise <Col N="907" /> any other farmers to do so again after what has happened at UMP.</P>
      <P>The measures which were passed in Dáil Éireann as part of the Companies (Amendment) Act do not translate into the type of protection which was envisaged at the time.  I have to admit that I believed that if the issued cheques had the protection of the Examiner, all would be well.  The collapse of UMP illustrates all that is wrong with the examinership. Several hundred farmers, many of them small farmers depending entirely on the sale of their few cattle, believed what they were told: that the cheques were safe when issued by the Examiner.  However, long after the demise of the Examiner and the installation of the Receiver and the High Court case today, the farmers still have not received one single penny for their cattle.  I understand that Mr. Justice Murphy said that the law did not enable him to give priority to people who supplied livestock.  They are the very words I heard from the court today.</P>
      <P>Who is supposed to fund the Examiner? That is the big question.  Were the funds to come from moneys available at UMP, from the receipts for cattle sold abroad or from intervention?  None of these scenarios is a cast-iron guarantee of payment, for a variety of reasons.  I wonder if the money was supposed to come from a deal done with the banks on working capital, as I think this was the most likely source of funding.  One of the major factors involved in UMP being in trouble was that the major French bank involved expressed the view that the Irish banks had too little exposure to the debt and that they were vulnerable.  After the Examiner had made the deal and gave the guarantees &mdash; I was in Ballyhaunis the night he announced that all livestock would be paid for &mdash; the banks for their own reasons sought to appoint a receiver. The Examiner now has egg on his face and the farmers have rubber in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there must be some type of State guaranteed funding to back up all the cheques issued by the Examiner. Commentators will point out that the <Col N="908" /> Examiner was successful in the case of Goodman International.  However, that was an entirely different story.  Up to 25 banks worldwide were involved with the Goodman group and, let us be honest, Mr. Larry Goodman may as well have been a member of your Cabinet, Deputy Ahern, such was his influence.</P>

      <P>I will bow to your ruling, Sir, but suffice it to say that Sher-Rafique of UMP had no such influence and in my view he has paid the penalty as a result.  Nobody in the west wants the Goodman organisation to have anything to do with the UMP factories in the west. Farmers and small creditors must be paid by Friday of this week irrespective of who takes over the factories.  We are led to believe a number of people are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that farmers will not deliver one animal no matter what the guarantees, or by whom they are given, until everybody involved in the supply of stock to those factories has been paid.  That is reasonable and no self <Col N="909" /> respecting receiver, examiner or Government could expect farmers to lose twice. Tonight it appears that something of the order of £7 million has been made available but for some strange reason the receiver could not give a categoric assurance as to when farmers and small creditors will be paid.  I speak for thousands of people affected in the west when I say that I do not want to hear in the morning that the banks got their few million pounds first.  I assume that is not possible but, bearing in mind the way our region has been left on its own, anything is possible.</P>
    <P>People are appalled at the shenanigans of the Government, the banks, the examiner and the receiver on the UMP issue. Everybody seemed to have an answer when a television camera was switched on them; everything seemed to be rosy. Up to today, many weeks after cattle and sheep were delivered to the factories, not a single penny has been paid.</P>
    <P>Due to the demise of Fóir Teoranta the Government had no direct responsibility to try to help a firm like UMP.  That is the major problem.  It appeared to me they had great sympathy and compassion but they were not in a position to rescue UMP, irrespective of the evaluation of the future of that firm.  That is why I see a huge problem with the Examiner.  I have no doubt UMP could have been saved had there been an early warning system which would have identified the problem areas earlier; 650 jobs could have been saved; valuable export markets protected; competition for cattle and sheep maintained and a valuable indigenous industry left intact.</P>
    <P>The UMP debacle reminds me that what is everybody's business is nobody's business; that is the only way one can explain the hands off attitude we have had for the past two months.  An Examiner without guaranteed funding and under the influence of the banks &mdash; which undoubtedly he had to be because that is the only place he could get his working capital &mdash; could never deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion is sensible and, in my view, addresses the problems that have arisen.  My colleague, Deputy <Col N="910" /> Noonan, the Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, on several occasions complained about the abolition of Fóir Teoranta. He, in fact, published the Companies Bill, a very complex document. I understand the reason it took a long time to complete but I am not sure it should have taken all those years.  Suddenly, the section dealing with the Examiner was lifted.  That section never got the attention it should have.  The reason was an urgent matter in August 1990.  At that time many people said it might work; I am not sure it worked for the company concerned.  As Deputy Noonan said, that company continuing to trade as such have done something which the UMP enterprise have not been able to do.</P>
    <P>Some people see the involvement of the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> Fóir Teoranta, in any guise, as promoting the idea of being the keeper of lame ducks.  I can point to a number of firms, during my time in politics, that progressed following the involvement of Fóir Teoranta; I know some that did not succeed.</P>
    <P>For a company such as UMP we had guaranteed raw materials, thousands of cattle and sheep, the best in the country; the expertise in the factories in Ballyhaunis, Ballaghaderreen and other factories and no shortage of export orders.  That firm trebled their direct sales to the supermarkets of Europe in the past three or four years.  Like other companies, they had to depend, to a certain degree, on intervention but they were trying to trade away from intervention. That is what the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Taoiseach and everybody is talking about.  They encountered a financial problem and talked about a sum of £50 million.  Should we try to equate the UMP turnover of £50 million with the £550 million turnover of Goodman?  I am not sure if the debt ratio was the same.</P>
    <P>I heard in financial circles that on the day UMP collapsed they were much further away from bankruptcy than were the Goodman Group in their day.  If all that is correct I would have thought that, even if one or two bank groups got nervous &mdash; perhaps with good reason &mdash; a project evaluation would show that in two to five <Col N="911" /> years time this company could have been saved.  They operated for 17 years, and nobody could raise a finger to them but suddenly the firm disintegrated.</P>
    <P>Had the Examiner the necessary legislative power the day he sat down to make a deal &mdash; he had to bring in a number of banking groups, commercial entities who protect themselves &mdash; and had there been a State rescue agency, modelled on Fóir Teoranta, combined with the work of the Industrial Development Authority, there would have been a different outcome. For a very small financial input by the State combined with State control which the Minister would have had because of the investment of taxpayers' money, there would have been a different conclusion to the case of the UMP group. That is why the Fine Gael Party believe this particular legislation is incomplete. A type of Fóir Teoranta must work with the receiver; in other words the emperor would not be without clothes.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;endorses the Government's overall economic policies as the best means of ensuring the creation and retention of long term sustainable jobs in the economy.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I should say to the Fine Gael spokesperson on Finance, Deputy Noonan, and to Deputies Finucane and Connaughton that I have listened carefully to the points they have made and <Col N="912" /> will cover a number of aspects of the motion which deals with An Fóir Teoranta and unemployment, while some of my colleagues will deal with the companies Act, 1990.  Indeed, most of the points made by the Deputies opposite relate to that Act, with particular reference to what happened in the House in August 1990 and the ongoing difficulties of UMP.  Having been involved in the various discussions on the financial aspects of that company I understand the Deputies' arguments fully and can assure them that I will deal with the points which concern the Department of Finance and will bring the points which concern the Department of Industry and Commerce to the attention of my colleagues.</P>
    <P>I would like, first, to devote a few thoughts on the performance of the economy over the recent past.  Despite the economic downturn at home and abroad last year, Ireland's economic performance had many positive features. GDP growth at about 2 per cent was only slightly less than envisaged in the 1991 budget.  Growth was of course much lower than in 1989 and 1990 but it was nonetheless creditable in the context of the recessionary conditions in some of our trading partners.  Our performance compares very favourably, for example, with the UK where the volume of GDP fell by 2½ per cent in 1991.  Our industrial exports rose by over 6½ per cent, even though our export markets expanded by only 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>At home, we saw a further general improvement in real incomes, but weaker confidence internationally and continuing high real interest rates saw much of this reflected in savings rather than spending.  Thus, there was only a modest rise in consumer spending and investment fell in real terms following the very strong growth of the previous two years.</P>
    <P>The corrective action taken in July last year kept Exchequer borrowing within reasonable bounds, and another important step towards reaching our medium-term fiscal targets was thereby taken. Most significant of all, despite all the difficulties, non-agricultural employment continued to grow.  Average employment <Col N="913" /> in larger industrial establishments was up by 1,100 in the first three quarters of 1991 on the corresponding period in 1990. Average employment in banking, insurance and building societies was up by 900 in the same period.  Tax returns and employment levy receipts also suggest that employment was still holding up at the end of the year.  Thus, the steep rise in unemployment last year reflected the return of many former emigrants and the cessation of emigration.  It was not caused by falling employment at home.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, the international economic outlook for 1992 remains uncertain.  Last December, both the OECD and the EC Commission forecast a slow and modest international recovery with growth picking up to 2 per cent or more compared with about 1 per cent last year.  While these predictions may now be a little optimistic, I think we can still expect some improvement in our export markets.  The UK Treasury now forecast a 4 per cent rise in the volume of UK imports this year compared with a decline of 3 per cent last year.  Our agricultural exports should also benefit from better market conditions in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>At home, nominal after-tax incomes should rise by about 6 per cent this year. Assuming broadly unchanged savings behaviour, consumer spending and investment should show a modest improvement in real terms.</P>
    <P>Although economic growth this year may not be much faster than last year, its composition should be more balanced as between domestic demand and exports and should be more employment-intensive. However, with unemployment in the UK likely to go on rising for the foreseeable future, and with only modest growth on the Continent and in the US, job opportunities abroad will be scarce. Given the projected rise in our labour force, average unemployment here is, unfortunately, likely to rise significantly again this year.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken a number of steps to combat rising unemployment. For example, the EC Commission has agreed to provide substantial funds for a <Col N="914" /> new employment subsidy scheme and for in-company training.  I warmly welcome the fact that these schemes are receiving the full support of the Federation of Irish Employers and other employer organisations as well as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I strongly urge all employers to participate as fully as possible in these schemes.</P>
    <P>The area partnerships envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to combat long term unemployment through training, education and enterprise development are now in place in 12 pilot areas.  The public agencies concerned have made the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Industrial Policy Review Group focuses on the need for a wider strategy in addressing industrial policy, e.g., by ensuring that various Government areas of responsibility such as education, training, taxation, transport, energy, infrastructural services etc., which have a contribution to make to industrial policy, are brought together in a more integrated and coherent way in the context of industrial policy, than in the past.  The report states that it is axiomatic that there should be no overall increase in expenditure/State borrowing as a result of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report represents a significant input to our approach to industrial policy and to how that policy can contribute to increasing employment and living standards in this country.  It contains a large number of recommendations over a wide range of policy areas which are under active consideration by the Ministers and Departments responsible.  A task force under the chairmanship of Dr. Patrick Moriarty has been established by the Government to follow up on the implementation of the recommendations in the report.  The task force will be vigorously pursuing any proposals likely to have a positive impact on employment.</P>
    <P>The task force will report to a committee of Ministers, headed by the Taoiseach and including the other Ministers concerned.  That committee will also consider recommendations of the task force on employment.  The direct link with <Col N="915" /> Government will ensure the highest priority for the activities of both task forces.</P>
    <P>While Government sets the policy environment, they cannot play the primary role in employment creation.  The lead here must be played by the private sector.  The private sector has shown in the past that, given the right conditions, it can create a significant number of new jobs.  For example, between April 1987 and April 1991, net non-agricultural employment in the private sector rose by over 70,000.  Deputy Noonan acknowledged that when the policies pursued by the Government led to economic growth there was a sustained increase in employment.</P>
    <P>The labour force increase we will have in the next few years means that even this creditable performance is not enough.  It must be bettered if the rise in unemployment is to be halted.  The key to greater employment creation in the private sector is stronger investment and expansion.  In today's conditions, maintaining competitiveness is not enough.  It must be improved.  The recent adjustment in cost increases achieved in the UK shows we have no cause for complacency. The days of easy competitiveness gains in the UK market are over.</P>
    <P>The message is clear.  Even in international recession, better competitiveness allowed us make worthwhile progress &mdash; increasing our share even of stagnant overseas markets.  Sound fundamentals stood up well in hard times. Equally, they can be the springboard for more rapid growth as conditions improve, but a daunting employment task lies before us &mdash; to earn the extra jobs we need through our own efforts: soundly based jobs which flow from selling goods and services at home and abroad, not from borrowed money.  This task will be with us for several years to come but is one worthy of the finest talents which this nation can command.</P>
    <P>We cannot achieve sound results by going back to the days when the State actively intervened in the economy.  It is for all these reasons that I tabled an <Col N="916" /> amendment to the motion asking this House to endorse the Government's overall economic policies as the best means of ensuring the creation and retention of long term sustainable jobs in the economy.  I will now remind the House of the background to the decision to wind up the activities of Fóir Teoranta and the reasons for its abolition.  This is part of the Fine Gael motion before the House tonight, the other part being primarily linked to the Companies Act and related issues, such as the involvement of the Department and the working of that legislation since its passage through this House in 1990.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Government announced the wind-up of the activities of Fóir Teoranta in February 1989, from which date it closed for new business, and the company was dissolved under the Fóir Teoranta (Dissolution) Act, 1990, on 2 April 1991.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta had been established in March 1972 under the Companies Act, 1963, as provided for in section 2 of the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972.  They were designed to fill a gap which was perceived in the range of State services available to manufacturing industry at the time.  Their purpose was to provide an orderly procedure for restructuring ailing, but potentially viable, industrial concerns which encountered financial difficulties and which were unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in a period of structural change in Irish industry prior to EC membership in 1973 and the removal of many trade barriers.  The progression to the open economy which we now have was taking place rapidly, and the Government at the time took the view that transitional measures aimed at helping Irish industry to adapt to the new, more competitive conditions would be reasonable.  Fóir Teoranta's busiest period of activity was during the recessionary period of the early 1980s, when they provided very substantial assistance to Irish industry, mainly in the traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing, footwear and leather, furniture, <Col N="917" /> etc.  Unfortunately, despite Fóir Teoranta's efforts, many of their client firms in these sectors did not survive.  It would be difficult to assert that Fóir Teoranta had anything but a marginal effect on the overall performance of these sectors one way or the other over the period of their operations.  On the positive side it must be said that some firms, in various sectors, which were assisted by Fóir Teoranta are trading successfully today.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, shortly after Fóir Teoranta were established.  Since then, there have been wide fluctuations in the performance of the economy.  In part, fast growth periods were stimulated by increased Government expenditure and borrowing.  These borrowing eventually became unsustainable.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> had as one of its central aims the improvement of the environment for industry so that industry would be in a position to stand on its own feet and compete in the world marketplace.  The aim was to reduce excessive Government expenditure, thereby reducing Government borrowing and lessening the upward pressures on interest rates and inflation.  As Deputies, know, very considerable progress was achieved under that programme.</P>
    <P>The level of activity in Fóir Teoranta had tapered off considerably in the years prior to their closure, reflecting the improved outlook for industry at the time, from a peak of about £23 million in disbursements in 1983 to about £7 million in 1988.  The number of applications received, cases approved, and the average size of cases approved had also substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>In line with the fall-off in demand for their services and the virtual disappearance of large cases, together with buoyant, own resources, Fóir Teoranta's requirement for Exchequer funding also declined.  From 1987 until their dissolution, they financed their operations from ongoing income from their investments by way of repayments from clients, including a considerable element of prepayments, and share realisations. However, it was not until near their closure, <Col N="918" /> when no new business was being transacted, that Fóir Teoranta were in a position to repay some of the Exchequer moneys advanced to them.  Fóir Teoranta were never really in a position to act on a commercial basis by remunerating any part of the Exchequer moneys advanced to them.</P>
    <P>Since Fóir Teoranta were a lender of last resort, it is perhaps not all that surprising that a high degree of failure took place among their client firms. However, the failure rate experienced by Fóir Teoranta involved very considerable cost to the Exchequer.  The failure rate may be measured by the fact that some £75 million of the Exchequer advances of £87.5 million outstanding at the time of their wind-up had, in effect, already been written-off by the company as irrecoverable. These advances have since been written off by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The level of write-off in Fóir Teoranta reflects the fact that many firms assisted failed, despite the assistance given by Fóir Teoranta.  Many of those firms left it far too late to go to Fóir Teoranta for assistance in the first instance.  Nevertheless, where assistance was given, in many cases the damage had already been done and the firms eventually went to the wall anyway.  While there may have been some economic benefit in keeping jobs in existence longer rather than being lost at the outset, the prospect for long term sustainable employment is better if firms are transferred to new owners quickly in the receivership or liquidation process. Keeping firms in existence, with Fóir Teoranta assistance, but with existing high levels of indebtedness and generally poor management, as well as other weaknesses, was likely to result in a more artificial intervention unlikely to generate long term benefits.  Frequently, it transpired that Fóir Teoranta's money eventually ended up in meeting bank liabilities, and the banks were often not all that accommodating in agreeing to financial restructuring packages.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the primary purpose of Fóir Teoranta was to secure the continuance of manufacturing firms which would in turn secure long term <Col N="919" /> sustainable employment in those firms. Indeed, it was a condition of obtaining Fóir Teoranta's assistance that there had to be reasonable prospects for long term commercial viability of the firms concerned. Yet, it is a feature of Ireland's employment record in the manufacturing sector that between 1973, soon after Fóir Teoranta were established, and the end of 1988, close to the time of the announcement of their wind-up, manufacturing employment was in almost continuous decline, from 216,700 in 1973 to 182,900 in 1988.</P>
    <P>The years following 1988 saw continuous growth in manufacturing employment, back up to an estimated 194,000 in 1991.  While a body such as Fóir Teoranta could hardly have been expected to have a substantial impact on the downward trend in manufacturing employment during the years of their existence, it would nevertheless be difficult to argue that Fóir Teoranta had a positive impact on overall manufacturing employment over that period, though of course the position in some individual firms was ameliorated.</P>
    <P>Average manufacturing industrial employment declined by an annual 1.8 per cent over the period 1981-88.  In the period 1988 to 1991, that employment trend was reversed, and employment in manufacturing industry increased by an annual average of 1.7 per cent.  The employment growth of recent years is the result of the prudent fiscal and monetary policies pursued since 1987, policies which gave low inflation and led to a reduction in the differential between our key three month interest rate and that of Germany from 9 percentage points in March 1987 to about one percentage point now.  These policies were, of course, complemented by the moderate wage agreement in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which helped to improve our competitiveness while at the same time reductions in income taxes gave employees increases in real take home pay.</P>
    <P>It is pursuing policies such as these that have turned overall employment around. <Col N="920" /> Fóir Teoranta, operating at the level of the individual firm, could never aspire to achieve such results.  Indeed, they could even act as a hindrance in that non-viable firms could be kept in artificial existence upsetting natural competitive forces which might otherwise throw up a new genuinely viable firm to replace the non-viable one.  I can see no prospect if Fóir Teoranta were re-established, as Deputy Noonan's motion proposes, that they would make a significant contribution to solving our employment problem.</P>
    <P>Employment is at the centre of this Government's agenda.  We are intent on developing proper long term sustainable measures which will keep employment on the growth path it has been on over recent years.  The recent report of the Industrial Policy Review Group set out an agenda in this regard which is being followed up vigorously by the Government. I want to reject any suggestions that it is not.  It is being followed up at a number of levels with involvement at the highest levels of officials from the State area, outside expertise and outside specialists who were involved when reports were necessary.  Deputies will note, however, that nowhere in the report is there any suggestion of State interventions of the type operated by Fóir Teoranta.  Indeed, the whole thrust of the report is towards broader macro-policies to be followed by Government, and not just in the economic area.  Tinkering with the economy at the firm level is not the type of policy favoured by that group, whose report has been widely welcomed across employers' organisations, trade unions and political parties.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision that Fóir Teoranta should be wound up was based mainly on the following factors: (i) the low level of demand for Fóir Teoranta's services over the years previous to the decision being taken; (ii) the very much changed industrial environment as compared with when Fóir Teoranta were established; (iii) the provisions that subsequently became the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, for the appointment by the Courts of an Examiner in order to help a potentially viable <Col N="921" /> company to avoid going into immediate liquidation; and (iv) the need to prepare Irish industry to be ready to meet the challenges of the more competitive regime which will apply when the Internal Market is fully in place after 1992.</P>
    <P>The decline in demand for Fóir Teoranta's services was due to a number of factors; the new climate of confidence in the economy and the favourable environment for industry were obviously major influencing factors.  Another important consideration was the fact that finance for industry had become available on a much wider scale than ever before from private sector individual and institutional sources.  Given also the improvement in the economy generally, it was inevitable that demand for Fóir Teoranta services would be considerably lessened and the need for such an organisation diminished. The industrial environment had changed as well, with industry itself, through the CII, stating that it would prefer a better overall economic environment, rather than grants at the firm level.  The pressures on State aids from Europe was another aspect, and indeed, it may well be that the European Commission would not permit a body such as Fóir Teoranta to exist in the post-1992 environment.  The Examinership provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, were seen as removing the need for State assistance to individual viable manufacturing companies in temporary financial difficulty.  Such assistance could in future be provided by the market.</P>
    <P>Management assistance was provided by Fóir Teoranta in some cases, but the IDA can, in relation to medium and large Irish industry, provide management with guidance and support in a number of ways: through the company development process, deficiencies can be identified which can allow restructuring to take place at an early stage; through their extensive network of contacts, both nationally and internationally, the IDA can assist companies to bring in new investors or partner investors; and where the company management team <Col N="922" /> is perceived to be too narrowly based, it may be bolstered through use of the existing range of incentives for management development.</P>
    <P>In relation to small businesses, a number of courses of action are available to the IDA with companies where difficulties may be anticipated: through the Mentor Programme, the IDA can assist companies by introduction to an experienced business person who would assist the company in identifying the problem areas in the business and advise on appropriate remedial action; and the involvement of the Mentor can be complemented by use of management development grants to address the specific problems identified.</P>
    <P>The IDA may become involved in restructuring where a company have closed down or goes into receivership and the assets have been taken over by a new investor with the objective of re-establishing the business on a commercially viable basis.  In this situation, the IDA may have a role to assist the new investor to put together a commercially viable operation using the assets, skills and expertise already in existence.</P>
    <P>To sum up, as regards Fóir Teoranta, the Government took their decision in relation to Fóir Teoranta in the light of prevailing circumstances.  The Government's view was and still is that with the other sources of finance available for investment in industry, and with the economy in better condition, there would be little if any adverse impact on employment as a result of the closure of Fóir Teoranta.  That is still the Government's view, as borne out by subsequent employment statistics.  As regards the view that a need has now arisen for the State to be actively involved once more in industrial rescue, it has to be made clear that the days of feather-bedding Irish industry are over.  That is the whole thrust and emphasis contained in the Culliton report on Industrial Policy.  The days are gone of an interventionist approach at taxpayers' expense to bail out the failures of individual private sector companies.  The IDA are still there to help with viable manufacturing jobs, through other means.  Such failures <Col N="923" /> cannot be rectified by using Exchequer moneys, thereby perhaps giving some firms where such failures occur, an unfair competitive advantage over others in the same market.</P>
    <P>Irish industry must be able to compete in the marketplace and, in an intensive effort to ensure that that will be the case in the post-1992 situation, the Government are devoting greater resources to industry in the context of the EC Structural Funds in order to assist employment and companies to expand into international markets.  Expenditure supported by the Structural Funds will be over £1 billion over the five-year period to 1993.  There is therefore no lessening in the level of resources being devoted to industry.  It is the purpose for which those resources are used which is important, and we will be ensuring that the funds involved are put to best effect in order to secure good solid progress in attaining the employment targets set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, regardless of the hostile international climate.</P>
    <P>I might add that the unavailability of Fóir Teoranta's services over the past few years has not caused major dislocations in Irish industry.  No industry association or trade union has made any representations to me that a need exists for the re-establishment of Fóir Teoranta. Further, as already mentioned, the IDA have a role, subject to certain criteria, in relation to giving financial assistance in the case of companies undergoing restructuring. I cannot therefore, see, the need for the re-establishment of Fóir Teoranta in respect of their former role as provider of State finance in company rescue cases, or as a provider of working capital to examiners.  As I have outlined, the IDA can do that with the £1 billion Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I will now go on to speak about the particular context in which Deputy Noonan's motion appears to be set.  That motion speaks of the difficulties being experienced by examiners appointed under the terms of the Companies Act, 1990.  It calls also for the extension of the <Col N="924" /> powers of a re-established Fóir Teoranta to provide examiners with the working capital they need to carry out their functions so as to avoid unnecessary liquidation and consequent loss of jobs. However, I am not aware of major difficulties being experienced by examiners in obtaining working capital during the examinership period.  Nor am I convinced that any company has gone into unnecessary liquidation as a result solely of the examiner being unable to obtain working capital.  Despite examinership procedure in cases where firms have subsequently gone into liquidation the reasons have been far more deep-rooted than a lack of working capital.</P>
    <P>I cannot say that the examiner provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 require the intervention of a State body such as Fóir Teoranta.  Since the expenses of the examiner are a first charge on the assets of the company concerned, I do not see the need for any such State intervention.  Nor am I aware of a problem arising in this regard, except perhaps in the recent United Meat Packers Group case with which we are dealing. Attempts are being made to make some progress in overcoming the difficulties in this case.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is constrained by legislation, but he is doing everything he can in this case.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do not believe that Fóir Teoranta's re-establishment to provide working capital for examiners is necessary, as they would be curtailed in the same way.  Indeed, the danger is that Fóir Teoranta's role as envisaged under Deputy Noonan's motion could quickly become that of an alternative banker enabling the banks and other creditors to avoid taking on further exposure during the examinership period or longer.  It is not difficult to imagine that if Fóir Teoranta were in existence, they would be regarded as an easy source of financing in examinership cases and commercial criteria could be lost sight of.  There is no need for the State to engage in any such non-commercial interventions, particularly when there is already in existence an adequate legal frame work to deal with <Col N="925" /> the problem.  Should problems be identified in the legislation, then I am sure that my colleague, Deputy Des O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, would be happy to look at the examinership provisions of the companies legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the situation which arose with the United Meat Packers Group, that group were confronted with a very grave financial crisis when their bankers were unwilling to advance further funds.  The problem here was not really one of lack of working capital but a lack of confidence in the group by their bankers.  In these circumstances, the only realistic option available was that these plants should be sold to reputable buyers without delay and the business, which is fundamentally sound, disposed of.  The sale of the plants is under way at present by the receiver who has reported a high degree of interest in the various factories. He believes that all plants can be disposed of, and the Industrial Development Authority are assisting as far as possible with both the receiver and with potential buyers.</P>
    <P>There is no problem about the banks providing finance on a commercial basis to enable these plants to get up and running as quickly as possible.  In fact the banks have consistently said that they are ready to assist in providing necessary finance for potential purchasers.</P>
    <P>The Government are aware of the difficulties experienced by small creditors of the Examiner in the UMP case.  However, the problem is one of timing, not a question of non-payment.  I understand that this issue was before the courts today, and I hope there will be a satisfactory outcome very shortly.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to sound economic policies which offer the best prospect of creating and sustaining long term viable jobs in the economy. As the Industrial Policy Review Group report states, there are no quick fixes when it comes to tackling unemployment. Government can, however, make a substantial contribution in this task through fostering the right economic conditions and by adopting the type of <Col N="926" /> broader strategy towards industrial policy recommended by the report in areas such as education, training, infrastructure, transport and energy.  This Government have curtailed the growth in Government spending, reduced overall State borrowing as a percentage of GNP, got interest rates down almost to German levels, tackled inflation, contributed towards improved wage competitiveness and are seeking to reduce the overall burden of taxation through reductions in personal income taxes and the removal of many of the plethora of allowances and tax shelters.  We are serious in our determination to bring about major improvements in our economic fundamentals with a view to bringing about increased long term sustainable employment. The resurrection of a body like Fóir Teoranta, for which there is no demand from industry, forms no part of that strategy.  Such a move &mdash; turning back the clock &mdash; would not be in the best interests of the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>Given the full circumstances I have outlined, I strongly commend the amended motion to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I may share the balance of my time tomorrow evening with one of my colleagues.  This is a timely motion in many ways.  However, it is ironic that the motion comes from the Fine Gael side of the House.  For many years the Fine Gael Party supported the ideology which is opposed to the involvement of the State in any way in building, planning, creating wealth or rescuing failed enterprises.  The philosophy of Fine Gael in relation to these areas can be summed up in the phrases &ldquo;the operation of free market forces&rdquo; or &ldquo;the survival of the fittest&rdquo;. These phrases are used frequently by this coalition Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  This philosophy led those parties, and Fine Gael in particular, to fight a rearguard action against the development of the National Development Corporation, which we insisted was a necessary instrument and tool which could be established.  They <Col N="927" /> continually sought to weaken and undermine it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that Fóir Teoranta had various periods of success from its foundation in 1973.  It was actively involved in rescuing what turned out afterwards to be viable operations.  I was personally involved in bringing industrialists to the then Minister for Finance to ask him to use the Fóir Teoranta structure to assist various companies which were temporarily in difficulty.  The Act allowed for the appointment of Fóir Teoranta directors to the boards of companies as a safeguard for the State involvement.  Fóir Teoranta's services were used almost exclusively to assist the high risk mining area and the tanning industry, which has now collapsed, although I hope it may succeed again in the Carrick-on-Suir area.  Since the Minister admits that there was a drop in the demand for Exchequer funding and that towards the end of their day Fóir Teoranta were in a position to repay the Exchequer, why was it necessary to abolish them?  One can only assume that they were abolished in 1987 by the minority Fianna Fáil Government in order to save money and because Fianna Fáil had become infected with the philosophy of free market economies.  They admitted only recently that the free market economy has not always worked.  The Minister for Finance has on numerous occasions repeated the view that if the proper environment for industrial development is created jobs will follow.  Unfortunately our experience is that the private sector is very slow to create manufacturing jobs, even when market conditions and economic environment are right and the tax regime is to their benefit.  It is because of this reluctance on the part of the private sector that the free market philosophy has been proved to be ineffective.  The private sector is primarily interested in profits, not in people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are important to the creation of wealth and profits.  It is imperative that our people have gainful employment and that the State be used as an engine to create that employment within its own <Col N="928" /> resources, with a payback to the State and a saving in the Exchequer funding of social welfare.  We must end the trauma of emigration and all the other scourges which follow the loss of jobs in industry. This Government must come to grips with the reality that the free market philosophy has not been successful.  The level of unemployment must be embarrassing for this Government as it is for Members of this House.  It is so unacceptable that we voted with the Government today to ensure the setting up of an employment committee in the hope that our combined efforts can produce some ideas and some understanding of how jobs can be created.  The State should have a role to play in that process.</P>
    <P>Following the 1989 election and the formation of this new coalition Government they took the next logical step in fiscal rectitude, in terms of their own philosophy, by abolishing the National Development Corporation.  The Fine Gael Party shed some crocodile tears but both decisions fitted in neatly with the prevailing philosophy of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats. The net effect of both these changes was that two very valuable mechanisms were removed from the economy.  The first, Fóir Teoranta, enabled the State where necessary to step in with an injection of capital and very often with an injection of new management when enterprises got into difficulties. Fóir Teoranta prolonged the life of a great many enterprises and enabled others to put themselves on a permanently sound footing.  The other mechanism, the National Development Corporation, enabled the State to inject venture capital into enterprises that were getting off the ground.  In the correlation of the private and public sectors in this mixed economy NADCORP was the catalyst.  That body during their relatively short life, even with the constraints under which they operated, were directly responsible for the creation of several thousand jobs.  Both these bodies were seen by us as useful tools of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that Fine Gael <Col N="929" /> have not chosen in this motion to call for the restoration of both Fóir Teoranta and NADCORP.  However, to do that would be to admit their mistakes as well as to criticise the Government's mistakes. The reality is that we need venture capital in our economy.  We need a source of funding which is clearly based on the notion of risk.</P>
    <P>The strength of NADCORP, and indeed of Fóir Teoranta, in their day was that they made investments with the prospect of a realistic return in the medium term rather than in the short term, a policy favoured by most capitalists. In an economy where greed for the quick buck is too often a feature, it is essential that there be agencies that are prepared to take reasonable risks in the interests of job creation, and are prepared to wait for a slower return on their investment.  However, very few capitalists want to do this.  The State has a responsibility in the overall economic development of the country, particularly in terms of job creation and the benefit that accrues to the economy from that, to, with reasonable risk, wait for a slower return on their investment.  That was the whole philosophy behind Fóir Teoranta and the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>We all know, for example, that there are vast areas of Irish industry which are totally under-developed as a result of a lack of slight risk capital.  The food industry is an outstanding example.  That industry, particularly the beef industry, is going through a crisis.  Forestry is another example of an area of slow return, but it is of major benefit in the long term to the economy and to the country as a whole. It is impossible to develop areas like these if the emphasis is only on a quick return for capital invested.  Similarly, it is impossible to develop areas like these if there is not a medium term co-ordinated planned approach, which the Labour Party advocate in their industrial policy.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting to tot up the number of jobs lost since Fóir Teoranta were abolished.  The Minister talked about the achievements of this body in the past but he did not quantify <Col N="930" /> what has happened since their abolition. Things have changed drastically for the worse since Fóir Teoranta were abolished two or three years ago.  It would be interesting to know the amount of social welfare that has been paid out since the agency were abolished.  If people are working they are not dependent on State agencies for social welfare and other subsistence allowances.  It would also be interesting to count the number of people who have emigrated since the abolition of Fóir Teoranta.  Of course, no one can argue that all those jobs, all that social welfare expenditure and all that emigration could have been prevented if Fóir Teoranta had been saved and allowed to function, even in the restricted way in which they did function but nobody can deny that they would have been able to play a significant role in some of the closures that have taken place in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>With so much economic catastrophe at present, with businesses closing down throughout the country, non-one can deny that there is a role for a State agency, properly structured and financed. United Meat Packers, referred to by the Minister, were cited by us in the debate on that debacle as a very good example of a company that could have been saved by Fóir Teoranta.  That is the kind of industry where detailed examination could have taken place as a precursor to rescue rather than a precursor to asset stripping, which is possibly going on in these factories throughout the country.  I hope that the efforts of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, together with those of the farming organisations, will ensure that the limited powers available to the Minister under present legislation are used for the benefit of suppliers to these factories.  If that is done confidence will be restored in the factories and in the success of the beef industry which is a very important part of the food sector.  During the crisis in UMP there was no State agency to tide them over, though they had available to them the markets, expert employees and the natural product.  That company could have been a success if the State was in <Col N="931" /> a position, through legislation, to assist them by way of an injection of capital.</P>
    <P>With every day the bank strike continues the possibility increases that a large number of businesses, particularly small businesses, will need to be rescued when the strike is over, particularly if it is prolonged and if greater efforts are not made to bring the two sides together.  The only mechanism that exists under law appears to be the mechanism of examinership. There have been many examples in the recent past of how limited and, at times, questionable that approach has been.  It is worth pointing out that in the debate that took place in this House when Fóir Teoranta were being wound up the Labour Party pointed out, as can be checked from the records, that the examinership procedure would be almost the only alternative.  At that time NADCORP were still in place.  In that debate we said:</P>
    <P>Examinerships will not meet the needs of the kind of companies that Fóir Teoranta catered for.  What Fóir Teoranta were doing was different.  It was much more practical and produced much more immediate results; most notably, it preserved people's jobs and kept the factory wheels turning.  We can set up all the court examiner procedures we like, and it may hold up the creditors from suing, but one thing it will not do is provide an injection of one penny of funds.</P>
    <P>How true was that prediction.  The abolition of Fóir Teoranta, especially when coupled with the later abolition of NADCORP, meant in effect that there was no organisation, company, bank, examiner or any other body in existence to meet the need that arises when a company goes into crisis.  With the right kind of handling, advice and subsistence from the State many companies could survive and prosper again.  For such companies now there is only the receiver or the liquidator and for the employees of these companies there is nothing but redundancy, unemployment, emigration and <Col N="932" /> eviction, as can be seen on a daily basis in our constituencies.</P>
    <P>In an era when we have the highest unemployment in Europe it is a scandal that the machinery which should be available to the State has been deliberately allowed to erode.  No responsible businessman would think it sensible to remove the safety mechanisms from the machines on his factory floor, but the Government's abolition of these two agencies is precisely that &mdash; the removal of two useful and valuable pieces of equipment from the wealth-creating sector of our economy.  That is a tragedy and for that reason the Labour Party will support the motion tabled by Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it perfectly clear that I fully support the concept of clean production, which is why I introduced an amendment to section 50 at an earlier stage.  By these amendments the Deputy is seeking to achieve an idealistic and noble state.  I compliment him on that, but it is not practical.  It is not possible to provide the kind of facilities that we require for our ordinary, everyday needs in a way and in <Col N="934" /> an atmosphere that avoids the production of hazardous waste.  Therefore, until such time as we have developed technologies, internationally or nationally, to ensure that we can have clean production it would not be possible to accept what Deputy Garland seeks to introduce here, albeit desirable.  Ireland is a net importer of technologies and is very dependent on development elsewhere.  To my knowledge there is nowhere in the world that can provide the required industries and the kind of resources produced by those industries without the generation of dangerous and hazardous wastes.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Bill it is clear that the agency, in their licensing functions and so on, will have to take into account the effect on the environment and will seek as far as possible the elimination, abatement and reduction of pollution.  The Bill is comprehensive in that regard.</P>

I seek to simply modify the power the Minister seeks to give herself by requiring consultation with the agency in any revocation or amendment she proposes to the Schedules.

      <P>As I explained on Committee Stage the circumstances described in this amendment are quite clearly covered in the generality of section 8 (1). Section 8 (2) deals only with circumstances in which other persons may be implicated.  I am also advised that adoption of the proposed amendment could give rise to further complications from a prosecution point of view in that it would have to be proved to the satisfaction of the court that an offence took place without the knowledge or consent of the body corporate.

    <P>We had a long discussion on this matter on Committee Stage when some Deputies sought to remove the monetary sum and others sought to retain it but also to ensure that the court took into account the risk or damage caused to the environment.  I gave an undertaking that I would table an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.  This amendment covers the matters without excluding the possibility <Col N="938" /> of a significant fine being imposed when there is no damage caused but when there is, for example, gross negligence.</P>
    <P>If the amendment in Deputy Gilmore's name were adopted it would result in no fine being imposed if there was no damage caused.  Obviously if there has been negligence, a fine should be imposed and, where damage has been caused, that too should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. We had a long discussion on Committee Stage on the type of penalty that should be imposed on a very serious polluter. In a number of incidents around the world in recent years horrendous damage was done to the environment, and the clean-up costs were such that even a figure of £10 million, which seems a sum sufficiently large to cover every eventuality, might not be sufficient.  I am thinking of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> experience and others.  The form of words now proposed by the Minister of State constitutes an improvement.  It is fair to suggest that an act of negligence should be taken into account rather than having to adopt the terms of Deputy Gilmore's amendment. I welcome the Minister's move towards the impassioned arguments advanced by this side of the House on Committee Stage and support her amendment.</P>

Unfortunately, Deputy Gilmore cannot be present and I am substituting for him at short notice.  He is endeavouring to address the classic issue of oil spillages around our coast when, time and time again the question arises of who will foot the bill, the relevant local authority or the polluter.

      <P>In page 13, line 39, to delete &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (1), the&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;The&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The import of these amendments is to deal with the provisions of section 11 and the agencies that may prosecute an offender.  First the primacy of the Environmental Protection Agency must be copper-fastened.  Certainly we would want to do that.  Section 11 (1) declares that the agency will prosecute.  Obviously, the Environmental Protection Agency will be the prime agency, but section 11 (2) gives power to the Minister, by way of regulation, to specify other persons, including herself to prosecute.</P>
      <P>The first thing I wish to achieve in these amendments is to underscore clearly that, in all circumstances&mdash;except exceptional ones which do not readily come to mind &mdash; the agency should institute such prosecution.  Second, in terms of the language used, notwithstanding section 11 (1), the reference to the agency is a duplication leading to rather difficult and awkward English which emanates occasionally from the draftman's office. Deleting &ldquo;notwithstanding subsection (1) the&rdquo;&mdash; which clearly gives the agency power to prosecute &mdash; and the words, &ldquo;and the Agency&rdquo; from the last line of the subsection saves a certain amount of duplication and, I humbly contend, is more readable English.</P>

    <P>I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 32.  Although the agency will be the primary body to deal with summary prosecutions, other authorities will have responsibilities and prosecution powers, for example, local authorities will have responsibilities in relation to the noise <Col N="941" /> regulations to be introduced; other bodies may be responsible for genetically modified organisms.  This is why it is necessary to retain the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding subsection (1)&rdquo;.  It is also my intention to make the legislation as clear and concise as possible.

Although we are making more substantial progress than I expected, I still do no want to waste time.  I believe the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding subsection (1)&rdquo; is irrelevant.  Subsection (1) provides that: &ldquo;An offence under this Act may be prosecuted summarily by the agency&rdquo;. My amendment proposes that subsection (2) should simply read: &ldquo;The Minister may, by regulations,...&rdquo;.  I believe the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding subsection (1)&rdquo; is redundant.

      <P>My amendments Nos. 34 and 38 arise from amendments proposed to this section on Committee Stage and will give effect to the spirit of those amendments. These amendments will allow the agency, where they believe that evidence in relation to an offence may be removed or destroyed, to apply to the District Court for a warrant authorising entry to any premises, including a private dwelling, without first having to be refused entry or, in the case of a private dwelling, without having to give 24 hours notice of his intention.  I believe my amendments meet the aims of all the other amendments to this section with one exception, that is, amendment No. 37.  The power being accorded to the Minister under this amendment would be too wide.  I have raised this matter with the Attorney General and he would not be willing to consider such a wide-ranging provision without a full list of the relevant enactments and the functions under these enactments to be given to an authorised officer first being set out.  Even if he approved the provision, which is far from likely, a schedule of the enactments and functions would have to be incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We need to address a number of issues in this debate as each amendment has a different import which needs to be taken into account.  Therefore, I will go through the amendments one by one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> Amendment No. 35 seeks to insert after the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or under and in accordance with a warrant of the District Court&rdquo;.  It is clear from section 13 (2) as it stands that the authorised person would have to give 24 hours notice in writing before he would have the power to enter a private dwelling.  We believe that provision is far too restrictive. If the District Court gives a person the power to enter a premises, that should supersede the provision of having to give 24 hours notice.  This would be an improvement to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister believes the powers proposed in amendment No. 37 are too broad and that the authority under this legislation should not be given to authorised individuals to act in regard to other environmental legislation.  If the Attorney General has a difficulty with this proposal the enactments can be specified.  I am anxious to ensure that the authority we give to people to act in accordance with this legislation should also apply to other relevant and linked environmental legislation passed by these Houses in recent years. If it is acceptable for a person, by regulation, to have authority to act under this legislation surely it is acceptable to give them the same authority in relation to other linked legislation which is designed to protect the environment.  I do not understand the logic of the case put forward by the Minister or the difficulties the Attorney General has in regard to this proposal.  As I said, if necessary, we can specify the other pollution Acts which have been passed by this House in recent years.  I would be loath to have my amendment dismissed because of a lack of specificity in relation to particular enactments.  Perhaps the Minister would consider putting down an amendment specifying the enactments, if she agreed with the principle of it.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 39 seeks to amend section 13 (6) by providing that: &ldquo;Where an authorised person in the exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises or from exercising any other powers...&rdquo;.  The extra <Col N="944" /> clout proposed in my amendment would apply not only to the barring of entry to a premises but to preventing an authorised person from exercising other powers conferred on him under this legislation.  This would give the officer acting for the agency under this legislation additional powers and scope which are warranted and necessary rather than simply confine him to the authority to enter premises.  I ask the Minister to reply to this point. Assuming my amendment No. 39 is accepted section 13 (6) would provide that: &ldquo;Where an authorised person in the exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises, or from exercising any other power, the authorised person or the person by whom he was appointed may apply to the District Court...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 40 proposes to insert the words &ldquo;without notice to any other person&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo;, while amendment No. 41 proposes to insert the words &ldquo;and the Court may grant such a warrant&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;entry&rdquo;.  If all my amendments were accepted section 13 (6) would read as follows:</P>
    <P>Where an authorised person in the exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises, or from exercising any other power, the authorised person or the person by whom he was appointed may apply to the District Court without notice to any other person for a warrant authorising such entry and the Court may grant such a warrant.</P>
    <P>I wish to go through these amendments again in order of importance.  I am advised that it is necessary to be specific when giving power to the District Court to issue such a warrant.  Maybe the Minister thinks I am being over-specific but I am advised it is necessary.  Maybe she will give her legal advice on this point.  I am sure she would not disagree with the need to give power to a person designated under this Bill to do more than simply enter a premises.  If they are obstructed from exercising any other power under <Col N="945" /> the Bill it should be the subject of an application to the District Court also.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 40 proposes to insert the words &ldquo;without notice to any other person&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo;, so that there will not be any difficulty in achieving an authorisation from the court because of a lack of consultation.  It would be specific and clear in the legislation that notice would not be required to be given to any person.  If that was not spelt out in clear detail there might be some complication or difficulty in the District Court issuing such a warrant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that her amendments adequately covered amendment No. 36, but that is not the case. We are concerned about the powers of authorised persons.  In law at present a private dwelling is protected and nobody has the right to enter unless a search warrant is obtained.  Usually the Garda would carry out the necessary investigations inside the house and our amendment seeks to insert &ldquo;except where the authorised person has obtained a warrant from a court to enter the dwelling without prior notice&rdquo;....  There might be occasions when the authorities might not wish to give prior notice, the element of surprise might be required.  It could also be the case there might not be anybody in occupation in the dwelling house in question or it might be difficult to get someone to answer a knock on the door. It is important that the due processes of law are gone through.  Instead of just bursting through doors and gaining entry that way, they should have a court warrant.</P>
      <P>As I said, there are occasions when you may not wish to inform anybody of your intention to enter a dwelling and to investigate what is going on in a dwelling house the person making the approach should have a warrant.  The Minister has not adequately covered that element by her amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore because it is a good one.  Is the Minister <Col N="946" /> trying to cover a point of principle of law? If not, will she accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment?  I can visualise a situation where some form of pollution is being caused from within a private dwelling.  I could cite a couple of cases in my own constituency.  If 24 hours' notice is to be given the offending cause could be removed until the inspector had made his call and, as soon as he left, could be reinstated.  If Deputy Gilmore's amendment is not accepted there will be a significant gap in the legislation through which a coach and four could be driven by some difficult residents or an individual. In one of the oldest parts of the city, Stoneybatter, there are piggeries within private dwellings which pollute the whole neighbourhood but we have been unable to do anything about them although people have to live next door to them.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment would ensure that this sort of thing would be stopped once and for all.  The stench certainly pollutes the air and there may be other health risks.</P>

      <P>My amendment does that but does not require the presence of a member of the Garda Síochána.  My amendment No. 38 would mean that section 13 (6) reads: &ldquo;where an authorised person in the exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises, or where after he has reason to believe that evidence <Col N="947" /> related to a suspected offence under this Act may be removed or destroyed, the authorised person or the person by whom he has been appointed may apply to the District Court for a warrant authorising such entry&rdquo;. Obviously if he has reason to believe that the giving of the notice will have the evidence removed then he does not require to give the notice and he can go to the court to get a warrant.  That covers what the Deputies seek and it is wider than Deputy Gilmore's amendment which restricts that part, to be given only in the context of the authorised officer being accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  That is not necessary in all situations, in the vast majority of cases it would be a burden on the Garda which they do not require and which is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I thought I had replied to them in my initial comments.  In regard to amendment No. 41, it is obvious that discretion for granting a warrant lies with the District Court.  I do not think there is any need to state it.  The Bill is quite clear that the authorised person can apply to the District Court for a warrant and obviously if a warrant is applied for the court will make the decision.  We do not need to state the obvious.</P>

      <P>I am advised that there is no need for that.  I took advice on amendment No. 37 and the Attorney General was quite clear that any other acts covered by this Bill would have to be specified because it would be unsatisfactory not to do so.  The Deputy is trying to cover a situation in relation to an inquiry where the agency would be called in or the Government of the day may decide that the agency would be the body to carry out the inquiry.  We may deal with this if we get to the section dealing with inquiries later on but, <Col N="948" /> obviously, those powers exist, not just in relation to this Bill but also in relation to the legislation which established tribunals of inquiry.  Obviously it is open to the Minister, in consultation with any other Minister, to add to the Second Schedule of other Acts to which this Bill may refer.  It is not necessary, therefore, to accept Deputy Howlin's amendment.</P>

Of course that is the tendency in regard to environmental health officers visiting restaurants and hotel kitchens where they tell them a week in advance that they intend to call.  If you give a person notice he or she knows that you are alerted and we are anxious that there should be an element of surprise in these cases.  We were anxious to have an element of surprise, that it would be a matter of getting a court warrant and then entering the premises and surprising the occupant.

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 33 and 34 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" />&ldquo;(d) a senior member of one of the third-level environmental studies faculties within the State,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are now into uncharted territory so perhaps we will go a little slower.  My amendment refers to section 21 which deals with the appointment of the director general, and more particularly with the committee set up to appoint the director general.  In the section, a list is given of the bodies who will comprise the committee. In my amendment I seek to substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) a senior member of one of the third-level environmental studies faculties within the State,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>for &ldquo;the Managing Director of the Industrial Development Authority,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The composition of the committee set up under this section is totally unbalanced. Three of its six members are Government or semi-State employees, for example, the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and the Managing Director of the Industrial Development Authority. The Minister and her Department claim that this agency will be independent. The Minister's definition of &ldquo;independent&rdquo; suggests that she knows as much about the English language as she does about the commitment to environmental protection and ecological sustainability.  It is totally unacceptable that this committee, which excludes representatives from consumer, agriculture, tourism and fishing bodies, the Confederation of Irish Industry and, most importantly, environmental organisations, provides that the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority has the automatic right to a place and inevitably a major input into the role of supplying lists from which the Minister appoints the directors.</P>
    <P>The IDA should have no influence whatsoever in this committee and absolutely no influence in the make-up of any committee attached to this agency.  The IDA are ten years behind contemporary Irish life and half a century behind in environmental awareness.  How can the <Col N="953" /> Minister possibly have an organisation like the IDA on the board of an independent environmental body when they are pro-development, pro-industry and represent everything that is anathema to environmental policy?  Politically, the Industrial Development Authority should not be let next or near the Environmental Protection Agency. There is no one in the IDA with an ounce of environmental sense or who knows anything about the environment.</P>

      <P>Earlier this afternoon I had the pleasure of listening to Deputy Garland's contribution on the establishment of an employment committee and I must say that it qualified for one of the most remarkable contributions made in this House for a long time, equalled perhaps only by the one we have just heard, because it is very much on the same theme.  Earlier this afternoon Deputy Garland began his contribution by making a defence of the Luddites and he has continued on the same theme in this contribution.</P>
      <P>In general, I believe the principle being established in this section is good and that the directors of a State agency are to be appointed some committee outside the party political domain should be established to recommend the names of the potential appointees.  I would have some criticism of the way it is being done in the section.  For example, the committee should recommend the names in order of preference and there is probably too much discretion given to the Minister to ignore the committee's recommendations.  I have some slight worries about the composition of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could all come up with our six favourite constituencies from which the six members of this committee could be drawn.  The idea of involving the Council for the Status of Women, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, An Taisce and the Department of the Environment is perfectly correct.  Involving the Industrial Development Authority is giving a weight to a particular sector of Irish economic life that is unwarranted.  The Industrial <Col N="954" /> Development Authority have a remit for the promotion of manufacturing industry.  Clearly there is a particular interest on the part of the Industrial Development Authority to promote manufacturing industry and there are occasions when the promotion of manufacturing industry comes into conflict with protection of the environment.  It would be far better if the wider business-industrial-employment area was given representation.  I do not often argue for representation for the Federation of Irish Employers but I think it would make more sense if the balancing representation to the Congress of Trade Unions were through the normal social partner area rather than through the Industrial Development Authority.  The Industrial Development Authority have a particular role to play in Irish life, which is to promote Irish industry. Obviously, they will want to get the quickest and shortest possible way of promoting industry.  It would be a better and safer method if the Federation of Irish Employers were involved since they would have a wider remit than the IDA who are purely concerned with manufacturing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Any examination of their record and the amount of money spent over the last ten years will show that they have been an abysmal failure. They are great at promoting their own image.  This is not the first occasion I have said that in this House; I recall in 1979 referring to the artificial figures for job creation announced every year with absolute credulity by the newspapers.  I contested them in this House.  I have no remit for the Industrial Development Authority and I agree that the managing <Col N="955" /> director of the Industrial Development Authority should be deleted from this list of people.  I am proposing also that the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women be deleted and substituted by the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency which has a more direct and appropriate relationship. The specific job of the Employment Equality Agency is to ensure that women get an equal chance in these appointments. That is the reason I propose that the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency be substituted in place of the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women.</P>
      <P>I am also proposing in amendment No. 49 that we add to the list the chairpersons of two other national organisations concerned with the protection of the environment.  One of the extraordinary things about this list is that other than the chairperson of An Taisce &mdash; out of six &mdash; that is the only one who can be said to belong to an organisation directly concerned with the environment.  That is unbalanced in my view and I hope the Minister will see fit to accept my amendment.</P>
      <P>I have serious reservations about the matter of appointments.  The trend and fashion is to remove from political influence these sorts of appointments.  In reality, just like Mr. Justice O'Hanlon, none of these people is answerable to the electorate.  At least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite right, a Cheann Comhairle, and I apologise.  It is a great thing now to take these appointments out of the political spectrum but that means we are removing them from answerability to the people.  We are diminishing the power of our people.  One of my criticisms of this legislation generally and, indeed, much of the legislation we pass in this House is that we are removing power and influence from people especially over local matters.  That is why <Col N="956" /> I argued strongly on Committee Stage in relation to the licensing procedure that it be done centrally rather than locally.</P>
      <P>In section 21 &mdash; to which these amendments relate &mdash; we are proposing a mould of appointment which is all very fine Dublin 4 stuff &mdash; but it will remove power from the elected representatives of the people and, thereby, from the people.  I have serious reservations about this trend.  In my view it is much better that we have clear political appointments and that the politicians who make those appointments are answerable to the people if things go wrong.  Here nobody is responsible.  If things go wrong and if there has been a disastrous appointment of a director general, because of this ménage-type of committee, nobody is responsible and the Minister can wash her hands of the appointment.  The matter could drift for years and we could find ourselves in an impossible situation.  However, in saying those few words I hope, even though the Minister did not accept my amendment on Committee Stage, she may consider it appropriate to do so now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

      <P>First, I disagree fundamentally with Deputy Mitchell.  The establishment of such a committee to short list recommendations for the Minister to appoint is a welcome trend and should be followed in all similar public offices.  Frankly, there is no record to support the contention that the politicising of offices is a good trend, the record is the reverse.  The number of bad appointments to State boards over decades by Governments of all political hues and which allowed practices to go on, without checking them, are testimony to the need for change.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the trend in this legislation in that it is not simply political friends of the Minister who are appointed, where if one slapped the right backs at the right time one could expect <Col N="957" /> to get the job later on.  That sort of situation obtained for too long in this country and I am afraid the consequences across the economy are visible from that clientist-shoneen type of politics.  I am glad we are moving away from it and the quicker the better.  I do not think those appointees were accountable because they were appointed by a Minister.  When names of people of exceptional ability were handed around, because they were not the right colour at the right time they were excluded from appointment.  It was regarded as a weakness to appoint somebody of the wrong political colour.  The move away from that type of appointment is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In relation to the actual listing of people who will make up this committee the Minister has done a good job.  I support the inclusion of most of the people suggested.  Mention has been made of the Industrial Development Authority.  I am no great fan of the IDA.  God knows I have criticised them often enough.  The green flat earthism we have heard twice today in this House does no service to the cause of trying to create jobs in this country.  The 300,000 people out there who are looking for jobs will thank us in no small way when we talk in jocose or simple terms of technology being bad in the most basic and luddite of terms which is patent and absurd nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I once heard Deputy Garland's solution to the job creation problem in this country. He put it so forcibly that if we all had half a job we would have twice as many jobs.  He did not mention, of course, that we would all have half pay as well.  That sort of simplistic nonsense does not substitute for thoughtful and rational policy. We could all come forward with additional people whom we would consider appropriate in relation to this panel of selection.  I am happy enough with the Minister of State's list and have not suggested anyone else.  However, I raised an eyebrow, in looking at the amendments <Col N="958" /> tabled, when I noted that the Democratic Left were suggesting that the chief executive of the Federation of Irish Employers should be included but I am sure there is great merit in this suggestion.</P>
      <P>I am tempted to support the Fine Gael suggestion that the chairpersons of two national organisations concerned with the protection of the environment should be included.  While the notion that the only environmental organisation that should be represented is An Taisce is insufficient the Fine Gael amendment is too vague.  It would need to specify the organisations because who would determine which two national organisations should be given this important role?  It would be necessary to specify the two organisations so that we could discuss the merits or demerits of their involvement.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to take issue with the Ceann Comhairle my amendment has nothing to do with the committee who will make the selection.  Amendment No. 50 deals with something quite different.  It seeks to ensure that the director general, once appointed, would be made an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the board of the Industrial Development Authority.  There is a concern that at times industrial policy is at variance with proper environmental policy.  Part of the reason for putting legislation such as this in place is to set out a framework under which industrial policy would advance.  It would be a great advantage if the person whom we consider to be suitable to steer this agency was also given a role in relation to industrial policy.  That person should be on the board of directors of the Industrial Development Authority to ensure they take into account the views of the agency in coming to any decision.  In this respect the IDA would be coupled in a tangible way with the progressive work of the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to policy formulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I said I saw a great future for this country with regard to green technology.  Jobs could be created in the food processing sector based on purity, quality and pollutant free foods.  We need not be afraid of this.  We can lay down the most stringent <Col N="959" /> standards and they will be both positive and beneficial even in relation to job creation.  This link should be made and I exhort the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 50 so that it can be made in a tangible way.  We should not just be aspirational.  I hope the Minister of State will accept the logic behind this suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Each person who sets out to draw up an appropriate selection committee would probably come up with a similar list of people but perhaps different organisations.  If I had suggested some of those proposed in the amendments rather than the ones I mentioned I would probably have got some of the people I listed but, perhaps, this is normal in looking seriously and aggressively at legislation of this kind which is the function of Deputies.</P>
      <P>I was keen to ensure that the director general and directors would be appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the selection committee and that that selection committee would be as broadly based as possible.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, we are not picking a group of environmentalists to review licences, issues new licences or to carry out a whole host of tasks which are being provided for in this legislation. What we are doing is choosing a director general and a full-time board of directors who will be given a very important role and function in relation to the way the agency will operate.  They will be the governing body of this agency on a full-time basis and will fulfil an important function in relation to licensing.  I said on Committee Stage that some of them will have to have particular expertise.  In addition, they will need management skills and be capable of making decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I set out to choose an appropriate selection committee almost every group that one could imagine lobbied to be included.  Initially, I have to admit that instead of including the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority I considered including the chief executive of the Conferderation of <Col N="960" /> Irish Industry.  At that time I was lobbied by the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, by the representatives of farmers' groups and a host of other people.  I decided, rather than choose one group to represent industry from FICI, the CII and the Federation of Irish Employers, who, in fairness, I have to admit did not lobby me, that it would be much more appropriate to pick the Industrial Development Authority because they have responsibility for the development of industry, including agriculture and the sectors covered by the CII and FICI.  I felt for that reason it would be more appropriate to pick the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority.  In addition, the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority is accustomed to assessing management skills and making decisions in relation to the appointment of staff and so on.  He is also a person who is at the forefront with regard to the formulation of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I should add, in response to Deputies Mitchell and Garland, that so far as environmental matters are concerned if an inappropriate industry locates here this is not the fault of the Industrial Development Authority.  If our planning and permit procedures are not satisfactory that is the fault of our legislation and controls rather than the fault of the body charged with the task of aggressively selling Ireland and promoting industrial development.</P>
    <P>I do not accept for one moment that we must encourage industry to locate here at any price; it is not a policy to seek jobs for the sake of them.  Environmental considerations are of the utmost importance in deciding whether an industry is acceptable. The people who will make the decisions and lay down the controls and regulations under which that industry will have to operate are not the Industrial Development Authority but either the local authorities, An Bord Pleanála and now, in relation to licences, the Environmental Protection Agency.  I believe they are the appropriate body so far as environmental standards are concerned.</P>
    <P>My decision to appoint the Secretary <Col N="961" /> to the Government and the Secretary to the Department of the Environment was questioned.  It is normal practice in appointing selection committees &mdash; this applies in the case of An Bord Pleanála &mdash; to include the Secretary of the Department of the Environment.  The reason I included the Secretary to the Government is that that is the kind of person involved in TLAC.  Since that body were established, they have worked well and many brighter and younger civil servants have been promoted.  The traditional practice whereby one serves out one's time and one will get to the top does not necessarily apply any longer.  The TLAC have worked extremely well and are seen to be fair and above board.</P>
    <P>Many young civil servants who have not been there that long have been given the opportunity to go right to the top of Government Departments.  In recent years a large number of younger civil servants were appointed to management positions at both Assistant Secretary and Secretary level.  Their experience will be invaluable in making recommendations to Government in relation to the appointment of the director general and directors.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I was keen to ensure that workers in industry would be represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and it is appropriate, therefore, that the general secretary of that body should be involved in the selection committee.  We will have succeeded in relation to the environment when we have trade unionists, industrialists and farmers who are environmentalists.  If we keep having this matter off to environmental organisations only we will never succeed.  It is important, therefore, that the representative of workers, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, should be involved.</P>
    <P>About two years ago the Irish Congress of Trade Unions produced an excellent position paper on the environment. They are concerned, are pro-active in relation to environmental matters and are constantly in consultation with Government Departments in relation to environmental issues.  It is wrong to <Col N="962" /> assume that because somebody is an official of a trade union that their whole concern is the pay and conditions of their workers.  They have a wider brief that they exercise all the time, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women on this selection committee is significant.  It is the first time, to the best of my knowledge, that a representative of women's organisations and women's point of view has been specifically written into legislation. One of the reasons women do not make it to top decision-making positions in this country is that they are not there at the selection stage.  The chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women is, I believe, a more appropriate inclusion on the selection committee than the chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency.  However, one could argue that it is six of one and half a dozen of the other.  Both groups are obviously concerned about equality, about ensuring that women have equal opportunities in employment and a fair chance of getting on to key decision-making bodies. Because the council is an umbrella for a whole host of different organisations, including women who are not involved in employment at all, and who might never become the concern of an employment equality agency because they are in the home and are not, according to our definition of work, gainfully employed, they are more representative of such women than the Employment Equality Agency.  However, I accept that the important thing is to have a representative of the female point of view on this committee.</P>
    <P>Some environmental organisations did not wish to be involved in the select committee. They do not want to take part in a State board or a body that has to do with Government policy on any legislation that might be passed by the Oireachtas.  Their view is that it might prejudice their independence.  That was the view expressed to me by Greenpeace. If one accepts Deputy Mitchell's definition, there are not that many nationally organised general environmental protection <Col N="963" /> organisations.  Many of them have a specific role in relation to a clearly defined area of the environment.  The one with the widest brief, the longest experience, that is beter organised nationally and that is more involved in the kind of activities that this agency would be involved in, is An Taisce.  That is why An Taisce is included.  They are also the prescribed body for the purposes of the Planning Acts and are known to be a very responsible environmental organisation.  That is not to say that some of the others are not.</P>
    <P>At one stage it was suggested to me that the Green Party should be involved in the selection committee.  A political party would be a most inappropriate representative to have on a selection committee of this kind, even if it was the Green Party.  Deputy Garland did not seek to have the Green Party included, so I presume that is no longer the policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Howlin's amendment that the chief executive would be <i>ex officio</i> on the board of the IDA, I thought initially that it was not such a bad idea.  However, on further consideration I think it would prejudice the work of the director general if he were to be involved in the IDA.  It has been said that one of the difficulties for local authorities is that there is a conflict between their developmental role and their responsibilities in relation to environmental protection and legislation. The same might apply if the director general were involved in the IDA. The IDA is the primary body involved in industrial development.  If the director general were to be <i>ex officio</i> on the board he would be privy to the IDA's views and policies on new development in Ireland. He would then, in his capacity as director general, be involved in licensing, controlling and, therefore, monitoring these activities, and it would be undesirable, from the point of view of the independence of the agency and would certainly lead to some confusion and probably some concern on the part of the public at large.  If the director general were involved and some controversial <Col N="964" /> proposal that had been brought in by the IDA got a licence, many people might question whether the decision was made independently.  However, in principle it is a good thing, certainly in relation to the board of the IDA, that there would be on that board and on State boards generally people who are concerned with environmental protection.  Just as we need to involve industry and farming organisations in environmental matters, we need to involve environmentalists in industry, agriculture and so on.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day we have chosen a selection committee that is representative and broadly-based.  Various skills and expertise will be brought together.  People from different backgrounds will bring their differing experiences to it.  The composition of the selection committee is comprehensive.  It is generous to all the concerns that had to be taken on board.  It involves the main sector of Irish life in the selection process. Industry is represented; workers are represented. Government are represented by the Secretary of a Department and the Secretary to the Government; the public service is represented by two individuals in senior ranking positions; An Taisce are represented and the women's point of view is represented.  I am not at liberty, and it would not be desirable to exclude anybody that I have proposed in this Bill. Neither would it be desirable at this late stage to extend the selection committee. It would be quite unwieldy and very difficult for it to operate if there were eight people on the selection committee.  I envisage that as many as possible of the selection committee would be involved in the interviews.  To be interviewed by six people is fairly adequate, but if that were extended to eight it would become unwieldy.  I have tried to keep the selection committee as small but as broadly-based as possible.  I think on balance we have got it right.  It has been generally acceptable, as far as I can see, to most people I have discussed it with.  Some people might argue as to who should be on the committee but nobody has argued against including the representatives that have been included here.</P>

      <P>This debate has been broadened to include Luddites, jobs and job sharing.  I did not seek to widen it but I would like to nail Deputy Howlin's assertion very firmly.  I have never, either in this House or outside it, suggested that everyone should work a 20 hour week with a corresponding reduction in pay.  That is not Green Party policy.  I did refer to job sharing as one of the methods of solving our unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>I tried to get an overview of this debate in section 21 (2).

      <P>Indeed.  The Minister made a side swipe at me when she spoke of the need to have people other than environmentalists on the committee.  I do not think anybody referred to that.  I think we are all quite happy to have the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, the Secretary of the ICTU and so forth.  I do not think anyone is suggesting anything other than that it must be broader based.  What the Minister is trying to do here is to in put a trade union person on the one hand and put in a counterweight by having somebody from industry on the other and that is a very good concept, bearing in mind the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude that is a reality of life in industry at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell agrees with me in regard to the managing director of the IDA not being a member.  Unfortunately, <Col N="966" /> Deputies Gilmore and Howlin have a touching faith in the ability of this organisation who have proved themselves to have created 7,000 jobs in the last 11 years at a cost of £500,000 per job, who have shown extremely poor negotiating skills with their efforts to get Merrell Down into a green field site in Cork. These are the people whom the Minister feels have the management skills to be involved in the selection procedure for the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I do not share the touching faith of the Deputies and the Minister.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that we do not want the managing director of the IDA to be in any way involved with this agency.  On reflection, I agree that my amendment is a little woolly and that the Fine Gael amendment is woolly in so far as it concerns the two national organisations involved with the environment.  I would have no problem with the chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency, except that it would add an extra person to the committee, and I am inclined to oppose the Fine Gael amendment on both counts.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin that amendment No. 50 should not really have been taken with this amendment because it is not related.  I agree with the Minister that the director general's appointment as an <i>ex officio</i> director of the IDA would be a great mistake and would compromise the agency.  I strongly oppose amendment No. 50.  As a compromise, will the Minister accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment to substitute the chief executive of the FIE instead of the IDA? On that basis I would be happy to withdraw my amendment.  The IDA are not the ideal people to be involved in this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In what has probably been one of the longest debates on a batch of amendments in the course of this Report Stage, we have just debated how the committee to nominate or to recommend the prospective director general and the directors of the agency are to be composed. In what was probably the longest contribution in this Report Stage debate, the Minister went to great lengths to explain why she had fixed on the six people concerned to compose this committee. Now we come to subsection (6) and this extraordinary line 27, which says that the Minister may by order amend subsection (2).  In other words, having told us why she is going to select these six people, she now has a clause in the Bill which says that having done all that, having failed to accept the compromise consensus approach suggested by Deputy Garland, she now wants to retain the right to change it by order.  The Minister in office at the moment prefers a composition in this form and another Minister might prefer a different six entirely and may by order decide to amend that.  Prior to the appointment of a director or a group of directors a Minister might for his own reasons, because he does not get the nominees he would like, from a <Col N="969" /> committee composed in this way, decide to appoint six different people.  Having decided to set down in the Bill who should compose this committee, having defended that in the course of the debate in this House, having rejected amendments and suggestions to improve or extend it, the Minister then wants to retain the right to change it herself, if the whim should take her or one of her successors.  That is an extraordinary provision. It should be deleted.  If it is not, it will undermine the general rhetoric of independence that has surrounded the approach to this Bill so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a misunderstanding about what the Minister can do here, so it is important that I intervene.  The Minister does not wish to have the sort of power Deputy Gilmore is talking about.  If an order is made under this section, it must be positively approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, otherwise it does not take effect.  What we are talking about here is changing the selection committee.  In normal circumstances the selection committee would not be changed, but an organisation might no longer exist.  For example, under the Planning Acts there are a number of bodies prescribed and one of them no longer exists, that is the National Monuments Advisory Committee. It is possible that An Taisce could decide to amalgamate with some other organisation or change their name and they might no longer exist in their present form.  It should not be necessary in that situation to bring in a Bill.  It is appropriate that the Minister should make an order which would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That guarantees the kind of independence about which Deputy Gilmore is concerned. It is being done for reasons of efficiency.  If an organisation becomes defunct, amalgamates with another or changes its name, it would be unwieldy to have to bring in legislation.  It makes far more sense to be able to change matters by a simple order which would require the approval of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I was inclined to accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment and am still so inclined.  With the greatest respect, the Minister has not stated where in the Bill it provides that such an order must be laid before both Houses.  The Minister is doing us a disservice in asking us to take this on trust.  In saying that, I intend no disrespect.  I accept that there may be changes.  The Secretary to the Government will not change.  The title of the Department of the Environment might change.  In theory an organisation like An Taisce may disappear, but I hope it never will.  Perhaps the Irish Congress of Trade Unions might disappear.  The Minister might be afraid that the committee would be unable to act in the appointment of a director general.  If so, why not accept an amendment providing that if any of these bodies should cease to exist they would be struck off the list and replaced by another body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 (3) makes the position quite clear.  It states:</P>
      <P>(3)  Where it is proposed to make an order under subsection (2) or under section 21 (6) (a), (100), 101 or 102 a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Mitchell becomes Minister, perhaps the IDA will be abolished.  I accept that Deputies do not want the Minister of the day to change the composition of the selection committee for the sake of it.  It would happen for only very good reason and with the approval of the Oireachtas.  An organisation may not necessarily cease to exist; it could amalgamate with another and become a different organisation.  The provision is designed to cover the type of difficulty which could arise.  If an organisation became defunct, another could not be nominated instead.  If An Taisce decided to amalgamate or become a different body we might not have a representative of an environmental organisation on the <Col N="971" /> selection committee.  If the Council for the Status of Women became a different body we would not be free to nominate somebody else unless we had a procedure of this kind.  That is why it is so important and subject to approval.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is a pity that the Minister when this was being drafted did not make it clear that it is designed to cover only situations where a named organisation either ceases to exist or amalgamates.  However, she has made it clear that there are two safeguards.  It applies only in situations such as I have mentioned and the order would be brought before the House for approval. In those circumstances I am prepared, somewhat reluctantly, to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with recommendations made by the committee in the nomination of a prospective director general or directors. The Committee have the power to select three candidates and to recommend them to the Minister.  The appointment is then made by the Minister.  It would be advisable if the committee were required to nominate the candidates in order of their preference.  It very often happens that, when a selection board or a committee nominate prospective candidates for appointment by a Minister or a public body, the first-named candidate is passed over, sometimes for dubious reasons.  Various factors come into play, including the candidate's political preference, the organisations to which he or she might belong and whether those organisations are open or secret.  One <Col N="972" /> secret organisation was mentioned in the course of an exchange in the House earlier.  Depending on who the Minister might be, there might be a secret society appointment taking place.  It is desirable that the preference of the committee should be clear and made publicly known so that if the Minister decides to pass over the first choice of the committee there is some good reason.  It is an important safeguard.</P>

      <P>Most of what Deputy Gilmore said is not unreasonable in that a person who is the first choice should be appointed, all things being equal.  I do not want to be accused of trying to promote members of secret organisations for appointment to the committee or to any other body.  The Top Level Appointments Committee, which has worked extremely well, and the committee for the purposes of appointing the chairman of An Bord Pleanála are the models for this selection procedure.  If we were to do what Deputy Gilmore is suggesting, the Government would be rubber stamping the selection committee.  That is not necessarily a good thing.</P>
      <P>The Government of the day make the decision on the basis of the names put before them by the committee.  The guarantee is that nobody can be appointed who is not suggested by the committee.  The committee may not want to be put in a position where they have to place candidates in order of their preference. It might be that any one of the three would be acceptable.  There might also be varying views among the members of the committee.  It is more appropriate that the committee should nominate three people and that the Government should choose between them in appointing the director general of the agency.  Because we are following established procedures I am not at liberty to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined a couple of scenarios that could arise and I would like to outline a further one, that is where the committee come to the conclusion that there is clearly one candidate of outstanding ability and merit who should be appointed to the post of director general.  As the committee are required to nominate three candidates, the Minister may decide to select one of the two lesser qualified candidates.  In those circumstances how would the committee communicate to the Minister their preference of candidate?  For example, since it is the Minister for the Environment who will make the decision will the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, who will be a member of this committee, discreetly whisper in the Minister's ear who should be appointed?  Where one of the three candidates nominated is preferred by the Secretary of the Department of the Environment &mdash; I am not suggesting that there would be anything improper in this; it would be quite normal that this might happen &mdash; but the other five members of the committee disagree with that view, the Minister will presumably take advice from the Secretary of the Department, thereby adopting a distorted view.  From the point of view of the protection of the interests of the Minister and of the Secretary of the Department, who has a double role in this regard, it is desirable that the order of preference be listed.  The Minister has rejected that approach and unless she is prepared to have a second thought on it I wish to put the amendment.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would say to Deputy Gilmore that while it is not mandatory on the committee to nominate people in order of preference they are certainly not prevented from doing so if one candidate is more outstanding than the other two.  If, as the Deputy suggested, the Secretary of the <Col N="974" /> Department of the Environment favours a candidate who is not favoured by the other five members of the committee, it is unlikely that that person would be one of the three candidates nominated.  If the committee cannot reach a consensus which would be desirable, obviously they will take a majority decision.  Therefore, if the Secretary of the Department is alone in his view as the Deputy suggested, it is unlikely that the candidate whom he favours would be nominated. The committee are free to nominate the candidates in order of preference, but it is unnecessary to put a mandatory requirement on them to do so.  As I have said, it does not apply in relation to the other procedures which seem to work well.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Notwithstanding subsection (3) or (4), if the Government decide not to appoint to be a director any of the candidates or, as the case may be, the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to a particular request</P>
      <P>(a)  the Government shall appoint a person to be a director who was among those, or as the case may be, was the candidate, selected by the committee pursuant to a previous request (if any) in relation to that appointment, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the Minister shall make a further such request to the committee and the Government shall appoint to be a director a person who was among the candidates or, as the case may be, was the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to that request or pursuant to another such request made in relation to that appointment.</P>
      <P>(6)  Notwithstanding subsection (3) or (4), if the committee is unable to select any suitable candidate pursuant to a particular request&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Government shall appoint a person to be a director who was among those, or as the case may be, was the candidate, selected by the committee pursuant to a previous request (if any) in relation to that appointment, or</P>

    <P>(b)  the Minister shall make a further such request to the committee and the Government shall appoint to be a director a person who was among the candidates or, as the case may be, was the candidate selected <Col N="976" /> by the committee pursuant to that request or pursuant to another such request made in relation to that appointment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to do what Deputy Howlin suggested on Committee Stage and what his amendment No. 57 seeks to do.  I gave a commitment that I would consider this matter and I am bringing forward this amendment to ensure consistency in the drafting of sections 21 and 24.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is honouring her commitment.  I do not have the Minister's amendment and, therefore, I am not sure what the difference is between the two amendments. I welcome the clarification of this matter which is what I sought on Committee Stage.  There was a consensus that the section, as drafted, was gobbledegook and was certainly extraordinarily difficult to follow.  There is clarity in the redrafted section, which is very much welcomed.  Perhaps the Minister, in conclusion, would indicate the differences between her amendment 56a and my amendment No. 57.</P>

      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Howlin in not having an opportunity to do his work properly on this matter.  I must put on record, as I have done time and time again, that it is absurd to take Report Stage of a Bill so soon after Committee Stage.  For example, the Official Report of some of Committee Stage is not available.  It makes nonsense of the way we conduct business in the House.  I do not know if any improvement is proposed in this regard but when considering changes in the workings of the House, we should allow for more time between the taking of Committee and Report Stages of Bills.</P>

      <P>The amendment would define the terms of office more clearly.

    <P>My amendments are designed to fulfil the intent of the Deputies' amendment No. 61, which issue was also raised on Committee Stage.  The amendments fix the membership of the advisory committee at 12, while enabling the committee to carry on their work when vacancies arise.  I think it was Deputy Gilmore who proposed a similar amendment on Committee Stage and I then undertook to come back to the House in this regard, which is what I am doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there is a problem with order here, but perhaps the Minister might raise another point of order and tell the House how many members the advisory committee will have.  My amendment on Committee Stage sought the provision of 12 members but I am not sure how many members this batch of amendments will provide.</P>

      <P>The number will be 12 except when a vacancy arises.  We want to ensure that the committee can work when a vacancy arises.  The Bill as drafted provides that the number of members of the advisory committee shall be not less than five and not more than 12.  The provision will now read:</P>
      <P>The number of members of the Advisory Committee shall be twelve, subject to subsection (II).</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 75 seeks to insert the following in page 24, between lines 47 and 48:</P>

It is confusing that the Minister is moving amendments that dovetail amendments tabled by the Opposition.  I certainly welcome and accept the provision that the advisory committee will now consist of 12 members.  My amendment No. 61 is therefore redundant in that the provision is made under the Minister's amendment No. 61.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 62, that the advisory committee may act notwithstanding a vacancy among its members, is to be substituted by another amendment, amendment No. 75.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the reason for tabling her amendments rather than accepting similar amendments already tabled.

      <P>I am completely puzzled.  The amendments relate to the director general being the chairman of the advisory committee, which issue was also debated on Committee Stage.  The Minister agreed to give some thought to the issue because on Committee Stage I argued that it was not desirable to have the director general being the chairperson of the advisory committee's meetings and that the advisory committee should elect their own chairperson.  I said that, in that way, the advisory committee could act in a manner somewhat more independent of the director general and the agency proper than would be the case if the director general also chaired the meetings.  I do not understand the way in which it is out of order to delete the director-general's chairmanship of the meetings but not out of order to delete the deputy director general's chairmanship of the meetings. I hope that some day I shall understand the logic of the Chair.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to take over the job of the Ceann Comhairle, but I think the reason is probably that amendment No. 63 was voted on during Committee Stage.  However, I am not an expert on the rules so I shall leave that to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the advisory committee is an essential element of the operation and functioning of the agency.  It will bring in a cross-section of outside people who will have a different perspective and who will be able to bring to the agency their experience and views on environmental issues. That will be an important asset to the agency in the carrying out of their work. In addition, it will give members of the advisory committee, who will be involved <Col N="981" /> in many organisations that play a central role in relation to the protection of the environment, first-hand experience of how the agency carry out their duties. If the advisory committee is to be the important body I want it to be, given that we shall have a full-time executive board as opposed to what is often appropriate in the State sector &mdash; part-time boards &mdash; there will be a role for voluntary people in the work of the agency.</P>
    <P>It would be more appropriate that the advisory committee should have, as its chairperson, the director general of the agency.  With the director general as the chairperson of the advisory committee it will carry more weight, ensure that the director general is present at meetings and takes on board what the committee direct.  Deputy Gilmore expressed doubts about this, indicating that a chairman can get almost whatever he wishes.  Those who will serve on this advisory committee will not be weak-minded individuals but rather people able to stand up for themselves and put forward their points of view.  I do not think they would allow any chairperson to dictate to them what might or might not be their position.  On balance, in order to integrate the advisory committee into the operations of the agency as much as possible I consider it desirable that the director general should be the chairperson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for permitting me to raise the subject matter of Questions Nos. 197 and 198 of 10 March last on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Ballyogan Estate is a recently built Dublin County Council housing scheme of approximately 200 houses.  It was to have been the first of a series of public and private developments which would ultimately result in a new suburb of approximately 1,500 homes serviced by local shops, schools and so on.  For a variety of reasons the other developments have not yet gone ahead.  This new housing estate is virtually isolated from the rest of suburban south Dublin.</P>
      <P>A primary school was planned for the area but this has not been built.  To date the Minister has given no indication as to whether he intends to proceed with its construction.  Meanwhile, the 200 homes have been occupied over the past six years by young families with children of primary school age.  There are now approximately 300 primary school pupils in the housing estate, sufficient to justify a ten-teacher school.  The nearest primary school, in Sandyford, can absorb a small number of these children.  The vast majority have been placed in primary schools at Balally, two and a half miles away; Dundrum, three and a half miles away; Kilternan, three miles away, Cornelscourt and other south Dublin primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transporting the children to these schools poses a huge problem in that two-thirds of the families are dependent on social welfare and very few have private transport.  The public bus service to the estate is inadequate.  In any event the parents would be reluctant to allow young children to travel, unaccompanied, to places like Dundrum where there is a bad traffic problem.  It is too costly for parents to travel with their <Col N="983" /> children.  For example, one parent accompanying three to school would cost £26.50 per week, an impossible sum for a family on social welfare or in receipt of low wages.</P>
    <P>The parents have organised private buses to transport the children to school. These buses accommodate a total of 165 children.  Approximately 40 or 50 children travel by Dublin Bus to various schools, these usually being the older children.  The remainder either walk or are transported privately to their schools. The cost of financing this transport is an intolerable burden for the parents, the scale of charges ranging from £4 for one child to £10.50 for four children.  Parents on social welfare or in receipt of low incomes in some cases spend up to 10 per cent of their weekly income on school transport, an intolerable burden on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently made some arrangements with Dublin Bus to give free transport to the children attending Sandyford national school on the scheduled No. 44 bus service.  This has been welcomed by the parents concerned. However, it caters for a minority of the children only, the majority of them still attending schools for which their parents must bear the transport costs.  When the Minister was making the arrangements for transport to Sandyford school he indicated that he was prepared to examine a possible extension of the free transport scheme to cover these unique circumstances.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister should make a clear statement of what are his intentions with regard to the construction of the proposed primary school at Ballyogan since, if that school were provided, the problem of school transport would not then arise. Second, I should like him to give the House an assurance that he will provide some interim relief for the parents, perhaps by subsidising the private arrangements the parents have made to have their children transported to school.  This is a unique position because of the relative isolation, albeit in a suburban area, of this housing estate which is badly serviced <Col N="984" /> by public transport.  The parents cannot have their children transported to school other than by engaging in what is a very costly exercise for them.  They have to do this because the Department of Education still have not provided a primary school in this area where it was promised when the housing development was going ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gilmore for having raised this matter.</P>
      <P>Ballyogan is one area of County Dublin which was earmarked for major housing development in the mid-eighties. In that light the Department of Education considered that the provision of a national school would be required. However, in the event a comparatively small amount of housing only was provided in the late eighties, with no firm indication when further, projected, large-scale housing developments would proceed.  For example, of some 1,000 houses planned 198 only have been built.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances the Department were placed in a dilemma: to have proceeded with the building of what would have been a major, costly school project, giving rise to under-utilised, unnecessary accommodation, at a time of financial constraint, could not have been countenanced. At the same time the Department were very aware of the difficulties faced by the families who had moved into the area in securing primary education for their children.  A majority of parents opted to send their children to school in Dundrum while other children attend schools in Sandyford, Balally and Kilternan. However, present indications are that further significant housing developments, public and private, are about to take place in the Ballyogan area.  According to information supplied by Dublin County Council there are now, in the Ballyogan area, some 400 houses under construction and in excess of 3,000 more in course of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present two primary school sites have been reserved by Dublin County Council and the question of what provision <Col N="985" /> is to be made is under consideration in my Department.  Every effort will be made to reach a decision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to school transport in Dublin, and indeed in other urban areas, is that the school transport scheme is not operable in such areas, it being basically a rural scheme, since children in urban areas normally live within two miles of their nearest school and have public transport available to them.  Under the terms of the school transport scheme the minimum distance for eligibility is two miles &mdash; in the case of children under ten years of age &mdash; between their home and the nearest school; in addition, a child must be attending that school.  Children over ten years of age must live at least three miles from their nearest school in order to be eligible under the terms of the scheme.  With the exception of transport to schools for children with mental and physical disabilities, no special school transport buses operate in Dublin. Therefore, children deemed eligible for transport under the scheme must be accommodated on public service buses.</P>
    <P>The special arrangement whereby children in the greater Dublin area wishing to attend their nearest all-Irish or Protestant school is done by accommodating those children on scheduled services.  The Department have been in touch with Bus Éireann in the provision of school transport. Arrangements have been made to enable children from Ballyogan estate who are under 10 years of age and who attend Sandyford national school, their nearest school, to get free transport on the scheduled No. 44 bus to that school. I understand that the pupils in question have now been issued with free tickets.</P>
    <P>With regard to other children from Ballyogan estate who go to national schools in Dundrum and Balally, the granting of free transport in these cases is outside the scope of the school transport scheme as it stands as these schools are not their nearest school.  Bus Éireann are currently ascertaining the basic facts about the number of pupils going to schools in these areas.  When the particulars are available in relation to these <Col N="986" /> children, which I hope will be soon, the question of providing a suitable extension of the scheme to suit the circumstances of the case will be addressed immediately. Bus Éireann are also considering what might be done to help facilitate children attending Kilternan national school and will approach Dublin Bus regarding the possibility of the No. 44 bus doing a loop into Ballyogan before continuing to Enniskerry.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to provide suitable school transport facilities in the Ballyogan area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the extraordinary loose, unChristian and uninformed remarks made by the Minister for Health in the Dáil Chamber on 26 March 1992.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a reputation for sometimes talking before he thinks, an unfortunate practice for one in charge of an area as sensitive as the health services. To say that artery by-pass operations have become very fashionable, that a person's life cannot be lengthened by an operation any more than it can be lengthened by taking tablets prescribed for the condition, that he would defy any consultant cardiologist to contradict what he was saying and that an operation may improve the quality of life but the same results can be achieved with tablets, defies the imagination.  He also said it was an acceptable fact that hi-tech ultramodern medicine gobbles up huge financial resources of the health budget and these resources may be better utilised in the primary care area of medicine, education or the environmental needs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take no pleasure in castigating or contradicting a fellow medical practitioner. I take no pleasure at all in questioning the veracity of the Minister's statements.  There are five effective methods for the treatment of coronary artery disease which has progressed to <Col N="987" /> the stage where it causes symptoms. These are as follows: (1) the adoption of a healthy lifestyle; (2) the treatment of pre-disposed conditions, such as high blood pressure or high blood fats; (3) drug treatment; (4) angioplasty and (5) coronary artery by-pass graft, or CABGs, as the Minister referred to them.  The first two procedures are employed on all patients for whom they are relevant.  Drug treatment is used by every family doctor.  The vast majority of patients referred to cardiologists have already been on drug treatment which has failed to relieve their symptoms.  It is because of this failure that these unfortunate patients are referred to cardiologists and cardiac surgeons for assessment.</P>
    <P>Coronary artery surgery was introduced in Ireland in 1967.  The indications for this procedure are well recognised and documented.  Assessment will discover whether a patient has extensive coronary artery disease which, if not corrected, may lead to the person suffering a heart attack or, even worse, dying suddenly. Angioplasty dilates the arteries with a balloon and does not require an operation.  In cases where it is deemed to be a safe and potentially effective alternative it is used as the intervention of first choice.</P>
    <P>Coronary artery surgery candidates fall into clearly defined groups: the unfortunate patient with angina at rest; the pre-coronary syndrome patient; the post-coronary patient with blocked arteries and, most dramatic of all, the patient who is discovered to have his left anterior descending coronary artery seriously blocked &mdash; the so-called widow-maker &mdash; who will almost certainly die suddenly if he does not have this operation.  That is a well documented medical fact.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out to the Minister that the anguish, pain, worry and mental torture he has caused to patients who have had the operation, patients who have had a stormy recovery period after an operation, the families of patients who tragically have not recovered from the operation and people on the waiting list <Col N="988" /> for the operation is incalculable.  It is unbecoming for a person in the Minister's position to make the kind of unfounded statements he made in regard to the operation. When taken in the context of the Minister's previous gaffe when he suggested that consultants should contribute £5 million of their back pay award to the mentally handicapped services, forgetting that the Government will take in £7 million in income tax, his statement defies imagination.  To say that this operation is fashionable is not only damaging to patients who have undergone or who are awaiting surgery but casts a slur on the integrity, ethics and professional competence of cardiac surgeons, cardiologists and anaesthologists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I paid little attention to what the Deputy had to say.  However, I am happy he has raised this matter as it gives me the opportunity to clarify what I said regarding cardiac surgery.  I should like the Deputy to read again what I said in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>First, I did not question cardiac surgery procedures where there is a clearly established need for this form of treatment. There are high quality cardiac surgery units in Ireland.  There is no question about that.  I called in the four cardiac surgeons and asked them if they would consider increasing the number of cardiac operations for this condition.  I provided the necessary funds and the number of cardiac operations is being increased.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the general question of the appropriateness of certain types of treatment for patients who suffer from various illnesses.  Patients must be given options when faced with a diagnosis of heart disease.  I should like all patients to have the options for treatment set out so that they can be involved in the decision-making process which must follow the diagnosis.  It is my intention to cover this matter in the patient's charter which I am presently preparing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may know, there are patients who have coronary heart disease of a level which would not justify surgery. The management in regard to heart disease <Col N="989" /> can be divided into four main elements.  These are, first, prevention which involves changing one's lifestyle &mdash; giving up smoking, taking measures to lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels.  These measures are vital. Then there is medical treatment, angioplasty and coronory artery by-pass graft.  But as I have often said, the best course of all is prevention.  Some of the problems can be solved by us as a community; the answer is in our hands.  As I said today to the Irish Heart Foundation, we must modify our lifestyles to protect and promote health.</P>
    <P>Medical treatment has certainly conributed not only to a decline in mortality but has improved the quality of life of many patients.  The majority of patients with heart disease can be treated in this way.  Angioplasty is a new technique which can be of considerable benefit to a certain proportion of patients with single artery disease.  There are considerable merits in the technique as it can be performed under local anaesthetic and the patient can often be mobile after 24 hours and discharged after 48 hours.  Symptoms can be reduced and good clinical results can be expected in the case of the vast majority of patients who undergo this procedure.  This procedure is now being performed by Harefield Hospital on patients with diseases other than single artery disease.</P>
    <P>Coronary artery by-pass graft is an extremely successful procedure: I have never doubted that.  However, coronary artery studies show that medical treatment is almost as effective as the by-pass graft, as the survival rates after five years are almost the same.  I merely expressed my concern that the procedure should only be undertaken where appropriate, in cases which do not respond to medical treatment.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that in some countries patients may have inappropriate cardiac surgery and two cardiologists in Dublin &mdash; in two articles in <i>Modern Medicine</i> in 1990 &mdash; said that we must ensure this will not happen here. The Deputy should read the articles in which this was stated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> I already told the House that I am fully in favour of a second post of cardiac surgeon in Cork.  We hope to have a surgeon in practice before the end of this year.  On 26 March 1992 I announced in the House the allocation of special funding of £120,000 to enable an additional 40 open-heart operations to be carried out in the Mater Hospital this year as an immediate step to reduce the numbers on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>I have also indicated that it is my intention to provide additional cardiac surgery capacity in Dublin and I will be making decisions in this area at the earliest possible date.  I question the relevance of the Deputy's statement about mental handicap.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me the opportunity of raising this very important matter on the Adjournment. The dramatic increase in subsidies by health boards to repay mortgages and provide rent subsidies is scandalous and shows the short-sightedness of Government to the problems of the homeless, particularly in Cork.  It is understandable and desirable that when a person has difficulty with repaying a mortgage for genuine reasons, ill-health, short time working or the loss of a job, the health board should step in to try to alleviate the problem until a permanent solution is found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures in the Southern Health Board for rent subsidies makes startling reading.  The subsidy for rent and mortgage <Col N="991" /> in 1990 was £296,031 in the south Lee area; in 1991 this had jumped to £751,436.  In the north Lee area the figure in 1990 was £371,548 and in 1991 this had spiralled to £780,767.  The trend this year means that the figures will increase again so that a massive sum will be paid out.</P>
    <P>A very large portion of this money goes to unscrupulous landlords who are becoming rich on the misery of thousands of people who, through no fault of their own, are desperately in need of housing. The vicious cutbacks in housing finance which local authorities are experiencing have had a serious effect on the waiting list, particularly in Cork, where for the first three months of this year 530 people applied for housing.  When one considers that a mere handful of houses&mdash;approximately 25 &mdash; will be built this year, it is obvious that these people will have to go on living in appalling conditions, subsidised by the health boards.</P>
    <P>Without private accommodation people on the housing list would be in a terrible state but the fact remains that some landlords have seen an opportunity to get rich quickly and are doing so with the help of taxpayers money.  Flats, houses and apartments are now being subsidised to the tune of £20, £30, £40 and £50 per week.  When landlords know that a subsidy is in the offing they raise their rents to exorbitant levels.</P>
    <P>There is also the ridiculous situation under the present social welfare regulations whereby a young person is forced to leave home and get private accommodation because the family income prohibits him or her from receiving unemployment assistance.  This is discriminatory and degrading.  It is ludicrous for a young person to pay huge rents, subsidised by a health board, to a private landlord when all that is needed in many cases is a reasonable weekly amount paid by right to a person living at home.  This would save the State thousands of pounds annually and would give an unemployed person independence and dignity.  The present system is a ripoff of public money by greedy landlords on the misfortune of others and has condemned people to live very often in <Col N="992" /> accommodation not fit for human habitation. This massive increase in subsidy is recoupable from the Department of Social Welfare but the administration of the health board is under great strain and their depleted staff cannot cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>It is time that the present system, whereby taxpayers money is used to create wealth for these unscrupulous landlords, is immediately investigated. However, the real remedy for the scandalous social problems is for the Government to start a building programme of decent housing which takes into consideration the 1,700 applicants on the waiting list of Cork Corporation and those in many other towns throughout the country who live as sub-tenants in overcrowded conditions and the hundreds of young people forced to leave the family home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy wishes to raise the matter of the increase in rent and mortgage interest allowances paid by the Southern Health Board last year.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, eligible persons whose income is insufficient to meet their rent or mortgage repayments may be considered for a supplement.  Those in receipt of social welfare or health board payments are normally eligible.  The supplement is calculated so as to leave an applicant with the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for his family size, less £3.50 which is the minimum contribution an applicant is expected to make towards his own accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determination of applications for supplementary welfare allowance is a matter for health boards operating under the Act, regulations and guidelines issued by my Department.  My Department last issued guidelines to the health boards in June 1988 which outlined the circumstances <Col N="993" /> in which rent or mortgage interest supplements may be paid.  In considering an application for supplementation the health boards are obliged to take various criteria into account. The application of these criteria is designed to ensure that the rent paid is reasonable for the size and type of accommodation in the applicant's area and that the accommodation is appropriate to his family size and circumstances. Similar criteria apply in relation to mortgage interest payments.  These guidelines are currently under review in my Department with a view to their publication in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board have been contacted with regard to the matter raised by the Deputy.  There has been a significant rise in the number and cost of rent and mortgage supplement payments in the Southern Health Board area.  This is in line with trends nationwide.</P>
    <P>These increases may be attributed to a number of factors, including increases in the live register.  Furthermore, there is evidence of increasing numbers of returning emigrants to the southern region who frequently require payment of basic supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplementation immediately on their return.</P>
    <P>Another important issue affecting the increase is the availability of local authority housing.  One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to a rent supplement is that an applicant must apply for local authority housing.  As a consequence of the limited availability of local authority housing, the housing needs of increasing numbers are being met by private rented accommodation through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>There are also indications that increased rent charges by private landlords have affected the level of housing subsidies.  I will be addressing this issue in the context of the current review of the guidelines.  A further factor underlying the increase is undoubtedly the increased level of publicity surrounding the scheme which has generated public awareness of the scheme generally.  In recent years my Department have undertaken <Col N="994" /> an increased level of publicity in relation to rent and mortgage supplements under this scheme.  The health boards do not at present maintain statistics in such a way as to facilitate a detailed statistical analysis of rent and mortgage subsidies paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Such supplements are included with other elements of supplementary welfare allowance in the accounting of the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, discussions are taking place between my Department and the health boards with a view to providing more detailed statistical information on the scheme with particular reference to rent and mortgage supplementation.  A study group comprised of officials of my Department and of the Eastern Health Board have been examining the operation of the scheme in the Eastern Health Board area with a view to suggesting improvements.  The group will be reporting shortly.  There are plans for extensive computerisation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and this would allow a full analysis of the operation of rent and mortgage supplementation and increase understanding of the factors affecting the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that FÁS will not take on any apprentices in September unless they are sponsored by the private sector.  This will pose major difficulties for many young people who want to become apprenticed.  Indeed one of the biggest problems facing thousands of young people is the lack of access to apprenticeship training.  In many cases this will be the career they wish to pursue.  They encounter several stumbling blocks, the greatest being that they cannot find employers who will sponsor them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is ironic in the context of the recommendations of the Culliton report which is crying out for more technical and vocational training.  The young people have the educational background, <Col N="995" /> the ability and the aptitude but they simply cannot find a willing employer to sponsor them.  The State must step in immediately and provide a full scale apprenticeship system in co-operation with the private sector.  This could be linked to existing FÁS centres, regional technical colleges and the secondary sector, which will be facing dwindling numbers and thus have excess capacity in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Young people and their parents have to trawl employers beseeching them to take on a young person as an apprentice. It is absolutely unfair that young people who have the ability and aptitude are barred from pursuing the trade of their choice when their peers can become apprentices simply because their families know employers who will sponsor them.  It is fair to say that it is now easier to get a place in any university faculty or any third level institution than to get an apprenticeship.  This is most unfair and must be changed immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I advised the Deputy earlier today when I responded to his question on this matter that in 1993 FÁS will implement the revised apprenticeship system agreed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and that the existing arrangements will continue in regard to intake and apprenticeships in 1992.  I reminded the Deputy that primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers but that it had been the practice for FÁS to sponsor a number of apprentices to meet any shortfall due to unexpected increases in demands for skilled personnel from existing or new employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS have responsibility for the regulation of apprenticeships under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, in industrial sectors designated by it under the said Act.  The 1986 White Paper on Manpower Policy set the objective of developing an apprenticeship system which could be based on standards achieved rather than the time served and which would <Col N="996" /> ensure a satisfactory balance between supply and demand for apprentices and reducing the financial cost to the State while maintaining quality.  At the request of the Minister for Labour in May 1988, FÁS established a subcommittee to review apprenticeships with the following terms of reference: first, to review current arrangements governing the apprenticeship system; second, to develop proposals for new arrangements which would make the system more efficient and flexible and which would ensure that the future apprenticeship needs of industry are met.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the report of the subcommittee, FÁS published a discussion document at the end of 1989 proposing the introduction of a single-standards-based system leading to craft worker status which would allow for internationally recognised certification based on uniform industry agreed standards. Proposals for a new system were subsequently agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The new system visualises a return to the position whereby the young person had to be apprenticed to an employer.  This position had been eroded through FÁS tending to sponsor a significant number of apprentices at considerable cost to the State because of the reluctance of employers to take on apprentices.  Funding arrangements for the new system have been agreed by the social partners under the auspices of the Central Review Committee and I will be shortly seeking Government approval for the necessary legislative arrangements to give effect to the agreed funding mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The board of FÁS have established a national apprenticeship advisory committee to advise the board on the implementation of the new apprenticeship system in accordance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I am satisfied that the new system will ensure that Irish craft workers are on a par with their EC counterparts and that Irish industry generally will be in a better position to meet the challenge of the Single Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the north-west we are <Col N="997" /> planting trees at a very rapid rate, some would say too fast, and that it is too much that the forestry companies are gobbling up the good land along with the marginal. Whatever one thinks of this development, this is what is happening.</P>
      <P>One thing is quite certain, we will not get worthwhile employment from growing trees.  I can give the example of what is happening in Arigna forest which straddles the Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon borders.  At present there are 15 general workers employed but recently 12 were told there would be no jobs for them in the future.  This will mean that just three workers will be employed in a forest of 13,000 acres.  I believe that forestry alone will give us a province without people.</P>
      <P>We have to look elsewhere for jobs. We could produce substantial employment in a pulpwood industry.  We already have plenty of raw material with forest thinnings and residues from the sawmills. We now have two pulpwood-using industries, the board mills in Clonmel and Scarriff.  The third outlet is in exports to Finland, France, the UK and other places.  Exporting is all right while we establish the supply line for another pulpwood industry but it is time we started putting on the added value in this country thus creating jobs from our own raw materials.</P>
      <P>We could establish another board mill or a pulp mill for paper-making.  I understand that one or other option would create at least 150 jobs directly and provide 250 or more jobs later.  We have sufficient raw material for one of these industries immediately and for two along the line.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has a great personal interest in this development.  I believe that logically and logistically he will have to favour the north-west.  I hope he will assure the House that progress is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for another pulpwood using plant in this country to cater for the supplies of timber becoming available in increasing quantities in the country as a whole and the north-west region in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 January 1992 I indicated in this <Col N="998" /> House that the increasing availability of timber supplies merited the establishment of a new pulpwood-using plant. That remains my view and Government policy remains firmly focused on ensuring that every possible avenue is explored so that export outlets for timber products are developed and in turn maximising added value in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the promotion of such a project is primarily a matter for Coillte, in consultation with the State's industrial development agencies. I know that Coillte and the IDA are continuing to hold discussions with all of the major international companies in the industry.</P>
    <P>There has been no slackening of effort in trying to find a suitable international partner to replace the Swedish industrial concern which withdrew from an earlier development project.  It is no secret that the timber industry internationally is going through a very deep recession and the House will readily understand that such circumstances are by no means ideal when one is searching for an international partner in this venture.</P>
    <P>However, the fundamentals for ultimate success remain strong and I believe that we are well positioned to benefit from any upturn in the international timber industry.  In this context, the Deputy will doubtless be interested in noting that in 1991, surplus pulpwood amounted to some 300,000 cubic metres which would be enough to cater for the type of development currently envisaged &mdash; this is a major factor in our favour &mdash; and that the total average annual pulpwood availability over the period 1992 to 1997 is projected to be 900,000 cubic metres per annum.  Some of this surplus is being exported as a short term measure but I would stress my intention to ensure that it is as short term as possible.</P>
    <P>All efforts are now being focused on securing the right investment sources with the right levels of expertise but, as I said, the search is not easy in recessionary times.  As to the likely location for a new industry, this would be a matter primarily for the major investor involved and would depend on a number of factors, including electricity, adequate water supplies and, of course, great emphasis <Col N="999" /> will be placed on environmental considerations. While it is thus too early for me to indicate to the House the location of such a new industry, I would say, in so far as the north-west region is concerned, that it would represent a prime potential location on the basis of the level of total national pulpwood supply projected from that region.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House of my continued commitment to the development of the timber industry so as to ensure that the real benefit of the State's substantial forestry investment is exploited for the benefit of job and wealth creation here in Ireland.  I will continue to assist where appropriate, to ensure success in meeting that objective and I will continue to encourage both Coillte and the IDA in their endeavours.</P>

      <P>As I have furnished the name and address of the specific individual I shall refer to him as Mr. X.  This specific case refers to an individual in a disadvantaged area who has applied to the Department of Energy for grant assistance for the provision of electricity. It may come as a surprise to some that there are still people in houses who do not have electricity.  This is a person who is not in good health.  He and his wife are 77 years of age with no family, they live on a small farm of about 52 acres, of which 40 acres is bog, and eke out a subsistence on a small stocking rate. Recently he was fortunate to be included in the disadvantaged areas as a result of which he is now attempting to instal electricity supply and a telephone.  When the individual received the application form he was possibly frightened because part of the stipulation relates to having one's tax affairs in order.  This person never paid any tax in his life and I doubt very much if he will ever be eligible for <Col N="1000" /> tax.  Normally I would not raise applications of this nature on the floor of the House because I would expect people to put their tax affairs and the tax numbers in order.  I raise it because of the exceptional nature of the request and because the individual and his wife are in a very isolated area, a good distance from the main road and electricity, in the twilight years of their lives, is essential.  I wonder whether there can be any deviation from these regulations in the Department?</P>

      <P>Under the Department of Finance regulations regarding tax clearance procedures grants for subsidies over £500 can only be paid in cases where the applicant supplies his or her tax number. Where the applicant is not registered for tax purposes he or she is informed that applications will not be considered until a tax number is provided.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to the person concerned advising him of the position and requesting him to supply a tax number.  This information has not been provided to date.  On receipt of the information the application will be given further consideration.</P>
      <P>In view of the age of the person involved I am sure it would be possible for somebody to give assistance because the procedures in relation to obtaining a tax number &mdash; even though the person has no tax liability &mdash; are not very onerous. I am sure with some assistance, and perhaps the Deputy himself might care to help, or if not I can arrange for somebody to assist these people in this way.  It is a requirement that has to be fulfilled. It is an obstacle that can be overcome with a little assistance and I would be very pleased to help in any way I can.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House in my reply of 26 February last on this issue, there is a number of differing views as to the cause of the sea trout collapse.  Since receiving the reports of the Sea Trout Action Group, the Sea Trout Scientific Working Group and the Irish Salmon Growers' Association, my Department have been examining the practical recommendations of all the groups concerned. The objective is to identify the steps which should be taken for this year in order to enhance the measures put in place in 1991.</P>
      <P>The various recommendations of STAG, of the Sea Trout Working Group and of the Irish Salmon Growers' Association can be categorised under these headings: research, conservation, and sea lice control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the research effort, I have stated before that there is a need for further research into this complex problem.  My Department are continuing to play a key <Col N="706" /> role in the organising of the scientific programme, and will assist in every way possible as far as resources permit.  The evaluation of the scope and direction of research projects for 1992 is being finalised at present, in consultation with STAG and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>On conservation, my Department are currently finalising proposals for a renewal of last year's conservation and protection measures for sea trout for the 1992 season, as recommended in the STAG report.  I will announce these shortly.</P>
    <P>On sea lice control, my Department will continue to monitor sea lice levels and assist the salmon farming industry with the implementation of management strategies to reduce lice numbers on salmon farms through the fallowing of sites, better husbandry practices and the use of approved treatments to combat lice.</P>

    <P>I came to my brief in the Marine with an open mind and an open door.  Organisations, groups and individuals representing marine interests have been encouraged to come to me with their views and to have full access to my Department.  I have already visited most of the marine and marine related locations and installations.  Each of these visits have been signalled in advance so that all of those I serve as Minister for the Marine could have the opportunity to put their views to me.  In the area of marine safety, I have changed the procedures which heretofore had governed availability of information in relation to the investigation of marine casualties under the Merchant Shipping Acts.  In future a report will be released in connection with preliminary inquiries held by my Department.  This will go a long way towards allaying public concerns in this area.  Regulations governing environmental impact assessment of projects within my bailiwick will be rigorously enforced, in the full spirit of openness and public consultation.  Public information, communications and media information has been targeted as an area for development.  It is my objective to provide a more comprehensive <Col N="708" /> service for public representatives, organisations and others with an interest in the marine.</P>

      <P>A special State grant of £100,000 was provided for in the 1991 Estimates for my Department to part fund a dredging project at Courtmacsherry harbour.  The grant was subject to normal Government accounting procedures.  Under these procedures payments can only be made on vouched receipts and any grant or part of a grant which remains unexpended at the end of the financial year, 31 December, must be surrendered to the Exchequer. The dredging works estimated to cost a total of £220,000, were needed so that the offshore lifeboat service operated from Courtmacsherry by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution could have safe launching at all stages of the tide.</P>
      <P>The dredging works commenced in August 1991.  A month later the contractor withdrew from the project having at that stage completed about 25 per cent of the work.  At this point £11,400 from the State grant had been paid to the contractor. The balance of £88,600 was not drawn down because by the time the project managers had engaged another contractor it was too late in the year for dredging works.  Furthermore, it was too late to have the necessary provision made in the 1992 Estimates.</P>
      <P>I understand that £176,000 approximately is required to complete the Courtmacsherry dredging project.  At present, I am examining the Vote for my Department to see if it is possible to make savings in other areas so that the unexpended balance of the 1991 grant or at least part of it could be met in 1992, so that this essential work can be recommenced as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Within the framework of the European Community's structural policies for fleet adjustment, the Commission is seeking reductions by end-1992 of some 15 per cent on the end-1991 figure.  These proposals are unacceptable and I made a strong case in this regard at the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg last week. <Col N="711" /> Instead I have sought a significant increase to allow for the take-up by Ireland of under-utilised fishing opportunities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My statutory powers in relation to fin fish farming derive from the Fisheries Acts and the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>The policy objective with regard to the licensing of fin fish operations is to ensure that development takes place in an orderly and well regulated manner, with full regard for other interests and in harmony with the environment while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy objective, my Department have devoted considerable technical and administrative resources over the last two years to bringing all fin fish operations under an effective licensing and monitoring regime.  All licence applications are subject to a rigorous process of evaluation and consultation including, in the case of significant fin fish projects, compliance with the requirements of the EC Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.</P>
      <P>Fin fish operations are statutorily obliged to comply with a comprehensive range of licence conditions, ranging from environmental monitoring requirements, production limits, lighting and marking specifications and reporting procedures on fish health, mortalities and escapes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the evidence available to me confirms that by and large fin fish operations are properly maintained, have little or no adverse impact on the environment and that good management practices are the rule rather than the exception.  This is confirmed from information available to me from my Department who are <Col N="712" /> involved in monitoring and inspection of the operations.</P>
    <P>The fin fish farming sector has become a significant contributor to the national economy.  Output was around 9,000 tonnes last year with a value of well over £30 million with direct benefits for the balance of payments.  There are over 1,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the fin fish sector with indirect employment gains in related service industries.  This employment and income generation is all the more significant given that fish farming is usually located in the more remote coastal areas, where there are traditionally few alternative sources of employment.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the review I have targeted four key objectives: (a) increases in allocations of fish stocks to the Irish region; (b) the adoption of fleet guidelines for the Irish fleet consistent with the allocations of fish stocks made to the Irish region and the adoption of positive structural measures to support the development of the Irish fishing industry; (c) the extension of exclusive coastal zones to 12 miles or the adoption of other measures which would strengthen the protection afforded to inshore fisheries; and (d) the making by the Community of an increased contribution to the costs, including operational costs, of Ireland's fishery control programmes.</P>

      <P>My Department were informed about the pollution on the beaches in Kerry at approximately 10 a.m. on Monday, 16 March 1992.  Immediately the problem was reported all resources attached to my Department were activated.  Since then every effort has been made to trace the source of the pollution or those responsible for it.  Unfortunately, to date, our <Col N="714" /> efforts both here and overseas have failed to indicate a culprit.</P>
      <P>In an effort to identify the product, its region of origin and length of time in the water, the Fishery Research Centre at Abbotstown was requested to carry out an analysis of samples of the pollutant taken from the beach in Kerry and the other affective areas.</P>
      <P>As a further effort to identify its source of origin, a sample of the pollutant was sent to the Institute of Off-shore Engineering, Heriott/Walt University Edinburgh, for further fingerprinting.</P>
      <P>While no positive results are available, initial indications are that it is crude oil. The institute is having great difficulty tracing the region of origin.  Tests so far have narrowed the region to probably the North Sea or Middle East.  The sample supplied would appear to be weathered for between two to 14 days.  The final report is expected to be available later this week.</P>
      <P>If the results of their analysis do not provide the necessary information the Irish Marine Emergency Service will, in a further effort to trace the source, contact the United States Coastguard, the Canadian Coastguard and the International Tankers Owners Pollution Federation Limited, advising them of the incident and requesting their co-operation.</P>
      <P>We also extended our inquiries overseas to the International Maritime Organisation in London, the UK Marine Pollution Reponse Unit, the UK Coastguard and Lloyd's.  They were all requested to let my Department know if they became aware of any vessel or vessels damaged or missing.  To date no information has come to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Based on our experience over the years the Irish Sea and south coast are relatively free of deliberate oil pollution.  This can be accounted for by, (i) the responsible attitude of the regular maritime users; (ii) the intensive aerial activity and pollution reporting by military and civilian aircraft from Ireland and the United Kingdom; (iii) the intensive marine activity and pollution reporting by commercial, fishing and pleasure craft crews; and (iv) inspections of vessels under Port <Col N="715" /> State Control which enforces international requirements.</P>
    <P>Our south-west and west coasts are our most vulnerable coastlines for pollution from deliberate discharge, although incidents of this nature are few and far between.  For example, a relatively small quantity of oil discharged at distances off our coast can, as in this incident, affect a large stretch of coastline.  The clean-up is labour intensive and costly.  Unfortunately there is little our, or any other country can do to stop deliberate discharge but, with international co-operation, prompt alert and adequate information we can endeavour to identify the culprit, prosecute and recoup our costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to publicly express my thanks to the county managers and their personnel in the affected areas for their prompt response thus avoiding the pollution migrating to an uncontaminated area.</P>

      <Quest>whether the Irish Sea Co-ordination Group has reviewed existing and proposed scientific programmes; if formal arrangements have been established for co-operation and co-ordination with the United Kingdom to deal with pollution in the Irish Sea and report on any changes in this sea environment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following an initiative announced at the Irish Sea Conference in the Isle of Man in October 1990, it was agreed to establish an Irish Sea Co-ordination Group to review existing and proposed monitoring and research programmes in the Irish Sea.  It was also agreed to appoint a co-ordinator to act as secretary to the group, to identify gaps in the programmes, the need for co-ordination and to prepare proposals for meeting those needs.</P>
      <P>Universities, technological colleges and research institutions in both Ireland and the UK were invited to tender for the position of Irish Sea co-ordinator. Following detailed consideration of tenders, interviews were held in February in both Ireland and the UK by a joint Irish/UK selection board.</P>
      <P>It was agreed to commission EOLAS, the Irish Science and Technology Agency to provide the services of Mr. Richard Boelens for three years as Irish Sea co-ordinator. I am delighted to be in a position to say that an Irish institution was considered the most suitable for the task. Mr. Boelens has had a distinguished career in marine environment research, protection and management.  Mr. Boelens is expected to take up his position before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The co-ordination group comprising representatives of main Government Departments, laboratories and institutions conducting monitoring and research in the Irish Sea will then proceed with its work.  The work will embrace pollutants from all sources including operational discharges from ships, ships' wastes and inputs from land-based sources, i.e. heavy meals, nutrients and sewage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> As regards a joint UK/Ireland response to maritime incidents it was announced at the Irish Sea Conference that existing working arrangements on joint response to marine incidents in the Irish Sea would be formalised by way of a bilateral agreement.  A number of meetings have been held with the UK authorities on this subject and agreement has been reached on the drafting of an agreement covering the operational aspects of both pollution control and search and rescue.  Drafting is now in progress.</P>

      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the continued expansion of Irish fish exports and, in particular, to the further development of the continental European market which is Ireland's most important outlet for fishery products.</P>
      <P>BIM is responsible for the development and implementation of the Government's promotional and marketing programme. For 1992, the board has prepared an extensive programme in mainland Europe involving support for Irish exporters in the marketplace, participation by Irish exporters and processors at important trade shows, retail chain promotions in all key markets and a programme of inward visits for buyers and consumer and trade journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my direction BIM is giving top priority to developing the European market over the coming year.  The thrust <Col N="720" /> of Ireland's marketing programme is centred on maximising the potential of the European market which was worth approximately £120 million to Irish exporters in 1991.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that with an increasing awareness at both trade and consumer level in Europe of the quality of Irish seafood, the outlook for our exports to continental markets for the foreseeable future is for further significant annual increases.</P>

      <P>An integrated approach to overall development of our inhabited islands is desirable and this has been recognised and pursued by Governments down through the years.  While a number of Departments, State agencies and local authorities have separate roles and functions in relation to islands, there is, in practice, close co-ordination between these bodies so as to ensure the most consistent and effective approach.</P>
      <P>In this context my own Department provide, on an agency basis, advice and other engineering services relating to marine works required on islands and the particular needs of islands are taken into account in the implementation of fisheries policies.</P>
      <P>As indicated in a reply to a recent parliamentary question, the question of re-establishing the ministerial committee on islands development is under consideration.</P>

      <P>In the five year period 1986 to 1991 there was an estimated net <Col N="723" /> outward migration of approximately 9,500 persons from Cork County Borough. The figure is derived as a residual by subtracting the natural increase in the population of the borough, that is, the number of births less the number of deaths, from the change of population as measured by the 1986 and 1991 Censuses of Population.  It is not possible to disaggregate this figure by year.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the figure quoted represents the net effect of all movements into and out of Cork County Borough, not only to or from abroad but also to or from other parts of the State, including the suburbs of Cork County Borough and Cork County.  It, therefore, corresponds to the net of two gross flows &mdash; outward and inward.</P>

      <P>Political agreement on the Third Council Framework Directive on Non-Life Insurance was reached on 19 December 1991 and following consultation with the European Parliament, a formal common position was adopted on 25 February 1992.</P>
      <P>This directive, which is due for implementation in mid-1994, represents a major step forward towards completion of the internal market in insurance and the logical progression from the partial liberalisation already achieved under the Second Non-Life Directive, which was implemented in June of last year.  The Third Directive will institute a Community-wide system of single licence authorisation whereby overall supervision of the branches and all cross-Border services business of an insurance company will be the responsibility of the supervisory authority in the member state where its head office is located.</P>
      <P>The directive includes a provision which will ensure that no insurance product can be marketed which does not conform with provisions relating to the general good in each member state.  It also includes certain &ldquo;information&rdquo; requirements which insurance companies must disclose to clients when a contract is being effected.  I am confident that the directive ensures satisfactory prudential controls on the solvency of insurance undertakings and adequate protection of policyholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain monopolies and exemptions which were permitted under previous insurance directives will now be abolished under this directive; this will have a direct effect on the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Although the Irish health insurance market will be open to competition following the implementation of this directive, all insurers operating here will be obliged to market only health insurance schemes that comply with the principles of community rating, lifetime cover and open enrolment. <Col N="728" /> Accordingly, the existing balance between public and private health care is likely to be maintained.</P>
    <P>Overall I consider that the adoption of this Third Non-Life Insurance Framework Directive is a singular achievement, striking as it does a balance between greater liberalisation for insurance activities and a high level of protection for the insurance consumer which, it is hoped, will lead to increased competition and freedom of choice to the advantage of all parties.</P>

      <P>Insurance intermediaries operating in the Irish market are regulated, in respect of their insurance intermediary activities, under Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989 which came into force on 1 October 1990 and which already embodies the main principles of the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Northern Ireland is our nearest and most accessible market and I am concerned to ensure that every opportunity to increase cross-Border trade is pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the five year period from 1986 to 1991, the aggregate value of annual cross-Border trade increased by some 37 per cent, from IR£937 million to IR£1,288 <Col N="730" /> million.  Exports to Northern Ireland in 1991 were IR£792 million and imports from Northern Ireland were IR£496 million. While pleased with this growth, I feel it should be higher.  It is starting from a very low base but I am confident it will be improved upon in future years.</P>
    <P>The imminent completion of the Internal Market represents our single, biggest, mutual opportunity in this regard, provided both sides work together in maximising cross-Border economic co-operation and trade.  Such co-operation will strengthen the economic base of the whole island of Ireland and will assist all Irish companies in their ability to meet increased competition both in their traditional markets and in the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I attended a meeting on 6 March 1992 of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at which discussions focused on the implications of the Single European Market for the whole island.  The conference welcomed the increasing interest and new initiatives in North-South co-operation and reiterated the commitment of both Governments to encouraging North-South trade and economic co-operation. The conference agreed that officials from the relevant economic Departments will undertake further work in this area and particularly in respect of research, technology and innovation and the opening up of public sector markets.</P>
    <P>As regards impediments to trade, these still include delays at the Border, inadequate infrastructure and lack of business information and co-operation.  However, Customs clearance delays will soon be eliminated by the Single European Market, while the programme to upgrade the Rosslare-Larne road and the likely upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail link should ease infrastructural difficulties. The biggest impediment of all to North/South links generally is, of course, the continual violence in Northern Ireland.  Everyone on both sides of the Border loses by this.  It hits trade and tourism particularly hard and no doubt is designed to do so.</P>
    <P>However, 1992 will see enhanced co-operation <Col N="731" /> between both sides.  For example, An Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland are holding a series of exhibitions on both sides of the Border to promote industrial sub-contracting and to make business people aware of opportunities to source inputs throughout Ireland.  Additionally, a range of activities are being undertaken by the various other economic development agencies, the International Fund for Ireland, the CII-CBI, the chambers of commerce and other business organisations.</P>

It will be appreciated that in many cases there are conflicting interests which cannot be balanced or adjudicated on by the courts and this is envisaged in the Acts.  While these Acts are subject to continuing review and may be amended from time <Col N="732" /> to time in the light of experience, I do not consider that specific proposals along the lines suggested by the Deputy would be warranted or appropriate.</P>

      <P>Under the Community Support Framework 1989-1993, Ireland has received a commitment of EC aid amounting to £2.86 billion (1989 prices) over the 1989-93 period.  Additional aid under Community initiatives has brought the total commitment to Ireland to over £3 billion. Of this amount, £1.7 billion relates to the three years to end-1991, with the balance arising in 1992 and 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Community funds are having a significant impact in strengthening the basic capacity of the Irish economy.  It is estimated that the increase in Community support negotiated in 1989 has boosted annual growth by approximately ¼ per cent to ½ per cent.  It has also resulted in higher employment than would otherwise have been possible and it was a key <Col N="733" /> factor in the net increase of 39,000 nonagricultural jobs in the two years to April 1991 &mdash; the latest date for which figures are available.</P>

    <P>Overall the commissioners estimate that about 604 Customs and Excise staff will be surplus to requirements following the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are endeavouring with the co-operation of all the Civil Service unions to find work for the surplus staff in their present locations.  As I said in my budget speech, it is essential that the surplus Customs and Excise staff are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance.  Full co-operation and flexibility will be required from the staff unions to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have put forward specific proposals for the absorption of surplus staff within Revenue through the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service especially the strengthening of the common external frontier, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post importation audit work.  The involvement of Customs and Excise staff in other Revenue work programmes is also under active consideration.  The decision of the Government to give Revenue responsibility for the new work arising post-1992 relating to the collection of Community Intrastate statistics and the VAT information exchange system will generate over 100 jobs.  The Government will make a decision shortly on the commissioners proposals for a major role for Revenue in the administration and control of a new motor vehicle taxation system.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear, however, that the total surplus number cannot be contained in Revenue and they are, therefore, discussing with the unions proposals for the absorption of Customs and Excise staff into the wider Civil Service and public service.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have put a lot of effort into designing a strategy, <Col N="735" /> the ultimate aim of which is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations.  In keeping the human and domestic factors to the forefront, I would hope that through co-operative flexibility on all sides this aim can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The position, as set out on that occasion, has not changed in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the inheritance tax charging provisions are specifically directed at inheritances that have been distributed or are in readiness for distribution. It is difficult, therefore, to envisage a situation where a liability could arise prematurely.</P>
      <P>Normally the charging date for inheritance tax does not arrive until a grant of probate or administration has been extracted and the inheritance is ready for distribution.</P>
      <P>Moreover, where a person who inherits a house or lands exercises his option to pay the tax by five equal annual instalments, the first instalment does not fall due until the first anniversary of the charging date.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the examination of particular commercial sectors is part of their ongoing audit programme.  The drinks trade was the first such sector examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examination brought to light a <Col N="738" /> number of malpractices of varying degrees of seriousness linked to tax evasion and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that there is a solid core in the industry who have a case to answer. The investigations are not yet complete and as part of the operation, the commissioners have invited members of the trade involved in malpractice to make a full disclosure by 1 July with payment of any amounts outstanding by 1 September. In accordance with the usual practice traders who make a voluntary disclosure will benefit from the less severe penalty regime which the legislation permits.  More extensive audits in the industry will be undertaken later in the year to ensure that evaders who have not made a disclosure are brought within the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have advised me that they are unable to estimate the amount of undisclosed tax liabilities at this stage in the investigation.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on the £100 million figure quoted by the Deputy but I understand that it may be based on suggestions from sources within the trade of the value of sales involved in the malpractices concerned.  I can say, however, that the commissioners have advised me that there will be additional yield arising from their investigations through collection of back taxes, interest and penalties and a higher degree of future compliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety at sea, I am naturally concerned about safety standards on board ferries operating in and out of Ireland.  All such ferries must adhere to the international safety standards, including evacuation systems, as laid down by the International Maritime Organisation.  Irish registered ferries are required to undergo a rigorous annual inspection by my Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates. This involves drydocking these vessels and a very thorough inspection of the vessel's bottom, hull, structure and all watertight doors and closing appliances on board.  All the vessel's life-saving appliances and fire-fighting appliances are examined and tested where necessary. <Col N="743" /> Tanks and other enclosed spaces are opened out and inspected as part of an ongoing survey programme.  All the vessel's lifeboats are inspected in detail and all the liferafts on board are sent ashore for servicing.  All lifejackets are examined. All signs indicating to passengers what to do or where to assemble in an emergency are checked, examined and replaced as necessary.</P>
      <P>Foreign-registered vessels using Irish ports are subjected to similar inspections under the port State control mechanism.</P>
      <P>Since the <i>Herald of Free Enterprise</i> tragedy the safety of Ro-Ro ferries has been extensively researched by the International Maritime Organisation and especially by its Maritime Safety Committee.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations from the Zeebrugge incident my Department have brought in new regulations covering, <i>inter alia:</i> closing of openings in enclosed superstructures and in bulkheads above the bulkhead deck; closing of openings in hulls and in watertight bulkheads; weighing of goods vehicles; passenger ships construction amendment rules relating to Ro-Ros and covering emergency lighting, television supervision of cardecks; indicator opening lights, passenger boarding card rules.</P>
      <P>Further regulations governing Ro-Ro stability, passenger announcements, life-saving appliances, structural fire protection will be introduced shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IMO is the United Nations international body, charged with maritime safety.  As members of the IMO we will continue to fully support all safety regulations emanating from that organisation and particularly with regard to passenger vessels.  For the Maritime Safety Committee meeting in London this week I have instructed my Department's officials to fully support a UK initiative whereby the SOLAS 1990 standards will be applied to all ferries on the shortest practicable timescale, preferably within five years.  When the timescale has been agreed at the IMO the new standards will be introduced as soon as possible with mandatory compliance for all vessels <Col N="744" /> both Irish and foreign sailing in and out of Irish ports and carrying passengers.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago in Brussels at the Council of Transport Ministers meeting I raised the question of ferry safety and stressed the need for the adoption of higher international standards for passenger ferries.  I have also called on my European colleagues to support the UK initiative at the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the development of fish farming as a means of generating economic growth and employment, particularly in coastal areas where there are few alternative employment opportunities.  The industry overall, and the fin fish sector in particular, has performed extremely well to date to the extent that there are at present approximately 100 fish farms providing some 1,000 full-time and part-time jobs, with indirect employment gains in related service industries.  Output from the fin fish sector was over 9,000 tonnes last year, valued at around £30 million, which is expected to rise to £37 million in the current year.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that fish farming develops within strict environmental standards.  To that end the process involved in licensing such operations is necessarily rigorous from technical, environmental and other perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the rigorous vetting process prior to licensing (which includes a statutory requirement that all significant fin fish applications must submit an environmental impact statement in compliance with the relevant EC Directive), fish farming operations are statutorily obliged to comply with a comprehensive range of licence conditions, which include mandatory regular monitoring of water quality for assessment by my Department's scientific staff. A report on this monitoring data by an independent expert, which was published last year, indicated that by and large Irish fish farms are properly maintained and have little or no adverse impact on the environment.  This is confirmed from <Col N="746" /> information available to me from my Department which is involved in monitoring and inspection of all fish farming operations.</P>

      <P>The current Garda building programme was launched seven years ago to tackle the serious accommodation crisis which existed in many Garda stations.  The programme, which is based on priorities agreed following consultation with the Garda representative associations, has seen the replacement of eight divisional <Col N="750" /> headquarters stations, 13 district headquarters stations, 30 smaller stations and the provision of four major extensions.</P>
      <P>There are 25 Garda stations in the Askeaton, Newcastlewest and Bruff districts, County Limerick.  As I stated in my reply to Question No. 82 on 4 March 1992, Official Report, volume 416, No. 7, columns 1520-1521, (i) new station buildings have been provided in recent years at Pallaskenry, Kilmallock and Foynes, (ii) renovation works totalling some £15,500 were carried out at Shanagolden, Athea, Tournafulla and Castletown stations in 1991 and (iii) the conversion of a former ESB premises in Rathkeale for use as a new Garda station is nearing completion at present.  Works approved to date in 1992 are a new interview room and entrance to Newcastlewest district headquarters and an extension to Abbeyfeale station.  Further improvements to Garda accommodation in the Askeaton, Newcastlewest and Bruff districts will be provided over the coming years in the light of overall priorities and available finance.</P>

      <P>It is my policy and that of the Garda authorities to maximise the amount of time which members of the Garda Síochána spend on outdoor operational Garda duties.  As part of this policy, I am asking the Garda authorities to review all aspects of Garda attendance in court with a view to streamlining current court procedure in so far as gardaí are concerned and thereby reducing the amount of time which members spend in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One significant measure which has already been taken to minimise Garda <Col N="751" /> attendance in court is the computerised scheduling of court cases so that cases dealt with by a particular garda are listed together for hearing as far as possible. Other measures include the new vehicle rectification scheme in the Dublin Metropolitan Area which allows motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and attendance in court.  I understand from the Garda authorities that 90 per cent of cases dealt with under this scheme do not come to court.</P>
    <P>On the specific question of court remands, I am considering certain legislative proposals which would address this issue in terms of achieving savings in cost and Garda time in court.</P>

      <P>In December 1989 a non-statutory body called the Sentence Review Group was set up.  This group has the task of advising the Minister for Justice on the administration of long term prison sentences including life sentences (but excluding the case of offenders serving sentences for capital murder).  Any offender who has served more than seven years of a current sentence may have his case considered by the group.</P>
      <P>The group review individual cases by reference to well-established criteria including assessment of whether a release would constitute a threat to the community and whether it would be reasonable to grant a release at a particular stage in view of the crime committed, the offender's previous criminal record and any compassionate grounds which warrant special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I am satisfied that the criteria used accord with international practice and are broad enough to enable a full evaluation to be made of the cases which come before the Sentence Review Group.  The final decision in each case, however, rests with me.</P>

      <P>The question of the provision of a new second level school in the Riverstown-Glanmire area of County Cork has been kept under review in my Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Of the 149 ordinary national schools in County Limerick, 76 have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes six schools allocated the services of a remedial teacher in the current school year as part of a national distribution of 80 such posts under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  This leaves 73 schools which do not have a remedial teaching service at present.</P>
      <P>It should of course be recognised that not all schools require, or indeed seek, the services of a remedial teacher.  I should also point out that remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the pupil's own class teachers.  The number of pupils who will require special assistance from remedial teachers will vary from time to time and accordingly be readily quantified.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a report in the Irish Medical Times of 27 March 1992.  I have had inquiries made from the Department of Gynaecology at University College Cork and I am informed that there was no report on the lines suggested.  I understand that a project touching on the matter was presented at a recent meeting of a clinical society in Cork but that no publication has resulted from this meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sedatives referred to in the Irish Medical Times report are benzodiazepines. In making his decision in regard to the prescription of these drugs, a doctor will have regard to the specific <Col N="770" /> guidelines of the National Drugs Advisory Board about their use.  It is, however, a matter for decision by a doctor in the light of his professional judgement what medication he should prescribe in any individual case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have established that no such report was recently published by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  Presumably the Deputy is referring to a recent article in a medical publication, following on a conversation between a journalist and the Registrar of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made from the society in the matter.  The society expresses disagreement with the statements in the report and finds it inaccurate in a number of respects.</P>
      <P>The position is that each month the society advises pharmacists of forgeries or suspected forged prescriptions in the Irish Pharmacy Journal.  In recent months, the number of reports has increased from perhaps one each month to two or three a month.  While it is not considered that this is a considerable rise, as stated in the question, every effort continues to be made to eliminate such abuse as exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive guidelines were prepared and agreed by the Medical Council and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland in 1983 on the format of prescriptions for controlled drugs.  In addition, there is a good reporting mechanism available to advise pharmacists if there is a problem.  Furthermore, there is close liaison between pharmacists, doctors, the Pharmaceutical Society and <Col N="771" /> my Department and every effort is made by the staff of the Pharmaceutical Society to monitor forged prescriptions and take necessary action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some evidence to suggest that, in certain circumstances, exposure to sunbeds may constitute a hazard, particularly for children aged under 16; people who burn easily, do not tan, or tan poorly; those taking drugs or cosmetics thought to be photoactive; those suffering from a skin disorder induced or aggravated by exposure to sunlight; those with a history of skin cancer; and those with risk factors for cutaneous melanoma.</P>
      <P>It is therefore advisable that people use sunbeds in moderation.  It must be remembered that treatment with sunbeds and sunlamps is sometimes used to treat various skin diseases, such as psoriasis, where they have a beneficial effect.  I would advise anyone thinking of using a sunbed to seek the advice of their general practitioner before doing so.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion that controls should be introduced, I should explain that there are no statutory powers available for this purpose.  I propose to consult my colleague, the Minister for Energy, and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in relation to the matter.</P>

      <P>Children seen by the Southern Health Board's school dental service are referred for screening for the provision of specialist orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>Children in Category A which is the category of greatest severity receive immediate treatment.  In the remaining categories (B and C) the average waiting periods are as follows: North Cork, 6-9 months; Cork City, South Cork &amp; West Cork, 0-18 months; Kerry 0-4 years.</P>
      <P>A full time consultant orthodontist has recently been recruited to the board's service.  The board has also arrangements with two private orthodontists, who work on a sessional basis, for the provision of specialist services.  The board recently reached agreement with University College Cork and Cork Dental Hospital under which an agreed level of orthodontic treatment will be carried out at Cork Dental Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A primary role of the consultant orthodontist is to organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures to specialist and sub-specialist level for health board <Col N="773" /> dental staff.  This will make further improvements in service levels.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the board allocated £186,404 for orthodontic services.  The board is reviewing the position for 1992 in the light of the recent appointment of a consultant orthodontist.</P>
    <P>My Department is also currently considering a proposal by the board for capital grant associated with the development of the service following the appointment of the consultant orthodontist.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board runs an AIDS Resource Centre at Baggot Street which is a drop-in centre where persons with HIV/AIDS can receive a range of services. There is a satellite clinic in Ballyfermot and further such centres are planned by the health board as part of its strategy to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.  In addition there are a number of non-statutory centres catering for persons with HIV/AIDS, some of which cater specifically for drug abusers, and which provide services on a drop-in basis as required.  Information about these centres is contained in a booklet published by the Dublin Aids Alliance, Avoca House, Parnell Street, Dublin 1.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries of the Matter Hospital and they informed me that the person concerned was scheduled for admission to the hospital on 23 March 1992.  Due to the number of emergency admissions to the hospital at that time, it was not possible to admit this patient as scheduled and a new admission date for 25 May 1992 was arranged.  However, due to a cancellation the person concerned was admitted on 31 March 1992 for treatment.</P>

      <P>The provision and management of the orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board is a matter for the board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that significant improvements have been made by the Eastern Health Board in the level of orthodontic services provided by the board as a result of the additional moneys made available by the Government. Despite these improvements, the waiting <Col N="783" /> lists for specialist orthodontic treatment are still at an unacceptable level.</P>
    <P>The board have had difficulties in filling the post of consultant orthodontist. The board did appoint a full-time consultant orthodontist in May 1991 but she subsequently resigned her appointment. The board have arrangements with a number of consultant and specialist orthodontists for the provisions of services and have for a number of years had an arrangement with the Dublin Dental Hospital for the provision of consultant orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>Joint appointments of consultant orthodontist between Dublin Dental Hospital and the Eastern Health Board were recently advertised.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that parents requesting information in regard to their childrens' treatment are fully advised as to the position and the likely date of treatment in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I understand from the board that the following numbers are currently on the waiting list for specialist orthodontic treatment: Category I, 85; Category II, 4,622: Category III, 3,246.</P>
    <P>The waiting list has not been completed on the basis of age groups and, accordingly, the board is not currently in a position to furnish this information.</P>
    <P>The joint appointments to the Dublin Dental Hospital and the Eastern Health Board will have a significant impact on waiting lists.  A primary role of the consultant orthodontists appointed will be to organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures to specialist and sub-specialist level for health board dental staff and so make further improvements in service levels.</P>

      <P>Section 42 of the Local Government Act, 1991, which enables a local authority to pay an allowance to the chairman in respect of reasonable expenses associated with the office, came into operation on 7 June 1991.  Section 51, which relates to expenses of local authority members and representation of local authorities at conferences, will be brought into operation as soon as possible. Possible arrangements under this provision are the subject of consultation with the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland and the General Council of County Councils.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of their estates are matters for the <Col N="796" /> local authority to be funded from their own resources which include rental income and the revenue portion, 40 per cent, of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes.</P>
      <P>Special capital funding within the provision in the annual public capital programme, is available under the remedial works scheme for the carrying out of major structural works to designated housing estates.  The eight estates to which Dublin Corporation have given the highest priority have been designated for funding under the scheme.  The financial commitments on these estates and the overall high level of demand by local authorities for funding under the scheme does not allow the designation of further estates at this stage.</P>
      <P>The capital provided for the remedial works scheme in 1992 has been allocated, in full and £6.3 million &mdash; some 40 per cent of the £16 million available &mdash; was allocated to the corporation.  This brings the total amount available to them, so far, under the scheme to over £25 million. The apportionment of the allocation between the designated estates is a matter for the corporation.</P>
      <P>In addition, £1.55 million has been allocated to the corporation under the sub-programme introduced last year to supplement the authority's expenditure on the provision of bathrooms in their rented dwellings.</P>

These included the adoption of a &ldquo;Statute of the Child and Adolescent&rdquo; and the creation of a new Ministry of the Child to implement it, the allocation of US$50 million for a national plan to protect street children, the instigation of a special inquiry by the Minister for Justice, and the establishment of a sub-Commission <Col N="801" /> of the &ldquo;Council for the Defence of Human Rights&rdquo; to make recommendations on the prevention of violence against street children.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposals on farm prices and related measures for the 1992-93 marketing year were formally presented to the Council of Ministers on 31 March and were briefly discussed at that meeting.  Except for the cereals and beef sectors, the proposals represent a roll over of existing prices and support arrangements for sectors of interest to Ireland.  In the cereal sector, the combined effects of the price reduction and the co-responsibility arrangements proposed will reduce producer returns by 6 per cent.  In the case of beef, the higher rate of suckler cow premium agreed in 1991 is not being maintained.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the basis on which the Deputy has made his comparison or the mainland European countries to which he is referring. Government policy in relation to the food industry has, over the last five years been aimed at switching national thinking towards the marketplace with the emphasis that firms should become market-led.</P>
      <P>To give effect to this objective, FEOGA and IDA aid is being allocated to those firms which are prepared to develop, produce and market added value products.  It should be noted that for the food sector as a whole, added value as a percentage of gross output has risen substantially since 1977 and I believe that this trend will continue.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 232, 233, 234 and 235 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme a weekly supplement may be paid to eligible persons towards rent or mortgage interest payments.  Such supplements may be paid where the rent or mortgage interest exceeds £3.50 per week.  As a general rule the supplement is calculated so that, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, the person has an income equal to the rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance less £3.50.</P>
      <P>The determination of applications for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is a matter for health boards subject to the Act, regulations and policy guidelines issued by my Department.  I am aware that different approaches are sometimes adapted in regard to aspects of the scheme.  The guidelines are intended to achieve a consistent approach to the operation of the scheme in different areas.  The guidelines on the payment of rent and mortgage supplements are currently under review in my Department and I hope to make them available shortly.</P>
      <P>The allocations to the health boards in respect in payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme in 1992 are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding to individual health boards for Supplementary Welfare Allowance is estimated on the basis of the most recent data on expenditure in each health board area.  Expenditure on the scheme is monitored <Col N="818" /> on a monthly basis by my Department.</P>

    <P>With regard to co-operation with the St. Vincent de Paul Society I have been informed by the health boards that this occurs in a small number of exceptional cases where circumstances such as alcohol abuse or homelessness dictate that special arrangements are called for. It may also arise where clients in distress contact the society directly and immediate assistance is given by the society which is subsequently reimbursed by the health board.</P>

      <P>Income support from my Department is available to farmers and self-employed persons through the means-tested Unemployment Assistance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the income of smallholder and self-employed the amount of Unemployment Assistance payable is based on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the year from the date of the claim.  That assessment may <Col N="819" /> be based on income actually received during the year immediately preceding the date of claim.  Allowance is made for expenses incurred in earning that income.</P>

      <P>In means testing applicants for a social assistance payment, the value of a redundancy payment is assessed in the same manner as other capital.  The assessment system is not related to interest actually earned but rather is based on a notional income from the capital.</P>
      <P>A 5 per cent of assessment is applied under the Unemployment Assistance scheme to amounts up to £400.  A 10 per cent rate of assessment is applied to amounts of capital over that amount.  The yearly value thus arrived at is divided by 52 to give the weekly value of the capital to the claimant.</P>

Estimates of industrial disputes are recorded by my Department on an individual company basis. From an examination of those records, an estimate of the number of days lost for companies located in the city and county of Limerick between 1989 and 1991 in respect of official strikes is given in the following Table.  There were no unofficial strikes recorded in the period under review.  It should be noted that these statistics cover days lost arising from strikes in companies located in Limerick but do not include data in respect of national or other strikes which may have affected Limerick.</P>

      <P>Statistics of notified redundancies giving a breakdown between Limerick City and county are not available in my Department as such statistics are recorded on a county basis only.  The number of redundancies notified in County Limerick &mdash; which includes Limerick City &mdash; in 1990 was 370 and in 1991 was 716.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be stressed that the figures <Col N="823" /> given for the two years in question relate to notifications of proposed redundancies under the Redundancy Payments Acts and not to actual redundancies.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the up-to-date situation in relation to former employees of a company (details supplied) in relation to their pension fund; and when it is intended to meet their claim of £118,813 from the insolvency payment scheme, provided for under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.</Quest>

      <P>The problems encountered by the former employees in question have arisen through their membership of a private company occupational pension scheme. The administration and operation of such schemes is the responsibility of the administrators and trustees concerned and is a matter in which I have no function.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour's sole function in regard to occupational pension schemes arises under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991, which provide for the payment from the Social Insurance Fund of certain outstanding pension contributions. Section 7 of the 1984 Act sets down the conditions of payment.</P>
      <P>The outstanding contributions covered for payment under the Acts are limited to those which both the employer and the employees were liable to pay in respect of the pension scheme during the year prior to the date of the insolvency of the employer.</P>
      <P>The only other condition in relation to the employees' contributions is that the amount claimed must have been deducted from the pay of the employees but not paid over to the administrator/trustees of the occupational pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of employer's contributions, <Col N="824" /> the amount that may be claimed is the lesser of the following: (a) the balance of employer's contributions remaining unpaid in respect of the 12 months immediately preceding the date of the employer's insolvency; or, (b) the amount certified by an actuary to be necessary for the purpose of meeting the liability of the occupational pension scheme on dissolution to pay the benefits provided by the scheme to or in respect of the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, my Department has an application from the Receiver of the company for payment of £118,813 from the Social Insurance Fund in respect of unpaid contributions to the occupational pension scheme covering the staff and executives of the company concerned comprising of, (i) unpaid employees' contributions amounting to £18,599 and (ii) unpaid employer's contributions amounting to £100,214. There have been considerable problems in obtaining all the information necessary to establish the exact amount qualifying for recoupment from the Social Insurance Fund.  In particular, there have been problems in clarifying the specific amount of the contributions due/paid in the year immediately preceding the date of the insolvency.  This gives rise to a difficulty in establishing what amounts, if any, may be payable under the Acts in respect of both employees' and employer's contributions.</P>
    <P>However, I am fully aware of the urgency of this matter and I hope to be in a position to take a final decision at a very early date.  At that stage, I will arrange for immediate payment from the Social Insurance Fund of any amount deemed to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts, 1984 to 1991.  If the administrator/trustees of the Pension Fund are not satisfied with the decision, it is open to them to submit an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <P>My Department has no record of a claim of redundancy payment in the case of the employee concerned.  However, my Department is aware of a claim by the employee under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The position as regards the unfair dismissals claim is that the employee was awarded compensation by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The employer did not pay the award and subsequently appealed the tribunal determination to the Circuit Court.  I understand that the Circuit Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the tribunal's determination.</P>
      <P>The trade union which represents the employee notified the Department of its intention to approach the employer for payment of the award and later indicated to the Department that the employer had appealed the case to the Circuit Court. This appeal placed the case beyond the scope of section 10 of the Unfair Dismissals Act and the employee's trade union was so informed by the Department in writing.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour may take legal action in certain circumstances, pursuant to section 10 of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, on behalf of an employee against an employer who fails to carry out a determination of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  That option is not available where the determination of the tribunal has been appealed.  Accordingly, I regret that I am not in a position to take any further action in this case.</P>

      <P>FÁS will in 1993 implement the revised <Col N="826" /> apprenticeship system which has been agreed in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  As such, existing arrangements will continue with regard to intake of apprentices in 1992.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers.  It has however, been the practice for FÁS to sponsor a number of apprentices to meet any shortfall due to unexpected increased demand for skilled persons from existing or new employers.</P>
