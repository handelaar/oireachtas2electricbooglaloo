      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, tá orm a chur in iúl duit gur éirigh mé as oifig mar Thaoiseach inné trína chur sin in iúl don Uachtarán de bhun an Bhunreachta.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, I resigned from the office of Taoiseach by placing my resignation in the hands of the President, pursuant to the Constitution.  I would like on this occasion to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your unfailing courtesy and assistance to all of us and for the dignity you have given to our proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 35 years in Dáil Éireann I have developed a deep affection for this House and its traditions.  I recall the great figures who have passed through its portals in my time and who are no longer with us. I remember vividly the many important parliamentary occasions this House has witnessed through the years.  Dáil Éireann is the democratic forum of this nation, to establish which our forefathers made many sacrifices, and of which they would be proud.  I would urge all Deputies to continue to stand up for and enhance the standing of the Dáil and the status of its Members and to foster a sense of pride in all our democratic institutions. When we look around this troubled world <Col N="1510" /> I think we can consider ourselves fortunate that we have these democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>We have introduced many important reforms in recent years to make Dáil Éireann more responsive and to bring it closer to the people under modern conditions, and I have no doubt this process will continue.  For my part I have done a fair amount to improve the conditions of Deputies, to enable them to carry out their duty of representing the people more effectively and to facilitate their work as legislators.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank all those colleagues who have served with me in Government, and I would also like to thank Deputies both from my own party, from the Government side and from the Opposition who have contributed to our work in the public interest over the years.  I want to thank the large number of dedicated public servants for whom, as they know, I have always had the highest regard, and who have served the Government and the country with diligence and dedication.  I would also like to pay a very special tribute to the social partners for their enlightened approach to our economic and social affairs, which has been of such enormous benefit to our country over the past five years.</P>
    <P>Above all, I thank the people of Ireland for the support they have given me over such a long period of years and indeed for the great deal of affection they have shown me from time to time.  As I leave office, I bid them a fond farewell and wish them every success and happiness.</P>
    <P>The work of Government and of the Dáil must always be directed to the progress of the nation, and I hope I have been able to provide some leadership to that end in my time.  I have always sought to act solely and exclusively in the best interests of the Irish people.  Let me quote Othello:</P>
    <P>I have done the state some service; they know't</P>
    <P>No more of that.</P>
    <P>As to all those who have frequently and vehemently disagreed with me in this <Col N="1511" /> House, I have always accepted that they did so in pursuance of their own interpretation of the public interest and in accordance with the constitutional duty of an Opposition party in a democracy to put the alternative view.</P>
    <P>The past 35 years have seen a total transformation of Irish society.  Even if not all our high hopes have been realised, there is much to be proud of in the economic and social progress that has been made, and in recent years I believe we have laid good foundations for durable advance.</P>
    <P>We should always keep in our minds, too, that Government has much wider dimensions than merely managing an economy.  There must be concern and commitment that all shall participate in the fruits of progress, a caring attitude towards the least advantaged, a love of our heritage and culture, a desire to protect our environment, a deep attachment to the values that are precious to us. There is also the need to respond constructively to the great universal yearning for peace in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Apart from that tragic situation, I am sure we are proceeding broadly in the right direction, and that Ireland can look forward to a great future in a united Europe, exceeding anything in our past, if we take the right decisions and stay on course.  The Irish people have the means and the character to lift themselves out of present difficulties, and in my estimation they will certainly succeed in doing so.  I believe, too, that there is in Ireland today a great flowering of creativity in all aspects of our national life which enhances the quality of our lives and uplifts out morale.</P>
    <P>I would like to wish my successor and the Government he will nominate well in tackling the many problems they will face.  I say farewell, as Taoiseach, to the Members of this House and salute them as the freely elected, democratic representatives of the people of Ireland whom we are honoured to serve.</P>
    <P>This is not the time to outline any special list of claims or achievements.  Let the record speak for itself.  If I were to <Col N="1512" /> seek any accolade as I leave office it would simply be: he served the people, all the people, to the best of his ability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish the outgoing Taoiseach well.  As a Minister and as Taoiseach, he showed himself to be an effective and imaginative manager of public business.  He has, as he has said, shown commitment to this House in his willingness to answer to this House, frequently in times of difficulty.  I wish him well in whatever role he now chooses for himself, as I wish well his family and his many friends.  May I say also that I doubt very much that he will confine himself to the cultivation of chrysanthemums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>The outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, quoted last week from Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar</i> to telling effect in this House when he referred to the &ldquo;Heavens blazing forth the death of princes&rdquo;.  I am sure that he did not intend to encourage us to look at our dog-eared copies of <i>Julius Caesar</i> and to especially remember Mark Anthony saying &ldquo;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Ides of March are not yet upon us so I will resist the temptation to follow Mark Anthony's precedent.  Instead I admit to having difficulty in finding the appropriate words to pay tribute to a retiring political legend.  My mind was drawn &mdash; not to Shakespeare &mdash; but closer to home to Flann O'Brien whose tribute to another folk hero, Fionn Mac Cumhaill, ran like this: &ldquo;I am an Ulster man, a Connacht man and a Greek, I am my own father and my son, I am every hero from the crack of time&rdquo;, which is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the abrupt ending of Deputy Haughey's time frame, I do not propose to dwell at length on the circumstances in which he has come to relinquish office other than to say that the manner of his departure, once the die was cast, was dignified and graceful, as one would expect.  This occasion represents the end of a long and turbulent era in Irish politics.  Charles Haughey was elected as Leader of Fianna Fáil &mdash; and <Col N="1513" /> Taoiseach &mdash; in an atmosphere of high expectation.  He brought to the job a prestigious range of talents and skills, perhaps unparalleled in the modern era. Throughout his tenure of office those skills were always in evidence; alongside the ambition and hunger for high office, with which his name will always be associated, the years during which Deputy Haughey was a central figure on the Irish political stage were marked by a series of controversial anomalies and questions, the kind of questions that can only be answered in the cooler light of history.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate now to list all the questions and controversies which helped to make the last 13 years so turbulent. In keeping with the complex nature of the central figure the period can be accurately described as years of achievement and failure, promise and betrayal, hope and despair, idealism and cynicism, style and mediocrity, triumph and disaster.  It will be up to the historians to say what are the correct measures to be applied for each of these descriptions. For my part, I have to say that if the next 13 years will enable politics to be restored to a more honourable and consistent ground, our country will be the richer.  If we can bring an end to the style and substance of politics that enables a few to benefit at the expense of many we will be better off.</P>
    <P>Throughout my career I have been an opponent of Deputy Haughey and, if he had remained in office, I would probably still oppose him for another two or ten years.  However, I will always wonder what might have been, particularly if he had the confidence to give free rein to his skills, which have always been palable, in pursuit of a vision of an Ireland that belongs to all its people.  On a personal level, despite many trenchant political disagreements, Deputy Haughey has always treated me in a courteous and fair manner.  In future, now that he is free from the never ending ambition for office, I hope his talents will find true expression, perhaps in the further development of the cultural life of our country to which he has made a genuine and long standing commitment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> On my own behalf &mdash; and on behalf of the Labour Party &mdash; I wish Deputy Haughey and Mrs. Haughey many long, contented and fruitful years of retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey knows well that I have disagreed with him fundamentally on virtually every major political issue of the past ten years and that I have been very critical of his style of Government.  Being the political realist he is he will, therefore, not expect praise from me nor would he, I suspect, take me seriously if I were to go down that road.  Notwithstanding that, I wish to join other party Leaders &mdash; indeed everybody in the House &mdash; in wishing him well in his retirement and I acknowledge the exceptional impact he has had on Irish political life over some 30 years. Phrases like &ldquo;the end of an era&rdquo; are thrown about far too freely by politicians but this is one occasion on which it is entirely appropriate; it is indeed the end of an era, not just for Fianna Fáil, but for Irish politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several decades Deputy Haughey dominated political life and had a major influence on virtually every political development since the sixties.  As I said last week, when he announced his decision to the Fianna Fáil Party, like him or loathe him, he has always seemed to provoke the strongest possible feelings, it was impossible to ignore him. Irish politics will certainly be different &mdash; and duller &mdash; without him as Taoiseach. While any examination of his political career will naturally focus on his years as Taoiseach we must not forget that he also has a distinguished record of achievement as a Government Minister in several different Departments.  He was a genuinely reforming Minister for Justice and, as Minister for Social Welfare, he introduced many reforms which helped to make life more bearable for those dependent on social welfare.  Even his strongest critics &mdash; I count myself among them &mdash; have to admit that Deputy Haughey has been an exceptionally skilled parliamentarian.  In Government and <Col N="1515" /> in Opposition he was the dominant presence in this House; always adept in the use of the procedures of the Dáil he has proved to be a formidable opponent for the rest of us.</P>
    <P>Most politicians would admire the tenacity which Charles Haughey has shown in his political career, he has probably endured more crises and setbacks &mdash; some of them, let it be said, of his own making &mdash; than all his predecessors as Leader of Fianna Fáil, combined.  He has climbed out of them, and out of the political grave, on more than one occasion.  If there is any lesson we all learned about Charles Haughey it was never to doubt his capacity to confound or his ability to survive.  In any private dealings I have had with him as leaders of our respective parties I have always found him to be courteous and helpful, quite different from the aggressive and sometimes boorish attitude he often adopted to his political opponents under public gaze in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey clearly has always liked to be at the centre of things and he is a person to whom retirement may not come easily.  He is still a very active man and I hope he will find an appropriate outlet for his talents and abilities.  I genuinely wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own behalf &mdash; and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; I join in the good wishes to Deputy Haughey on his retirement.  He has had a long and extremely distinguished career as Taoiseach, as Minister and as a Member of the House.  I have, over the years, had disagreements with him on policy matters but I have come to recognise his outstanding abilities and capabilities.  I am happiest of all to acknowledge how positively and how usefully those great abilities were used in this Government which comes to an end today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge, in particular, the way in which something new and different was facilitated by him and how the task of each member of the Government was <Col N="1516" /> made easier by his courtesy and concern for every member.  There are few people in our time who will have made the kind of impact which Deputy Haughey made on the country.  That marks him as a man of very considerable distinction and ability; he deserves what we hope he will now have &mdash; many long and happy years of retirement.  I wish him and Mrs. Haughey well in that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite, comprising Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats, do not have a mandate to form a Government, no matter who leads the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1989 the people neither voted for nor were they offered a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government.  If the 1989 general election decided anything it was that the voters did not want a Fianna Fáil Government with an overall majority.</P>
      <P>I must say this.  The people were possibly satisfied &mdash; and the polls appear to confirm it &mdash; that for the first 18 months there was acceptance of the Government as formed, but since the sacking of Deputy Brian Lenihan until today there has been and is considerable concern over what has been happening in the country.  Since last summer I have felt that the only solution to the series of scandals we have witnessed over the past 12 months was a general election.</P>
      <P>I have said this previously, both publicly and privately, as many Deputies on both sides of the House know.  Politicians, politics and the business community have all been tainted unfairly, by these scandals.  I say &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; because most Deputies and business people are as appalled by what has been happening as are members of the general public.  As I have said, the only way we can clear the air and clean the system is by having a general election because no matter who is elected as Taoiseach today, I do not believe the public have changed their minds: they do not want to see Fianna Fáil with an overall majority now or at any time in the future.  This will present challenges to every Deputy elected to this House after the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the scandals to which I have referred &mdash; I do not want to list them here, they are well known &mdash; there have been a number of other incidents which cast grave doubts whether a Government comprised of Fianna Fáil <Col N="1518" /> and the Progressive Democrats can continue to work.  Besides Deputy Reynolds' well known view of the Government, there is deep bitter resentment among many Fianna Fáil Deputies at the role played by the Progressive Democrats in the sacking of Deputy Brian Lenihan as Tánaiste, the non-appointment of Deputy Jim McDaid as Minister for Defence and, most recently, the resignation of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  This resentment has been angrily and publicly articulated both inside and outside this House by many of the people who are now being named, I do not know with what accuracy, as possible Ministers.</P>
    <P>How can a Government so composed deal with the problems of high unemployment, a worsening economic situation, a crisis in the health boards, bankrupt local authorities, a rudderless educational system and the entirely new challenges which face us in the European Community as a result of the signing of the Maastricht Agreement last week and, above all else, the tragedy of Northern Ireland?  The two major issues which must be faced and which demand special attention are unemployment and Northern Ireland, and these issues are connected. There are now well over 270,000 people unemployed in this country, the highest level in the history of the State. The acting Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, is quoted in today's papers as saying that this figure is going to rise. Families who for generations had all their members at work now have a son or daughter or, even worse, a father unemployed. Regardless of their social background or financial circumstances, all parents live with the fear that if their children find work it will not be in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This tragic problem demands all our efforts, both inside and outside the Dáil. Deputy Bruton has put forward the most constructive proposal so far &mdash; a jobs forum.  I suggest to the new Taoiseach that a new Department should be set up, a Department whose only responsibility would be to get people back to work &mdash; a Department of Employment headed by <Col N="1519" /> a Minister for Employment whose first task would be to establish the jobs forum proposed by Deputy J. Bruton.</P>
    <P>The tragic situation in Northern Ireland now needs the undivided attention of one Cabinet Minister.  I do not have to remind anybody in this House, particularly those who served on the New Ireland Forum, of the economic costs of violence on this island &mdash; investment opportunities postponed or located elsewhere, tourism not achieving its potential and money spent on security which we would all prefer to see spent on job creation.  We would gladly make these sacrifices if it would help to bring violence to an end and bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland.  Over the past 20 years violence has touched virtually every family in Northern Ireland.  At this stage violence is for paramilitaries an end in itself.  People in this House and on this island have to help bring an end to that violence.</P>
    <P>Any Government elected by this Dáil must recognise that some of our problems relate to Northern Ireland and that all of them fade into insignificance when compared to the need to find a political solution which is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland.  Sometimes the best contribution we can make is by remaining silent.  The appointment of a Government Minister who is sensitive to the rights of both communities, to quote the New Ireland Forum, to be what they are and to be where they are would be helpful at this stage.  There is no violent solution which will satisfy the aspirations of either community; there is a political solution which will satisfy neither community but will help to bring an end to violence.  It is the responsibility of all of us to help the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland to find that solution.</P>
    <P>I propose Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great honour for me to be called upon to second the nomination of Deputy John Bruton as Taoiseach.  More than anything else <Col N="1520" /> Deputy John Bruton is a thoroughly modern man.  To call him a radical is to tell the truth about him.  Yet, it is no lie that his vision is grounded firmly on solid principles.  He is a man who sees the best traditions of the past, not an anchor but as a stepping stone to the future and it is to the future that we in this House on this day should direct our closest attention.</P>
      <P>It is Deputy Bruton who is today's candidate for the future.  In 20 years time he will still be younger than either Deputy Haughey or Deputy FitzGerald are now.  Yet, 20 years ago he was already serving in this House with both of these giants of modern Irish politics.  Here is the right blend of youth and experience, a man with a solid past as the foundation stone for a bright and long future.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barry has said, unemployment and Northern Ireland are today's major Irish problems from which all other significant problems flow.  Yet, it can be said truly about both of these issues that they in essence and in quantity arise from 70 years of short term decision making which has been a frequent feature of Irish politics since independence.</P>
      <P>The figure of 288,000 on the register of unemployment represents directly the sum total of human misery.  I should explain that the published figure for last month's unemployment is 276,000 and not 288,000 as I have mentioned.  That is because 12,000 unemployed people over 55 years of age are pushed to one side under the heading &ldquo;pre-retirement allowance&rdquo;. This of course, I can assure the House, is an untrue reflection on those 12,000 people because they know, as do we, that they are as available for work as is Deputy Reynolds who, under these rules created by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government, would be already in his fourth year of pre-retirement leave.  In line with Deputy Bruton's philosophy there is room for people over 55 years of age; every person counts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people think it is a disadvantage for Deputy Bruton to be a son of the soil, but I do not so think.  My family's history is as deeply embedded in the illustrious culture of Dublin as is Deputy Bruton's <Col N="1521" /> in the fertile lands of Meath.  This pedigree is what gives Deputy Bruton his cherishing of Ireland's past, his understanding of Ireland's present and his vision of Ireland's future.  As Fine Gael spokesman on the Environment I know only too well the priority he attaches to environmental matters and how deeply the natural environment matters to him. This is not just a fashionable trait; it is a deeply embedded instinct which directly derives from his love and understanding of the land of Ireland and its people.</P>
    <P>There are seven years and ten months to go to the end of this century.  Not alone should Deputy Bruton be around to celebrate the 21st Century, but he has a clear vision of what he wants for Ireland in the next century.  He has both the time and the courage to implement policies that will transform Ireland and Europe for the better.  Indeed, and this is a crucial point for Dáil Éireann in making its choice of Taoiseach today, the policies needed to change Ireland for the better need time; what is not needed is more short term expediency.  Deputy Bruton has time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has time not just in terms of years but also in terms of attitude. To coin a recent phrase, Deputy Bruton is a politician with attitude.  This attitude springs from two very deep reservoirs within him, both of which may be temporarily out of fashion, namely, patriotism and Christianity.  These are the twin spark-plugs that turn on his boundless energy.  Many of our great patriots in the past died for Ireland. Today's great patriots are called on to live for Ireland.  Deputy Bruton lives for Ireland and his vision, his passion, is that all other Irishmen and Irishwomen can live for Ireland and live in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's patriotism is as outward-looking and as generous as is his Christianity.  In both cases he rejects the narrow view but the broadness of his mind is matched by the depth of his commitment. His Christian commitment is best encapsulated by what has become, for those of us who have the privilege of working with him, his motto: &ldquo;every person counts&rdquo;.  The Bruton philosophy <Col N="1522" /> that &ldquo;every person counts&rdquo; is as exciting as it is simple.  It is the cornerstone of both Christianity and democracy and it is all the more important for it is now the clarion call of all Christian Democratic parties in Europe.  It is firmly and confidently within Europe that Deputy Bruton sees Ireland's future.</P>
    <P>In 1973 Deputy Bruton was first appointed to a ministerial position.  It was also the year Ireland joined the EC. Deputy Bruton's commitment to Europe predates his long parliamentary career. Both his experience and his linguistic skills equip him to deal with and relate to the Europe of the future.  It is within Europe that he sees the solution to the epic tragedy of Northern Ireland and to the awful tragedy of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, as a Christian Democratic party, unlike Fianna Fáil or any other party in this House, are in the mainstream of politics in Europe.  It is the philosophy of life which has brought great prosperity and social justice to western Europe at a time when extreme forms of socialism were bringing tyranny and ruin to eastern Europe.  Now in the closing years of the second millennium, throughout Europe and the Christian democratic philosophy is more than ever seen as the way of the future.  Deputy Bruton is Ireland's way of the future, and I commend him to this House.</P>

With the exception of Deputy Spring, no candidate for Taoiseach in this House today has led his party before the electorate as leader of his party seeking a mandate of Taoiseach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first reason I wish to propose him.  Secondly he is the longest serving party leader of any party in this House at present, and thirdly, <Col N="1523" /> quite frankly, he is the best.  It is self-evident from the opinion polls, from the respect he has received across the entire spectrum, from the published accounts of the various opinion polls that are on record in this House and outside it that Deputy Spring is the most popular leader of any party, the most respected and, therefore, the best qualified.  However, I would not be so naive as to anticipate that such compelling arguments would win over Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies.  It is quite obvious that Deputy Reynolds will be elected Taoiseach today, and I personally wish him well in his onerous office.</P>
      <P>I want to make four brief points to the incoming Taoiseach and subsequently to his Government which will be ratified later today.  Deputy Reynolds, during his recent press conference, promised open Government, and we will keep him to that promise.  This House, this country and indeed this nation desperately needs open Government in which all of us can be proud, where transactions are transparent, people are accountable and differences of opinion, honestly held and clearly articulated, can be put before the nation and voted on in a democratic manner.  We offer Deputy Reynolds, in support of such a pursuit of open Government, the Ethics in Government and Public Office Bill which the Labour Party brought forward last spring.  We request him to earnestly consider it, with amendment if necessary, as the basis of the statute of the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to refer to is Northern Ireland to which Deputy Reynolds also referred at his press conference. Nobody in the House has a monopoly on concern or compassion in respect of Northern Ireland.  All of us share a desire &mdash; indeed, a sense of urgency &mdash; to do something about it.  My party leader, Deputy Dick Spring, made a suggestion to Deputy Reynolds in response to his press conference about the urgent need for a convocation by the incoming Taoiseach of all of the party leaders in the Republic to come together to explore ways in which some kind of <Col N="1524" /> new initiative can be launched from this side of the island to the beleagured people of the other side of the island so as to break the impasse that is clearly there now, the resolution of which ultimately falls upon the shoulders of politicians.</P>
    <P>The third point relates to the economy in general and unemployment in particular. It is quite obvious that nobody has the answer to the problem of unemployment, that no particular Government has the unique solution and that no particular individual has found the way. However, it is evident to me that within the House, in the back benches of your own party, in the benches of the Opposition parties and of the Independent Members, the energies, enthusiasm and intelligence available have never been properly harnessed to resolve this problem in our society.  I invite the Government of the day, through whatever means are open to them, to seek to engage the energies of every Member in this House and not just those of front bench members of a beleaguered Cabinet or those of isolated civil servants who are not accountable to anybody but the Cabinet Ministers in question.</P>

      <P>That is one of several proposals to be put forward, and the Labour Party have supported that proposal.  A social and economic affairs committee of the Oireachtas would perhaps be a more effective vehicle.  We have to find new solutions to the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The final point I wish to make concerns Europe.  The House has not been characterised by an open and effective ongoing debate on the whole question of what we are currently doing in Europe in the various Councils of Ministers' meetings or of what we will be committed to doing after the Treaty of Maastricht has been ratified by all of the 12 contracting parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A European affairs committee is desperately needed and the House also <Col N="1525" /> needs a form of democratic accountability that will provide an opportunity both to support the efforts of our Ministers abroad and to make them more effective when they are abroad by being able to cite the support or, indeed, the constraints that have been democratically put upon them by this House to which we are all elected.</P>
    <P>Those are the four priorities that the Labour Party offer the incoming Taoiseach who will be elected here this morning. We will maintain, as we have in the past, the effective opposition on this side of the House; we will give the lead, as we have done in the past, to ensuring that the responsibilities which the House will now confer upon the new Taoiseach and the obligations which he takes into his hands and those of his Cabinet Ministers will be executed firmly, fairly and with the utmost ability that he commands; we will reform the democratic task of the Opposition &mdash; we will criticise and we will ensure that from both Opposition and Government the citizens of this State get the kind of republican government which they have sought in the ballot box and which it is our obligation to deliver.</P>

      <P>My party oppose the nomination of Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach.  In our view, what is needed is not simply a change of faces in Government Buildings or around the Cabinet table but a change of policies.  Unfortunately, there is nothing to suggest that Deputy Reynolds will depart from the policies which have brought unemployment to record levels, led to such unprecedented scandals in the public sector, left so many essential public services in disarray, and contributed to the general sense of despair and disillusionment which so many of our people now feel.</P>
      <P>The question of the Fianna Fáil leadership is entirely one for the members of that party, but the election of Taoiseach is a matter which is of vital interest to every citizen.  The election of Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach does not augur well for any prospect of social, economic or political reform, which is so badly needed in this country.  Deputy Reynolds has been a Member of the Dáil since 1977.  He has held ministerial or front bench positions continuously since 1979, yet it is almost impossible to establish from the records of the House what, if anything, he stands for.  He seems to have been a man without any sort of broad vision or political ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the Dáil debates is no help in providing any clue as to the broad political views of Albert Reynolds, as his contributions &mdash; other than on economic matters, where he has always adopted a most conservative line &mdash; have been extremely rare.  If one looks at the period between 1983 and 1987, when Deputy Reynolds was in Opposition without any restriction of ministerial office and relatively free to speak his mind, the most striking thing is the manner in which he managed to avoid taking a stand on the <Col N="1527" /> controversial political and social issues of the time.</P>
    <P>When the legislation was going through in 1983 for the so-called `pro-life' amendment to the Constitution, Deputy Reynolds had nothing to say, although there was a long and heated debate in the Dáil and throughout the country on this measure.  Similarly, when the Dáil was discussing the proposed divorce amendment in 1986 Deputy Reynolds remained silent &mdash; and according to recent newspaper interviews he still has not made up his mind on this major social problem.</P>
    <P>The man who would now be Taoiseach had not a word to contribute to the Dáil debate on the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, although the measure was strongly resisted by his party, and a year later when the Dáil ratified the terms of the Single European Act Deputy Reynolds was again a notable absentee from the debate.  When Fianna Fáil were bitterly opposing the Health (Family) Bill in 1985, Deputy Reynolds' entire contribution to the debate was a five-word interjection in support of a point made by the former Fine Gael Deputy, Alice Glenn, and which seems to have implied that the then Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, had &ldquo;opened an abortion referral clinic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many of Deputy Reynolds' front bench colleagues contributed to the debates on these issues.  The only interpretation that can be put on Deputy Reynolds' Trappist-like silence is that he either did not consider these matters to be of importance or did not want to take a public stand on controversial issues.  In either case, it is hardly evidence of visionary political leadership.  There is more required of a head of government than a knowledge of economic matters and an ability to balance the books.</P>
    <P>Neither is there anything in Deputy Reynolds's ministerial career to inspire any confidence.  I quote what I said when he was nominated as Minister for Finance in 1988 as reported in the Official Report of 24 November 1988:</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds has always carried <Col N="1528" /> the flag for the interests of business and private profit.  I have never heard him say anything which suggested that he might have any degree of social conscience, or that he was concerned at the plight of working-class families, struggling to make ends meet under appalling difficulties.  His appointment does not augur well for the class I represent.</P>
    <P>Nothing I have seen or heard in the intervening period has caused me to change my assessment.  When Deputy Reynolds took over the key portfolio of Finance in November 1988 there were 234,000 on the live register.  When he departed from office three years later there were an additional 25,000 out of work.</P>
    <P>His last budget speech as Minister for Finance in January of 1991 contained no more than a few token references to unemployment, although the numbers on the live register at that stage were in excess of 240,000 and, as we know, his estimates for unemployment levels during that year were wildly out.  By common consent, unemployment is the greatest social and economic problem facing the country, yet, unfortunately, I do not see anything in the career of the nominee for Taoiseach which inspires any confidence that the problem will be given the priority it needs.  The image of thousands of our young people queuing outside a Dublin hotel yesterday in vain hope of escaping from unemployment in this country by securing a not very well paid job in the new Disneyworld project outside Paris is a shocking indictment of 70 years of independence as a State.</P>
    <P>The other absolute priority for the new Taoiseach must be the pursuit of a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland, which will ensure the ultimate isolation and defeat of terrorism. Condemnation of violence is not enough.  Statements of concern are not enough.  Sympathetic noises are not enough.  Commitment and compromise are required.  We must intensify efforts to ensure that there are no bolt-holes or safe havens anywhere on this island for those who murder, maim and destroy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> Compromise is required not just on the part of the British or the Unionists but also on the part of the Irish Government and of Nationalists.</P>
    <P>If the Anglo-Irish Agreement continues to be an obstacle to progress then it cannot be considered to be sacrosanct. It is not enough to say simply that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution will be on the table in any final negotiations.  If these Articles are providing a barrier to better relations between the people of Northern Ireland and the people of the Republic and thereby obstructing the search for a solution, we should have the courage to tackle them now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Albert Reynolds has had little to say in the Dáil on Northern Ireland during his political career, but if he shows a real willingness to break free from the outmoded sloganising of some of his party colleagues, and if he approaches the search for a solution to Northern Ireland in a real spirit of openness and compromise, then he certainly will have the support of The Workers' Party for any steps he takes in that direction.</P>
    <P>As I said we will be opposing the nomination of Deputy Albert Reynolds.  The figures guarantee that he will be elected anyway.  As Head of Government he will carry an enormous burden.  For the sake of our people I hope that my assessment of him is wrong and I wish him well in his new position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory:</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Independent Member of Dáil Éireann my position as regards the vote on the nomination for Taoiseach is guided by the record of the candidates and the policies of their respective parties.  The record of both Deputy Albert Reynolds and Deputy John Bruton, and the record of the Governments in which they served, has been one of harsh Government measures directed against the interests of the less well off in our society.  There were attacks on our health services, the cutting off of resources to schools, the spiralling tragedy of the numbers of people forced to emigrate, the absolute failure to provide jobs for more than a quarter of a million unemployed and the refusal to <Col N="1530" /> tackle poverty or even to accept the seriousness and extent of the problem for those living in poverty, with one-third of our population existing on social welfare. The architects of these measures over the last ten years were the leadership of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Fine Gael parties.  The nominee I would support would have to recognise at the very least that with one-third of our population socially disadvantaged, there is an absolute need to provide a basic minimum income, a readily accessible health service, a public housing programme and positive discrimination within the education system.  Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael in the past have failed miserably on all four levels, refusing to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, allowing the development of a two tier health service, one readily available for the rich and one dominated by long waiting lists with under funded, under-staffed hospitals for the workers and the poor.</P>
      <P>In our schools, particularly at primary level, we are refusing to give adequate help in disadvantaged areas, to give children from low income groups any chance of building a decent place for themselves in society.  By scrapping the building of local authority houses even in the most disadvantaged inner city areas, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats are now the parties of the privileged, and increasingly the working class electorate and the growing unemployed electorate are recognising that fact and are changing their allegience to the parties of the left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are fed up listening to how good the Government are for the country. They are fed up hearing that they were the best Government for decades.  The people know that the books are being balanced but that it is the sick, the old, the handicapped, the unemployed and the young emigrants who have suffered and paid the unacceptable price.  The question now is, will these harsh measures continue under the leadership of Deputy Albert Reynolds?  Will the tough decisions continue to be made &mdash; tough <Col N="1531" /> only on the weak and the vulnerable?  It is clear that that will almost certainly be the case.  In this context it is now essential that the left wing parties and Deputies unite to present the only genuine alternative, a left wing alternative which will put the people first and give priority to the poor.  If this unity is projected within the Dáil, I am confident that the left will be increasingly supported by the people at future general elections.</P>
    <P>In the vote on the nomination for Taoiseach, I shall be supporting the Leader of the largest left wing party in the Dáil.</P>

I also hope this new Government will not be beset by the scandals of the previous Government.

I would like to assure Deputy Quinn and <Col N="1534" /> the Labour Party that the Green Party are very anxious to co-operate with everyone in this House.  In fact, we will be launching a major policy initiative on unemployment next month which will, I think, contribute considerably to solving this problem.  I will be seeking co-operation from everyone in this House towards finding a solution to the unemployment question.</P>
      <P>Regarding Northern Ireland, I echo the sentiments of Deputy Mitchell that this problem needs to be prioritised to the extent that we need a special Minister in this area, if not a full Minister, then at least a Minister of State who would give this matter his or her undivided attention and would not be distracted by other affairs in the great world outside.  I say that with no disrespect whatsoever to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has many duties to perform, but we need to concentrate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The last and one of the most important issues is the environment.  I hope when the Taoiseach elect puts together a Government he will set up a proper Department of the Environment, not a Department of local government that is masquerading as a Department of the Environment.  We need a separate Department of the Environment under a Cabinet Minister who will deal exclusively with the many environmental problems we have today.</P>
      <P>In the past week we had five or six major environmental problems; the probable demolition of Howth House, the felling of trees at Coolattin Woods, the three interpretative centres which the Office of Public Works seem determined to foist on people whether they like them or not, the Dingle marina and, last but not least, the rape of Carton House which now seems imminent.  For all these reasons I will be voting against the nomination of Deputy Reynolds.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to comment on the points made in this debate to which ordinarily I would have liked to reply.  I wish simply to say that I am conscious of the great honour being conferred on me.  I thank the Dáil for having nominated me to this high office.  I am conscious also of the very many grave problems facing us as a society.  As Taoiseach I will endeavour to deal with them to the best of my ability.</P>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, it is now necessary that I go and inform the President of my nomination so that she may appoint me.  Accordingly, I suggest that the Dáil adjourn until 3.30 p.m. this afternoon.</P>

      <P>Before the sitting is adjourned I want to wish the new Taoiseach well in his work.  For reasons I will explain later it is in everybody's interest in this House that he succeeds in his work.</P>
      <P>As is our responsibility, we on this side of the House will be critical and at all times vigilant.  Obviously it would be our hope that the next time we have a vote on this proposition the result will be different.  In the meantime I wish the new Taoiseach well in his work.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf, and that of the Parliamentary Labour Party, I wish to congratulate Deputy Albert Reynolds on his attainment of high office, on becoming Taoiseach.  He undertakes a very serious and difficult task at a difficult time which he recognised in his public statements so far.  Obviously we have a role to play in Opposition and I should like to think it will be constructive.  I am confident the new Taoiseach is fully aware of the difficulties facing him and <Col N="1539" /> his party and wish him well in this new post.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the new Taoiseach on his election to the most important position in our parliamentary system.  I have already stated my views in relation to the politics of the new Taoiseach. I look forward to debating with him the points I have raised.  At this stage I should like to make one point, which I made earlier, that the Taoiseach actively take up the proposal of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed for the establishment of an employment forum, when I have no doubt the Opposition parties will co-operate fully with him.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> It has been the practice at this stage to indicate the Departments to which members of the Government will be assigned.  I propose to assign the Departments of Defence and the Gaeltacht to Deputy John P. Wilson.  In assigning the Department of the Gaeltacht to him, I am conscious that he is uniquely qualified to discharge the onerous responsibilities involved.  The other assignments are as follows:</P>
    <P>Department of Industry and Commerce to Mr. Desmond J. O'Malley.</P>
    <P>Department of Finance to Mr. Bertie Ahern.</P>
    <P>Department of Energy to Mr. Bobby Molloy.</P>
    <P>Department of the Marine to Dr. Michael J. Woods.</P>
    <P>Department of Justice to Mr. Pádraig Flynn.</P>
    <P>Department of Education to Mr. Séamus Brennan.</P>
    <P>Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications to Mrs. Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    <P>Department of Health to Dr. John O'Connell.</P>
    <P>Department of the Environment to Mr. Michael Smith</P>
    <P>Department of Foreign Affairs to Mr. David Andrews.</P>
    <P>Department of Agriculture and Food to Mr. Joe Walsh.</P>
    <P>Department of Social Welfare to Mr. Charlie McCreevy.</P>
    <P>Department of Labour to Mr. Brian Cowen.</P>
    <P>I also propose to nominate Deputy Noel Dempsey for appointment by the <Col N="1542" /> Government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>I propose to nominate Harold A. Whelehan, SC for appointment by the President to be the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It had been my earnest hope that from today we would see the beginning of a new and more constructive phase in Irish politics.  That will only happen, however, if the majority in this House &mdash; the two parties forming the Government &mdash; make a clear break from their past, not just in terms of personnel but also in terms of the way they look at politics.</P>
      <P>We need something which we have not had for some time &mdash; a Government with a clear sense of direction.  We need a Government which abandons the &ldquo;make it up as you go along&rdquo; approach to policy-making that has characterised Irish public life for the last four years.  We also need a Government who are prepared to take Dáil Éireann into their confidence and see those who are elected to this House as capable of making a useful contribution to the life of this country. Leadership is not Government by press release, restricted debates in this House or indeed by smart answers to this House any more indeed than it is opposition for opposition's sale.  All this, I hope, belongs to the past.  It is on the basis of whether there is a real break with the past &mdash; not just a break for some individuals &mdash; that we will decide whether this is a new phase in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that, for the last number of years, politics in Ireland have been drifting aimlessly and not responding to the sense of crisis which people in their homes, discussing political issues up and down the country, feel, a sense of imminent crisis, particularly as far as employment is concerned.  They ask why the politicians do not seem to share this sense of crisis and why they seem more concerned about who is being promoted and demoted, whose face will appear on the <Col N="1543" /> poster, rather than what will be done about finding employment for their sons or daughters.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not able to provide enough jobs for its people, it is failing and exporting its best brains.  It has accepted 20 years of ongoing violence in Northern Ireland, a few miles from this House, committed by an organisation, much of whose arms are stored on this side of the Border in this jurisdiction, with dull resignation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a nation which has an expanding class of people excluded from life here by unemployment, living on the fringes of society.  Youth unemployment is up 40 per cent in the last 12 months; in many areas of Dublin people are leaving school, one-third of them without any qualifications.  Yet the process which led to the formation of this Government, to this exercise in snakes and ladders where so many have gone up and so many have gone down, did not relate to any of the problems to which I referred.  Indeed they were not discussed by any of the candidates for preferment in any of their discussions in the last number of weeks. It has all been about personality, nothing about substance.</P>
    <P>Today's nomination of the Government is the triumph of the superficial over the real; it is the triumph of personality over policy.  Ireland, unlike other island nations which have become world leaders or at least regional leaders &mdash; like Japan and Taiwan which are no better blessed geographically than we are &mdash; remains in Europe's second division.  This is because we prefer to spend our time arguing about who should lead us rather than where they should lead us &mdash; the constant triumph of the superficial over the real, of personalities over substance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Conversation in the Chamber and in the lobbies must cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that as a result of today's vote the style will change, but does anyone in this House <Col N="1544" /> seriously believe that this change of Ministers is going to increase our economic growth, reduce unemployment, keep our emigrants at home or reduce the number leaving school too early?  I am sure that question was not even asked when the selections were being made.  Of course it will not do these things.  Why not? Because the policies have not changed, indeed, there is not a single reference to policy anywhere in this sparse announcement of personnel changes.  It is as if personnel mattered for everthing and policy for nothing.</P>
      <P>Some of the Ministers who retain their seals of office sat at Cabinet and were collectively responsible, as was the incoming Taoiseach, for the errors of the past five years.  What Government need is not a change of personnel in the sense that we have seen today but the establishment and election in this House of a Government who are truly radical in the sense that they are prepared to go to the root of our problems as a nation.  We need a Government who are prepared to reduce taxation on work and raise taxes elsewhere to pay for that.  We need a Government who will ask our people to change our Constitution so that for the first time the people of this State will fully and heartily accept the existence of a community of one million people on this island who regard themselves to be British as well as Irish, something we have never accepted in this House or as a people.  That is radicalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a Government who will clearly say, as this Government have not yet done, that divorce should be allowed in this country.  We need a Government who will introduce educational reform and promote higher standards and broader choices so that we will not come second last in international surveys in certain aspects of educational achievement, as was indicated in a survey published this week.  We need a Government who will reform our welfare state to promote an active rather than a dependent society.  We need a Government who will reform our legal system so that the amount of money one has no longer decides whether one can afford to get <Col N="1545" /> justice in Ireland's court system.  We need a Government who will give dignity back to those who are ill, shelter to those who are homeless and a voice to those who are handicapped.  All these people count just as much as the Ministers who have been promoted today and the Ministers who have been demoted.  Their concerns do not seem to loom very large in anything we have heard so far from the Taoiseach at his initial press conference or his speech today.</P>
    <P>We need a Government who will change the system of parliamentary democracy in this House so that democratically elected politicians of all parties will be seen to do a constructive job.  We need a Government who will get our people back to work.  We need a Government who will seek a mandate which will enable them to restore peace to this deeply troubled, divided and traumatised island of ours.  In short, we need a Government with a vision.</P>
    <P>Despite its superficial radicalism, I must confess that I do not see any real vision in today's rearrangement of office holders within the Fianna Fáil Party.  For those who regard politics as some sort of spectator sport, all these changes are interesting and probably quite diverting in the same way as changes of soccer managers or changes of greyhound trainers, which perhaps is more appropriate as we are talking in a sense about blood sports, and I have no doubt they will fill several column inches in the newspapers tomorrow and maybe for weeks to come. However, for those who expect this House and politics to actually change their lives for the better &mdash; I am talking now about people outside this House &mdash; and offer them a glimpse of their future, to give them a lead, I am not so sure that these nominations add up to very much at all.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I want to say directly to the new Taoiseach: I want him to succeed.  The entire profession of politics has been dragged down by the scandals and the failures, particularly those of the past six months.  Nobody in this House, and certainly nobody in my party has gained from anything which happened in <Col N="1546" /> the past six months.  I do not see that any of us has been enriched by the misfortune of anyone on the other side of the House. All of us have suffered from what has happened.  When I say I want the Taoiseach to succeed I mean it because it is up to him and the Ministers he has chosen to restore respect to the profession of politics so that people will begin, which they certainly have not done for the last six months, to look at us in this House and say, these are people who are telling us something about our future, these are people we respect, these are people who are leading us somewhere.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the time comes for a general election the result will be very different to the one of 1989 which has given this very indirect mandate for the formation of this Government; in fact, I am very confident that the result will be very different.  In the meantime, I hope the Government are successful, not just economically but also in restoring respect to democratic politics.  In that sense, both personally and politically, I wish the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, every success.</P>
    <P>I have already offered him co-operation on an all-party approach to the jobs problem; I suggested the setting up of an all-party forum on jobs.  I am surprised there was no reference to this in his announcement today.  He was being offered an unusual opportunity, an opportunity which reflected the seriousness of unemployment.  Indeed, it would have given him an opportunity to show that when he spoke at his press conference of his Government being one who believed in consultation, not confrontation, of not being a Government who were defensive, on his first day in office he was offered by the main Opposition party and others an opportunity to give real meaning to those words by bringing politicians on all sides of the House together with the social partners to tackle the greatest scourge this country has &mdash; the fact that 270,000 people find their lives entirely wasted by unemployment. I offered him the opportunity to sweep aside partisan politics for once and bring all the House together to tackle <Col N="1547" /> that problem, perhaps denying the Opposition in that process some of the opportunity they might otherwise have of embarrassing the Government by taking some small share in the responsibility. Perhaps it is indicative of the Taoiseach's sense that all that really counts is what happens within Fianna Fáil that he did not take up that offer of an all-party jobs forum.  I think it was a mistake, a mistake the Taoiseach will not have to wait long to regret.</P>
    <P>I also proposed that we co-operate to reform the Dáil so that all of us would share some responsibility, through a committee system, for the budgetary and legislative decisions which the Government must make.  There are issues like Europe, Northern Ireland and local government reform where the parties can and should work together.  Fine Gael have shown many times before that they are willing to be constructive, but we will also be vigilant.  We will not accept it if the prerogatives of this House are taken over by those outside it or by the Executive, as has happened so often in recent months.  We demand now the introduction of a comprehensive ethics code not just for the chairmen and members of boards of semi-State bodies but for politicians in this House and in Government. We demand a comprehensive ethics cose with the means of enforcing it.</P>
    <P>This side of the House, as long as we remain here, will relentlessly expose the type of moral cowardice &mdash; that is what it was that allowed the budgets of 1990, 1991 and 1992 to dishonestly conceal and postpone financial problems &mdash; that is what those three budgets did &mdash; leaving others to deal with them later.  Not only is that bad financial practice; it is moral cowardice.  They are not the types of budgets the Fine Gael Party in Government introduced.  Those on this side of the House often have been the subject of criticism for our approach to these matters but one thing we have never shown is the sort of moral cowardice that was demonstrated in the budgets to which I referred, two of which bore the hand <Col N="1548" /> of the new Taoiseach.  We will continue relentlessly to expose that type of moral cowardice in this House, and hopefully our work will ensure that it does not recur.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in the only policy statement the Taoiseach has made since becoming leader of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; namely, his press conference &mdash; he did not refer to the imminent destruction of the economic base of rural Ireland in the form of the radical destruction of the Common Agricultural Policy arising from the European Community's financial problems and from the world trade round, an issue that affects the lives of so many of the people of this country, including many of his constituents.  Combined with the increasing volatility of the world computer industry, the other pillar of our economy, we see Ireland's two major economic sectors, food and electronics, under imminent threat.  Yet neither sector merited a mention in what the Taoiseach had to say at his press conference.</P>
    <P>Our two major sectors are under imminent threat because, as far as economic policy-making is concerned on the international stage, the Irish Government over the past four years, abdicated responsibility to outside decision-makers. They abdicated responsibility as far as agriculture is concerned to Commission officials and they abdicated responsibility as far as industrial development is concerned to multinational chairmen of boards whom Ministers visit from time to time.  Indeed they abdicated responsibility for much of our future to officials of the European Community who are conducting the world trade negotiations. Irish Ministers of our sovereign Government in the past four years have become mere supplicants on the international stage, not people with a vision of a common European future in which Ireland can play a pivotal role but people going to meetings in Brussels and elsewhere, hoping to get as much as they can and give as little as possible.  That is the level to which international economic strategy-making has sunk here.  In a sense our political leadership has abdicated <Col N="1549" /> responsibility to others outside this country not only for the shaping of the policy of Europe but also for our internal affairs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of consultation, but this should mean consultation with the Dáil, not just with the Deputies in his own party.  The consultation which has dominated the Governments of which he has been a member up to now has been consultation not with this House but in private with outside interest groups.  In particular policy on employment creation here has been devised exclusively in consultation with those who have jobs.  Is it any wonder that the proposals in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as far as jobs are concerned display no sense of urgency about job creation when the only people who were consulted about it were those who have jobs?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must recognise that the jobs crisis here will not be solved within the framework of Government policies as set out in the Government's joint programme. Corporatist policies, such as those in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that are driven by the interests of those who have jobs are not the best way to help those who have no jobs.  Tax policies dictated by the Progressive Democrats designed primarily to reduce top tax rates and give maximum benefit to those on £100,000 a year or more are not the best way to spend the limited amount of money that is available to restore incentives to work for those on the average industrial wage or less. Because the Fianna Fáil Party have no tax ideas and no economic ideas of their own, in policy terms they are like a blank sheet of paper upon which the Progressive Democrats can write whatever they wish.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> would not even be claimed by those who wrote them to be a solution to Ireland's fundamental economic problems. It is even tacitly admitted by their authors that they are mere short term arrangements designed to serve the immediate needs of those who signed <Col N="1550" /> them.  Yet the Taoiseach admitted at his press conference that as far as economic policy is concerned we have the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the joint programme.  That is all he had to offer: policies that were drafted by his predecessor.  He did not offer any suggestion that those policies were going to be changed, and nobody took him up on that because of course we have come to accept that it does not really matter what the policies are.  What is of real interest is who will be Minister for the Marine, who will be Chief Whip and who will be Taoiseach.  It is all about personalities, about what is going to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the existing policies that have been so readily, almost casually, accepted by the Taoiseach as continuing indefinitely will solve Ireland's jobs problems.  Ireland's problems are so profound &mdash; violence, unemployment, alienation &mdash; that one Government, whether they last two years, two months or four years, will not solve them on their own.  Any one Government's timescale is too short and their electoral needs are too pressing for the profound and radical steps that are necessary to bear fruit.  That is why this Government should, through an all-party jobs forum, use the talent and experience of all sides of this House to improve Government legislation and scrutinise all Government spending and budgetary proposals in advance through a Dáil committee system.  Such a system would force all Deputies, including the Opposition, to face problems openly, and recognise that while we compete and disagree from time to time we must do so within realistic financial limits.  For that reason I see Dáil reform as crucial to restoring sensible long term thinking to Irish politics, something that has been gravely lacking for the last four years.  That is the sort of profound reform that would lift politics onto a new plane here.</P>
    <P>The new Taoiseach's remarks on Northern Ireland, so far at least, have been disappointing.  Everything he has said, including his remarks on Articles 2 and 3, will be &ldquo;on the table&rdquo; whenever, <Col N="1551" /> if ever, anyone gets to the table.  Do the Government have so little pride that they are prepared to just sit back and allow Irish people to die needlessly, waiting for initiatives from other people to create a table around which the Government will sit?  Is that the sort of Government we want, a Government that will just sit and wait for other people to put forward proposals and then say: &ldquo;we will put proposals on the table so long as someone else makes the first move&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Do the Government have so little pride in terms of our Constitution that they wait for talks while others tell us what changes should be made?  Surely if our Constitution needs to be changed we should be the first people to suggest how it should be changed.  Yet the Fianna Fáil approach is to say and do nothing about Northern Ireland.  They say obliquely that if a discussion forum is established they will be forthcoming in some unspecified way about what they will do.  That approach essentially is to sit back and let it happen, it is a Pontius Pilate attitude. We are not to expect them to take any initiative to bring about talks.  So far as they are concerned that is a matter for other people but if the various interests manage to get around the table eventually Fianna Fáil will start to think about the process.  The Constitution is at issue. If we are concerned about the carnage in Northern Ireland we in this House should be the first to take an initiative to change our Constitution, to show that we respect the rights of the one million people living on this island whose ancestors have been here for the past 300 years and who are as Irish as anyone here but have a different allegiance from us.  However, there is no sign in anything the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, has said so far to indicate that he wishes to abandon the traditional hopeless Fianna Fáil approach to Northern Ireland &mdash; of waiting for talks to start and then being forthcoming in some unspecified way.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to make progress <Col N="1552" /> on Northern Ireland, he must be prepared to abandon the territorial nationalism that has been the stock-in-trade of his party for the past 66 years.  It is time to start building a real unity of purpose on this island &mdash; a lasting peace which will recognise that one million people see themselves as being both Irish and British at the same time and share the north east corner of this island with 500,000 people who see themselves as exclusively Irish. We should be prepared and willing to devise institutions that will accommodate both traditions on this island we share with them.  There is no sign in anything the new Taoiseach has said of a willingness to grasp that, but perhaps I will be proved wrong.  I am willing to wait but not for long.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to be offensive or even controversial when I say that essentially the Fianna Fáil Party have no policies of their own.  They have elevated what they call pragmatism to a form of holy writ. Indeed, the contestants for the leadership of the party spent the past three weeks trying to prove that one was more pragmatic than the other.  Pragmatism is not a political creed, it is a way of avoiding trouble and decision making.  It is not a way to lead a nation.  A party who see pragmatism as an end in itself should not be in Government.</P>
    <P>A pragmatic approach is fine in a country that is prosperous and stable, that has virtually no social or economic problems and that could afford to be pragmatic for a few years but Ireland is not such a country.  We have a profound and deep-seated problem in the form of ongoing violence in Northern Ireland.  We also have a profound and deep-seated economic and employment crisis starting us in the face over the next six to ten years. Our level of emigration is almost without parallel in Europe.  Pragmatism will not solve these problems.</P>
    <P>Apart from pragmatism, Fianna Fáil have elevated consensus with the social partners in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as the other element of their holy writ.  Naturally that suits a party who does not have their own policy but who are willing to take on board <Col N="1553" /> ready made interest groups who will write policy for them.  The policy devised by the social partners, all of whom are employed, is not the best way of solving the problems of a country whose biggest problem is unemployment.  Indeed that approach to policy making leads to the triumph of the lowest common denominator, promises now and payments later and a heavy does of fudge to fill in the gaps.  That sort of decision making with which the new Taoiseach was intimately involved as Minister for Finance will not move Ireland up from Europe's second division to the first division.  That is not the type of Government required by a society facing crisis.  That is why we oppose this Government.  Irish society require a far-sighted and decisive Government, a Government prepared to act on a profound analysis of our deep-seated problems.</P>
    <P>The parties in Government have done no such analysis &mdash; no better evidence of that can be found than in their superficial Joint Programme for Government.  The Progressive Democrats claim to be a policy driven party but their policies are based on the interests of about 6 per cent of the electorate.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to spend much time dealing with the personal suitability of Deputy Reynolds for the Office of Taoiseach. As I said earlier, to the best of my knowledge, Deputy Reynolds is an open-minded and decent man.  At his first press conference &mdash; some aspects of which I criticised &mdash; he showed a refreshing lack of rigidity in his views on a range of topics.  I contend, however, that at this point we need more than just flexibility and openness.  We need decisive and visionary leadership.  I doubt that the combination of parties making up this Government is capable of giving us that.</P>
    <P>We need also a Government of sound and courageous judgement.  Many &mdash; both inside and outside this House &mdash; will question whether the Taoiseach's judgment has always been sound.  He owes his election to the Dáil in the first instance to the 1977 Fianna Fáil election manifesto, a document he praised eloquently at the time, but subsequently <Col N="1554" /> admitted he had not read.  He owes his promotion to ministerial office in 1979 to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles Haughey &mdash; in whose removal from that office he played no small part in the past few weeks.  He was a member of the Government from 1979 to 1981, along with Deputy Haughey, when the grave financial crisis facing the country was openly and honestly admitted by that Government and then completely ignored by them.  As a Minister in the Government Deputy Reynolds was collectively responsible for their decisions.</P>
    <P>He was a compliant member of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench who opposed the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1987, Deputy Reynolds was responsible for the restoration of export credit to Iraq.  This was seen both at the time and afterwards as one of the more foolish financial decisions taken by any Minister in recent years.  As Minister for Finance, too, Deputy Reynolds introduced the 1990 budget in which he backed away from the opportunity to complete the task of financial correction initiated by his three predecessors.  Instead, his budget of that year laid the foundations for the financial problems that his successor, the present Minister for Finance, has now so irresponsibly postponed even further to 1993 in the present budget and in his renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>To be fair, while he was Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds expressed on radio his serious concern about the financial implications of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  He did not, however, do anything about it.  His ultimate dismissal from Government came about not because he had taken a stand on a policy matter but simply because he had taken a stand on a matter of personality &mdash; the personality of the then Taoiseach.  All of these errors of judgement, and I believe they were errors of judgement, do not derive from any conscious irresponsibility on the part of the Taoiseach &mdash; I do not accuse him of that &mdash; but they may arise from a slight over confidence in the capacity of short-term <Col N="1555" /> deal making to solve longterm problems. Regardless of the motive the price the public have had to pay for the mistakes in which the new Taoiseach played a part, right back to 1977, has been very high indeed.  Let us hope there will be no more such mistakes.  If there are, Fine Gael will expose them to public view, and we will be vigilant.</P>
    <P>I invite the Taoiseach to do what he did not do in his speech today, to set out clearly the course he believes the nation should follow.  I have done so in this speech.  As yet, he has not done so.  I urge him then to bring parliamentary democracy back to life in this House and enlist the support of all Members of the House in a committee system to enable all of us to share some of the responsibility and the power that is at present exercised privately, and often irresponsibly, by the Executive.</P>
    <P>The days of deals with powerful interests behind closed doors are, I hope, behind us &mdash; that remains to be seen.  The penchant for making a deal at all costs-whether in individual commercial matters or in bigger issues &mdash; has been the prime cause of the decay that has set into Irish public and economic life in the past number of years.  It must end, it must end quickly, and if the new Taoiseach does not end it the next one will.  Let us restore democratic politics to its proper role as the driving force in public affairs.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not see the rather dramatic changes in personnel in the Government as indicating any change of policy.  As far as the people outside this House are concerned, the people who have no jobs, the people living on both sides of the Border waiting for the boot at their door that may be the prelude to a short burst of machine gun fire that will end their lives, the people who have been on a waiting list for an operation for perhaps two or three years, and cannot get it, people who have handicapped relatives at home for whom they can no longer care but for whom there is no place, the people who live in fear in their homes in the outer suburbs of this city and other cities, wondering when they <Col N="1556" /> will be run down by the misnamed phenomenon of the joyrider, those are the people who really matter, not the people who have been demoted and promoted &mdash; although I am sorry for some and happy for others.  So far the Taoiseach has given no indication &mdash; and certainly not  in his dramatically sparse announcement &mdash; that he is prepared to do anything different to solve any of the problems experienced by those people. In this debate they are the people who matter, and in this House we should be their voice.  If the Government are not prepared to offer them a voice, I can assure the House that the Opposition will do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a relatively long serving leader of a parliamentary party in this Chamber, I have a few words to add to today's debate.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that the incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, would take the opportunity to outline to the House his agenda and the agenda of his new Government and that he would set forth a programme of work he intends to pursue. Unfortunately, he failed to take that opportunity, for the second time today &mdash; understandably the first time this morning &mdash; to set out, however briefly, his intentions, aims, ideas and vision for his leadership of Fianna Fáil.  Obviously he has been very preoccupied over the last number of days; perhaps the title of this show should be &ldquo;Gone with the Wind&rdquo;&mdash; or perhaps it was even a hurricane that brought in this Government.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Taoiseach has taken not only the Dáil but the whole country by surprise by the nature and the scale of the appointments made here today.  This is probably the first time in the history of the State that eight members of a Government were sacked in a Cabinet reshuffle, nine if one includes the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  None of the Fianna Fáil Ministers, with the single exception of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, held onto his or her portfolio, strange times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Government put before the Dáil today is undoubtedly Taoiseach <Col N="1557" /> Reynolds' own choice.  For that reason I say he is playing for very high stakes. He has demonstrated a certain degree of political courage in doing so and there can be no doubt that the outgoing Government were stale and unimaginative and that Taoiseach Reynolds is now taking a fresh approach.  I congratulate the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I believe that at least in terms of style he has made an encouraging start.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our congratulations to all the ministerial appointees today.  I am disappointed there is only one woman &mdash; a very able woman and Deputy in the Cabinet.  Every Member of the Dáil will recognise the appointments of Deputy Andrews and Deputy McCreevy as a just reward for two Deputies who have been well known for their independence down the years.  I trust that their independence will not cause the Taoiseach any trouble &mdash; although I could not guarantee that, of course.</P>
    <P>The incoming Government have a difficult and onerous task to carry out and they will need constructive support as well as vigilant criticism and constructive opposition.  I pledge to the Taoiseach that they will certainly receive constructive opposition from the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We will oppose the formation of the Government at the end of this debate when a vote is called primarily on the basis that this Government and these appointments have no mandate from the people, other than from the 83 Deputies on the Government side together with whichever Independent Members vote for them today.  At best that mandate is a fragile and tenuous one, depending as it does on the mood of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have already exacted the second highest price that can be paid for continuation in office. They have effectively presided over the removal of a Taoiseach and a Tánaiste; obviously, the only thing left is to destroy the Government themselves.  For that reason and for other reasons that I intend to spell out, I believe the first imperative <Col N="1558" /> facing the Taoiseach elected this morning is to seek a mandate from the people.</P>
    <P>I said there are other reasons.  The Government elected in 1989 have governed through a series of inquiries, examinations and investigations.  They have been beset by scandal after scandal, some of them created as a result of the climate that they themselves encouraged, some of them created by an increasingly autocratic style of government and some of them created by deliberate Government policy decisions.  I am talking not only about the various business scandals we have witnessed, which have done so much damage to Ireland's reputation and self-esteem; I am also talking about the scandal of homelessness, the scandal of poverty; the scandal of the social services which lurch from crisis to crisis; and, above all, the scandal of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I intend to concentrate the remainder of my remarks on two issues that I believe are most important for the incoming Taoiseach and the incoming Government, that is, unemployment and the North of Ireland, because they are extremely serious and crucial for any Government of this country at this time. Other speakers from the Labour Party will concentrate on other aspects of the future life of this Government.</P>
    <P>Month after month we have historic unemployment figures and month after month they are accompanied by blasé and sanctimonious statements.  Surely it is reasonable to demand that at the very least the complacency which has been present should disappear by the end of this debate.  Unemployment is at the core of our fiscal problems.  The budget overrun last year, for example, was largely accounted for by the excess spending on unemployment related payments.  Unemployment is at the core of the grinding poverty that afflicts thousands of families. Most of all, it is unemployment that is at the core of our equality crisis.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for a national forum on unemployment.  The Labour Party certainly support such calls. During the weekend I was heartened by newspaper reports that the incoming <Col N="1559" /> Taoiseach has not ruled out the possibility of such a forum and I urge him to keep that idea very much at the top of his agenda.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach does not believe there is a simple, magic wand type solution to unemployment.  No solution can be pulled out of a hat by a new Taoiseach. We must start from the point that the figure of 270,000 unemployed is unacceptable, completely and starkly unacceptable, in any kind of economic policy or any kind of economic and social basis for our society.  It is all the more unacceptable in the context of a more prosperous Europe, a Europe in which our unemployment rate is by far the worst and is now almost exactly twice the European average.  If we had started from that point some years ago instead of simply trying to export the problem, the position would not be as grim today as it is.  We must recognise that there are crucial steps that can and must be taken, some big and small, some immediate and some longer term.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have already published a range of suggestions in relation to unemployment.  I will not go into them in detail but I will make two points.  We do not accept that every major policy initiative must be geared to the medium or longer term.  A number of things can be done immediately which will give priority to those who are most affected, the long term unemployed.  Our ideas are based on two single principles.  The creation of extra wealth here is crucial and the retention of that wealth, translating it into jobs, is equally crucial.  We must secure more added value from everything we do.</P>
    <P>It would be dishonest to say the Government are entirely to blame for unemployment.  I have argued before that we will only really begin to seriously address the problem when we look for solutions within ourselves and re-discover the patriotism inherent in a commitment to excellence, to economic flexibility, to high standards of service and to efficient production methods.  Notwithstanding that, the Government must <Col N="1560" /> be criticised for their performance.  Their complacency was totally unacceptable. They are also to be criticised for consistently ignoring the European dimension and for their unreceptiveness, which I hope has changed, to the idea of a forum on unemployment.  Until the crisis of unemployment is seriously addressed it will continue to undermine the fabric of our society, and indeed this institution. In the end it will do irreparable damage. No Government who continue to turn a blind eye to the existence of that crisis and continue to ignore the need to achieve a consensus, committed to solving the crisis, is a Government worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>Last weekend I called on the incoming Taoiseach to convene a meeting of all party leaders in this House to begin a process of consultation about how we could contribute to the restoration of peace and reconcilation in Northern Ireland.  I sent a copy of that speech to the new leader's press office at his request.  I will reiterate some of the major points in that speech.  The violence in Northern Ireland demands a fresh start at a security and a political level.  Any politician who chooses this moment to opt out of discussion with enemies and friends alike is allowing history to pass him by.  Worse, if politicians fail to break the present impasse they will be harshly judged before the court of history.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal that divides constitutional politicians on this island but there is also one thing that unites them &mdash; a total and absolute detestation of violence as a means of forcing change. Now is the time to build on that platform and for all politicians, whatever their persuasion, to agree to come together to find ways of ending the violence.  What we need is a new forum.  It should not be a place where politicians set out demands or lay down conditions or express aspirations. All that has been done already. Everybody knows the aims and aspirations of the other side.  There is a place for aspirations but that place is on the back burner.  We have to face the fact that the commitment to a united Ireland has not brought peace, any more than <Col N="1561" /> has a commitment to the union.  Instead, the intransigent commitment to our aspiration has killed people.  Our dream of a united Ireland is killing people every day, as is the dream of the union with Britain.  That is not the same as saying they are evil dreams &mdash; far from it, but how can we cherish dreams used by evil people to justify evil acts?  That is why we have to set our dreams to one side, not forever, and perhaps not even for too long.  This is not a moment for dreams. It is a time to wake up and give the first priority to the needs of an Ireland at peace.  We should consider the establishment of a successor to the New Ireland Forum to be called perhaps the Ireland at Peace Forum.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach already said that he has made no deals to secure the job to which he was elected this morning and that he does not owe anyone any favours.  If that is true in relation to personnel, it must be doubly true in relation to policy and history.  Nowhere is that more important than in relation to Northern Ireland. Deputy Reynolds' views on Northern Ireland have not been forcefully expressed in the past.  There is no reason to believe he is encumbered by any of the myths or shiboleths that have dominated the attitudes of the past.  In fact, it appears that, if anything, Deputy Reynolds believes strongly in the potential for closer co-operation and the kind of peace that leaves room for economic development.  For all these reasons he is uniquely placed to make a break with the past, and I call on him to do so.  Deputy Reynolds could begin by calling a meeting of party leaders in this House.  I have not the slightest doubt that he would find every party leader in this House willing to respect his confidence and, above all else, willing to find new ways forward.</P>
    <P>We must begin to think in a new way in relation to Northern Ireland.  This is an opportunity for the Taoiseach and the new Government.  We need a new concept which will define a nation as much in terms of its people and their rights as it does in terms of the territory they occupy.  The concept I have in mind might <Col N="1562" /> be called nationism rather than nationalism. Any discussion about nationism would start from the point of citizenship and would progress to the rights of the individual.  It would concern itself with the Border in the hearts and minds rather than the Border that exists on land.  It would be more a process of giving than taking, more aimed at bringing people together for common purposes, rather than using fear and hatred to drive people apart.  Above all, the underpinning principle of nationism would be that a nation consists of its people.  A nationist would not ever find it acceptable to blow people up or arbitrarily deprive them of their livelihoods as some so-called nationalists seem to do.  That is why we have to make a fresh start and the election of a Taoiseach in the Republic of Ireland represents a suitable point of departure.  The pain and suffering so many families in our nation are undergoing this week makes it imperative that we begin the whole process of healing again.  That will take fundamental changes of attitude.  It will require taking risks.  It will mean dropping the easy clichés of old, that we cannot hide behind any form of banal interpretation of our history.  The time to do that is now and I urge the Taoiseach to do so now.</P>
    <P>After being elected Leader of Fianna Fáil the Taoiseach in his press conference promised a more open and honest style of Government.  Most people listening found that refreshing.  Some people will be sceptical and some will be cynical about the capacity of Fianna Fáil to change but the Taoiseach deserves the benefit of the doubt.  The Taoiseach has the reins in his hands.  The leadership and responsibility lies with him.  The promise given by him will be carefully watched. The people will want to see action leading to a reinvigoration of the democratic process. The Taoiseach has made a good start and I hope he will continue as he has begun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to express congratulations to the new Taoiseach and to the members of his Cabinet, many of whom are taking on <Col N="1563" /> onerous positions for the first time.  I am pleased for them and I hope they enjoy the tasks ahead.</P>
      <P>Nobody believes the election of the new Taoiseach and the new Cabinet will bring any real change in the political orientation of this Government.  The Government will presumably continue to operate on the basis of the Programme for Government agreed in July 1989 and reviewed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in October last year. For that reason The Workers' Party do not support the motion of the Taoiseach for the appointment of his new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Neither the original programme nor the review offered any real agenda for tackling the country's daunting social and economic problem.  The review failed to offer even one new idea or initiative for job creation.  A level of unemployment which the EC warned against yesterday, reaching 300,000 within two years, is apparently acceptable to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  At least in the review they dispensed with the phoney promise made in the original 1989 programme, that unemployment would be the major priority of the Government. The reality is that what is generally accepted to be the biggest social and economic problem facing us has received no priority at all and will not be given priority by this newly constituted Government.</P>
      <P>Many commentators forecast we would see major changes in the Government but few suggested that changes would be as sweeping as those announced by the Taoiseach.  What we have seen here is not just the formation of a new Government but the day of the long knives.  Despite what the Taoiseach said last week, old scores have indeed been settled and favours have been repaid. An injection of new blood was certainly necessary but some of these appointments are extraordinary in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People on all sides of the House will welcome the appointment of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to the Cabinet.  She is a Deputy of proven ability, but I would not be alone in expressing regret that her <Col N="1564" /> appointment has apparently been at the expense of the only other woman member of the outgoing Cabinet.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn now has responsibility for Tourism, Transport and Communications and I would ask her, since repeated requests had been made to her predecessor without any great effect, to take on board as a priority the ongoing dispute at RTE and to intervene directly to ensure that the matter is resolved.  In my observations and consultations with personnel involved directly in that strike, it would appear that the parties are implacably drawn into lines of battle, that there is little common ground between them and that without the intervention of a Minister or Ministers to seek to resolve the dispute it will drag on unnecessarily in a long and bitter feud.  There is a real proposal on the table for the establishment of a joint industrial council to arbitrate over issues and disputes which will inevitably develop as new technologies are introduced in that body.  I hope the new Minister will take on board that proposal as a priority.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised, if not astonished, at the appointment of Deputy John O'Connell as Minister for Health. Although he is a medical doctor, people who depend on the public health services can draw little comfort from his appointment if he still holds the views expressed about patients being left overnight on trollies in corridoors, he uttered the immortal words that &ldquo;a trolley is just a bed on wheels&rdquo;.  In the same week in 1989 he delivered an insulting message to hospital and health care workers when he told them that health care funds were perfectly adequate but that health workers were squandering them.  I hope the new Minister for Health does not still subscribe to those antediluvian views and that his term of office at the Department of Health will lead to sweeping changes and progress for all people who rely on the public health service as a necessity to survive.</P>
    <P>On a personal level I welcome the appointment of Deputy McCreevy as Minister for Social Welfare, but I have <Col N="1565" /> rarely heard him speak on matters affecting social welfare in this House.  I look forward to hearing him and I will offer him every support as long as he is pursuing the interests of those who rely on the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>Once elected Leader of Fianna Fáil Deputy Reynolds outlined at his press conference a number of objectives that he hoped to pursue during his term in office.  In particular we look forward to any changes in policy that can hold out hope of some changes in the style of Government as promised.  I hope the new Taoiseach will honour his commitment given at that press conference to operate an open style of Government, that the diktat will end and that we will be able to rely upon consensus and consultation. The Taoiseach has an onus on him to spell out exactly what he means by those aspirations and to say how he would hope to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> There was nothing about the style of the out-going Government which demonstrated any commitment to openness or accountability.  Indeed, the contrary was the case.  This was especially so in regard to the Dáil and contributed in a major way to the exceptionally poor relationship between Government and Opposition parties in recent years.  Had that Government been more open many of the embarrassing scandals might have been avoided or might have been cleared up much earlier.  Mr. Justice Hamilton recently commented at the Beef Tribunal over which he presides that had Government Ministers been more forthcoming with information sought at various stages, then there might have been no need for that tribunal at all.  I fully agree with him.  Certainly the attitude with regard to Dáil Questions which permeated the last Government from the Taoiseach down to the most junior of Ministers has to change.  I hope that the aspirations to openness, as espoused by the new Taoiseach, will involve a change. If a question could not be transferred or disallowed, then the fall back position was to give the minimum information possible.  Extracting the simplest of information from Government Ministers was an extraordinarily tedious and often painful process.  I hope there will be significant change in this regard.  If the commitment to open Government is to have any meaning an area which must be addressed is fundamental reform of our own procedures.  I listened with some degree of amazement to the comments of the outgoing Taoiseach when he talked approvingly about what had been done with regard to Dáil reform.  We have had some minor improvements but little of any real significance and no root and branch reform.  The Programme for Government in July 1989 promised substantial Oireachtas reform by the end of that year.  It is more than two years overdue.  The review of the programme at the beginning of the last Dáil session made further promises of reform but we are still awaiting them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach specifically to look again at the repeated requests <Col N="1567" /> in this House for the appointment of a foreign affairs committee.  I particularly welcome the appointment of Deputy David Andrews to the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope the long years he has spent in Opposition in the back benches of his party, during which time he actively engaged in many initiatives on an all-party basis, will lead him to appreciate that there is great scope and opportunity for the idea of involving Deputies from all sides in consultation, negotiation and initiatives with regard to foreign affairs generally.  It is essential that the Government also address the commitment for the reforming of the European affairs committee so that we can take on board in an active way many of the challenges being presented to us by the debate on Maastricht and developments at EC level on post-Maastricht affairs.</P>
    <P>As The Worker's Party said in a document on Dáil reform published last year, the effectiveness and credibility of the Oireachtas depend on our procedures striking the correct balance between the right of the administration in power to get on with the business of Government and the right of Opposition parties to question, to query, to raise matters, to challenge, to contribute alternative views, to initiate new proposals and, where necessary, to oppose and to oppose strongly.  The Standing Orders and the Rules of Procedure as currently constituted do not strike that balance and are unfairly tilted in favour of whatever Government are in power.  That is particularly so with regard to the so-called strictures of the <i>sub judice</i> rule as it has been applied in this House, as recently exposed in the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Hanlon in the High Court.</P>
    <P>The new Taoiseach and his Government must face up to the unprecedented degree of cynicism in the real world about the effectiveness of the Dáil.  If the Taoiseach sets about modernising our procedures, ensuring that this House, and its activities, relate to citizens' lives, his real, lasting contribution to Irish public life will be undoubted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> A related area is that of full disclosure of financial interests by Dáil Deputies, an essential requirement also of open Government and to the restoration of public confidence in the integrity of our political system.  On this issue the Taoiseach is reported as having said that he had an open mind.  He is reported to have an open mind also on divorce and on votes for emigrants.  It is now time for him to begin making up his mind on these issues, all of which must be addressed, no longer long-fingered, because they have remained unaddressed for too long by people who had not the courage to tackle them.</P>
    <P>The performance of the Taoiseach and members of his Government will be measured by the way they tackle their respective portfolios.</P>
    <P>We hope The Workers' Party will be appreciated in this House for the work they do, for the critical opposition they will bring to bear on Ministers' performances in their respective portfolios. We wish the Government and Ministers well in their endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Taoiseach on his nomination and those Ministers who have been selected by him to serve in Government. I find the Taoiseach's approach extremely refreshing, giving hope for the future.  I predict that many people who had been disappointed with the trend of Irish politics in recent years will begin to believe that there is hope.  I predict many people who had been cynical will say; well, the new Taoiseach has taken a huge risk in introducing so many new people into his Cabinet, on which he deserves credit; we hope the courage he has shown will bear fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity there are not 15 seats along the front benches opposite to accommodate all Ministers.  It is somewhat unfair to two new Ministers, Deputies Cowen and McCreevy, to have to sit in the second row.  As I am aware from having served in Government, there is a huge chasm between the powers of a Minister and a Minister of State, indeed an even greater gap between any Cabinet <Col N="1569" /> Minister, Minister of State and backbencher. They should all be on the one level simply for presentation purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline the overall position for people who are not very familiar with Cabinet procedures.  The Workers' Party may have an interest in this because, as the former Taoiseach often commented, they hardly ever see the inside of the Cabinet room although who knows what may happen in the course of time.</P>
    <P>There are 15 Ministers, including the Taoiseach, and the Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  In addition to those we shall have also the extremely able civil servant and Secretary to the Government, Mr. Dermot Nally, who has served under a number of Taoisigh, now sitting on the right of the new Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Fait accompli.</i>  Nobody is more worthy of mention than that gentleman, an extraordinarily competent, able man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all appreciate that the Taoiseach is a self-made man.  He has had vast experience in a number of positions ranging from clerk with CIE, to dance band promoter, to dance hall owner and to becoming the proprietor of a very successful pet food industry.  I am in a very complimentary mood today, it being a very auspicious occasion.  While I know the former Taoiseach said, in reply to Deputy Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> on Thursday last that he did not consider that occasion <Col N="1570" /> to have been auspicious, this one is extremely so because of the revolutionary nature of the changes announced in the Cabinet.  Never in my experience in this House have there been so many changes announced within a Cabinet. That is why it is so revolutionary and deserving of comment.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned there will be no derogatory comments made on this occasion.  There were some before which caused much upset.  I am not going to refer to expressions such as &ldquo;flawed pedigree&rdquo;. Rather will I refer to the new Taoiseach in terms of &ldquo;Pedigree Chum&rdquo;, in the hope he will appreciate the humour inherent in that remark.  I wish him the best of luck in all his ventures.</P>
    <P>It is particularly nice to see ability being rewarded.  While we on this side of the House probably crossed swords with the former Taoiseach on many occasions it has to be said he has many outstanding attributes.  But some of us felt he had not been playing ball with the general public, the people who really matter, in that Deputies from his side of the House were not picked because of their ability but rather for their blind allegiance to his leadership.  I do not make that comment in any sense of bitterness but rather in a factual manner.  It was not a desirable trend.  Indeed, perhaps the former Taoiseach's son, Senator Seán Haughey, in his statement yesterday may have come closer to the bone in saying that the new Taoiseach should select people on ability, younger people in particular.  We have seen an example of that here today on which the new Taoiseach is to be complimented.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to some of the ministerial appointments.  There are five new Cabinet Ministers, people who have not served in that capacity before. The new Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, who served in this House formerly as Ceann Comhairle, has some experience of having held a senior office. Nonetheless this will be the first occasion on which he will have held a ministerial portfolio.  He may have felt somewhat aggrieved, when a member of the Labour Party in the mid-seventies, not to have <Col N="1571" /> been a member of that Coalition Government. He has now been given his opportunity. The new Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, was a senior Cabinet Minister for some time, not very long, but was an extraordinarily able Minister.  A former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture once said to me: of all the junior Ministers he had seen in that Department in his day, Deputy Michael Smith had been the most competent. That was a fair tribute to him.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, was referred to by Deputy McCartan.  Everybody in the House will applaud his selection as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  If I am not mistaken he has served in this House since 1965, 27 years, and has been one of the most competent Members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  He served as a junior Minister for approximately two years and has been an outstanding Deputy in this House, his abilities, particularly on matters relating to Foreign Affairs and Justice being well known to all of us.  Therefore, his is a particularly appropriate appointment.</P>
    <P>We have two Ministers who did not serve previously even as Ministers of State.  I refer to the new Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare, Deputies Cowen and McCreevy respectively.  The Minister for Social Welfare is not just a good debater here in the Dáil&mdash;unfortunately in the past he has not partaken frequently enough&mdash;but he is also well known as a television and radio personality, and I hope he can bring his talents to bear in this area.  I should mention in passing that the Minister who preceded him three months ago in that post &mdash;Deputy Woods, the new Minister for the Marine&mdash;did an extraordinarily good job in that area.  I would like to think that Deputy McCreevy would continue that enlightened approach.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Brian Cowen, now Minister for Labour, the boot is on the other foot because he was noted more often for his interruptions and his heckling than for his lengthy contributions. He is a highly intelligent young man and <Col N="1572" /> when he did speak he expressed himself very concisely, precisely and definitely, and he is a man who has a very promising political future.</P>
    <P>Of these new senior Ministers I have left until last the new Minister for Agriculture and Food&mdash;former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food&mdash;Deputy Joe Walsh.  It has been acknowledged for some time in the Fianna Fáil benches that Deputy Joe Walsh was the most accomplished Deputy in the party where matters relating to agriculture were concerned.  It was a cause of concern to many of us, on all sides of the House, that he had not been promoted to this position, or some Cabinet position, many years ago.  I have no doubt he will do a very good job in that area, one I shall refer to for a few minutes as it is my own area of responsibility in the Fine Gael party.</P>
    <P>It has been a source of great pain to me over the past five years to see that portfolio being handled in a rather inept manner.  I am not being kind in what I am saying here.  In complimenting the new Minister for Agriculture and Food I have got to pinpoint&mdash;as is my duty on behalf of the members of my party generally and on behalf of the general public&mdash;what has to be said.</P>
    <P>We have lost our position in Europe in matters relating to agriculture.  Up to 1987 we had carved out a special position where agriculture was concerned and in the intervening five years that position has been seriously eroded.  We have been seen to be without any bottle when it came to negotiating in Europe in those intervening five years.  There has been an erosion of our position.  That position will have to be reconstituted and it will take a strong Minister for Agriculture and Food, together with assistance from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, to recover that position.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we in Europe got special concessions in matters relating to agriculture.  I am not referring particularly to the milk quota case in 1983-84 but to a whole series of measures where we got special payments and special <Col N="1573" /> moneys.  That day has long passed and I want to see our position restored.  I hope Deputy Walsh, in his capacity as Minister for Agriculture and Food, will be able to do that.  The slide was not just at the Council of Agriculture Ministers, but also at summit meetings because I believe our authority was not stamped on the proceedings of those particular meetings. In Europe you are dealing with power politics.  If the Taoiseach or Prime Minister of your country cannot make an impression or cannot make certain demands, then his Minister for Agriculture really does not have much of a foothold.  I am asking the Taoiseach today, in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture and Food and, to a somewhat lesser extent the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to see that that foothold is retained.</P>
    <P>Nine or ten months ago in this House I had reason to ask the former Taoiseach if we were going to be subjected to the terms of the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy if he would use the veto, whereupon he answered that he wondered if the veto had any relevance any more and if it really ever had any relevance.  Of course it had relevance, we had to threaten the use of the veto in 1984 to get what we got; we actually had to table a motion invoking the veto on that particular occasion.  More recently we saw that the veto still does have a relevance.  In the run-up to the Maastrich Summit in December last, the Spaniards let it be known that they were not prepared to accept less than was being offered.  When I refer to what was being offered I am talking in terms of cohesion &mdash;that is the transfer of moneys from the better off states and the better off regions to the less well off regions.  At the end of the day, because of the very threatening of the veto, the Spaniards made tremendous progress in getting what they wanted and we travelled along on their coat-tails.  In actual fact the Greeks and the Portuguese also threatened to use the veto.  We cannot afford to be seen to be travelling on other people's coat-tails where agriculture is concerned; we must be the ones who make the running <Col N="1574" /> because no other country is as dependent on agriculture as Ireland.  If we do not get special treatment then we will have a catastrophe not just in the agricultural industry but in associated industries and in the economy generally.  I want to make that point clearly, I will be hammering away at it from this side of the House and I hope my colleagues will be doing likewise in the expectation of getting a response from the Government of the day.  We have slipped in Europe, we have gone backwards, we are not regarded as a special case and we will have to return to that particular position.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on agriculture in the House last week, I said that our performance in Europe over the past five years in agricultural matters had been &ldquo;anaemic&rdquo;.  That might not be a nice word, but it was the most relevant word I could think of and it was the most pertinent thing I could say in relation to our negotiating stance.  We will have to be strong and definite.  There are no soft touches in Europe.  Those of you who have negotiated in Europe know that; you have got to be dogged, tough and relentless.  You do not necessarily have to be nice but there are times when it helps; you cannot be ugly all the time. We have lost our special position and I want to see the Government regain that position.  I have confidence in the Taoiseach and in the Minister for Agriculture and Food to do that, but I would ask him to bear in mind what I have said.  One will not get it by playing footsie or going softly softly, and there are times when one has to put the boot in.  If it is necessary to invoke the veto then it must be done.  One will get no thanks for being nice in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have said most of what I wanted to say.  Deputy Bruton and some of the other speakers have alluded to some other items which I might have mentioned. I hope the Taoiseach's acquaintance with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, will be of assistance to us; personal relationships such as that can be enormously helpful.</P>
    <P>One cannot believe what one sees in print too often nowadays but last week it <Col N="1575" /> was reported that the incoming Taoiseach said that he was going to have a Government who, above all would be honest and forthright, and I think that is what we will look forward to.  We look forward also to the restoration of public confidence in the political system and we want openness at all times and the formation of committees such as a foreign affairs commitee and other committees relevant to the needs of the country, for instance, a committee on emigration and a committee on employment.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for the Taoiseach to be bound by the names of Departments which have been in existence for many years.  He could rename the Department of Labour the Department of Employment and Emigration, if necessary.  He could amalgamate Departments such as the Departments of Health and the Department of Social Welfare, as was done before.  Before I became Minister for Agriculture the Department of Agriculture incorporated the Department of Lands, which had been a separate Department, and the Department of the Marine which is now a separate Department.  Therefore, we had three Departments in one.</P>
    <P>Let me suggest to the Taoiseach that, in an effort to create jobs, the Department of Agriculture and Food should be renamed as the Department of Food, with the emphasis on converting what we produce into food, thus encouraging processing and the provision of new jobs. The new Minister for Agriculture and Food, when he was Minister of State at that Department, had that title, Minister for Food.  Why should he not carry that title with him?  That might mean something in terms of jobs, because that is what it is all about at the end of the day. The produce should be converted into the end product within this country so that everyone can benefit, the farmer, the processor and the worker.  Once again, I wish the Taoiseach the best of luck during his term of office.</P>

      <P>This is the second time in a matter of months that Dáil Éireann has been requested by the Government to debate a motion of this kind.  There is a certain irony in that it was the sacking of the person who has moved the motion today, the Taoiseach, which caused the vacancies a matter of months ago.  There is an air of calm in the House or at least there was before the announcement was made one and a half hours ago.  It was almost as if there was no political crisis, that it was not a matter of great moment, that something had unfolded and it was simply a matter of putting the pieces into place&mdash;a new Government, what of it?</P>
      <P>That calm belied a real crisis, the effects of which might not be felt in the House except probably among a not inconsiderable group of former Ministers. But outside this House there is a huge and deepening crisis about which I want to speak briefly.  This crisis is characterised by the alienation of a significant proportion of our citizens from the democratic process.  Many of our citizens, particularly those who are hurting &mdash; and that is at least one quarter of the total population &mdash; and those who have been hurt in recent years feel that they have been betrayed by this House and have no confidence in politicians of any political hue to solve the problems they face in their everyday lives.  I say to the incoming Government and each of the Ministers whose nominations have been put before the House for ratification that they have many tasks, the first of which is to set about restoring confidence in our democratic system.  That is a fairly tall order and a difficult task which will require a great degree of imagination and courageous decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago I had the honour and privilege, on behalf of the Labour Party, of bringing before the House an Ethics in Government Bill which, unfortunately, was voted down.  The debate which ensued on that proposal might have been seen as premature in the light <Col N="1577" /> of what has happened since when scandal upon scandal has been unfolded in our political system.  What the intervening months have shown is the necessity for such legislation.  I put it to the Taoiseach and the incoming Government that they should use it as the basis for sweeping reform of our political system.  This is required to begin the process of restoring confidence.</P>
    <P>We need to bring into political life a new openness and transparency in the way we carry on the business of this State so that people do not feel excluded from the decision making process and are not fearful of inner cabals or golden circles who are charmed in all their dealings with the great majority frozen out in a wilderness of misery.</P>
    <P>I also put it to the incoming Government that they should begin in a real sense the task of reforming the Dáil, a matter to which we have paid lip service for years.  I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges sub-committee on Dáil reform.  To our eternal shame the most significant thing we have managed to do in two years&mdash;apart from televising the Dáil which was a great step forward&mdash;is to bring the grievance procedure into existence where Deputies have two minutes at the end of a Dáil day to discuss matters of importance and to increase the number of Adjournment debates from one to three, hardly stirring stuff in terms of allowing this Parliament and the Members of it to have an input in running the country and getting the Government to account for their actions in an open and transparent way as the people require.</P>
    <P>We have talked about establishing committees.  I have worked on committees of this House who were effective in dealing with the issues that were discussed but I have also worked on committees whose recommendations were pre-empted by decisions of the Cabinet who paid no regard to the work of those committees comprising Deputies drawn from all sides of the House, and who heard evidence from people outside.  We do not operate a parliamentary democracy but rather an executive Government <Col N="1578" /> where the only people who matter in the decision-making process are 15 Cabinet Ministers and their departmental advisers.  Backbenchers on the Government side and frontbenchers on the Opposition side of the House have scant or no input into many, if not all, of the political decisions being made and into the passing of legislation.  For example, only half a dozen sections of the Local Government Bill, to which the Labour Party tabled 164 amendments, were dealt with.  The rest were not discussed because the debate on the Bill was guillotined by way of an omnibus motion.</P>
    <P>There is also a positive side.  I worked on the Child Care Bill where a consensus evolved and all views and attitudes were taken into account.  However, we need to make that the norm&mdash;and not the exception&mdash;in relation to doing business on behalf of the people who send us here as their representatives.  In essence, we must end executive Government, Government by decree, Government by a small group, and open it up to all, particularly to the Members of this House who are sent by our citizens to give their views on matters of public importance.</P>
    <P>The third element in reforming the way we do business of State is to grasp in a real sense the notion of decentralisation. It does not mean hiving off a section of a Department and X number of public servants to a rural town.  That is not decentralisation.  It is very good news for some of the population starved area of the country&mdash;and please send one to the south-east&mdash;but it is not decentralisation because decentralisation is based on the principle of subsidiarity where decisions are made at the lowest possible level, where they affect real people.  The thrust of policy in recent years has run counter to that principle.  We have not sought or tried to devolve power downwards to local communities or to local democratically elected institutions; we have sought repeatedly to grab power to ourselves as a corps and the tighter and smaller the corps the better, by all accounts in recent years.  Let us have decentralisation, not simply of offices and civil servants but of devolved power.  Let us <Col N="1579" /> take that courageous, dangerous, radical decision to allow people to govern their own affairs at local level.</P>
    <P>The second task of the incoming Government is to restore another fundamental principle, equality of citizenship, which is a fundamental principle of a republic.  Equality of citizenship has been sorely eroded in recent years; we do not have equality in virtually any area of activity.  In the health service the thickness of your wallet is more likely to determine the quality and speed of health care rather than the urgency of your medical condition.  That has been exacerbated in recent years and the gap between the haves and have-nots has widened since the first Fianna Fáil minority Government were elected in 1987 followed by the forerunner of this Government, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats first coalition.</P>
    <P>There is no equality of citizenship in housing.  We have stopped building local authority housing; 1,000 local authority houses will be built this year, an increase on the figure of two years ago but it is virtually nothing considering there is a minimum of 25,000 people on our housing lists.  Local authorities all over the country despair of even drawing up housing lists.  I attended a housing meeting in my own local authority this week and we are still working on the 1987 list; that is not an insignificant date because it was not worth our while to draw up a new list since then.  Yet, there are houses not far from this august institution which can command £100,000, £200,000 or £500,000.  That is the gap in the equality of citizenship in relation to a fundamental issue such as shelter.  There is a growing problem of homelessness which besets not just this city but cities and towns across the country.  It must be an issue for the incoming Minister for the Environment and the Cabinet to address.</P>
    <P>In relation to education, there are students outside the House at present demanding equality of treatment in relation to education.  The previous Government's reaction to that was to means test European Social fund grants, <Col N="1580" /> hardly a radical or innovative decision in the light of the fact that there is a huge tranche, particularly of middle income people, who despair of sending even one child&mdash;let alone two or three&mdash;to avail of third level education.  Surely, if there is a fundamental basis to solving or even addressing unemployment, it is preparing our young people, our most precious resource to whom lip service is often paid in this House, to the best of their ability to face the world of work and to prepare this country for participation in the Europe of tomorrow.  There is a gulf in the basic equality of citizenship as far as education is concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxation, there has been clear evidence in recent times that there are two categories of people in this State, those who can evade or avoid paying their tax and those in relation to whom every penny must be accounted for and paid to the tax man.  We must have equality of treatment in relation to taxation, not only done but seen to be done, because the great frustration among the PAYE sector is the sure knowledge that they are almost suckers in our economy because they pay while others are not expected to pay.  The most innovative thing which the predecessor of this Government could do was to broaden the tax base to include social welfare recipients, hardly revolutionary, progressive or imaginative. These are just some of the issues in relation to restoring equality of citizenship in our republic.</P>
    <P>The largest part of the contribution of the Leader of the Labour Party to this debate was the issue of Northern Ireland. In the past number of weeks we were faced with mind-numbing violence which requires to be addressed in a bold fashion, not from a basis of fear of losing face but rather from a determination to find a fresh accommodation, not trapped in history but committed to life.  Boldness in pursuit of peace will find widespread support in this House and across the country.  That is the third issue.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue is unemployment and there have been many contributions already in relation to it.  The Taoiseach has not closed his mind to the issue of a <Col N="1581" /> forum on unemployment.  The Culliton report is at least a basis for beginning to address the problem but, unfortunately, even in its own description it is not a solution to the horrendous task of finding jobs for our young population and indeed for older people, many of whom feel themselves to be on the scrap heap in middle age.  As a nation, we must make unemployment our top priority, an economic imperative which takes precedence over all other economic imperatives.  All other economic requirements should be measured and addressed only on the basis of how they impact in relation to unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are two other issues on which to make a brief comment.  One is an appeal to two Ministers in particular, the incoming Minister for Labour and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, both new to their portfolios. The national broadcasting station has not provided proper coverage &mdash; and cannot in the present industrial climate &mdash;of the momentous political happenings of recent weeks.  It is imperative that the national television radio and broadcasting services are restored.  I request the two incoming Ministers to please intervene directly and to try to bring about a resolution of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The second issue is a parochial one. We have seen again in yet another announcement of ministerial appointments the counties of Wexford, Wicklow, Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford, the south-east corner of our island, left without a seat at Cabinet.  Signs on it, in recent years in terms of unemployment and infrastructural development, the views and voice of the south-east are not reflected adequately at Cabinet.  I greatly regret that.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a modern and young Republic with talent and resources which have never been properly channelled and focused for the real benefit of the nation. As a people we often thrived and prospered abroad in a way in which we seemed unable to do at home.  It is now necessary for all of us to seek to release that talent and nurture it at home.  The experience of the Fianna Fáil and Fianna <Col N="1582" /> Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments since 1987 does not fill me with great promise or hope.  The last two Governments have been backward looking, stale and always surrounded with at least a whiff of scandal.  There were those who were in and those, the great majority, who most definitely were out.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would have preferred a general election to allow the people to have their say on the performance of the Government over the last two years and who should sit in the Taoiseach's office this evening.  I believe there is a wish and a growing and significant demand for a new Ireland, more open, more equal and more modern, that this incoming Government would not even recognise, much less be able to respond to.  However, I remain an optimist. I wish the incoming Ministers well in their respective onerous ministries and for the sake of the new Ireland, I wish them a short term of office.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil don Taoiseach nua agus don Rialtas nua.  I wish the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, well in his retirement.  I also send my best wishes to Mrs. Haughey.  I congratulate the former Taoiseach on his endeavours as Taoiseach, Cabinet Minister and Member of this House.  Irrespective of what has been said in private or public debate, I think it is acknowledged both inside and outside this House, regardless of one's political leanings, that he was a brilliant parliamentarian and a man of enormous skill and ability.  Irrespective of the cut and thrust of debate in this House, no matter how much heat or venom was generated within the House, he was always a man of unfailing courtesy. I very sincerely wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the incoming Taoiseach well.  As I said in the <i>Irish Press</i> last week when I was asked to define the strong and weak points of the various contenders for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party, what made Deputy Reynolds unique was that he seemed to be able to separate the issue from the personality and to bring his <Col N="1583" /> business-like skill and approach to bear in the various Cabinet portfolios he has held.  I am sincere in wishing him well and I hope he will have the success he is obviously looking for in energising the Government, which they certainly need. His selection of Cabinet Ministers has stamped his trademark and authority on the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not without sympathy for some of the former Ministers.  In dealing with dynasties, the Taoiseach has certainly wielded the scalpel with some considerable effect.</P>

      <P>Gone are the Collins's, the Burkes, the Lenihans, both male and female, and the Daverns.  Into the cabinet has come Deputy McCreevy, Minister for Social Welfare.  One of Deputy McCreevy's unique characteristics has been his lack of spleen in any contact he has had with the Opposition parties.  On radio and television he always manages to acquit himself with a considerable amount of media and communication ability; he has always managed to bring his own particular stamp of independent thought to Fianna Fáil.  I believe the inclusion of Deputy McCreevy in the Cabinet will have a considerable beneficial effect.</P>
      <P>The nomination of Deputy David Andrews as Minister for Foreign Affairs has been welcomed by Members on the Opposition benches as an enlightened move.  Deputy Joe Walsh has managed to acquit himself with extreme effectiveness in all his junior Ministries.  I am delighted that Cork has at last been acknowledged as having the right to have a senior Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the make-up of the Cabinet one is struck by the fact that it seems to be largely Progressive Democrats oriented. Deputy McCreevy was one of the bridgeheads between the warring factions in the post-1989 election scenario.  He was one of the go-betweens on that occasion in cobbling together the new Administration; Deputy David Andrews was of <Col N="1584" /> the same ilk; Deputy Joe Walsh could be described as an honest broker in the talks, and there but for the grace of God or something else, Deputy Séamus Brennan almost became a member of the Progressive Democrats.  It will be very interesting to see how the new partnerships gel together, or is it a case that the marriage is virtually complete bar the consummation?</P>
    <P>This is a courageous Cabinet.  There is no doubt about that.  However, I believe the changes are an acknowledgment on the part of the incoming Taoiseach that the previous Cabinet failed in relation to their economic remit, they failed to resolve the social problems, which still have not been tackled, and they failed to energise the country.  If ever this country needed inspiration it is now.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Education is Deputy Séamus Brennan.  He is a man of enormous experience and I sincerely wish him well in dealing with what is one of the most onerous portfolios.  Before I deal with the area of education, I should like to say I am happy that my fellow countyman, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, has been brought back into the Cabinet.  As a west of Ireland Deputy we would prefer if he had got an economic portfolio, but failing that, from the point of view of the resuscitation and resurgence of the west we would like to have seen him get education. I say this to the Taoiseach in all good faith; the outstanding undelivered promise for a regional technical college for County Mayo, which has the third highest participation rate in third level education, is our due.  The people of Mayo would have seen the appointment of Deputy Flynn as Minister for Education as a clear signal from the Government that they would at last deliver on that promise.</P>
    <P>In wishing Deputy Séamus Brennan well as Minister for Education, we are saying that, irrespective of how we laud ourselves on our educational achievements and educational system, we should not clap ourselves on the back too much. While our education performance is reasonably good by comparison with <Col N="1585" /> other countries, and while we have managed to hold the line in relation to standards and performance, nevertheless there are huge gaping holes in the education spectrum.  By becoming Minister for Education, Deputy Brennan will inherit the greatest social instrument of all.</P>
    <P>Recent surveys have shown that our crime rate is soaring, our prisons are bursting at the seams and there are huge no-go areas in this city where even essential services, such as the ambulance and fire brigade, cannot go.  There are massive ghettos on the outskirts of those cities that are now wreaking the social havoc that was inevitable because of the haphazard way in which the cities were built.</P>
    <P>Education is the greatest civiliser, the greatest enlightener and the greatest moulder of society provided we can make it work.  We must ensure that the central plank of Government policy is education for all and education to the highest standard. Somebody once said that education is what remains when all else has been forgotten.  Irrespective of the degree of formal education achieved, we must encourage pupils to remain at school at least until they complete primary education. The subjects taught must be as relevant as possible and we must eliminate from the education system the type of porosity that exists at present, with a massive drop-out rate before any reasonable level of education is attained.</P>
    <P>Despite the manner in which we may vaunt our education achievements, after all the expenditure on education we still have the largest class sizes in Europe. At present there are 685 primary school classes with in excess of 40 pupils.  It is very difficult to educate such a class because you are talking about damage limitation, crowd control and containment rather than on education.  There are 4,000 primary school classes with between 35 and 40 pupils; 4,000 with between 30 and 35 pupils and 3,800 classes with between 25 and 30 pupils.  In all, there are over 11,000 classes in which the official pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1 is exceeded.  The minuscule changes in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social <Col N="1586" /> Progress</i> will have no major impact on class sizes.  It is quite obvious that what we should be targeting is a maximum class size with positive discrimination in areas of disadvantage, particularly in terms of the massive social problems in the suburbs of this city.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited one of the schools which features prominently in the Sunday papers in terms of looting and burning of cars.  The school principal, when looking down the classhall, said he could point out the people who might be featured in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in two years' time. That is a sad indictment of the fact that we cannot keep these pupils in the education system.  I make a particular plea to the incoming Minister for Education to consider as his number one priority remedial teaching.  Of the 3,400 primary schools only 300 have remedial teachers.  Yet, it has been proved that between 11 and 12 per cent of children entering primary school require specialist remedial teaching. If we cannot deliver an educational service to each and every individual at primary level, what hope is there of delivering it at second or third level?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tackle what is an impending civil war at second level. Given the decline in population and the fact that the number of children leaving primary schools will drop by 110,000 between now and the end of the century, we are on the brink of an educational civil war at post primary level.  In rural communities post-primary and vocational schools are vying for a diminishing number of pupils.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge in a positive fashion the requests from the various catchment areas and post primary centres to immediately set up a task force with a view to rationalisation.  It would make economic sense, social sense and good education sense, and it would result in a much healthier environment in many post primary centres.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of free education. By introducing free education in the mid-sixties the late Donogh O'Malley left a massive imprint on the whole social services in this country.  As a result of bringing onstream new subjects and the <Col N="1587" /> introduction of modern languages, intermediate and leaving certificates to vocational schools and a whole range of certification, additional teachers were appointed.  At present teaching is becoming a greying profession.  The education system is beginning to suffer from arthritis or a hardening of the arteries. There are many teachers who are incapable of coping with the demands of the modern classhall.  The changing system in terms of discipline, new methodology and subject choice and range poses challenges to people who are simply incapable of coping with them, particularly in view of the fact that we do not have in place a proper in-service regime.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to introduce an ongoing early retirement scheme, first from the point of view of giving people suffering from lethargy the option of retiring and, secondly, from the point of view of employing the thousands of highly skilled, highly motivated young graduates who are champing at the bit to get into the system and who have much to offer.  I ask the Minister to introduce some of the obvious innovations that are necessary such as teen teaching and a proper system of career breaks to ensure that young people may avail of the service to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Last Friday week in the region of 50,000 young people signed their CAO and CAS forms for entry to third level education.  The die is now cast for these people.  They have made their choice of subjects and courses and their choice of career, and in many cases there is no going back.  Recently when I asked the former Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, a parliamentary question as to the number of career guidance counsellors I was amazed to hear that of the 1,135 post primary schools only 380 have career guidance counsellors.  As a parent who has tried to wrestle with the CAO and CAS scheme I am in total sympathy with the 17-year old who tries to fill out such forms and also with parents who try to help their children decide on the multiplicity of subjects that are available. <Col N="1588" /> I have no doubt that due to the lack of career guidance teachers many people made the wrong choice last Friday week, resulting in drop-outs from college and people opting for a career that is not suited to them.</P>
    <P>It is fundamental that on completion of their education young people should have available to them professional advice and assistance and towards this end I would ask the Minister to avail of the talent of unemployed teachers and graduates.  He should introduce a crash course for career guidance counsellors so that one career guidance counsellor is provided, if not for every school at least for every three or four schools.  I also ask the Minister to provide that career guidance counsellors be available in schools during the two weeks after the announcement of the leaving certificate results to give the pupils the benefit of their advice as to the career they should follow.  As a <i>quid pro quo</i> these teachers should be given two weeks holidays in September.  It is unacceptable that pupils who completed their leaving certificate and are faced with a range of choices as to the career they should follow do not have the advice of career guidance counsellors because they are on holiday.  That matter should be considered by the Minister and some arrangement should be made whereby students have the benefit of professional advice at such a crucial time in their lives.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take note of what is quite obviously pledged as a fundamental plank of European union.  The Maastricht Summit recognised the central role of education in relation to European union.  It laid emphasis on technical, technological, vocational and practical education and looked at the range and choice of subjects at second level.  This was also alluded to in the Culliton report which reiterated the need to reorientate education to put greater emphasis on and to provide more resources to both vocational and technical education.</P>
    <P>The issue of European Social Fund grants will be a hot potato for the new Minister for Education.  What the Minister is doing is importing into the ESF <Col N="1589" /> system all the anomalies, inequities and wrongs of the current higher education grant system.  By so doing he is not levelling the playing field.  You do not pull one group up by pulling the other group down.  If you are going to level the playing field you take everybody up to the same level.  I urge the Minister, rather than going ahead with this very devisive move in September 1992, to set up an all-party committee, an expert review group or committee, to examine the whole area of higher education, the inequities, injustices and anomalies in the present scheme and keep the existing European Social Fund grant system in place until such time as that is done.  Having been lobbied by and received representations from PAYE parents, middle income parents and the students themselves, I know that the issue is a powder keg that will explode.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to do the sensible thing&mdash;to buy time by setting up a committee which will involve the students, the parents, the relevant Departments and Members of the European Community. If they do not provide jobs, if the European Community is part and parcel of providing a twin pincers movement by way of GATT and Common Agricultural Policy and agriculture is going to suffer, then I believe the Community has a social and moral obligation to provide us with education.  It is recognised that this country has become the education conveyer belt for top quality engineers, scientists and technologists for Germany, Italy, France and other member states.</P>
    <P>The waiting is now over, the Cabinet has been announced and it is now down to business.  Ireland is a country with great potential but we have frittered away a lot of that potential; we have failed to tap many of our indigenous resources; we have a high degree of potential self-sufficiency if we could only get our act together.  There is so much work to be done and so many are unemployed, it is a case of producing a blueprint to bring the twain together.  That is a formidable task.  In tackling it the Taoiseach and incoming Cabinet will have everybody's <Col N="1590" /> gratitude.  We will suspend judgment we will wait and see.</P>
    <P>I wish the Taoiseach and the Members of his Cabinet well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley):</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in my capacity as leader of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>Today must mark the start of a new era of policy focused politics in this country which is so desperately needed as we grapple to resolve the many social and economic problems facing us in the South and the scourge of terrorism in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The past 15 years especially have been dominated by the politics of personality here, personified by and often deliberately focused on the careers of the country's two last Taoisigh.  Deputy Haughey and Deputy FitzGerald.  There is no doubt, of course, that outstanding personalities&mdash;as they both undoubtedly are&mdash;will wield disproportionate influence, particularly from the political pinnacle of the Taoiseach's office, but at the end of the day, it is what Taoisigh and their Governments do, how they affect and alter the welfare of people's lives rather than their personalities, which should be the real basis of politics and political endeavour.</P>
      <P>Since our foundation just over six years ago, the Progressive Democrats have sought to assert the dominance of policy over personality in Irish politics.  Because that is what really matters for our people, even if they do not always fully realise it.  I believe we have demonstrated our commitment to this principle on many occasions, most especially at the time of the formation of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna Fáil Administration in July 1989 when both parties managed to put aside personality considerations and agreed to devise a radical and far seeing Programme for Government, which is serving this country very well in many important spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment of the Progressive Democrats to getting things done in Government is further underlined by the even more comprehensive contents of the <Col N="1591" /> revised Government Programme, adopted on 18 October last.  Quite understandably the constant interruptions caused by the political events of the intervening period since October have led to a delay in meeting various deadlines established in that programme. However, I and my party confidently believe that renewed effort and energy will be applied by all members of the new Government to implementing the various policy commitments of the programme in the coming weeks and months.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the overriding objective of the new Government must be to advance a whole range of inter-related economic, social and institutional reforms that taken together will effectively tackle the unemployment crisis, which is the foremost domestic issue facing us in this Republic.</P>
    <P>These reforms include maintaining strict control of public spending, and getting our overall borrowing requirement down to 1.5 per cent of GNP next year, in accordance with the Government progamme; continuing the radical pro-jobs tax reform programme, on which such a decisive step was taken in the recent budget so as to create a tax system that is simple, equitable and transparent, and which promotes greater output, and encourages work and enterprise; implementing the comprehensive reform of industrial policy advocated in the splendid Culliton report, which I commissioned in June of last year; protecting and promoting our vital agricultural and food sectors in the light of the radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy that is now going on and the changes and pressures emanating from the current Uruguay Round of GATT talks; further developing and improving our vital social services, especially in the fields of health care, social welfare, the penal system and caring for children at risk; successfully prosecuting the referendum to adopt the Maastricht Treaty which heralds an era of intensified European integration, and the creation of a more unified Europe in economic and monetary terms first and then perhaps in <Col N="1592" /> political terms: undertaking major institutional reforms affecting how our democracy functions, from updating the archaic procedures of the Oireachtas to delivering meaningful local government to local communities.</P>
    <P>If one wants to reflect on just how the procedures of the Oireachtas need updating, I would remind Members that they are at liberty to say far less inside this Chamber in their capacity as elected Members of the Dáil than they are to say it outside the door or on the street in their capacity as private citizens.  That is fundamentally wrong; modernising our whole legal code; ensuring proper accountability by the State, its agencies and by business at every level; protecting and further enhancing our natural and built environment, so vital not only to the quality of life of our own people, but crucial to the development of key industrial sectors like the food industry and tourism.</P>
    <P>Those are just some of the policy priorities of the Progressive Democrats. They are comprehensively addressed in the Programme for Government and I am confident that the new Administration taking up office after today will quickly address the missed deadlines that have occurred and will set about vigorously implementing the programme.</P>
    <P>One of my priorities in my departmental area is to implement the radical agenda of reform in industrial policy outlined in the Culliton report.  To be successful, no such reform programme can be confined to a narrow definition of industrial policy, which we have had here for perhaps too long.  The Culliton report makes that clear.  The reform must also address many related issues, including energy policy, education, transport infrastructure, telecommunications, natural resource development and much more.</P>
    <P>While this Government naturally must within our own jurisdiction give priority to the unemployment crisis, the continuing and worsening carnage in Northern Ireland must also dominate our thinking.</P>
    <P>The tragic events of recent weeks appal <Col N="1593" /> every decent person.  How can such evil lie in the hearts of certain people that they can coldly and ruthlessly blow up a busload of workers or indiscriminatly shoot up a bookies shop full of people? Those evil people must be afforded no hiding place; no possible label that they might put on themselves of Republicanism or Loyalism can be allowed to mask their awful deeds.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that today's meeting at Downing Street between the British Premier and the Northern constitutinal party leaders offers some hope.  It is essential that the Brooke talks, so fully supported and encouraged by our own Government, resume as quickly as possible and that they should not continue to be deadlocked by considerations relating to the outcome of the upcoming British election.</P>
    <P>For our own part in the Republic, I believe that we must try and try again to reach out and build greater understanding with the people of Northern Ireland.  In particular, we must also make it clear that this State has no predatory designs on either the people or the territory of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the prominence that the Taoiseach accorded the Northern issue in his first press conference and also his indication that contentious issues such as Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution are negotiable in any talks embracing the Republic and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have since our foundation favoured comprehensive constitutional reform in this State, relating not only to matters directly affecting Northern Ireland but also to more accurately enshrine and reflect a caring and liberal civil rights ethos in our own society.</P>
    <P>We believe that so far as our present Constitution is concerned it is necessary to look again at the territorial claim expressed in Articles 2 and 3 and to make it clear, even in advance of North-South constitutional talks, that we are willing to revise these Articles and to refine them in light of the Anglo-Irish Agreement to reflect an aspiration to unity by consent, <Col N="1594" /> rather than a territorial claim of jurisdiction or domination.  In suggesting that, I remind the House that this is not a novel step that would be unfamiliar to Members of this House but was a central recommendation of a committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas which was set up by the late Seán Lemass in 1966 and which reported to the two Houses in 1967.  We should remind ourselves that 25 years have passed since then.</P>
    <P>One of the truly tragic dimensions of the Northern Ireland question is that while evil men on both sides of the community intensify their efforts to perpetuate civil strife and to render the coming together of both parts of this island ever more remote, developments at the wider European Community level are actually bringing the peoples of these islands institutionally closer together every day.</P>
    <P>The creation of a single Europe, with the free movement of people, goods, capital and services, is accelerating by the day.  Last Friday, although it passed virtually unnoticed here we had the historic signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which must be subsequently ratified by referendum of the Irish people later this year.</P>
    <P>That referendum campaign is of a vital importance to the future welfare of this country.  This week its significance in pure economic terms will be graphically underlined when the President of the EC Commission, Monsieur Delors, unveils the new Structural Aid Programme for 1994-98, which could see Ireland's direct aid from the Community rise to more than £1 billion per year after the conclusion of the existing Community support framework at the end of next year.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.  He helped in no small measure to bring about the historic Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government in July 1989 and there is no doubt that that marked a feat of real political courage of a kind that was repeated on several occasions throughout his career.  I also wish his successor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, every success and good luck <Col N="1595" /> as Taoiseach.  I pledge the fullest support of the Progressive Democrats to the effective working of Government as we jointly set about vigorously tackling the various social and economic problems facing the new Government.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I express the human reaction that there are people in the House now who served with me as colleagues in Government recently and as far back as 20 years ago who from today are no longer colleagues of mine in Government.  I regret that the nature of politics must sometimes require the unfortunate departure of people.  I recognise that fact at least as well as does any Member of the House.  Those who have departed the Cabinet are almost more in my thoughts today than are my new colleagues.  I offer them my thanks for the support and friendship I have known from them in Government.  I hope that friendship will continue when they are no longer in Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken the opportunity of wishing the outgoing Taoiseach the very best in his retirement and thanking him for the contribution he made to public life here.  At times that contribution was controversial but he certainly did make a major contribution and had a flair and panache that many people admired.  He will certainly be missed on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to extend the congratulations of the Labour Party to the new Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and his new team that he proposed to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of the nation is now placed on the Government, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the announcement of the personalities involved.  It is only natural that the constituencies of the new Ministers will show a certain degree of joy and happiness that one of their public representatives has been chosen to be a Minister.  There will also be sadness in constituencies that have lost a Minister.  That is inevitable and, as the previous speaker, Deputy O'Malley said, that is the nature of politics.  Those of <Col N="1596" /> us directly involved can understand the personal triumphs and sadness that follow elevation or demotion.  There is no one in the House who has not been touched by such personal occurrences in his or her political life.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for me to express my regret at the removal from Cabinet of my constituency colleague, Deputy Davern. Deputy Davern had only just a few months to settle into his new portfolio and become involved in the preparation of budget estimates.  His efforts in this area were cut short because this new Taoiseach said that he was going about his business on the basis of no promises or favours and that appointments would be based on ability.  Looking at the Taoiseach's new Cabinet there is no doubt that the Taoiseach honoured his commitment and has picked his own team with a certain amount of courage.  We look forward to a change in direction in the Cabinet as a result of the changes. New enthusiasm might have an effect in particularly difficult areas.  Some of the new appointees are certainly of independent mind.  We must wait to see if this new Cabinet is capable of dealing with the pressing problems facing us.  The new Taoiseach has never underestimated our problems and he will have the support of most Members of the House in tackling them.  Of course, the Opposition will be critical.  It is our job to highlight inadequacies, to point to where priorities are missed and to highlight areas of need.  I wish the new Government well.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party today highlighted some of our priorities including the crises in employment.  One out of every five of our citizens is affected by unemployment.  That figure is almost three times greater than a former Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, suggested as being totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The most up to date analysis of European unemployment figures shows that for the first quarter of last year Ireland replaced Spain as the country with the highest rate of unemployment.  In Spain the rate has stabilised at around 16 per cent while here it has increased from 15.5 <Col N="1597" /> per cent to over 20 per cent.  In some areas it is as high as 60 per cent and 70 per cent.  In parts of Dublin unemployment is at crisis point.  Over the last 12 months my constituency has suffered from job losses, bankruptcies and so on and people who are capable of work have been thrown onto the dole queues.  Carrick is a real unemployment black spot.  Clonmel has not been exempt from unemployment nor has Cahir, Cashel or Tipperary town.  The European Community statistics dramatise the frightening increase in unemployment in Ireland. This reflects badly on the Government who were devoid of any understanding about the proportion of unemployment in society and were unable to implement a real jobs creation policy.  They depended totally on creating the proper environment, on social employment schemes and on retraining schemes.  That is not enough.  This Government will have to show some initiative and they will be supported in that by Members of the House.  This support has been offered by all party leaders in their speeches today. We need to address unemployment as a matter of urgency, else we will condemn our young people either to unemployment or to emigration.  This would be a dreadful sentence to impose on young well qualified people coming from our schools.  It would be terrible to have nothing to offer them apart from an employer who will employ them only if they get a special grant from the Government. Creating a proper environment has not been successful in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach today said that unemployment is at the top of his agenda.  That is a welcome response from him.  I hope that Deputy Reynolds who, as Minister for Finance, participated in the previous Government will now have the vision to implement a series of concrete job creation policies which will in the short term discriminate in favour of the long term unemployed and in favour of youth.</P>
    <P>It was with regret we noted that the Taoiseach did not today take the opportunity to outline any programme for Government with his main priority being to <Col N="1598" /> tackle unemployment, and did not agree to a national forum on unemployment. Perhaps the Taoiseach wanted to choose another time to come before the House with his proposals to address this cancer of unemployment in our society.</P>
    <P>The 1992 budget was silent in many areas, for instance on health.  There was one small paragraph on the health services and one or two lines with regard to the handicapped.  After the last election everybody, including the previous Taoiseach knew that there was a crisis in health services.  Anybody with personal experience of health services knows that there have been shortages in this area for a number of years.  The health services are unable to meet any additional demands despite the fact that budget estimates will be produced confirming that additional spending is taking place. Because of inflation and further demands on the health services health boards cannot increase their level of service beyond the 1990 level.  They have to ignore additional demands which exceed the 1990 level of services which the Govenment have agreed.</P>
    <P>The budget made a passing reference to handicap, an area which has been shamefully neglected by the Government but which should be a priority for the new Minister for Health.  I hope he will remedy the neglect in this area.  I am concerned about the new Minister for Health.  Although he was previously a party colleague, I must say that I have heard him utter in this House the most extreme right wing comments on the health services.  He has always quantified the cost to the Exchequer of certain medical and surgical interventions as if to say that if something is too expensive we cannot afford it, irrespective of whether a person needs it.  The new Minister has referred once to new fangled operations. These procedures may be new but I suggest that they are needed.  Nobody asks to go into hospital.  It is traumatic to be told that you need to be hospitalised for an operation.  These matters are decided by professionals.  We should not criticise the patient if the need is established.  If it is possible to improve a lifestyle or to <Col N="1599" /> help save a life we should not put a price tag on the necessary medical or surgical intervention.</P>
    <P>Mental handicap has been of particular concern to all of us.  I pay tribute to Deputy O'Rourke, the outgoing Minister for Health, on showing some flair in taking on board suggestions we made in this area.  The Minister for Finance on budget day gave a miserly £3 million but she immediately responded by topping it up with another £3 million.  A total of £6 million added to last year's £4 million is still only £10 million over two years in the area of the handicapped.  Research documented by the Government's review group on mental handicap services indicates that the under-funding amounts to £27.15 million.  The parents of the mentally handicapped and the review group which brought out the document <i>Needs and Abilities</i> have identified need as being much greater than that to which the Government are prepared to respond.</P>
    <P>The incoming Minister will be made aware by all of us of the acute financial difficulties experienced by health agencies and others dealing with people who have a disability.  They have been starved of finance by the Government.  Since 1987 they have been subjected to more and more cutbacks.  During the general election campaign in 1987 Fianna Fáil used posters which declared that health cuts hurt the old, the poor and the handicapped, but in achieving office they actually increased the hurt in all these areas and they have not in the meantime properly addressed the need.</P>
    <P>The situation of families of people with a mental handicap has deteriorated in recent years.  The report of the Minister's group states there has been a standstill in budget terms.  We have documented the needs in this area.  About 2,000 places are required, some 600 or 700 residential places and practically 1,000 daycare places for persons with a mental handicap. Deputy O'Rourke as Minister suggested the introduction of a home care service for parents of children with a mental handicap.  That was welcome but it was not to be seen as a substitute for <Col N="1600" /> daycare services and long stay and respite care.  The introduction of the home care service could be viewed only as a welcome backup.  We hope the new Minister will address this area.  We have tried to assist him by publishing on behalf of the Labour Party a Private Members' Bill giving specific legal rights to people with a handicap.  Those rights would be enshrined in Irish law and the State could be found guilty of dereliction of duty if it failed to respond to those needs.  It is ironic that parents who choose to care for their children at home, thereby saving the State millions of pounds, are neglected when they cry out for State residential places for adults with a handicap. The Minister cannot afford to ignore their plight.  We call on the new Minister for Health to take action in this regard and we remind him of his social commitments in that area in the past when he was a member of our party.  We call on him to drop the right-wing attitude he adopted when he joined the Fianna Fáil ranks.  The comments he made on Health Estimates will not now be acceptable to the vast majority who are in need of a health care service.</P>
    <P>There is a financial crisis in the health boards.  According to recent press reports, most of the eight health boards owe between £30 million and £50 million to suppliers.  In some health board areas they have been refused supplies from ordinary suppliers who generally welcome such contracts to supply basic foodstuffs, health care products, drugs, medicines and so on.  At the end of last year firms were requesting that their names be withdrawn from the list of suppliers because the health boards were unable to pay them due to a cashflow problem.  That problem is still occurring, despite recent gestures by the Minister. It is unacceptable that any major agency involved in health care should postdate cheques or even run the risk of cheques bouncing.  The State's credibility is a little better than that.  From a business point of view this would represent mismanagement by the Department of Health who in themselves are major spenders of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> We realise that spending must be targeted to areas in need.  Money is a scarce commodity and must be used correctly,. We have tried to identify areas of specific need.  It is hoped that the incoming Minister for Health will be prepared to take a new and imaginative approach to the severe funding problem.  He must be aware this is no way to run a health service.  If he does not take immediate action to remedy current shortfalls, patients will suffer.</P>
    <P>We have all talked about the long waiting lists for essential treatments and interventions. It is sometimes forgotten that the treatment available to people when they get to the front of the queue and are given a bed is getting worse by the day, particularly in the case of long-stay patients of all kinds.  There is the scandal throughout Ireland of old age pensioners, holders of medical cards, who have no place to go because the community are unable to meet their urgent needs: They might not be ambulant and would need long term geriatric care and attention but there are long waiting lists for hospitals providing this service.  People are forced to go to private nursing homes and to supplement their meagre pensions by £70 or £80 extra per week to cover the cost. The outgoing Government with the co-operation of the House, passed the Private Nursing Homes Bill which permitted the State to supplement the cost of private nursing care.  Yet to date the Minister for Health has not introduced the necessary regulations to give effect to the provisions of that Act.  I call on the new Minister for Health to make this one of his priorities and use the £1 million provided in the budget for the care of geriatric patients in need, many of whom are becoming bankrupt because neither they nor their relatives are able to meet from their pensions the increased charges on private health care expenditure. Increasingly such patients are being accommodated wherever space can be found for them, with some non-ambulant patients being accommodated on second and third floors in dilapidated buildings. The attitude on the part of the Department that somehow or other all these <Col N="1602" /> commodity problems will be addressed, has meant amongst other things that such old buildings have been neglected.  There is no extra funding being provided to ensure that such people can remain within their communities as long as possible. I might here compliment hospitals and day care centres who have endeavoured to address this problem, many funded through public generosity.</P>
    <P>There is one reason only for all these problems, that since Fianna Fáil resumed office in 1987, in coalition, the proportion of national wealth spent on health care has declined annually.  For example, in the 1991 Estimates the proportion of national wealth spent on health care was estimated at approximately 6 per cent, failing totally to take account of the real GDP obtaining in that year, that figure being even smaller now.  The net effect is that, in real terms, we are spending nearly £200 million less on health care than we were a few short years ago.  The recent budgetary provisions will merely paper over some of those cracks.  They will not alleviate the cash flow crisis I have identified within the various health boards, stave off the potential bankruptcy of some major health agencies or allow for heating to be turned up in some of our hospitals if the weather becomes colder.  It will clearly be seen that our health system is deteriorating before our very eyes.</P>
    <P>One of the most tragic occurrences of recent years has been the shameful manner in which our nurses have been treated by the outgoing Government, having refused replacements, thereby forcing the nursing profession, a caring one, into taking industrial action and causing them and their patients much physical and emotional stress.  Unofficial work to rule and other such actions had to be taken by nurses in order to make the outgoing Government sit up and take notice of matters which have been a grave source of worry to them, particularly staffing levels.  This has been the fate of our health services under the outgoing Coalition Government comprised of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, <Col N="1603" /> causing a crisis it gives us no joy to identify here but which continues.  Therefore, we will be demanding of the new Taoiseach and his Ministers, in particular the Minister for Health, that the health services and those for the handicapped be given priority.</P>
    <P>The new Taoiseach has already made some promises with regard to what will be the priorities of his Government.  It is to be hoped that these promises will not be of an aspirational nature but rather will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are some new Cabinet appointments deserving of mention.  For example, the new Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, will bring a new independence and flair to his portfolio. All Members will welcome back Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, another Cabinet appointee, and in my constituency also the reappearance of the new Minister for the Environment, Deputy Micheal Smith.  He has been in and out of Cabinet, demonstrating that he has always been available and capable of accepting any portfolio allocated to him.</P>
    <P>I regret the passing over of the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke.  I regret also the passing over of the former Minister for Education, Deputy Noel Davern, a constituency colleague, and that of the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly.  I always found him most courteous within a very sensitive area touching on the lives of almost 1 million of our people, with 270,000-odd unemployed, people striving to penetrate the bureaucracy of the social welfare system in order to prove their means, availability for work and so on.  The former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly, had the courage in this House to commit himself to effecting changes, to ensuring that his departmental officers helped people rather than obstructed them in reaping their due entitlements.  He showed a certain amount of flair and courage which had already borne fruit.  It would be remiss of me not to extend my thanks to him for the manner in which he approached his <Col N="1604" /> tasks within a very sensitive ministry and to wish him well in the future.  There have been other personality changes, some shocks, some surprises, and other appointments coming as no surprise to us.  We wish them all well in their new portfolios.</P>
    <P>The electorate will demand that the incoming Government immediately tackle the priorities identified by the Taoiseach and Members of this House, for example, our huge unemployment problem, the crisis prevailing within the health services, that obtaining in the public housing programme with its long waiting lists of people seeking local authority housing.  It is to be hoped that the Government will meet some, if not all, of these demands, thereby indicating to the electorate that they are responsive to people's needs as highlighted from these Opposition benches.  The electorate have been shocked in recent months by the various scandals and crises that have occurred.  They look desperately to this incoming Taoiseach and his Cabinet to move away from them, into a new era, within which they will have a certain honeymoon period.  But I warn them that we will be watching, waiting in the wings, calling the shots, voicing our demands.  It is to be sincerely hoped that they will deal effectively with the real problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin my contribution by wishing the former Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, a constituency colleague of mine, well in his retirement.  I have had the opportunity to witness at first hand his personal generosity and great sensitivity to people's needs.  Indeed his successes, of which there were many throughout his career, owe no small part to his outstanding sensitivity to people and their needs.  He will be missed in Dublin North-Central constituency.  I should also like to wish the former Minister for Defence, Deputy Vincent Brady, well, another colleague from the same constituency, who lost his Cabinet appointment today.  Indeed ours must be the only constituency to have lost two former Ministers on the same day.  I hope both <Col N="1605" /> of them will have bright futures in their chosen activities.</P>
      <P>The incoming Government face a daunting task.  I was disappointed at what I detected to be complacency on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the scale of our economic problems and what needed to be done to tackle them.  The truth is that our economic policies of the past 20 years have failed dismally.  One need look only at the year 1991, supposed to have been a record year for growth, when the new Taoiseach boasted of his part in having boosted growth.  Yet that was a year when 5,000 additional jobs were lost; there were 5,000 fewer people working at its end than at its commencement, despite the so-called great improvement in growth.  There were 43,000 additional people unemployed; it was a year in which the number of young unemployed grew by a massive 23,000, 40 per cent more of our young people being unemployed at the end of that year of so-called outstanding growth.</P>
      <P>It is extremely depressing to examine the pattern of unemployment among our young people.  I examined the recently published 1991 Census figures giving information on where people attending school, aged between ten and 14 years ten years ago, were now.  Of those 340,000 we discover that an alarming proportion, 76,000 in fact, had emigrated already, that almost one-quarter of those students who sat in our classrooms ten years ago, before reaching their early twenties, had already emigrated.  No more revealing statistic of the failure of our economic policies could be produced than that.  We have failed dismally to produce the growth in employment that people needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, we have failed our young people in many other areas, not least in education.  Of those young people who were in our schools aged ten to 14 &mdash; ten years ago &mdash; 25,000 left school without any qualification.  In a survey of their employment experience in the five years after they left school it was shown that they had spent half of their time out of work.  Those 25,000 people are facing the <Col N="1606" /> most dismal employment prospects, they are already in a category which will lead to long term unemployment unless there is effective intervention to deal with their needs.  In Dublin it is extraordinary that one-third of children of working class families are leaving school without any qualification.  If the Government want to intervene and produce effective policies to tackle unemployment they have to intervene at that level.  We cannot allow a situation to continue in the city of Dublin where so many people are leaving school without any qualification that can give them a decent hope of obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>In 1974, long before I was a Member of this House, I was working as an economist in research.  At that stage the self-same analysis of the problems of our industrial policies were presented to us.  To hear the Minister say that something new and exciting has come from the Culliton report is beside the point.  It was recognised in 1974 that we were developing a foreign sector that did not have sufficient linkages to the Irish economy and that the capital grants being offered to foreign industry were not suitable to develop the indigenous sector.  To hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, say we now had the great blueprint for the future in the Culliton report is disheartening to say the least.  These issues have been around for a long time, the Minister has been responsible for industrial policy for a long time and there has not been any enhancement in performance from our indigenous industries sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the small moves in taxation this year as if this was the major breakthrough that would transform employment performance here. There is no evidence that any of the tax changes, small and modest as they were, will produce one job.  In the past few years we have seen the abolition of capital allowances which their author &mdash; the new Taoiseach &mdash; had hoped would produce jobs but we have not seen any growth in employment from the manufacturing sector as those capital allowances declined.  The evidence <Col N="1607" /> internationally of people who have tried to hinge employment policies on a simple reduction of a few tax rates is not encouraging.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister for Finance reintroduced a series of training schemes in the private sector.  People seem to forget that this same Minister, less than three years ago, abolished a similar programme which was then called the work experience programme.  Now it is called training in industry.  The same programme, the same idea he abolished three or four years ago is now reintroduced and vaunted as a great step forward, an answer to the needs of people who are out of work. That is not realism.  The Minister should re-read the speeches he made when he abolished that scheme and, perhaps, apply them to his present proposals.</P>
    <P>We have had nothing but lip service to producing a radical approach to our unemployment problems.  The budget did nothing about the poverty trap &mdash; one of the most practical things that could have been done &mdash; in which many people who are unemployed find themselves. That poverty trap is brought about because there is no recognition in the tax code of the burden of various household expenses.  People who are unemployed may have the advantage of differential rents and childrens allowances from social welfare but they cannot obtain similar advantages if they accept offers of low paid work.  We are trapping people in unemployment by failing to deal with those poverty trap issues that have been highlighted in report after report.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Culliton's proposal to break-up or reorganise FÁS. Only a few short years ago the Minister for Labour told us that the reorganisation which was consolidating FÁS would give us a great leap forward in employment. Now by breaking up FÁS we hope to have a leap forward in employment. Those are not realistic options.  The Government should face up to the fact that we need new ideas in the employment area.  They should sit down with the best from all sides of the House, from the social partners, the unemployed and the <Col N="1608" /> disabled who are excluded from the social partners, in a consultative process which will put before us a vision of an Ireland that can produce worthwhile employment for its people, be they low education achievers, persons with a disability or whatever their position.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the health area.  I am disappointed to see that Deputy O'Rourke was not retained in her portfolio. Many people looked to Deputy O'Rourke's energy in addressing policy issues to bring about improvements in the health sector.  I am sorry to see her go before she had an opportunity to fulfil the hopes she raised among many people who are interested in the health sector. The past few years in the health sector have been disappointing.  Last year a series of panic measures were introduced to deal with budgetary problems, all of which hit directly at patients.  The Government brought in tough measures to reduce the ability of patients to get refunds on their drugs and introduced measures to attack the VHI's funding base which was already precarious and took money from people who are members of the VHI in a way they had no right to do.  The Government introduced bizarre arrangements to handle accident and emergency services in Dublin under which two of the hospitals were taken out of the system each night.  None of those panic measures produced results in the health sector.  We have not seen any new thinking from the Government as to how they will tackle the major problems confronting our health sector.</P>
    <P>It was very disappointing that the Government did not tackle the two tier service which has developed.  Instead they institutionalised the notion that there will be good health care for private patients and a much inferior service for public patients.  The Government should have developed the notion of common waiting lists whereby people would be taken off the waiting lists, based on their medical needs.  Instead the Government agreed to a system that will separate completely public and private.  None of us need to be told that what we will have is a continuation of what we have had for <Col N="1609" /> the past four or five years: those with money in their pockets can have any operation immediately while those who cannot afford private treatment will be put onto the end of the waiting list.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government published the scale of those waiting lists and we saw that 1,700 people are waiting hip replacement operations; 1,000 are waiting for cardiac surgery and 3,000 waiting for cataract surgery.  Typical waiting times in some parts of the country range from two years to three years for basic surgery which prolongs life.  It was a very retrograde step for the Government to introduce a measure which drew apart the public and private sectors in a way which had not been done before and accepted that that would be the norm in providing health care services in this country.</P>
    <P>There is another major problem that must be confronted, that is the problem of AIDS which poses a threat in this country.  We do not have any strategic policy to address that problem.  Official figures show that 1,100 people are infected with the HIV virus but most experts would accept that the true figure is probably three to four times that number.  At least 4,000 people are infected with the HIV virus and the number is still growing at an explosive rate.  As I said, we have no coherent strategy to tackle that problem.  Indeed, outside of Dublin there is virtually no service available for patients with the HIV virus or AIDS and the sad fact is that many of those patients will end up in London anonymously looking for care because in many rural areas there are no facilities to care for them.  It is crazy to expect that one could have a patient-centred plan to care for a patient with AIDS based on an allocation to a general practitioner of just £18.</P>

      <P>I was addressing some of the problems confronting us in the health area and would like to say that I wish Deputy O'Connell well in the health portfolio.  As I said, it is a difficult portfolio because he will inherit from his predecessors a series of unanswered problems.  Indeed, we are in the sad situation where the interests of patients are increasingly coming under pressure in a system which is visibly under strain.</P>
      <P>During the past few months general practitioners, ordinary family doctors, have notified the Department that they intend to withdraw from the GMS system.  In effect, 1.2 million of our people, the most needy, will be left without any health service if those general practitioners withdraw.  This has been brewing for a long time because the Government have not had an effective strategy to develop a proper general practitioner service that would answer the needs of their public patients.  We are now threatened with a withdrawal from the system and this could have devastating effects.  Sadly, the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, had to admit he had failed during his period in Government to provide a coherent policy on general practice.  I think we are reaping the sad results of his failure to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who looks at the health needs of the country will recognise that the first priority must be to develop a proper <Col N="1614" /> primary care service run by general practitioners but what we have seen instead is a continual move away from that with more and more patients going to accident and emergency departments and being referred to hospital.  These could be cared for effectively in the general practitioner's surgery, which would be much more cost-effective.  Money should have been made available to honour the promise made to general practitioners to develop their practices so that many diagnostic tests could be carried out in their surgeries and people with illness that could be stabilised in the community could be cared for properly in the community but we have not seen this development. I am not surprised many general practitioners are very frustrated at the way in which they have been treated by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another indication that patients are discontented and that there has been a lack of attention to patients' needs is the horrendous growth in the number of medical negligence claims during the past few years.  This year alone the cost of medical negligence claims will double, while patients are, increasingly having to have recourse to the courts because there has been what I would describe as a breakdown in communication in many cases where patients and their relatives have not been given proper information about their care and treatment.  If there was proper communication we would not have this growth in litigation which has led to so much money being diverted away from the health services.  A sum of £20 million is going to be diverted this year to what very often will be needless litigation in the courts.  This is money which could easily have been devoted to patient care.</P>
    <P>Patients are going to be very badly hit by the recent proposals of consultants to increase their private fees by up to 100 per cent.  In some cases they will be over 100 per cent above the sum allowed by the VHI.  People on middle incomes are trying to provide for themselves through the VHI and if these fees are increased they will find that the VHI will only cover half of their consultant's bills.  This will <Col N="1615" /> undermine the credibility of insurance which has been taken out.  Let us not forget that those people are entitled to avail of the public care system.  I believe we are building up a problem for ourselves because tomorrow if the 40 per cent who are members of the VHI choose to take up the option of being treated in the public health sector that sector will be strained beyound belief.  We already have waiting lists of two and a half years to three years long for basic surgery.  If those who have paid premiums to VHI find their cover has been undermined in this way we will build up problems for ourselves and the Government will not have the capacity to meet them.</P>
    <P>This year, again, the people of Tallaght are being neglected and forgotten as patients in our health service.  Only a few cannot know now that the population of Tallaght is as big as that of Limerick city. Yet, is has no hospital of any sort to provide care for its people.  It is among the most deprived parts of the city, on any indicator of economic or social wellbeing. There is high unemployment, low incomes, a low educational success rate, a high rate of marriage breakdown and many other social problems.  Once again, in 1992 those people are to be left without the health service they need.  It should be recalled that the proposal that a hospital be built in Tallaght was first made in 1980 and the first sod was turned in 1986 but here we are in 1992 and the people of Tallaght are left without a service.</P>
    <P>How is a single mother in Tallaght with two or three children and who has perhaps been deserted by her husband going to get to an accident and emergency Department with her family?  The Government must look at their priorities again, given that at a time when there is a budget of £45 million for investment in hospital services, Tallaght has been told that this will not be their year, and that they will have to wait for more reports and more studies before those commitments will be honoured.</P>
    <P>Handicapped people have been forgotten for far too long.  There was a small commitment in this year's budget &mdash; a <Col N="1616" /> sum of £3 million &mdash; to try to develop services but people conveniently forgot that the Government's own report on the needs and abilities of persons with a mental handicap indicated that in 1992 a sum of £23 million should have been set aside for those services, £5 million in capital spending and £18 million in current spending.  To answer the Government report with an allocation of £3 million is not facing up to responsibilities to people with a disability.  The demands by people with a disability are not for some sort of discretionary extras over and above the norm.  They are demands for basic rights, education for their children, therapy which eases a disability, a break from the task of caring for people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  They are demands for the opportunity of a placement when the task of caring is no longer bearable; demands for access to public buildings.  Look around this House; a person in a wheelchair could not get in here.  Most of our polling stations are the same; people with a disability cannot enter them and yet we talk about equal rights for our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, sadly, missed the opportunity to set aside some public transport facilities especially designated as accessible for persons with a handicap&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the Minister allocated taxi plates this year in Dublin, none of them was accessible to the disabled. I know that the Minister told me, in private that he had intended to address that on the next round but it is symptomatic of our approach to people with a disability that it will be the next round which sees their needs addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> there was a fulsome commitment to new policies for community action to help people with a disability but, seven days after the programme was signed, we saw the extent of the commitment in the 1991 budget.  The people with a disability were once again told, despite all that was in the <i>Programme for <Col N="1617" /> Economic and Social Progress,</i> that 1991 was not their year; 1992 is not their year either.  Let us hope that, under the new Government, 1993 will be their year.  As I said, these are demands for basic rights which able-bodied persons enjoy and the sooner we see legislation which enshrines the rights of people with a disability to access to service and to not being discriminated against, as they are now in access to employment and public places, the better.  That sort of legislation is on the Statute Book in the United States and is before the House of Commons at the moment but there has not been any mention by the Government in relation to such legislation.  I should like the new Minister for Health to introduce that sort of change.</P>
    <P>We also need a clear charter for our patients, which the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> promised.  The promise, which has not been acted upon, was lacking in many areas.  Anyone thinking of a charter for patients would immediately think that when someone needed an operation there would be a maximum time beyond which a person would not be asked to wait.  In the charter spoken of in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, we have not offered that right to patients.  If we were to decide on just one reform which should inspire the health policy of the new Minister, it should be that the patients' interest must be put first, everything must emanate from what the effect of the change will be on the patient.  That has not been evident in policy in the last two years.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a very important document, the WHO's health objectives for the year 2000.  It is very disappointing to see in the <i>Irish Medical Times,</i> which the new Minister for Health edits, the statement that we have failed to achieve the targets set for us.  Indeed, in relation to many of the targets, we have not even bothered to set up a system which would monitor our progress in relation to targets.  There has been no improvement in life expectancy despite the injection of £1,500 million to our health service every year.  There has been <Col N="1618" /> no improvement in absenteeism from work and there has been very poor progress in dealing with avoidable diseases. Despite reports on the need for a new approach to public health and to health care, no action has been taken by the Government on the proposals of the report to make public health, public health promotion and preventative medicine a real cornerstone of our policy.  Lip service has been paid to those needs but no money had been allocated to see that measures are implemented.  Successive budgets have become more and more dominated by the hospital budgets and less and less by community care, health promotion and the preventative aspects of health.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inherited a daunting task.  The <i>Irish Medical Times</i> when reviewing the prospects for 1992, said that there was a grim year ahead.  It also said that there was a need for very radical reform of the whole health system.  It hoped that the then incoming Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, would face up to those challenges.  I hope that the incoming Minister, Deputy O'Connell, will face up to those challenges set out in the editorial of his own newspaper.  I hope that in 1992 and the following years patients will have a guaranteed access to a service which will be equitable and that there will be a reorganisation in the health sector which puts patients' interests first in a way which, sadly, we have not seen so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I was amazed by the number of former Ministers who failed to be reappointed to the Government.  So much for the Taoiseach's assertion that selection would be made strictly on merit.  That some of the outgoing Ministers deserved to be dropped is incontrovertible; however, the decision to sack Deputy O'Rourke is quite amazing.  Everyone in this House will agree that she performed well in Education and, latterly, in Health. It was an opportunity by the Government to have more women in the Cabinet. Fortunately, they appointed one women, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, but that <Col N="1619" /> merely to replace another woman; an opportunity was lost to have two very able Deputies in Government and it gives the lie to the assertions by the Government that they were doing their best to advance the cause of women.</P>
      <P>Another disturbing factor also emerges.  Not only has Deputy O'Rourke got the sack, Deputy Woods has been demoted from the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Department of the Marine.  These two decisions show a very ugly streak in Fianna Fáil.  The new Taoiseach has, unfortunately, made a very bad start.</P>
      <P>I notice it does not appear likely that any change will be made in the set-up in the Department of the Environment.  I remind Members of the House that of course the Department is really the old Department of Local Government dressed up in fancy new clothes.  As I mentioned in my speech on the election of a Taoiseach, I feel very strongly that a Department of the Environment, completely shorn of their local government responsibilities, should be set up.  I have repeatedly called for this reform in the House but it has fallen on deaf ears.  It now seems as if this Department will continue as before, apart from a change of Minister.  The environmental protection cause is being seriously disadvantaged by the absence of a senior Minister with responsibility for this area.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to indicate at this stage that responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs is to be hived off from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In view of the very serious situation in Northern Ireland, I once again appeal to the Government to appoint a Minister of State with specific responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only long standing members of the Government are the two Progressive Democrat Ministers and one Minister of State.  These members of the Government have been reappointed to the same portfolios.  The time has now come to evaluate the records of these three Members.  The Progressive Democrats describe themselves as the environmental <Col N="1620" /> party.  I want to look at the reality behind the rhetoric.</P>
    <P>When one examines the record of Deputy O'Malley one finds failure on every count.  During his years as a Minister he consistently attacked the environmental lobby who seek to control dirty industry.  It has to be stated very clearly that far from creating jobs industry which pollute cause net job losses.  During his term as Minister, unemployment has increased from 228,000 to 268,000: the figures speak for themselves.  His continuation of the misguided policies of the Industrial Development Authority can only be described as a prime example of stubbornness.  Fortunately the new Taoiseach disagrees with the whole thrust of IDA policy.  In a notable speech made at the annual conference of Ógra Fianna Fáil last November the Taoiseach, in his former capacity as Minister for Finance, said:</P>
    <P>The reason for high unemployment was the over-reliance on international investment to create jobs.  Creating a native industry base takes longer, is slower and perhaps is not as glamorous as announcing an American firm coming in with 1,000 jobs, but it is the only way in the end.</P>
    <P>I could not have put it better myself. Presumably Deputy O'Malley, will receive fresh driving instructions from the Taoiseach.  Deputy Molloy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle; no offence was intended.</P>
      <P>Minister Molloy's performance in the Department of Energy has been a great disappointment.  His almost total neglect of all forms of renewable energy is notorious.  His failure to enthuse over the proposed EC carbon tax also shows his lack of commitment to the serious crisis in the area of fossil fuels.  The Green Party are totally opposed to his policy on the electricity inter-connector with Britain as it undermines completely our opposition to Sellafield.  With regard to Sellafield, the Minister has made no progress whatsoever in tackling this extremely serious environmental hazard. The Minister's espousal of the cause of the mining industry is also a source of grave disquiet.  His efforts to pressurise Mayo County Council to change their decision to exclude mining from their draft development plan is deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the record of the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, whose stint in the Department of the Environment has been a non-event.  Apart from legislation to ban the sale of bituminous coal in the Dublin area, what has she achieved?  The much vaunted Water Pollution Act was, no pun intended, severely watered down during its passage through the House and is of very limited value.  The Government's failure to progress the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency is deplorable.  The Bill to set up this agency was promised in November 1989, yet, almost two years later, it has not even reached Committee Stage in the House. Minister Harney is a well meaning person whose Department are starved of cash by a non-caring Government who only gave her this appointment to keep her quiet <Col N="1622" /> and out of harm's way.  Even her Progressive Democrat ministerial colleagues are doing all in their power to outweigh any slight improvements her best efforts can bring about.  This is a farce.</P>
    <P>The Minister is absolutely right in regard to one area about which she has expressed concern, that is, the setting up of interpretative centres in the Wicklow Mountains, the Boyne Valley, the Burren and the Dingle Peninsula.  I ask the Minister to use her good offices with whoever is appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to instruct these faceless fascists to cease forthwith from imposing these unwanted edifices on the public.  I would single out in particular the Wicklow scheme.  Wicklow County Council and all relevant local and environmental interest groups have expressed grave disquiet about this project and have asked that a decision be deferred for a short time pending further study.  This most reasonable suggestion has been turned down in a most arrogant fashion by the Office of Public Works.  This has now become a scandal of international proportions.  I will do everything in my power to stop EC funding for these projects.  Hopefully this will put an end to them.  I call on the Taoiseach as a matter of urgency to direct his Minister to order the Office of Public Works to lay off this issue.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other very urgent environmental matters which require immediate attention and I appeal to the Taoiseach to take a direct hand in these matters.  I am referring in particular to the threatened demolition of Howth House, the further disastrous tree felling at Coolattin Woods, the proposed marina at the Scellig Hotel in Dingle and the most undesirable developments at Carton House, County Kildare, and Powers-court Demesne in County Wicklow, two precious national resources which surely should be taken into public ownership. In addition, there is very serious disquiet about the huge dump of burned meat in County Roscommon which is seriously endangering the ground water there.  I could go on all night about the long chronicle of environmental problems <Col N="1623" /> facing us.  I have given but a few examples and if I have left out a favourite I can only apologise, there are so many it would be hard to list them all.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the unemployment crisis.  I shall deal more fully with this issue in my contribution on the budget debate later this week.  Suffice to say at this stage that none of the Cabinet nominations inspire me with any confidence that the Government have the slightest intention to even try to solve the unemployment problem.  The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, will be launching a very important policy document in this area next month.  I hope other parties will at least examine our proposals carefully as they contain much new thinking in this sphere.</P>
    <P>While I wish the new Taoiseach and Ministers well, nevertheless I want to put on the record my profound disappointment at the Cabinet appointments. Accordingly, I will be voting against this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a new Taoiseach and Government is a time of excitement and disappointment for many people.  It is a day which will be remembered by all Members, especially those who are promoted or demoted, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the contribution made by Deputy Haughey as a TD, Minister and Taoiseach to this House and politics in general. His was always a visible and vibrant political presence; always controversial and always taking a particular point of view.  I would like to thank him for his unfailing courtesy at all times in this House and for his deligent work in making available facilities to all Oireachtas Members.  I am sure that the accolade he sought of having worked to the best of his ability for the good of all the people will be acknowledged.  As a French author wrote years ago: <i>Heureux qui comme Ulysse a fait un beau voyage</i>&mdash;happy he who, like Ulysses, has made a great journey.  I take this opportunity <Col N="1624" /> of wishing the outgoing Taoiseach and his family every success on his retirement.</P>
    <P>This is a day of enjoyment, disappointment and even bitterness for some people.  Some families are jubilant and some are very disappointed.  The appointment to Government will mean a change in family life and increased responsibility for those concerned.  I wish those who have been appointed to the rank of Cabinet Minister every success and good fortune in his or her position. However, as members of political parties we have to deal with the consequences of the decisions taken today by the newly appointed Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds. It is imperative that everybody who takes on a constitutional role ensures that he or she meets their responsibility with diligence, vigour and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the interviews given by the new Taoiseach in the past weeks. It is obvious that merit, performance, ability, hard work and team-work are common denominators in his chosen appointments and as evidenced from the interviews given by him, those are the characteristics he was seeking.  One recent comment was that he would wish to see more women appointed to his team and that they would play a greater role in Irish life and Irish politics.  If the criteria for appointment to Government include merit, ability and performance why was Deputy O'Rourke, the Taoiseach's onstituency colleague, dropped from the Cabinet?  It appears to have been a case of vindictiveness but I trust that is not so.  While I certainly differed with Deputy O'Rourke in her capacity as Minister for Education she was able to deal with teacher unions which are quite diverse in their objectives.  She was one of the few Ministers for Education who ever received a standing ovation at teachers' conferences.  That kind of performance warrants a place in this Cabinet, and the new Taoiseach certainly has made a major blunder in dropping Deputy O'Rourke from her position &mdash; I am not here to defend her.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said recently the economy and unemployment would be <Col N="1625" /> his greatest priority as Leader of the Government.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures in every employment exchange should be available in Departments on a monthly basis as a measure of the performance of each Minister appointed today in terms of dealing with the economy and reducing unemployment.  It is a national scandal that human talent and energy is wasted because people cannot find jobs.  The performance of each Minister should be measured by the numbers unemployed. Meaningful jobs should be provided for these people, giving them the opportunity to use their talents and better their lifestyles.</P>
    <P>In regard to the appointments, the minor partner in Government were quite happy to be left in their Ministries. Deputy O'Malley who has responsibility for Industry and Commerce deals particularly with industrial incentive and job creation.  From an Opposition viewpoint the change in Cabinet positions has been quite dramatic at first glance.  To appoint so many backbenchers of such experience and political achievement is indeed historic.  I am not sure they will be content.  The Taoiseach has made sweeping changes.  Many people on the Fianna Fáil benches will be very angry that the Minister for Finance, a young man with a vision of Ireland and capable of relating to ordinary people, did not have the courage to let his name go forward for election as Leader of Fianna Fáil.  However, that is a matter for that party.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Government will be very confined in their work when one considers the economic constraints on them and on the Minister for Finance. The budget is only a smokescreen for the changes that will be made next year.  The granting of the special pay awards, the introduction of the Single Market next year, the drafting of Estimates later this year and the implementation of a budget in 1993 will prove to be extremely difficult. The 1992 budget will be seen merely as a smokescreen for greater changes to come.  As Seán Lemass said in 1966: &ldquo;The years ahead will be a great <Col N="1626" /> time to be alive, to be young and to be Irish&rdquo;.  We will have to wait a number of months to see if the amalgamation of minds and talents will result in a solution to the problems facing us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy remains Minister for Energy.  Deputy Garland referred to that Minister's pressurising of a local authority in regard to the implementation of county development plans.  I am not clear as to the law in relation to mining activities. The Minister for Energy instructed the local authority of which I am a member not to introduce a blanket ban on mining as it would be contrary to Government policy.  He said that local authority members should have faith in the planning procedure and in environmental impact analyses.  Yet the same Minister, for religious and historic reasons, introduced a ban in defined areas.  If we are to have faith in the planning process and in the outcome of environmental impact studies, why did the Minister give a direction to ban mining in certain areas?  This matter is of great importance to the local economy as well as to the national economy, and it needs to be clarified from a legal point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has been nominated as Minister for the Marine.  In the short term he served as Minister for Agriculture and Food he recognised from his experience the value of a scientific research into agriculture. As a result of his visit to the west and in particular to the institute at Belclare, County Galway, he declared that centre should not close down because of the value and importance of the research work carried out there.  I hope his successor will stand by that policy.  I trust that Deputy Woods, in his review of the law of the sea, will be in a position to ensure that Irish fishermen will have the opportunity to earn their livelihood off our coast, thus creating the necessary on-shore jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan has been nominated as Minister for Education.  I said previously that the former Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was enlightened in her ministry and she at least livened up the Department.  I wish Deputy Brennan <Col N="1627" /> well, because that Department is often quite difficult to work in.  He will be dealing with a small segment of the overall budget and I trust he will be in a position to look after the interests of first, second and third level students.  It is obvious from all the surveys and studies that have been carried out that although in the next ten years or so more students will be emerging, there will be fewer opportunities for employment.  Obviously if they are going to have to go abroad to work, and this seems likely, they should be given the very best training and education. I hope the Minister will be able to strive at Cabinet level for further funding to ensure that resources will be made available for our students.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is obviously very capable, articulate and intelligent. However, I wonder what her personal view is on the Shannon stop-over.  Will it continue to be Government policy to retain the stop-over at Shannon or will it be a split decision between Shannon and Dublin?  What stand will Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn take on the up-grading of the Galway, Westport and Sligo lines?  Will she have sufficient clout to ensure that both Government and European funding will be provided for this?  I wish her well and hope she will deal successfully with communications, tourism development and other fundamental issues connected with her portfolio.</P>
    <P>The fact that Deputy O'Connell has been nominated as Minister for Health after a very long period in this House causes me to wonder.  I distinctly remember that in the late seventies and early eighties, Deputy O'Connell, then a member of The Labour Party was very enthusiastic, diligent and vibrant in his pursuit of health matters.  Were he to be appointed Minister for Health, I think he should have been appointed to that post back in 1973.  This is a strange appointment but I wish him well in this very difficult ministry.  I honestly do not see any great change being made in the numbers waiting for orthopaedic, cataract and other operations unless there is a massive change of heart at Government <Col N="1628" /> level, but the recent allocations to the health boards do not indicate that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith has been nominated as Minister for the Environment, a major, free-spending Department.  Deputy Smith is obviously a man of intelligence, ability and perceptiveness.  I wonder, however, if the recently reviewed Programme for Government will have to be reviewed again.  The programme states quite clearly that the proposed regional councils will be set up by the end of March of this year and that the sub-county districts will be set up before June of this year.  Let me say that every single councillor, Senator and TD from practically all the political parties is completely and totally opposed to setting up another layer of bureaucracy without teeth or finance, and requiring another level of administration.  Since the Government are unable to provide the finance to run the county councils; how in the name of high heaven are they to be expected to implement and set up a further layer of bureaucracy with none of these facilities?  This could well be the crunch issue between the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat elements of the Government.  As Deputy Smith comes from a rural constituency he would well know the state of the county roads and I hope he will be in a position to do something about them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews has been a Member of this House for 27 years, which is a very long time indeed and his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs is well merited.  He is a man of considerable ability.  Having served with him on the New Ireland Forum and on the British-Irish Association, I have no doubt that he will carry out the very great responsibilities given to him.  He is the tallest member of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has been nominated as Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>He was always considered the great white hope who had never been given a Cabinet position.  Having had so many near misses I trust that Deputy <Col N="1629" /> Walsh will fulfil the confidence so many people had in him.  He should start with a complete and total rejection of the Mac-Sharry proposals because of their consequences for this country.  If those proposals are implemented as envisaged, the flight from the land will increase by thousands.  Deputy Walsh has considerable experience as a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture and Food and is also a person of ability and understanding.  I urge him to take on the challenge on behalf of the farmers and the farm families of rural Ireland.  I hope to see his potential realised and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>I have known both Deputy Cowen and Deputy McCreevy for a considerable lenght of time.  They are both persons of ability.  My personal preference is that their ministries would be interchanged. Deputy McCreevy is a known negotiator and is able to deal with diverse opinions. Indeed I would remind Members of the very fine speech which Deputy Cowen made in 1985-86, when in Opposition, and in which he set out what should be done to provide training and employment opportunities for young people.  This should form the basis of his agenda as Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>I regret the removal from office of Deputy Dermot Ahern as Chief Whip. He is a young man of great potential and ability and no doubt his day will come. Having referred to the various appointments I now obviously must congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Flynn, on his reappointment to Cabinet. It is important for a county to have a voice at Cabinet.  The influence of Deputy Flynn is to an extent obvious in some of the appointments here.  I wish him well in what is a very sensitive Ministry. He has been given responsibility to deal with the rising crime rate, the vast Minister for Foreign Affairs, the tragedy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want my next statement to be taken in the wrong way, but I trust that my colleague, Minister Flynn, will comprehensively disprove what was written <Col N="1630" /> about him in the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial of 19 March 1988.  The Minister had been in America on St. Patrick's Day on Government duty and made remarks about the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which, he said, was then at risk because of a series of blunders by the British Government.  The editorial described my colleague, my county man, in the following way:</P>
    <P>This rambling, scarcely articulate interview on radio yesterday morning is proof positive that he has neither the training nor the ability and experience required to undertake diplomacy at any level.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that statement.</P>
    <P>The Government programme also refers to the White Paper on marital breakdown, which is to be introduced by the Minister for Justice of the day.  I know the Minister Deputy Flynn, had his own personal position on the divorce referendum and I am not sure about the way his appointment today ties in with the implementation of such legislation.</P>
    <P>Having made those few remarks in relation to Minister Flynn's appointment, I wish him well.  As I said, it is important to have a voice from one's county at Cabinet level and from that point of view I welcome his appointment.  I trust he will be in a position to influence other Minister and see to it that the problems in the west, highlighted recently by conferences called by bishops all around the country, will be dealt with as well as possible and that whatever resources and funding are necessary will be made available.</P>
    <P>The Government have been appointed and the new Taoiseach is in place.  Is everybody happy?  I do not think so, nor do I foresee the lifetime of the Government being extended for the period of the programme recently reviewed.</P>
    <P>I feel that while Deputy Haughey was leader and Taoiseach, particularly in the past 18 months, the first and most important criterion for Fianna Fáil Deputies was the retention of their Dáil seats and when that issue began to get very hot, people started to say that the scandals outside, <Col N="1631" /> the demise of the status of politicians and all the other bad things happening in politics, hinged on one person only, the Taoiseach of the time, Deputy Haughey. The former Taoiseach became the political blotting paper for soaking up all those claims.  Eventually, people within the Fianna Fáil Party decided they had to get rid of him.  The former Taoiseach has now gone, but I wonder whether all the scandals have gone away.  Will yet more scandals come to light?  Will the new appointees to Cabinet see to it that the Government is honest, open and transparent and that such occurrences can never happen again?  It was the desire of a great number of people to lay the blame for all those claims, on Deputy Haughey's personality.</P>
    <P>Will Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, be a strong leader?  In the words of an American President, the only valid test of leadership is to lead and to lead vigorously. I hope, for the sake of this country and for the sake of politics, that the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, does lead and lead vigorously.  I would not like the Taoiseach to become the chameleon of Irish politics, changing his spots on every political position, an expert in camouflage with the ability to change colour depending on the circumstances.  I would like the Taoiseach to lead this country. People will have the opportunity to judge his leadership within a short timebetween 12 and 15 months, if not earlier.</P>
    <P>Time is very short for the new Government. I wish them well in their endeavours but they should not get carried away by thoughts that a change of Ministry, a change of Department, or the removal of some to the back benches will do away with the series of problems now facing this country.  I say to all members of the new Government that since 1975 I have seen many changes in Government.  They should all work hard and deal with the issues within their portfolios as quickly as possible because, in politics, time moves very quickly indeed.  If the new Government do not get down to work immediately, then the people will sooner rather than later, have the opportunity to hold <Col N="1632" /> the Taoiseach and his Government accountable.  In the words of the Taoiseach himself, he not being an ambitious person, he does not mind and will not mind being held accountable for his actions.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Government well but I would remind them that their time is short.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief.  On the occasion of the appointment of members of the Government and this motion seeking approval of names that have been submitted to the House this afternoon, it is not very useful for us to go back over debates that have been held on the Estimates or to anticipate debates that might be held on the Finance Bill.  However, there are several very brief points that do need to be made on this occasion.</P>
      <P>One must immediately wish the new Taoiseach and Members of his Cabinet, particularly Members who are joining Cabinet for the first time, every success. I take the opportunity to do that now.  It is a very great honour and privilege to be asked to serve on the Cabinet of one's country, and if it is a great honour to be asked, equally those who are departing from such positions must feel a great sense of loss.  It is appropriate to identify and sympathise with the sense of loss that many may feel as they leave positions they have held and in which they have expended effort.  Too rarely in this House we pay tribute to what is given in public service, be that service as an elected representative or as a member of Government. There are certain responsibilities for which one must be always accountable and there are different policies that one can implement when one holds office, but to come forward, to hold office and to undertake tasks deserve recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the occasion of the departure of the previous Taoiseach, I must say that on a number of occasions, on matters that were quite specific, for instance when we were both working on the release of Brian Keenan, I found him to be very <Col N="1633" /> human, approachable and very courteous. I could give many more examples. I wish those who are not on the front benches any longer peace and further achievement in their lives in their own way.  That is important because there is a human content to politics.  It is not the only dimension because we are in a democracy, Government and Opposition, to serve the public.  We have to serve the public in terms of clear policy outlines and choices.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Irish politics has suffered greatly in recent months.  As I look across at the Tánaiste, I think he will appreciate it if I say that much of it had the character of a loose Lope De Vega farce with a new scene being added every week and the audience wondering when it is going to come to an end.</P>
    <P>My view of politics and representation is not cynical.  It is important that this new Cabinet address the growing gap between language and reality in politics. There is a sense in which it has been suggested that one can simply change the managers and life will change.  That is not a pedantic or a debating point because it has to change.  We have to remember, in this rather rarefied atmosphere, the 277,000 people who are without work, and their experiences.  Whether they succeed in watching the account of these proceedings on television or reading about them in a newspaper, sometime some of them will ask &ldquo;what effect will it have on our lives?&rdquo;  We have a horrific level of unemployment, about the second highest level of unemployment in the Community at about 19 per cent, crawling to over 20 per cent.  We cannot allow a honemoon period of any kind to these new occupants of office, because the unemployment figure is likely to pass the 300,000 mark before they become familiar with their offices and those who are unemployed are entitled to ask questions.</P>
    <P>It is very honest when people acknowledge where matters are wrong.  Because a new Cabinet might look at it differently, I will repeat, that it is possible to be mechanistic about an economy.  It has been said, and it is an abuse of language, <Col N="1634" /> a nihilism of which even Beckett would have been appalled, that the economy has been doing well in recent years.  The economy has been doing well measured separately from the people in the society it serves.  People point to indications of doing well such as low inflation rates, comparatively low interest rates, and a good trading balance, even though the export figures are highly suspect because of transfer pricing and the manner in which we are getting materials in at certain prices and selling them at other artificially high prices to avoid taxes and so on.  These are the indicators of an economy; therefore, what happens in a democracy when people are told the economy is doing well but that we have the second highest level of unemployment in the Community?  We cannot go on like that, because people will eventually take to the streets and say &ldquo;they in the House believe that the economy is doing well, but every one we see around us is unemployed&rdquo;.  To say that the unemployment figure is 19 per cent hides a great reality.  There are parts of this city, and parts of Galway, which have unemployment rates of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.  In some of the housing estates the percentage goes up to 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 60 per cent. I am simply saying we cannot sustain a democracy in which we say the economy is doing well while we have such massive levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental problem involved here, and here all the new occupants of office will encounter their first real challenge within days in office.  They will encounter an ideology which says it must be run the same as it is, that we must weather it out.  Weathering it out means letting the unemployment levels go over 300,000.  There has to be a fundamental resolution that is political.  Let us differ on it politically, but the view of the Progressive Democrats is honest and straightforward.  They have said, &ldquo;We are going to get the mechanistic version of the economy right and let the devil take the people&rdquo;.  Bluntly, that is what they are saying.  They are saying that if they get the economy at a particular level, if <Col N="1635" /> sales are up and so on, inevitably wealth will trickle out to everyone and that it will percolate to those who are unemployed. It is a fallacy, but it is open and honest.  The public are entitled to know from the new Cabinet if they believe the economy is composed of a set of instruments which can be used to achieve certain purposes, for instance employment creation.  This debate is as old as Keynesianism and politics.  It is as fundamental. I will not get involved in a tedious argument about what somebody else in power, did or did not do.  We are past all that.  There is a sense of urgency now about what we have to do.  We have to compose and define again the economy with a social dimension at its heart.</P>
    <P>Here is an interesting dilemma and for one part of the Government, let us say the Progressive Democrats, it is a very interesting forecast for what they perceive as the challenge of the next few years.  I also heard people on the Fine Gael benches arguing a most interesting point.  They take a target and say that our Exchequer borrowing requirement in proportion to our gross national product has to be reduced systematically to the point at which we play in the first league by such and such a year.  This is the inevitable outcome of Maastricht.  One could call that kind of political economic crudity a kind of a Maastricht philosophy.  It ignores what is likely to happen in relation to the number of people who will be employed, the number of people who will be on incomes of certain kinds and so on.  This is slipping away all the time from the annual accounts of this country. The question our wonderful public servants are always embarrassed to answer relates to the cost of unemployment. They do not like questions relating to the cost of sustaining high levels of unemployment which are growing.</P>
    <P>I want to be positive about it because there are things we can do in relation to these matters.  We have to be clear that if we say the Exchequer borrowing requirement to gross national product is the primary aim of economic and fiscal policy for the next number of years, we <Col N="1636" /> should be honest and say to all the families in the different estates that it is more of the same for them, and that they will be sending their children out of this country not to a Europe that is a land of milk and honey but to a Europe that is becoming more and more racist in its attitude to migrant workers.  I find it intolerable that this aspect is being ignored.  Already in every country in Europe there is a racism problem.  It is growing in France.  Monsieur Le Pen has been able to say he finds himself in line with French opinion in relation to north Africa.  It is true in Italy, it is true in Spain.  We may say that our children are white, that they are English speaking.</P>
    <P>It was at a precise moment in Irish politics that social planning and social aims in relation to the economy qualitatively changed.  I remember it.  When the first Programme for Economic Expansion was succeeded by the second they deliberately added in the economic and social programme because it was accepted that at the end of the day the economy was just a set of instruments but that the social policy was the priority, towards the aims of which the economy should be directed.  That was the debate in the Cabinet of the day.</P>
    <P>Gradually this rather dated thinking about economics crept in.  I have great respect for economists but in the end economies is about planning to achieve social objectives.  I could make points about this which are quite important. Any new occupant of a Ministry has to face the barriers which exist between different Government Departments, say Health, Social Welfare and Labour.  As more and more people become unemployed, it is possible that the carer's allowance could be cut and unemployment be reduced by identifying slots which could be filled in the social, caring and health areas.  These services could be recognised as valuable areas of employment in a community.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged to speculate on the difference in style in the Cabinet now coming forward.  There is no doubt that the biggest disease that the Irish economy suffered post-1970s was the manner in <Col N="1637" /> which the economy became speculative rather than productive.  A culture grew up according to which economics was mysterious and was about moving money in particular ways and so forth.  People became regarded as economic geniuses, people to be admired.  A whole class of people emerged who did not produce. They would have been our opponents in the old days.</P>
    <P>In the past people started factories, took risks, made sacks, buckets and spades and lots of other things &mdash; the Pierce agricultural factory in Wexford and many others.  They made things and sold them and sometimes went broke.  That class was completely obliterated by a new group of people who took the balance sheet of a company and saw that it was years since the assets were valued.  They claimed that the share value was understated. They decided to acquire the company, perhaps a small clothing company as in the case of Fitzwilton, and then there was Gouldings.  They collapsed one firm after another.</P>
    <P>The IDA were scouring the world with taxpayers' money looking for new jobs while these people regaled us, sometimes in their own newspapers, with what they ate at the weekends.  They were becoming the new landlord class, moving into the estates in which people like my father and others had hunted the English a long time ago.  They came close to politics and they have come very near to destroying the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will not be weeping for them nor will I be heartbroken. In a way the difference between them and the traditional Fine Gael Party was that in the case of Fine Gael they were at respectable large-scale rackets much earlier on, such as the Hospital Sweepstake and things like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a young Senator in 1973 I was canvassed by a Fine Gael Senator in the other House to assist in the removal of VAT from the stud fees of horses and at the same time as there was VAT on blankets for children.  VAT <Col N="1638" /> on horses erections in the Curragh were described as an attack on the bloodstock in the horse industry while at the same time the mothers of children were paying VAT on blankets.  That old respectable class of business had got involved in stealing the field from under the goose, as the old man had it.  They were replaced by this new group who came along in the seventies.  Just to ease the nerves about history, we will move on to the late seventies and eighties.  This speculative group which nearly destroyed this country, who write about themselves, think it is a mark of human excellence to fly your friends to your fiftieth birthday party and so on.  Nobody saw what they were producing.</P>
      <P>When I became a Member of this House I remember hearing a lecture from one of the longest standing Members, the late Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan.  I differed from him but I respected him.  The subject was the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance.  One he described as a mortal sin, the other a kind of venial sin with which you could be assisted by your accountant.  In the seventies and eighties tax avoidance became a good thing, a principle of economic development. I listened to budget speeches and Deputies never spoke about how good it would be to put an 80 per cent or 90 per cent tax on any shares purchased by an off-shore company.  I would have loved some brave Minister for Finance to say it would be illegal for an offshore company to purchase shares on the quoted market or on the lesser markets and to require anybody who had purchased them in the past five years to pay 80 per cent tax. That would put the frighteners on quite a few people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This breed, this parasitical scum with no loyalty to this country, replaced genuine productive activity, even by old capitalism's ordinary standards, by that kind of glorified theft, speculation and dishonesty.  The idea was to have an ostentatious lifestyle, rather like in Haiti, in which after a while you could involve nearly everybody.  Nearly everyone would have a drink with you in Ireland if you stayed at it long enough.  That is why <Col N="1639" /> we sank, and that is why politics sank.  It was not all of politics that was sinking; it was a particular group and class.  There was a great difference between that and the productive economy.</P>
    <P>I totally disagree with people who say there is something inherently wrong with us Irish.  It is part of the national disease that we continually sell ourselves short. I am not impressed by people who ask why Ireland is not like Taiwan or Japan, where four members of the Cabinet are currently on trial for bribery and corruption. These examples are hilarious.  I do not suffer from that national inferiority complex.  There are comparisons that can be made between the Irish economy and other economies of the same scale.</P>
    <P>People who look at the structure of the Danish economy will see that from an expertise in selling stainless steel equipment to the dairying industry they moved into selling stainless steel surgical equipment on the Continent, where they have a large market share.  They purchased patents and technologies.  There was a culture of economic production in Denmark and that culture was created by a partnership between semi-State companies, the banks' private industry and individuals.  It is irrelevant how many Governments came and went in Denmark or how many different shades of political opinion there were.  There was a capacity to capture technologies and patents and from that to create jobs in the agricultural structure, using value-added. It became a net importing country in agriculture.  Why?  Because it was reexporting finished agricultural products. We buy in Danish products here, for example, Danish pastry.  In fact, at one stage we purchased refrigerated stuffed Danish potatoes from Denmark that had products added to them which were on sale on shelves in our supermarkets.  The moment a country shifts its mind from a culture of economic production to one of economic speculation is a very important political reality, which is what has nearly brought our political system to its knees. <Col N="1640" /> These are matters terribly important to me.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that, within the Cabinet, there will be that genuine shift, in respect of which I wish them well, in relation to research, development and technology, belief in the capacity of people to do things.  That is not assisted by the type of nonsensical comment I heard this morning to the effect that some survey had shown we were the second worst in some European educational league but in support of which I heard no statistical source advanced.  Rather it was just another demonstration of the poor Irish mentality of which one becomes weary having listened to it over the years; contending that that is why the Irish are as they are.</P>
    <P>However, we can differ on this matter. For example, my party differs from others in relation to the role of the State; it is very fundamental, the ideology is not ours.  We are accused continuously of being ideological because we claim a role for the State.  In that respect all I would say is: what would there be here for any of these Ministers?  Let us take the example of the Minister for Energy: did private electricity suppliers produce the capacity to generate electricity here?  No, they had to be bought out in order to get going on electricity generation.</P>
    <P>One might well traverse every aspect of our economy.  For example, would we have had Bord na Móna had we awaited a couple of people hiring others with sleáns to begin cutting turf?  One might advance the example of Bord Gáis, indeed every semi-State body.  There is not any big ideological hang-up on this. It is economically logical that one needs companies that have the resources to undertake research and development, to develop new products, purchase technologies, hire marketing people and be sufficiently large to compete in the new internationally-traded economy.  Anyone who suggests that we are not going to live in a world of an internationally-traded economy is not in the real world at all.  It is all very well for us to think we could retreat to the days when one milked one's cows, grew carrots, heads of lettuce <Col N="1641" /> and the like.  That is nonsense.  The fact is we must have an economy firmly based in the real world.  It should be acknowledged that people who attack and destroy State companies are attacking our capacity to trade in the internationally-traded economy.  They are attacking and destroying our capacity to undertake research and development, engage in marketing practices and have trained personnel.</P>
    <P>Into all of this was imported an extraordinary philosophy borrowed, like every other bad thing, from across the water.  When something happens there, inevitably we get it eventually.  I have listened for years now to these lectures contending that there is no such thing.  I have listened for a long time now to the contention that somehow I am backward because I believe I am Irish; that I should be really thinking differently; that I should be telling my children: &ldquo;You are not Irish; you are part of the great march towards the EBR/GDP requirement stipulated at Maastricht&rdquo;&mdash; the contention that my children should live their lives by that yardstick.  I have no shame about being Irish.  This country has an enormous capacity.  People with inchoate motives spent much time founding this State, creating the capacity for us to sit on the seats in this Chamber.  Then there are the people who perpetrate this nonsense that perhaps we could have drifted off to some kind of patronised post-colonial or other arrangement.  They are missing the point, whatever their motives &mdash; perhaps they are unable to articulate them &mdash; that those who founded this State created the capacity for us to have a Government, to have an Opposition and for us to change the members of our Cabinet.  I respect that capacity and/or choice.</P>
    <P>That is why I say to the incoming Minister for Education, whom I knew one time in University College Galway, how sick I am to think of President, Chancellor, Emperor or whatever he is of the University of Limerick suggesting that the Irish language is not a sufficient requirement, as a European language, to enter Limerick University.  We are in an <Col N="1642" /> absurd position in which this destruction of national self-respect is taken to the point that, because there are other working/recognised languages in Europe, we do not have a recognised language.  We have a recognised language which is Irish.  We are being placed in the interesting position, according to &ldquo;Emperor Walshe&rdquo; in Limerick, that if we spoke one of the other minor languages of Europe, such as Catalan and Irish, we spoke no language at all; it is not a working language.  The mandate of his institution in Limerick, which is ours in that we pay for it with our taxes, is to educate our people, not Japanese, Taiwanese or others.  Indeed, he is operating <i>ultra vires</i> by breaking the Limerick University Act when there is a clear obligation on him to stop this nonsense.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, without being in any way disrespectful to you, I can tell you it will give me great pleasure, as someone who has taught in a university for over 20 years, to put a picket on this institution if he does not cease this nonsense in relation to the Irish language. He is typical of this anti-Irish, anti-national morale kind of thinking.  It should be rememberd that we run the place, pay for it, hire the staff, processed the relevant legislation through these Houses, gave it autonomy and deemed it to be an academic institution.  But then it is contended: I am sorry, Irish is not up to it, it is a recognised language but is not a working language.  That is what we have to put up with here.</P>
    <P>Certainly the incoming Cabinet would have my support in opposing that kind of attitude.  At present we have a very unusual version of democracy here in that, approximately 80 per cent of our people who work have money taken from them in taxes, redistributed, among other things, to education whereas approximately one in eight of them only can aspire to have their children attend these institutions.  That is called republicanism, an equality of taxes, with a tiny minority only able to continue into third-level education while, in the meantime, these new institutions spring up.</P>
    <P>A change of Cabinet is not a matter of <Col N="1643" /> changing the managers.  It is not a matter of changing personalities.  It is time when we are entitled to hear, for example, was the outgoing Cabinet's programme of legislation the same as that of the incoming Cabinet, or will the latter incorporate new legislation?  We are entitled to ask other questions, particularly of the younger members of the Cabinet. Indeed, I congratulate those incoming Ministers present, the Ministers for the Environment and Labour, Deputies Smith and Cowen, and their colleagues and wish them well in their ministries.  I congratulate, in particular, one incoming Minister with whom I had dealings before, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy David Andrews, and wish him well.</P>
    <P>I contend the choice is simple.  For example, are we here to discuss the representation of interests or are we here to discuss the representation of rights, for example, those of a woman who is unemployed, or whose spouse is unemployed, bringing her children to the clinic; wondering whether she will be back in time to get more children ready for some other activity and who is worn out.  A job would remove the insecurity; if she had an income it would help her, if she could have a decent house, instead of which she will be prescribed pills to keep her nerves subdued while she continues this treadmill existence.  She and her children have rights.  The incoming Ministers will be approached by people who represent interests, people who will say they represent this, that or the other interest group.  One of the fundamental differences &mdash; and it is up to the Government to disprove us &mdash; between the parties, when all of the people who have been attacking us have finished, is that the departure point for Left politics always has been the representation of citizens' rights.  That raises questions as to how citizens must be given them.  The economy must bend, if necessary, to satisfy their rights and interests must be tamed if we are to have anything that is democratic, no matter how many of us may not like it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> It is wrong in a society if, after a budget, those who are on the highest incomes are £60 per week better off and the people I have described are 60p per week better off.  We have to resist this ideology that will come from partners in Government, ideologies of individualism that do not accept or believe in anything like the social.  That is very important. This is a seedy aspect of a version of what is going on: I said it was like a Lopé De Vega farce.  We ask the people to believe a certain notion of what ought to be in politics and what ought to be in society: we might call these norms &mdash; the normative theory of politics &mdash; and they see something else happening.  Suddenly, gradually, the ethics of politics strip away and people say that if you really want to get something done you should go through a specific interest group.  In a democracy interest groups have to be represented but they have to be seen for what they are, lesser then the project of rights in any society.</P>
    <P>I wish the Cabinet well in tackling problems of unemployment and poverty. It is very important that we end this nonsense about poverty too because they will find in every Department an ideology that thinks that people, for example, are poor because of some of their own characteristics.  The explanation is in terms of poor individuals, poor families, poor districts, even poor cities, but people are poor because of the failure of the economy.  There are people who take on characteristics that are psychologically damaging to themselves.  They inter alise the facts of their poverty but until poverty is seen as a structural weakness and a structural failure you will continually insult those who are poor and you will never have a serious attack on it.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Cabinet well in getting past the ugliness of poverty.  The choice of Cabinet should represent the urban rural divide.  That is something we need now like a hole in the head where you have some people living in the thistles and others living under slumberdowns in the suburbs.  The reality is that we are all a whistle away from being peasants.  The majority of people who live in cities lived <Col N="1645" /> in the country not so long ago; the people who are living in the country surely had a visit from someone in the city not so long ago.  It is nonsense to say there is some kind of rural arcadia out there &mdash; we are country folk, let us start the barn dance &mdash; and meanwhile these people cannot talk to people who, unfortunately, by geography are living in the city.  That kind of primitive thinking is just that &mdash; primitive and ignorant.  I wish the new Ministers success in defeating that problem.</P>
    <P>People are chosen for Cabinet because of the expectation of what they can offer by way of policies.  This is too small a country for the kind of notion I mentioned of pseudo-pastoral or anti-urbanism. There is probably no country in Europe that has paid a higher price for its anti-urbanism than this country.  The suggestion is that, if we could all march into the past, to the time before condoms, if we could all march from the cities out into the rural areas where we would all be whistling like the corncrakes, somehow there would be no sin, there would be pure virtue and we would be as happy as the day is long.  Those sentiments used to be in the lenten pastorals of the thirties.  It belonged there and it read well.  Heroines went up to the city and lost their virtue and tried to go back again only to find they could not recover it.  God created man in a garden, the city is the result of the fall, that kind of nonsense is all over the world.  Let us hope that as the new Cabinet get down to their business they remember they are Irish people more than anything else.  I hope we will have the time to debate those issues again.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Andrews, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, will introduce &mdash; and I am sure he will &mdash; a foreign affairs committee to give us accountability in foreign affairs, to encourage participation by people and the public in decisions.  He will have our support in making that committee work.  I hope he and his Cabinet colleagues will restore our level of overseas development aid to make it possible for us to achieve the UN target at some foreseeable time in the <Col N="1646" /> near future rather than in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I hope the Gaeltacht and the Irish language will do much better.  I do not believe it has been significantly demoted in its prospects as it moves from the outgoing Taoiseach to the Tánaiste.  B'fhéidir go deánfaidh sé i bhfad níos fearr san áit nua ina mbeidh sé.</P>
    <P>While the Estimates are spoken for and at the same time there is a limitation on money, there is a possibility that so many things can be done if Cabinet members realise there are decision-shapers, decision-makers and decision-takers and they will be remembered by reaching in before the decision shaping case and bringing the prospective of rights into their Department.  As I said, I wish them well.  There is an advantage about being new, for example, Deputy O'Connell in the Department of Health. I am sure he will want to put an end to our being the laughing stock of the world where you are asked to produce a marriage certificate or show a ring before you can get a condom or whatever and suggest what one is supposed to do with it.  As a doctor I am sure the very absurdity of the whole nonsense will make him want to rush to the Department to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I plead with him to do something about the AIDS problem.  This fudging around and suggesting that some transcendental notion of authority claimed beyond democracy about the nature of life in the world and the cosmos and so on should stop us having an adequate AIDS problem is simply indefensible where people's lives are in danger.  He will have support from my party &mdash; and I am sure from the Left &mdash; in any comprehensive AIDS programme he may want to introduce.  There are many other matters which, I am sure we will have an opportunity of raising.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a personal plea to the Minister for Justice to do something about the Irish prisons.  I have to pay tribute to Deputy McCartan, among others, who continually raises the issue every time some unfortunate person dies in a prison.  I was a member of the McBride Commission, referred to in its <Col N="1647" /> day by a Minister for Justice as a self-appointed commission.  I visited prisons since that time and have visited a number of prisoners.  It is a terrible thing to lose your liberty, to lose discretion over your body, space and time.  What is happening in our prisons is an absolute scandal.  The new Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, could spend the next several weeks on a tour of our prisons and doing something positive about them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate and wish well my fellow constituency colleague, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who has already been asked by other Deputies to improve the train service to Galway, even before I get home on Thursday.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn every success in the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications.  There are many serious issues to be sorted out.  I know she will want to ditch the ideological antipathy towards public broadcasting that has preceded her, that she will want to deliver and make her name by putting in place Teilifís Gaeltachta, that in transport we will be able to look forward to the infrastructure in the west which is needed for development and that tourism will not become the threatening thing which Comhaontas Glas and others perceive it to be.  In other words we will be able to look at our environment sensitively without any of the compulsory interpretative centres which are threatening to drive most of our population into such deep trouble.  However one may have differed from one's colleagues in Parliment who have served in Cabinet they should be thanked for coming forward. One should wish them well on their <Col N="1648" /> departure and to wish the new people who will take office every success.</P>
      <P>So that all these proceedings might be more meaningful in people's lives I have asked every single Minister for Education to ensure that the subject &ldquo;political and social studies&rdquo; is included in the school curriculum so that we might have greater participation, that we might learn to know different options, that we might differ more meaningfully, and that our democracy might be more full.  It is perfect nonsense to bring trails of children to show them the outside of the building while at the same time deny them the opportunity in the curriculum of knowing what democracy is, how it differs from totalitarian systems and fascism.</P>
      <P>If we are ever to learn to live in peace on this island we will have to have exercises in the classroom where people will have votes on simple issues; they will then ask themselves how the majority, who having won should treat the minority, and what rights the minority, who have lost should have; and the minority might win on another issue.  Until that kind of subject is included in the school curriculum we will not have a vibrant democracy in which people will want to serve not only in Parliament but in Cabinet. If that happens in the classroom I can assure the House that it is very likely we will have as many women as men.  I wish there were more women in Cabinet than there are now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the task of following such an eminent speaker as Deputy Michael D. Higgins will be a very hard one.  He has certainly outlined in detail the problems confronting the nation.  I want to extend my congratulations and best wishes to the new Taoiseach and Cabinet in undertaking the task of trying to restore some semblance of credibility to the running of governmental affairs.  This may prove to be an impossible task for this new Cabinet but we should not dismiss or condemn them overnight.  We must wait and see the results of their stewardship, be it long <Col N="1649" /> or short.  Perhaps what was needed was a new Government democratically elected by the people rather than a new or replacement Taoiseach and Cabinet. There is an old saying that &ldquo;a leopard never changes its spots&rdquo;.  Very rarely, if ever, does a politician change his or her convictions.</P>
      <P>It is evident that our economy has been drifting along helplessly for the past two and a half years, like a ship without a rudder and with a serious list.  However, no action was taken by the captain of the ship to rectify the list and even the first mate, as Minister for Finance, made no effort to correct it.  Yet, that first mate is captain of the ship tonight.</P>
      <P>I wonder if he has taken the appropriate corrective steps to rectify the list before the ship of State goes high and dry on the rocks.  It is true that he has changed his crew but I sincerely hope that he has quelled the mutiny within his ship.  Time, which is the best almanac, will tell.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new Taoiseach's decision to recognise Cork city and county's need for clout at the Cabinet table, which is long overdue, by selecting my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, with whom I have a happy working relationship in political matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I am thrilled that he has now been appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food.  It is a step in the right direction as Minister of State in that Department for the past few years he was muzzled and lacked power and finance to back up his plans.  Now that he has voice in the Cabinet I sincerely hope he will deliver the goods to the beleaguered agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope also that he will correct the many serious anomalies which exist in the agricultural industry, in particular the serious problems which exist in his own constituency of Cork South-West where land of a countless number of farmers was excluded from the disadvantaged areas. Land that would not rear a snipe was ignored, while land, where if one lost <Col N="1650" /> one's walking stick at night one would not find it in the morning due to the extra growth of grass, was included in the extended disadvantaged areas.  I hope that, once and for all, Deputy Walsh will correct the serious anomaly.  As Fine Gael spokesman on disadvantaged areas I am aware that this situation also applies to land from Malin Head to Mizen Head, where hundreds of thousands of farmers, whose land should have been included in the disadvantaged areas, were completely ignored.  If I was Minister for Agriculture and Food I would have the whole country classified as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>We will be the only island nation in Europe when Great Britain is shortly joined with the Continent by a tunnel. An island nation should get priority. Since the foundation of the State successive Governments have given priority to island communities off our coasts.  We have given them special grants to build houses and special concessions in all walks of life.  But for some unknown reason Ireland has been ignored in the European Community even though it will shortly be the only island nation in the Community.  I am at a loss to know why this has happened.  Did the former Taoiseach and his Cabinet play their part in Europe and seek concessions for Ireland? Have successive Ministers for Agriculture and Food failed to hear the cry emanating from our farming organisations calling on the Government to do something to save an industry which is vital to this country's prosperity?  So far all their requests have fallen on deaf ears. When the American negotiators came to try to settle a deal with Commissioner MacSharry he met them in the plush surroundings of Dromoland Castle, County Clare.  The red carpet was laid before they came.  Why did he not take them to my constituency, to the Beara peninsula or to the Kilcrohane and Mizen peninsulas? Instead he wined and dined them to the strains of Yanky Doodle Dandy in Dromoland Castle and he threw in the towel by offering a 30 per cent reduction to the Americans.  Did he realise what was involved?  Was he talking about the <Col N="1651" /> rich plains in the South of France, Germany, Belgium or Holland?  One factory farmer in Holland has a quota bigger than all the farmers in south-west Cork put together.</P>
    <P>If the EC, in its wisdom, wants to reduce milk production and dairy products in the Community why does it not attack the factory farmers in mainland Europe?  They are responsible for the mountains of agricultural products to which we are also supposed to be contributing. I admit we are contributing because we have failed hopelessly to sell our products abroad.  We took the easy way out and put our products into intervention. We should never have bothered with intervention because quality always tells.  We had products of quality and distinction in the international market.  If you travel to any part of the world today you will see Kerrygold butter for sale in supermarkets.  The same should be done with all our other agricultural products. Guidelines should have been laid down by the previous Minister for Agriculture and Food and a direction given by the Taoiseach and Cabinet Ministers to ensure that, as far as possible, our food, which is unique, was sold round the world.</P>
    <P>In south-west Cork countless numbers of farmers were refused the beef incentive scheme because of minor irregularities in the completion of their application forms.  Some of the unfortunate applicants sold one, two or three cattle to keep the bailiff from the door but, because their cards were not ticked at the mart by an official of the Department of Agriculture and Food, they were obliged to take the cards to the local district veterinary office in Cork, 18 miles from where I live and 120 miles from parts of my constituency.  They were automatically disqualified from the beef incentive scheme.  Not alone were these people denied the benefits of the beef incentive scheme, the same applied to the entire western seaboard from Mizen Head to Malin Head.  I hope the new Minister &mdash; I know he will &mdash; has the courage and determination to tackle the <Col N="1652" /> problems which have bedevilled thousands of farmers throughout the country. I assure the new Minister that I will give him all the assistance possible to solve the enormous problems confronting our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I will also be at his disposal to ensure that justice is done to people who are playing their part to ensure the future prosperity of our country.  I firmly believe that if you do not have a prosperous farming community you will not have a prosperous society.  When the farmers do not have the money to buy new cars and tractors are not sold and there is no demand for any development.  The Minister has been waiting long enough to get an opportunity to play his part.  He now has the opportunity to do so and he should ensure that nobody in his Department will rubber-stamp anything without his knowledge.  He should ensure that farmers in disadvantaged areas, some of whom are living on an income of £30 per week, will get an opportunity to draw their headage and beef incentive grants &mdash; and other grants which may be due to them &mdash; without forcing them to go through the costly process of employing an accountant to provide a statement of accounts for an income tax inspector.  I urge the Minister to scrap that system; if he does not he will obliterate thousands of small farmers throughout the country. I know this is something which has been handed down to the Minister but he is now in the driving seat and he must correct that serious imbalance.  I know he will, he is a man after my own heart and he will play his part in developing agriculture.  He has a very good record and I will monitor his progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>Agriculture will always be one of our predominant industries; when the last litre of oil and gas have been extracted from the waters round our coastline, agriculture will still be the main industry. I know there is a heavy weight on the Minister's shoulders but they are big and wide enough to take it and to correct any existing anomalies in the industry.  He must ensure that right will prevail and that the farmers in Dunmanway, Ballygorteen, <Col N="1653" /> Rossmore, parts of the area round Clonakilty, Ballineen and Rosscarbery will get their rightful share of the cake which has so long been denied to them.  It is the first time in the history of the State that we have someone from the constituency of south-west Cork in charge of agriculture.  Let us hope he will deliver the goods; I will be requesting him to do so.</P>
    <P>The stalwart Deputy O'Malley will retain responsibility for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He has left his mark on that Department over the last two and a half years.  I should like him to do a number of things.  The Whiddy Island terminal in Bantry Bay is a gold mine but he has done very little to bring industries into this job starved area. For example, he has publicly announced the creation of 1,000 jobs in Limerick, 1,000 jobs in Dublin and 500 jobs in Cork, yet he has completely ignored Bantry Bay in south-west Cork, one of the finest bays in western Europe.  At one time the rulers of Great Britain boasted that Bantry Bay could hold their entire fleet.  Today not one decent vessel uses the bay.</P>
    <P>When one considers the millions of pounds in EC Structural Funds which have been spent dredging harbours in Rotterdam, Cork, Spain and Portugal, there must be ways and means of developing Bantry Bay.  This asset has been left untapped by successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to provide money for the development of this bay.  I was delighted today to see the Minister had moved up and was sitting two seats to the Taoiseach's left.  Perhaps that is where he should have been sitting since he became Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give Bantry Bay the same status as the Shannon Estuary.  He should designate Bantry Bay as a free port.  The people of the area could do with such a development.  The outer harbour does not need to be dredged; it is capable of holding the biggest ships afloat today.  However, the people of the area are being completely <Col N="1654" /> denied the right to exploit the potential of this bay.  The time is ripe for the Minister to cast his eye further than the Shannon Estuary, the Dublin docklands and Cork harbour.  We cannot all live along the Shannon, in Dublin or in Cork city. The Government must ensure that people continue to live in the south-western tip of the country.  As citizens the people in this area are entitled to their rightful share of development, no matter from where it comes.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Taoiseach has retained Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance did not have much to do with framing the budget he introduced two weeks ago; the budget was framed by the Taoiseach before he was sacked as Minister for Finance.  The country needs a Minister for Finance who will give a direction so far as our finances are concerned. However, the budget was a non-event. It did not give any hope to the 300,000 people unemployed; there was no light at the end of the tunnel for those beleagured people.  We should remember that a country's wealth is its people: a country without young people and a strong vibrant workforce has nothing.  I hope the Minister in framing his next budget &mdash; he may not have this opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He has deferred many important decisions until the 1993 budget and has forgotten to ensure that the country is run in a proper manner.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that Deputy Molloy will retain the Energy portfolio.  However, I should like him to come out of his shell and act as a proper Minister for Energy. Coillte Teoranta were set up as a State-sponsored body to ensure that forestry plantations would be enlarged and developed.  It was intended that setting up industries in areas where forests were located would lead to the creation of jobs.  However, Coillte Teoranta are now selling their plantations in remote parts of the country in order to obtain finance for the Department of Energy.  This will be to the detriment of rural areas which are starved of jobs.</P>
      <P>With the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for forestry and in latter years the setting up of Coillte Teoranta we were told a huge number of jobs would be created in rural Ireland.  The present policy of the Minister for Energy of selling to foreigners plantations in outlying areas will do nothing to create jobs. The Minister has failed hopelessly in this regard.  I hope he will tackle this problem; otherwise it will be a sad day for rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods has been appointed Minister for the Marine.  He will have huge problems to surmount.  It is sad that that Department have been relegated by successive Governments to the role of Cinderella.  Ireland has access to over 20 <Col N="1656" /> per cent of EC fishing grounds and 4 per cent of the EC fishery catch.  I admit that Deputy Woods showed a fighting attitude in his approach to the problems of agriculture in the short time he was in the Department of Agriculture and Food and I hope he will continue fighting on behalf of the fishermen.  Our rich fishing grounds are being ravaged by Spanish, Dutch and German trawlers.  I am well aware of that because I lived for many years within sight of the Fastnet lighthouse and saw these trawlers fishing the waters off our coasts.</P>
    <P>EC regulations banned herring fishing in the Celtic sea at a time when herrings were dying of old age in those waters.  If the new Minister for the Marine is to make improvements in this area he will have to listen to the demands of the fishermen who work long hours.  These men cannot tie up their boats at night and go home to bed.  They leave home on Sundays and they are lucky if they arrive back the following Friday evening. The new Minister must take into consideration the importance of the fishing industry to Castleownbere in my constituency. The Minister present is well acquainted with that part of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <P>As do I.  We share the votes.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the fishing industry, particularly the fishermen in the Castletownbere area, get greater share of the national cake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes when Minister for Finance, provided money for the erection of a £1 million pier in Schull but what have this Government done since?  They have barred every fishing trawler from landing even one herring at that pier.  It is disgraceful that fishermen have to travel up to 100 miles to Cobh to land herrings. They could, of course, land them in Baltimore if the facilities were there to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn has been appointed to the prestigous Department of Justice. That Minister will face serious problems including rising crime and drug smuggling. Over the past two years millions of <Col N="1657" /> pounds worth of drugs were landed along the coastline of south-west Cork and South Kerry but the people responsible were never intercepted.  I hope the Minister will fulfil his responsibilities and will provide the necessary money to the Garda and the customs officials in that part of the country to ensure that this practice is brought to an end.  The closure of lighthouses throughout the country is reprehensible because lighthouse keepers were able to keep track of every boat that came within their scope, but for some unknown reason the lighthouses have become fully automated in recent years.  That is a sad day for Ireland and will have repercussions as far as drug smuggling is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan has been appointed to the Department of Education, inheriting a multitude of problems from his predecessors, although not primarily from Deputy Davern's actions.  He at least kindled the flame for the short time he was in that Department but it was quickly extinguished by the failure of the new Taoiseach today to reappoint him as Minister in that Department.  That was a very bad mistake.</P>
    <P>Considering the millions of pounds disbursed by the Department of Education yesterday, I am very disappointed no provision was made for the national school in Clonakilty, a school with almost 300 pupils but with no playground and no indoor toilets.  It is disgraceful the people of Clonakilty have to tolerate such conditions. I hope the Minister present will be able to persuade the new Minister to give priority to a new national school for Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has been appointed to the prestigious Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications. She should be acquainted with all the problems confronting that Department. Tourism is destined to be our primary industry at the end of this century, which is only eight years away.  The right impetus must be applied if that target is to be achieved.  However, with the lack of finance and the lack of commitment to this industry down the years I am afraid we will not achieve the desired results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> Deputy O'Connell has been given the very important portfolio of Health.  He should be fully aware of the gigantic problems confronting the citizens as far as health matters are concerned.  Let me ask Deputy O'Connell what he intends to do about the waiting lists for hip operations and sight and hearing tests.  Some of the many thousands waiting for a hip operation will see the light of heaven before they see the light of the operating theatre.  The Minister designate will have to start right away to redress the serious problems in the Department of Health. He must insist that proper funding be made available to his Department.  I suggest he look to the national lottery for funding.  The national lottery collects a great deal of money each week much of which goes to less important projects than our hospitals.  It is very important that our hospitals are properly financed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith will be appointed Minister for the Environment.  I wish him well.  He is a Munster man moreover and he should know what is happening in that part of the country.  I hope he will bring some semblance of reality into this very important Department.  We should have a clean environment, clean rivers, clean air, clean water and a clean coastline.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister designate will recognise that both his colleague, Deputy Walsh's and my constituency of south-west Cork is denied one mile of national primary route in the road network system.</P>

We were told lies not alone <Col N="1659" /> in the fifties but in the decades since then.

It is only slightly less intimidating to follow him than to be at the other end of his sights as the Minister present is, as indeed I have been on occasions.  I can feel sorry for the Minister when that power and eloquence is directed at him.  I know, of course, that one has to be strong to survive in south-west Cork and both the Minister and the Deputy have shown a great capacity to survive.</P>
      <P>Since Deputy Walsh is here let me say that he knows perfectly well that most of us who have been involved with agriculture in one way or another for a great many years have a certain kind of affection for him and wish him extremely well. As a former Minister for Agriculture, may I wish him well but I predict that he will have a great many sleepless nights both at home and in Brussels and I am not sure which will be worse.</P>
      <P>A week ago I looked at this famous Fianna Fáil dream ticket.  One member on the ticket is now Taoiseach but the other, as is the case on so many of these occasions, seems to have evaporated &mdash; nobody is talking about the other member on the dream ticket, the present Minister for Finance.  I predicted at that stage that the dream ticket would turn into a nightmare.  It already has: it has been a nightmare for the former Taoiseach, for eight Cabinet Ministers and a Chief Whip, all of whom have lost office. That is the first fruit of this dream ticket which has so quickly turned into a nightmare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pundits would all say that if the new Taoiseach were to make fundamental changes in his Government, not to speak of the style of Government, this was the best and possibly the only <Col N="1661" /> moment he could do it.  They may very well be right.  We all know that the rooms, corridors and restaurants of this House are buzzing this evening with all kinds of speculation.  We will see more of it in the media.  I have no doubt that tomorrow's newspapers will be full of every kind of expert analysis, examination and interpretation of what the Taoiseach has done, why some people are included and others are not.  I wonder, however, if they will make what seems to be a straightforward point &mdash; simply that the choices made by this Taoiseach are, in a very direct way, an eloquent comment on the choices made by his predecessor and that the deletions may be an even more eloquent comment on the choices of his predecessor and may be an explanation of some of the history of what has been happening in the Fianna Fáil Party for the past two years.  All of us &mdash; certainly Members on this side of the House &mdash; will conclude this evening that a discernible group within Fianna Fáil have now moved in and another discernible group have moved out.  If the matter were not so important I would be tempted to make other comparisons, but I would be moved to say that the pantomime horse had changed around and what used to be the tail is now the head and what used to be the head is now the rump.</P>
    <P>I wonder what that new head has to say to us because that is really the most important question before us now.  The answer, quite honestly, is that we do not have very much of an idea.  We do not have very much upon which to base a view on what this head has in store for us in terms of management of the economy, a small but very important part of a Government's job or on what is in store for us in the way of a new approach to our fundamental problems of unemployment, inflation and fitting our economy to compete in Europe and to employ more people.  Will we have something that has been overdue for a very long time, that is, a Government that get hold of the basic fact that in order to create greater employment &mdash; to provide jobs for more young people who are coming out of our schools, colleges and universities <Col N="1662" />&mdash; we will have to produce goods and services more competitively than other countries?  The Government have to recognise that no amount of short term expedients, no amount of agencies, no amount of training schemes and no amount of the old illusionary politics of creative schemes that do not tackle the real issue of competitive production of goods and services in Ireland will sort out our problem.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is very difficult to know just what to make of the new Government. The Taoiseach has not put very much on the public record in relation to what he thinks about any of our problems. We have a rough idea of what the new Taoiseach thinks about competition policy &mdash; he has been Minister for Industry and Commerce; we have a fair idea of what he thinks, on the surface anyway, about running the nation's finances &mdash; he was Minister for Finance; and if we reach back far enough in our memories, we have some idea what he thinks about transport policy &mdash; after all, he was Minister for Industry and Transport at one time.  Mind you, I wonder whether the new Taoiseach would now repeat something he did in 1980, when he went to Brittany and offered himself as a hostage to try to free an airplane?  I doubt if he would now offer himself as a hostage for anything, although it may be that the Fianna Fáil Party have offered him as a hostage to fortune in the future.</P>
    <P>If one considers the other Members nominated for appointment to Cabinet, there is not much evidence of the stand they could be expected to take.  One has to look at the record to find out what views they hold, and, in all conscience, that record is very mixed.</P>
    <P>The present Taoiseach brought three budgets before the House &mdash; in 1989, 1990 and 1991.  It would be fair to say that the 1989 budget did not bear much of his imprint because it was largely put together by his predecessor, Ray MacSharry, before he went to Brussels. The budget of 1990, however, although it was not very spectacular, would be the most recent occasion on which a Government seemed to have any real grip on <Col N="1663" /> what they wanted to do in setting priorities in all the main policy areas while respecting the financial constraints they faced.  That could not be said of the 1991 budget.  I spoke about that budget at some length this night last week and I shall not go into it again, but I shall say that the 1991 budget employed sleight of hand to give the impression that the Government were managing to deal with the country's financial problems when in fact they were doing no such thing.  The 1991 budget started off as a juggling act that concealed increased Government borrowings and ended up not even as good as it had seemed in the beginning. It was clear that the Government of the time had given up any real attempt to keep control of our financial destiny while fixing priorities in social and economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know what to make of the 1992 budget, but we cannot blame the present Taoiseach too much for it because he was taken out of the game before the final budget decisions were made.  However, it is still fair to say &mdash; because the Minister for Finance is still in place &mdash; that this year's budget was another very worrying phase in the retreat from any real attempt to respect the financial constraints imposed upon us, and that does not give me any great confidence the Government will find a way through those financial constraints to deal with our economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has no great record in financial matters.  He allows the idea that he has been an accountant to circulate but he has not been an accountant &mdash; he has been a book-keeper, all right.  It is a curious irony that the Fianna Fáil Party, which complained for so many years about a book-keeping approach to national accounts, now has a book-keeper as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister for Finance will not succeed in balancing the books any better than his predecessor did last year. If the present Minister for Finance had a reputation for anything, it is a reputation for conciliation &mdash; which is the best word <Col N="1664" /> I can find for what he seems to be good at.  Last year, for example, he conciliated his way into the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> a programme the country could not afford even at the time. He then became Minister for Finance and had to conciliate his way out of that agreement.</P>
    <P>I was wryly amused this morning to read a newsletter from one of the organisations that participated in the deal, which now claim that the position to which they have retreated in the Minister's latest conciliation is actually a gain. They have decided that they do not want to go on strike or to take industrial action but they are trying to pretend the position to which they have retreated between the beginning of last year and the beginning of this year is in some way a gain for their members, and, indeed, a gain for the children who are subject to their members' profession.  It is not a gain; it is a deal that should never have been struck in the way it was.</P>
    <P>As I said, the ability of the present Minister for Finance seems to be that as a councillor.  The only difficulty is that whenever he conciliates a problem it ends up costing us more money, and if he does not have the money today then he will do as he did in this year's budget, he will put off the expenditure to a future year and let deferred expenditure build up.</P>
    <P>I am appalled to consider what the country faces next year in deferred commitments. There are all the deferred <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> commitments, some of which have been deferred for a third or fourth year; there is the problem of a deferred £200 million VAT at the point of entry on imports from other EC countries which has not been dealt with but has been put off until next year; and there is the potential problem with deposit interest retention tax which has not been dealt with this year but has been put off until next year.  It does not require any great imagination or alarm to deduce that there could be a sum of £400 million in deferred payments to be dealt with in the 1993 budget.  The Minister for Finance himself admitted in the House on budget <Col N="1665" /> day that he does not know what he will do about that and hopes something will come out of discussions with the Commission. That is the record of the Minister for Finance, that is what we have to base our hopes on for future Government financial policy.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy McCreevy, has my very best wishes, and I mean that sincerely.  He has stayed out of office &mdash; perhaps by choice at times &mdash; for quite a long time and now finds himself at the Cabinet table.  He has great common sense and I hope he will continue the progress made in recent years in simplifying the social welfare system, in making it a little more responsive to the needs of the people for whom it is to serve and ensuring that it does that efficiently and with compassion.</P>
    <P>God knows there is a need for compassion. Very recently I came across a constituent of the Minister's and of mine, a widow, who was in receipt of a child dependant allowance for twin sons who were at college.  Early last year she asked the Department how long their entitlement would last.  About two months later she got a reply saying that entitlement would continue until some date in October last year.  A week before Christmas she got a letter from the same Department saying that since her two sons had turned 21 last February there was an overpayment and that she now owed them £1,250.  Her widow's pension is £53 per week and they were going to deduct £5 a week from her pension to recover the overpayment.  It was to take five years for that women to repay an overpayment that arose only because the Department who had all the information could not get it right.  It was only when I contacted the Department that they agreed to pay the cost of their own mistake.  That should not happen.  A Minister for Social Welfare should have as one of his ambitions to make sure that that kind of thing could not happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, the new Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, achieved some very useful things in simplifying that system.  For his pains he was described by one of our scribes, one <Col N="1666" /> of the experts in everything, as a technocrat. That, it seems is a very bad thing to be.  It is a bad thing to be a technocrat and to make sure that a system of administration works in the way it was intended and produces benefits for the people it is intended to benefit, the Press do not like technocrats.  I know for a fact that the ordinary people would far sooner have a technocrat who gets the job done and makes the system work sufficiently on their behalf than a glamorous chancer who gets away with fooling them up to the eyeballs without doing them any good at all.  Yet we have an example on the other side of the House, now on the back benches, of a person who was a glamorous chancer for about 20 years, the man who gets the rave reviews from the press, whereas the man who does a job for real people, a job that matters to them in their pockets, in their jobs, in their homes gets labelled with this dreadful label &ldquo;technocrat&rdquo;.  My constituents would rather be served by a technocrat who gets the job done than by a glamourous chancer who will only spend their money.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications is to be congratulated on her return to the Cabinet. The strike in RTE has produced some very strange results.  The 6 o'clock news on television this evening recalled some highlights of the Minister's career.  There were two or three clips, one of a function the Minister attended on her return to her constituency last November having been fired and there was no soundtrack on that.</P>
    <P>The second clip was an earlier one in which she gave what many people regarded as a very masterly, ambiguous and loaded speech to warm up the crowd for her Taoiseach at the last Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis.  I am glad to see that she is back in Cabinet, if there has to be a Cabinet of that complexion.  I hope that Minister will give her earliest attention to resolving and dispelling some of the confusion that her predecessor in that Department caused over the last two years, by his dithering about the status of <Col N="1667" /> Shannon Airport as Ireland's transatlantic gateway.  The Minister, Deputy Brennan sowed alarm, confusion and unfounded optimism throughout the country by trying to be all things to all men, by making ambiguous statements and by failing to do the one thing any Minister involved in his area should have done, to simply read the terms of the Bilateral Agreement between Ireland and the US on transatlantic air services. If he had done that he would have been able to resist the siren songs of American airlines who say what they are going to do without ever asking their Government to negotiate on their behalf, and he would not have fallen into the kind of trap he has fallen into over the last two years.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Deputy John O'Connell as Minister for Health is something of a surprise.  It is hard to know what to expect of the Minister, because we do not know much about his record on the issues with which he will be dealing. During the course of the 1989 election he was reported to have said that he saw nothing wrong with people being on trolleys in hospital corridors and he went on to explain to those of us who apparently missed the simple point, that a trolley was simply a bed with wheels.  I know that most of the patients in hospitals would take a very much less relaxed view of it than that.  Perhaps the Minister has more to say about the quality of our health services, about how they are organised and about whether we get value for money from the health services. I wonder if the Minister believes, in the present system of managing our health services where nobody in a public hospital anywhere in this country has any control over what the hospital does and very few people have any idea of what hospital procedures cost.  Has the Minister any idea about how to get better value from our health service by giving more of the management of the health services to the people who deliver the services and allow them to schedule how they do their business without it being <Col N="1668" /> done for them by two parallel bureaucracies, the Department of Health and the health boards.</P>
    <P>I searched through the record of the House and could find no record of the new Minister for Health giving any views that he might have on, for example, family planning and contraception.  He was silent during the debate we had in 1985 and I am not aware that he said anything about it since.  It is an issue he will have to deal with along with the wider issue of our campaign against AIDS which must be dealt with.  I would like to see the new Minister for Health come in and tell the House honestly that the problem of AIDS is a much deeper, much more fundamental and much more worrying problem than it is being presented as at the moment, and that the issue of who can buy condoms, at what age and where, has very little to do with the problem of AIDS.  I would like to see the Government separating those two issues and not trying to cover up their faint heartedness in relation to the issue of condoms by linking it unnecessarily in an unfair and stupid way with the much bigger problem of AIDS.  I am not at all sure that the new Minister for Health will do much to get over the conservativism and faint heartedness that is legendary in his party on this and on related issues.</P>
    <P>We have a new Minister for Justice in Deputy Flynn.  I wish him well on his return to Cabinet.  Many people in this House will say that he displayed a degree of conviction last November and adherence to principle that perhaps surprised some of us.  He is to be commended on that and I welcome his return to the Cabinet, but I wonder what we can expect in the way of law reform from a Minister for Justice who has shown himself to be a deeply conservative person. The last major legislation in which he was involved as Minister for the Environment was the Local Government Act last year. That was a restricted, conservative Act and if that was carried through this House with conviction by the Minister, then I am not at all sure that we can expect any major departure in terms of law reform.</P>
    <P>What does the new Minister for Justice <Col N="1669" /> feel about the changes that are being proposed on our laws of libel, for example?  Has he any proposals or conviction on the necessity to provide here a procedure for the re-examination of doubtful verdicts which have gone all the way through our courts?  That system exists in the UK, although we sometimes forget it.  It is an administration we have loved to criticise in recent years, but we do not have such a system here, although I think there is agreement in this House that we need something of that kind.  Are we to see that kind of reform of the law pertaining to our courts system from this Minister for Justice?  Are we to see any reforms in the law, for example, in relation to marital property, from this very conservative Minister?  I would look forward to being surprised on these matters by the Minister but I am not all sure that I will be.</P>
    <P>The legacy is such that the new Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, starts off with a big disadvantage. The last reform of local government is an albatros hanging around the neck of the new Minister.  If he is to do anything real and substantial about local government reform he will first have to set aside huge sections of the Act which went through this House last year and decide to devolve real decision-making powers to local authorities.  He will also have to grasp the one nettle which the Barrington Commission were told not even to look at &mdash; the financing of local authorities.  Rumour has it that Deputy Flynn when Minister for the Environment flirted with the idea of reforming local government finances four or five times during his career as Minister. The new Minister will be able to do nothing in relation to reforming local government and promoting local democracy and the principle of subsidiarity &mdash; which our former Taoiseach suddenly discovered on the road to Maastricht &mdash; unless and until he takes his courage in his hands and persuades the Government to do something fundamental about financing local authorities and giving them access to and responsibility for tax revenue of their own.  Until we do that <Col N="1670" /> we are wasting our time talking about local government reform or any kind of local democracy.</P>
    <P>I said I looked forward to being surprised by the Minister for Justice.  I looked forward also to being surprised by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Brian Cowen.  He has been remarkable to me only for being what I might call the chief vulgarian of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and the heckler-in-chief when they all get together in a group.  If he is to make an impact as Minister for Labour he will have to show a deal more delicacy and finesse than he has so far shown in this House.  There is an enormous job to be done.  It is a problem that will cause a great deal of worry, not just to politicians and members of Government but to ordinary people.  I refer to finding alternative employment over the whole midlands areas when Bord na Móna have finished with the cutaway bogs.</P>
    <P>That is an immense problem and only a very small start has been made in the consideration of it.  The Minister for Energy recently published the report of a committee which he set up over a year ago.  The committee did a very good job and produced what can only be regarded as the very first outline of the problem. It would be churlish to go into it now; there will be another day.  The committee went beyond themselves in suggesting that one of the things we might do would be to build new cluster village in the midlands where new people would go to live. That is not the problem.  We have to find opportunities for employment for the people already there who will lose their jobs in Bord na Móna and the ESB, never mind any new people who might move into the area.  That is a problem this Government should begin to address.  It is so complex and has so many facets that it will be quite a while before we can even begin to feel we have mapped out a strategy.  The Minister for Energy should listen to the new Minister for Labour, who should be able to tell him the reality that is facing people throughout the midlands who see their only future as being on the dole at a fairly young age in an <Col N="1671" /> area where there is very little chance of alternative employment.</P>
    <P>There appear to be four committed Gaeilgeoirí in the Cabinet.  If I were to do the normal political thing I would lapse into Irish at this stage.  I will not do so because when I speak Irish I prefer to speak it all the way through.  I do not like tokenism.  I am glad to see the four Gaeilgeoirí in the Cabinet and I hope we will see a new realisation and that they will do a lot more for the language than did the last Government or previous Governments.  If they are to be serious, they must do one thing above all.  There are vested interests involved in this and it will be an uncomfortable thing to do. Until we fundamentally change the way we teach Irish to our children we will be wasting time and resources in doing what Governments over the years have tried to do.  The way we teach Irish to our children is an absolute scandal.  It is pointless and it creates resentment and resistance, even among children whose family background is militantly pro-Gaeilge.  I have seen it myself, as well all have.  Unless and until we decide to begin to teach children Irish in something like the way they learn their family's mother tongue when they are growing up, we are wasting our resources.  All the talk about the language from the current Taoiseach or former Taoisigh or anybody else will be so much wasted hot air.</P>
    <P>It is traditional to wish a new Government well.  I wish this new Government well and I hope they will be successful at their jobs.  There is one fair prediction: although they will get credit for a number of things they will do, this House will never say unanimously that it approves of what they are at.  That is the duty of Government versus the duty of Opposition. I should like to see this Government do one thing.  It is the key to everything we have to decide.  Fianna Fáil have not decided on it and I do not think the Progressive Democrats have decided on it either.  We must decide to stop building up commitments and debts that pre-empt the revenue we produce every year. The current Taoiseach knows something <Col N="1672" /> about this and I hope the new Minister for Finance is awake enough to find out about it.  What annoyed me most as Minister for Finance &mdash; and it has been something that has worried me ever since I began to take any kind of interest in how we run a country or a society &mdash; was the frustration of seeing our people produce goods and services and of having £2.5 billion of tax revenue taken away with not a single thing the Government of the day could do to use that money constructively to deal with today's problems and to provide for tomorrow's.  That is what overspending, budget deficits and Exchequer borrowing do for us.  They cripple our ability to use the resources we now produce to deal with the problems we have today and foresee for tomorrow.  If the Government can add anything to what has been lost since 1987 they will have done something worth while.  The most important thing that happened over the past 20 years took place between 1982 and 1987 &mdash; and it took longer than that for it to stick when the country woke up to the scandal of limiting ourselves in that way, acquiring some passing acquaintance with economic common sense which was thrown away in 1990 and 1991.  It is time the Government endeavoured to retrieve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to offer my good wishes to the incoming Government. If any Government needed and deserved luck it is the incoming one having regard to the scale of the problems confronting us.  It is unprecedented that a Cabinet would face the scale of the problems built up whether on unemployment, the challenge of the Single Market or the worsening and grave position in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that sense this debate will be seen to be historic.  It will also be seen to be historic for the reason that Deputy Charles J. Haughey will no longer be Taoiseach or a Minister in an Irish Cabinet. Since I reached the age of political reason Deputy Haughey has dominated Irish politics.  In my opinion he has been a man of exceptional ability.  Contrary to what Deputy Dukes said on a programme <Col N="1673" /> we shared recently, Deputy Haughey has been a consummate parliamentarian.  He has also represented and helped create a culture in Irish politics with which I do not agree.  He has been largely the author of a politcal culture that has conferred acceptability and approval on the quick stroke in Irish politics &mdash; the person who seeks to make a fortune out of their speculative interests in the economy rather than any productive interest they might have had.  Nonetheless it is the end of an era.  In a stark way it is a contrast between the frugal, rural vision of Irish society held by the founder of Fianna Fáil, referred to earlier in this debate, and the modern materialistic philosophy espoused by the present Fianna Fáil party.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment I am reminded that two weeks ago in my constituency the outgoing Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Daly, who I am sorry to see no longer in Cabinet, launched a publication called <i>Life on the Dole,</i> under the Tallaght strategy as one of the 12 pilot schemes set up by the Government under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  He said the thing most striking about the contents of that report &mdash; which bears reading &mdash; was the remark by the man on its cover who said: &ldquo;The thing I dread most of all now in life is the day I will be heading to the labour exchange with my son&rdquo;.  That is the scale of the challenge facing us which, in a personal, human way, illustrates the crisis of our endemic unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would dispute that a number of Ministers who made their exit today were well past their &ldquo;sell-by&rdquo; date, whose jaded dispositions and tired old policies contributed to the economic failure the outgoing Government accumulated especially on unemployment. However, the sheer scale of the exits, which has taken us all by surprise, holds out the prospect of a Cabinet in exile as disgruntled former Ministers lick their wounds.  It would be a tragedy if a new war of attrition within Fianna Fáil were initiated today because the legacy of bitterness and division in Fianna Fáil has <Col N="1674" /> served only to divert the energies and focus of past Cabinets from the real problems affecting our people.</P>
    <P>The real issue is whether we are witnessing cosmetic changes or changes in style.  Certainly some changes in style would be welcome.  For example, the obsessive secrecy that surrounded the outgoing Government, an obsession which Deputy Haughey &mdash; who I am glad to see in the House &mdash; sought to impose, as Taoiseach, on earlier Cabinets has no place in a modern parliamentary democracy. The Workers' Party will measure performance in this area against the welcome promises of the new Fianna Fáil Leader, now Taoiseach, at his first press conference.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach means what he said about open Government.  I am sure it will not have escaped his attention that the sole member responsible for conducting the affairs of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry at Dublin Castle commented on this in a very particular fashion recently when he expressed the opinion that the matters of which he is seized would not be before him had Ministers answered questions put to them over the years.  That is a very salutary lesson for all of us.  Certainly one thing that has taken me completely aback in this House is our inability to use the parliamentary question as a means of eliciting any real information.  Indeed, the manner in which the outgoing Government used, or abused, the parliamentary question brings into question the very efficacy of the notion of Question Time.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the new Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, is in the House.  He is rated very highly by his colleagues and others in the House.  I am sure that assessment is correct.  The Ministry he takes over is an exceptionally important one.  I hope he will show greater judgment in it than he did in his acceleration of the beef development plan that will feature at the tribunal to which I referred.  In that case the Minister showed commendable energy in getting things moving but, while it is easy to be wise in hindsight, he did not show a great deal of judgment <Col N="1675" /> about the basket into which he chose to place so many of the State's eggs.</P>
    <P>On the new Ministers, I must say I cannot agree with Deputy Dukes in his remarks about Deputy Cowen as being the vulgarian of the Fianna Fáil benches. On the contrary, Deputy Cowen is a man of very considerable intellect and ability which we may not have seen in the House yet but which presumably we will now see in his capacity as Minister for Labour. I congratulate him and wish him well in his new task.  There are many important issues confronting him in his portfolio.  I should like to see him concentrate on a body of equality legislation needed to be introduced as soon as possible.  The existing equality legislation has served its purpose, but, with the passage of time, it has been found to be wanting.  Indeed, it is an area in which any new Minister for Labour might well make his mark.  I hope Deputy Cowen will address that issue which is of such fundamental importance to approximately one-third or more of our workforce.  I would also like to see him continue the practice of the former Minister for Labour when he addressed the question of part time workers.  It was an area of extreme exploitation in our economy, and I do not think describing it as such is an exaggeration.  Here were people who were most vulnerable to being exploited, many of them women, and I think where the legislation failed was in the area of agency workers.  I hope the new Minister for Labour will bring forward legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>I cannot cry crocodile tears about the departure of all the Minister.  For example, the decision to dispatch Deputy Davern back to snagging turnips is not likely to be to the detriment of our children's education.  I hope the new Minister for Education will be less partisan in his representation of interest groups than in his previous portfolio as Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. I welcome in particular the appointment to Cabinet of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  She is an exceptional Member of the House.  My only regret is that she was not in the Cabinet in recent <Col N="1676" /> months when her predecessor made some very strange decisions &mdash; not least the manner in which he chose to dispose of the B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the appointment of Deputy McCreevy and agree with what Deputy Dukes said about him.  However, I think it is a rather peculiar choice to put the only man in the House I know is a monetarist, into the Department of Social Welfare.  I could have thought of a number of other Ministries that Deputy McCreevy would unquestionably adorn, but I would have thought the Department of Social Welfare an unusual choice.  The emergence of Deputy Andrews whose language, Patrician style, should be well suited to the elegance of Iveagh House, will probably be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell as Minister for Health is a peculiar appointment.  Politics is a funny old business when you see the circuitous route by which Deputy O'Connell finally realised his ambition.  It is exceptionally strange in that he joined Fianna Fáil specifically because of his admiration for the then Leader of Fianna Fáil.  I think he said enough complimentary things about him to have got promotion at that time.  It is funny how the wheel turns: he is now the Minister for Health and in addition to the other tasks that have been mentioned by Deputies Bruton, Dukes and others I would like to avail of the opportunity to put down a marker for the construction of the Tallaght Regional Hospital.  This is one of the most urgent decisions facing this Government.  I do not think there is a real appreciation on the part of the Government or on the part of many people elected to this House, about the needs of Dublin south-west.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon when Minister for Health announced the restructuring of the Eastern Health Board, streamlining it into five district boards, each based on an acute general hospital.  The only area that cannot be so restructured is south-west Dublin because there is no such acute hospital there, in fact, there is no hospital of any kind.  It is not just the 90,000 people in Tallaght or the 50,000 people in Clondalkin who will be <Col N="1677" /> affected, there are approximately 250,000 people in terms in north Kildare, west Wicklow, south-west and west Dublin who will be affected.  I sincerely hope the new Minister has not bid farewell to his Labour Party principles &mdash; which he professed so noisily when I first knew him &mdash; and that he will not take the approach that this hospital, so often promised, cannot proceed.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to his predecessor, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke, the board estimate that it would take only £6 million to enable that very valuable and badly needed project in Tallaght to go ahead.  When she was Minister for Education Deputy O'Rourke managed to find £6 million to purchase Carysfort. I have no idea what part that decision may have played in her unfortunate loss of office today.  I welcomed Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's elevation to the Cabinet and looked forward to the prospect, for the first time in the history of the State, of having two women in Cabinet. Although I do not claim to be a fan of Deputy O'Rourke, nonetheless she proved to be a formidable Minister and it is regrettable that she has been omitted from the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question remains as to whether the new Government have any new ideas about tackling the unemployment crisis.  The same old despairing clichés about getting the climate right, bemoaning our demographic structures and UK and US recessions will not create one extra job.  In one capacity or another the new Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have presided over the existing unemployment scandal.  It seems to me that the new Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, will be required to make same sweeping changes in economic policy that he has so surgically effected in the construction of his new Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I want briefly to deal with unemployment because Irish society is facing its greatest crisis in this area since the foundation of the State.  Each month's figures break the previous record for numbers out of work, including those on Government make work schemes and <Col N="1678" /> those not on the official register, who would take up paid employment if available. One in four of the total labour force is unemployed.  The Government blame this state of affairs on the fact that not as many Irish people are emigrating as they used to.  Indeed, we now have the recent prospect of a Government Senator flying to the US with visa applications to ensure that as many Irish people as possible were enabled to leave the country.  Meanwhile, at home we are saddled with a political and economic system dedicated to tax evasion, financial scams and get rich quick strokes while at the same time, hospital wards are closed, schools are overcrowded and one million poor struggle for survival.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Irish State is politically and economically bankrupt; indeed, this has always been the case.  No Irish Government have been able to provide adequate employment opportunities for their citizens on a sustained basis.  Things could have been different.  Other small peripheral European countries have suceeded where Ireland has failed and their population now enjoy living standards among the highest in the world with tiny numbers out of work.  The Workers' Party believe that the Irish unemployment crisis can be successfully tackled.  The key to secure job creation in Ireland is an effective industrial policy. To be effective, industrial policy has to create a foundation of home based export industries, purchasing Irish material and services, reinvesting their profits in Ireland and generating spin-off jobs throughout the economy.  The industrial policies pursued by successive Governments have failed to create that foundation.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge, The Workers' Party were the only party to make a submission to the review group on industrial policy.  This is extraordinary having regard to the lip service paid in the House to the need for job creation. In a policy statement we are about to publish in response to the Culliton report we identify what needs to be done to develop industry to the point where <Col N="1679" /> serious inroads can be made into the rising tide of unemployment.  Achieving this will require political leadership and commitment from the new Government of a type never seen before in this country. Securing this leadership and commitment will be the gratest challenge faced by the people.  The industrial policies pursued by Governments down through the years have produced an economic structure inherently incapable of providing jobs in sufficient numbers for our people.</P>
    <P>Irish industry is mainly made up of two separate components, each of which suffers from profound deficiencies. Native industry is mainly small scale, largely limited to lower growth traditional sectors and geared to the home market. Some firms have managed to grow large from this base usually because they have been sheltered from foreign competition by transport costs.  They have continued to grow by investing in similar activities abroad rather than by diversifying at home.  Faced with the choice of being innovative and creating jobs for our people or sticking to the safe and familiar, they have taken the soft option. This attitude epitomises Irish private enterprise in general.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the managing director of the Industrial Development Authority was forced to complain that when one mentions the word &ldquo;risk&rdquo; Irish business dives for cover.  As recent events show clearly, an Irish business culture has developed which prefers to seek profit from non-productive investment such as buying and selling property and company shares.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments stand indicted not only for allowing this culture to develop but for playing an active role in simulating its growth. As a result, native industry in its present form offers little hope for future growth and job creation.  It lacks the scale of operations, the long term perspective, the commitment to research and the management and marketing capabilities required for successful penetration of oversees markets.  These obstacles must be overcome if any real hope is to be <Col N="1680" /> offered to present and future generations of unemployed.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of Government industrial policy during the past 30 years has been directed towards the attraction of foreign investment.  This in itself is an admission of the inability of native firms to secure the export markets which are vital for economic growth.  Generous grants and tax incentives have been used to attract these foreign firms.  In terms of its own modest objectives the policy of promoting foreign investment has been reasonably successful.  Some 80,000 jobs have been provided here by overseas firms, over one-third of the total.  These firms account for over one-half of Ireland's total industrial production and the vast bulk of exports.  Many provide stable and good quality employment in modern industrial growth sectors.</P>
    <P>However, ultimately, this policy has been shown to have fundamental weaknesses which have become increasingly apparent in recent years.  By emphasising direct job creation in foreign-owned factories too little attention was paid to the need to develop spin-off employment. Thus, foreign firms made little use of local materials and services.  By importing most of their requirements they cancel out most of the benefits of the export revenues which they generate. Repatriated profits, equivalent to one-tenth of gross domestic product in 1989, and projected to double by 1994, eliminate the remaining benefits.</P>
    <P>There are further problems with foreign firms.  They employ mostly routine unskilled labour thus providing few jobs outlets for the growing output of skilled graduates from our third level colleges.  I would like to say a good deal more about our industrial policy but perhaps this is not the occasion.  My colleagues are getting exceptionally restless and I appreciate that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope we will have an early opportunity to have a full-scale debate in this House on the question of revamping our industrial policy if we are to make any impact on the lengthening dole queues.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to extend my good wishes to the members of the incoming Cabinet.  In particular, I would like to extend special good wishes to my colleague, Deputy McCreevy who is sitting opposite me at present.  I wish him every success and good fortune.  I am sure I speak for everyone in County Kildare when I say we will co-operate with him as best we can.  Mind you, we will provide him with plenty of constructive opposition also.  Both he and his colleagues have a rough job ahead of them.</P>
      <P>County Kildare is a microcosm of the whole country.  All of the problems that exist in the country, including the shortage of jobs, lack of housing, the need to put a stop to emigration, the need to attend to the problems of students now seeking employment, including those who are wondering if they will receive second or third level education and those who are inquiring if they will be given the opportunity to avail of the necessary lifeskills education to seek a job, will require the attention of the Cabinet at this time.  They will need all the support and good wishes they can get in addition to constructive opposition because the job they face is a daunting one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As several other Members of the House want to speak tonight I will curtail my remarks in so far as possible but I would not like this occasion to pass without paying the outgoing Taoiseach and Members of the Cabinet a compliment. I am quite sure, just like the incoming Cabinet, that many outgoing members of the Cabinet did a very good job to the <Col N="1682" /> best of their ability.  I assess the success or failure of a Taoiseach or Minister &mdash; I have said this in the House many times &mdash; on their willingness and ability to answer questions in the House honestly and fairly in so far as they can.  The day is long gone when it was fashionable to evade and avoid questions and to give as little information as possible.  As I said before, this means on many occasions that the Minister can withhold information from the House.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see that a number of outgoing members of the Cabinet have lost their jobs.  Let me mention in particular the former Minister for Education and Health, Deputy O'Rourke.  From my dealings with her in the House she attempted to deal honestly and fairly with all the questions we put to her.  The best tribute I could pay her is that she always tried to answer as honestly and as fairly as possible.  I hope and know the incoming Ministers will do likewise.  Once they deviate from that practice we will be faced with a danger.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope Members on all sides of the House will resort to the kind of public debate we were accustomed to having in this House some years ago. Debates were of a high standard and were conducted in a non-personal way.  The issues we dealt with in a non-objectionable manner from the point of view of the person who raised the question or from the point of view of the person to whom the question was directed.  That should be the hallmark of a politician who is able to deal with the situation on hand.  It should be and was always possible for a politician on the Opposition side to question his opposite number in a non-personal and non-objectionable way.  Likewise, it should always be possible for the Member on the opposite side of the House to answer in a similar fashion.  Once we lose sight of that objective, whether in this House, at local authority level of in any other forum, debate will degenerate into a political squabble.  It certainly does not do us any good in the eyes of the public or gain political advantage for one political party or another.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> I hope that the massive task which lies ahead of the Government will be addressed fairly and squarely by the members of the incoming Government, that they will do their jobs honestly and well, as I know they are capable of doing, and that we on this side of the House can give them the strong and constructive opposition they deserve and expect.  We hope that, at the end of the day, the general public will be the winners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as possible to give some time to another Fine Gael speaker, as promised.  Today politicians and the press used quotations and even clichés to describe what has happened. I am at a disadvantage because I am away from my books and I would not trust my faulty memory, I would have to check the source of a quotation from Shakespeare or Seán Ó Faoláin or, more appropriately, Edwin O'Connor, the Providence, Rhode Island born author of <i>The Last Hurrah,</i> which was not quoted today but which might be more applicable to the politics of Boston, particularly south Boston, in a certain era.</P>
      <P>One phrase kept recurring in the House today, &ldquo;the end of an era&rdquo;.  It is a cliché.  What does it mean?  How does one measure what an era produces?  You cannot measure it through personalities in this House, you measure an era through the progress of ordinary people and how it has benefited them.  It is measured also by its effects on employment and on economic policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been a leading party in his House almost since the State was founded.  They came to power in 1932 and formed the party with some help from Labour.  Since then they dominated Irish politics.  They have gone through different periods in their historic journey and the party are now at a crossroads. The party were founded on idealism, on a vision of Ireland, which developed momentum.  They have come a long way in Irish politics.  They built up the telephone service, protected Irish goods and kept out foreign goods through tariffs and taxes and by giving subsidies to home <Col N="1684" /> manufactured goods.  This was a very good thing at the time because it had a beneficial effect on employment and industrial production.</P>
    <P>Employment increased dramatically between 1932 and 1939 but, unfortunately, the party learned the hard lesson that political freedom is only a very limited concept; unless you have economic freedom those things eventually mean nothing.  That is what happened to the party because the forties and fifties were stagnant and the economy was going down.  I was affected in 1957 when 70,000 people emigrated.  I was one of them.  I found myself in London wondering what this was all about.  Eras and economic policies set me thinking about the whole business of politics.</P>
    <P>As I said, our economy was stagnant and Fianna Fáil did a remarkable thing; they had the strength, courage and capacity to turn their whole philosophy around.  They were the party of Sinn Féin, ourselves alone, including small farmers and small businessmen.  Instead of continuing in that vein they faced reality and realised that they had to bring in free trade and multinationals.  There was an Anglo-Irish free trade agreement in the mid-sixties and we joined the European Community in 1973.  Our educational system was changed to accommodate economic changes bringing about AnCO, FÁS, the University of Limerick, regional technical colleges and so on to accommodate society to those changes.  We dismantled censorship laws on books; when Deputy Lenihan was Minister for Justice he unbanned 7,000 books in one fell swoop in 1967.  That all happened under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>However, as a party, they could not go on in this way because they ran out of dynamism.  All that was left to the party in recent times was their ability to retain power which was no good because, even though the multinational companies brought a new impetus to industry and jobs here, that is not the case at present. We are now at a crossroads in relation to our development.  The cohesion of the party was disrupted in the late sixties and <Col N="1685" /> early seventies by the arms trial and the party have never really recovered from it.  It has left an indelible imprint on the party's make-up.  The then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch was forced out of office by a carefully orchestrated campaign, and some of the people involved then were involved in the campaign which was also orchestrated to force Deputy Haughey out of office.</P>
    <P>At this stage the party should take stock and see how they will make progress. The Thatcher years in Britain were also measured by their effect on people and employment.  We must apply the same criteria to the Haughey era.  Of course the Government had no control over many events of the last two decades but, no matter what excuses we make, there are 270,000 people unemployed, which is an indictment of all Members of the House.  None of us has any reason to be smug, complacent or proud of what we have done; as Deputy Sheehan said, we must account for our stewardship and unemployment is an unfortunate and unpalatable fact.</P>
    <P>A new Taoiseach has come on the scene and he has reshuffled the Cabinet in a very drastic way.  However, new policies have not emerged from anybody over the last few days to tackle the problems of society.  I do not wish to personalise the Members involved in the transition, I would not reduce my contribution to making personal remarks about former Ministers and the newly promoted Deputies because time will show the effectiveness of the new Government. However, I would be less than honest if I did not say that I am surprised at some of the changes in the Fianna Fáil Cabinet; perhaps I would not have made them. The pendulum of politics swept some of them out of office but others have been swept back to power.  If we include Deputy Haughey, nine of the old Cabinet have gone and the figure comes to ten if you include Deputy Dermot Ahern, the former Chief Whip.  Not only has the new broom swept clean but some scores have obviously been settled.</P>
    <P>The new Cabinet is, to use another cliché, a rainbow coalition.  I should like <Col N="1686" /> to know what is at the end of the rainbow. Many senior figures have been demoted. The old Cabinet are mostly on the back benches and there are more than a few loose, dangerous cannons among them. It remains to be seen what fire power these cannons can muster and at whom the fire power will be directed in times to come.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to wish the new Ministers well.  I know many of them personally, as they often languished on the back benches with me.  We had that in common during the good &mdash; and not so good &mdash; years in the House.  I will confine myself to commenting on two Ministers.  The problems of local government have been outlined in this House and it is time they were tackled.  The issue has been dodged for too long.  Unless the new Minister tackles the problem of restructuring local government and allocating finance there will be no future for it, which would be a drastic curtailment of democracy.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will be a good Minister and that she will use her office in the able, intelligent way she did in the past.  The last few months have been a traumatic period for her.  I should like her to take an interest in the Shannon stopover question and not merely make inspired leaks to newspapers or plant stories in the press.  She knows Shannon Airport well and the contribution it has made to the entire western seaboard.  I should like the Minister to ensure that the status of Shannon Airport is not downgraded in any way.</P>
    <P>It is important that we learn a lesson from the Haughey era, as it is being called.  It is also important that young people learn this lesson.  Public representatives are here to represent the public, especially young people.  I have not said too much in the House over the past six months because I have been appalled at the scathing and bitter attacks by Members on each other.  This has served no useful purpose.  The public at large have found it difficult to watch their public representatives behaving like school children.  In this context we can learn something from the British.  British <Col N="1687" /> parliamentarians in the House of Commons are perhaps far more theatrical than we are in their debates but they do not wound as deeply or hit as hard as we do.  Sometimes Irish parliamentarians in their contributions strive to make a killing, wound or maim other Members.  This serves no purpose to the people we represent. We are here to solve problems, find a way forward, give people hope and set a framework and infrastructure by which they can live their lives.</P>
    <P>Those who founded our country in 1916 were all men.  Some of them were idealists and some had no idea of the world.  However, they all had a vision of Ireland, were courageous and had an idealism.  Have we lost that idealism, especially since Fianna Fáil took office. We need a new idealism.  The politics of expediency, opportunism, personal advancement and cynicism have no place in Ireland today.  Other countries are not impressed by &ldquo;ring craft&rdquo;.  We must earn our living in the world and find the way forward.  Politics is about solving problems and helping people to live decent lives.  We should get on with this work after today's blood letting.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. My time is limited as other speakers are anxious to contribute.  I wish the Taoiseach and his Government every success. I have known the Taoiseach for a number of years, having served with him on Longford County Council and representing the same constituency.  He has always been extremely courteous and helpful to politicians from other parties.  While it may not be known to politicians in other parts of the country, he was the ante-post favourite for this job among politicians in County Longford for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach faces a very tough task. He should know better than anyone else the problems facing the country.  We have the highest unemployment level in the history of the State and he has taken this on board as one of his priorities.  We can only wish him well in dealing with this problem.  I was glad to hear his remarks <Col N="1688" /> on Northern Ireland.  All democratic politicians can only wish the Taoiseach and the Government well in dealing with this tragic problem.  It is the duty of all Members to help the Government in whatever way they can in trying to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>There is an air of expectation among the people of County Longford.  As the Taoiseach knows there have been many problems on the employment front in that county over the past number of years.  The people of County Longford hope that the Taoiseach's elevation to high office will give a much needed boost to the area.  I wish the Taoiseach and his family well in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with my colleagues in wishing the Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the new Government well.  Since I was elected a Member of this House I have engaged in sparring matches with the Taoiseach from time to time.  We have had arguments about the state of the economy.  I notice that the Taoiseach at his press conference claimed that the economy is in good order.  However, that is a matter for debate on another day.</P>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach well during his term of office.  Many things have changed in recent times, one of which was referred to by the Leader of my party today when he said that Government policy is being debated in public by the chairmen of semi-State bodies and other people.  The Taoiseach needs to set out a policy which will be clearly understood by the servants of this State.  As a man from rural Ireland, he will be expected to place greater emphasis on the west and midwest regions.  It is for this reason that I look forward to a greater distribution of Structural Funds post-1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister for the Environment to oversee the building of a motorway from the east to the west.  He should make that a priority.  The Taoiseach needs to take into consideration the needs of the west, as highlighted by the Bishops.  The Minister for the Environment is fully aware of the Department's plan to build a motorway to <Col N="1689" /> Portlaoise &mdash; Ireland will finish at that point.  The Taoiseach should lay it on the line that the west has to be taken into account.  He comes from the west and nice things have been said about his association with the west.  I will not say anything further about that tonight.  The people west of the Shannon need a gesture from the Taoiseach.  I am talking about the building of a motorway from Dublin to Limerick.  This would give all people access to the capital.  It would also give employment to small builders, and small industries.  This is the only way the Government can hope to gain the support of people and make a dent in our huge unemployment level.</P>
