      <P>On item No. 6 relating to the Green Paper on Education, I would like to confirm that the Government are agreeable to a further day's debate on this in view of the fact that a one day debate would allow only a small minority of Members to contribute on this important topic.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of what happened the other day I must protest in the <Col N="1371" /> strongest possible terms at the manner in which this new procedure regarding Friday debates is starting in the House. It appears that there is no provision whatever for Independent Deputies and the whole procedure has not been explained to us.  The least the Taoiseach could do is explain the matter to us.  It is not clear from the Order Paper what the position is.  I do not think time will be provided for Independent Deputies.  Will the Taoiseach please comment on the matter? Will the Taoiseach say something?  I am entitled to a reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement that item No. 7 shall be decided without debate appears to be in conflict with item No. 3 which sets out the guidelines for the debate on the second part of item No. 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 7 (ii) is the introductory part, which will be decided without debate, and item No. 3 (ii) is the taking of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only the first part of item No. 7 which is being taken without debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 7 (ii) agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with item No. 3 (ii) agreed?</P>

      <P>Yesterday I indicated to the Government Chief Whip that I felt there should be a debate on the Supplementary Estimate relating to this House.  We are seeking to pass an Estimate in the region of £23 million on the nod.  It is of significance that it deals with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Estimates <Col N="1372" /> of this size should not be passed without some debate.  This is particularly the case when it relates to our work.  I wish to register my objection to this procedure being pursued; it is a mistake.  The issues dealt with in the Estimate are excellent, the introduction of electronic voting is an important advance and the same applies to the additional staff required for the extra hours which this House is sitting.</P>
      <P>Under item No. 3 (ii) (a) it is indicated that the Fine Gael and Labour Parties will have 20 minutes in which to speak on this important debate in relation to assistance for companies in trouble. Effectively, the Democratic Left will have ten minutes to speak on this issue and they should also be given 20 minutes. There is a discrepancy in the way in which time is allocated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Fine Gael Party wish to argue for 40 minutes for them they are entitled to do so.  However, ten minutes is a derisory allocation in which to deal with jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a discrepancy if you compare the time being allocated for the International Marine-Loran C Agreement, where each Member of the House who wishes to speak will be allocated 20 minutes while Members who wish to speak on the jobs issue are allocated only ten minutes. There seems to be a misunderstanding about the issue with which we are dealing under the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that people are dying at the rate of 100 per day in Baidoa and that aid workers have had to withdraw from the town because of lack of UN protection, will the Government urgently ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to contact the United Nations to ensure that adequate protection for our aid workers so that food and other supplies will get through to the starving people in Somalia, particularly in Baidoa?</P>

I remind the Taoiseach of the titles of those four Bills.

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Supplementary Estimate which has been moved by the Minister for Finance and which I am now following up on this morning arises from the Government's decision to immediately establish a market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March 1993 to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the recent turmoil in exchange rates within the exchange rate mechanism.</P>
      <P>The recent currency crisis was not precipitated by the Irish Government.  For several years we have pursued a consistent line in regard to our exchange rate policy.  We have sought to maintain a firm and stable exchange rate within the narrow band of the EMS.  We have lent credibility to this approach by adopting a set of economic policies which are consistent with membership of a strong currency regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach has paid dividends. From 1987 wage and price inflation reduced sharply to facilitate the achievement of significant gains in the competitiveness of the traded sector of the economy.  This improvement in competitiveness coincided with reasonably favourable increases in import demand from our main trading partners, particularly the UK, as economic growth achieved a modest acceleration.  This gave a major boost to exports to sustain a record surplus on our balance of trade and balance of payments in recent years. I realise I am repeating what is known to the House, but it is important to sketch <Col N="1382" /> the economic context and background to this morning's debate.</P>
    <P>Inflation was brought down to the less than 3 per cent annual rate that prevails at present.  Interest rates, which soared almost ten percentage points above the German rates in the mid 1980s, fell to less than one percentage point above those rates just before the recent currency crisis.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced from 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to the 2 per cent rate now prevailing.  Government debt as a percentage of GNP has come down by about a quarter over the last four to five years.  Significant progress in the reform of our taxation system has also been achieved, especially over the past three years, thereby engendering investor confidence and a growth in numbers in nonagricultural employment.</P>
    <P>Ireland's, capability to sustain a stable position within the ERM has been recognised consistently by our Community partners.  The recent tensions within the European Monetary System have led, through, to speculative attacks on the EMS currencies on a scale not previously contemplated.  The withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS and the devaluation of the peseta has created further fears in the market that the EMS might break up, thereby fuelling further speculation against the Irish pound as well as other EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>There are many good reasons why it is important that Ireland remain part of a hard currency regime within the ERM. In the time available I will refer to a number which are important from an industrial development point of view. First, the obvious reason.  Firm currency policies in recent years have contributed to competitiveness and allowed our trade with the rest of Europe to increase dramatically.  Certainty and the assurance of stability contribute to trade growth.  Uncertainty and the risk of fluctuation undermine trade and serve to inhibit firms from undertaking costly and potentially high risk marketing initiatives in new markets.</P>
    <P>Secondly, nearly £8.9 billion of our <Col N="1383" /> national debt is denominated in currencies other than sterling; accordingly, a devaluation of our currency would increase the cost of servicing our national debt by almost £1 billion per year if the Irish pound devalues to the extent of the recent devaluation of sterling.  This would considerably constrain the Government's objective of achieving a continuation of the tax reforms initiated in recent years, which aim to encourage enterprise and employment creation.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, a devaluation of the Irish pound now would lead to similar expectations at times of future currency instability and would very definitely drive away future investment.  It would add a higher risk premium to interest rates in future and would discourage industry from taking the actions required to expand in future years.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, our membership of the ERM and adherence to its disciplines has facilitated a significant improvement in the state of our national finances.  It has contributed greatly to the improved rate of employment.  While recognising that much more must be done to sustain and increase employment, we cannot jettison recent progress by now going for a devaluation option.</P>
    <P>The degree of dependence of Irish industry on the UK market in particular as a location for overseas sales, has greatly exacerbated the difficulties faced by manufacturers here.  Since we joined the European Community, our reliance on the UK market has almost halved, from 61 per cent of total exports in 1972 to 32 per cent last year.  However, even though we have achieved that remarkable progress, one can only shudder at the thought of what would have happened had progress not been achieved in the diminution of dependency on the UK market, but it still remains a dominant market for us.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála calculate that in 1991 indigenous industry exported some 43 per cent of its output to the UK market.  It is therefore not surprising that the dramatic fall in the value of sterling <Col N="1384" /> in recent weeks and days caused immense difficulties for a wide range of industrial firms.</P>
    <P>In response to the growing crisis facing many industrial firms, the Government established a working group representing the main Departments of State and State-sponsored bodies to look at the nature and extent of the problems arising for firms and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The working group drew strongly on the information available from representative bodies of exporters, industry and trade unions, as well as many individual firms, in evaluating the extent and nature of the problems.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the representatives of industry, trade promotions groups, individual firms and trade unions for the open way they conducted their business and their lobbying with me, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance and the Government.  There was a realisation that something had to be done and a clear recognition that the Government meant to do something.  There was a common point of view and it was possible, therefore, to work out the plan.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the information available to them the working group concluded that the devaluation of a number of EC currencies, in particular sterling, has caused significant potential problems for some firms notably in the UK market where the cash receivables in Irish punt terms have fallen by over 10 per cent; on the domestic market where there is high import penetration from UK firms and in certain third markets which take a high proportion of exports and in which there is serious price competition from UK firms.</P>
    <P>The firms under greatest pressure have some or all of the following main characteristics: a high level of dependence on markets where the forces of competition have changed radically because of recent currency instability; existing low margins; high gearing; a high level of debtor exposure and little or no forward cover.  Some have all those components, some have one or two but they all share those common characteristics. <Col N="1385" /> The Government accept that the short term impact of the currency crisis holds very serious consequences for a large number of Irish trading firms because of its suddenness, intensity and the size of devaluation which has occurred.  They also recognise that the first responsibility for responding to the consequential and fundamental change in the market place rests with each individual firm affected and that the essential role of Government is to support firms in doing this.</P>
    <P>I know from speaking with many firms in recent days that this process of adjustment is already taking place.  Firms are exploring ways in which they can reduce production and distribution costs and are taking action to improve the products and services they offer customers to justify an increase in prices to help maintain margins.  Many are also looking at the opportunities available in markets whose currencies have not devalued such as Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>The Government, and their agencies, will provide significant assistance to help firms to help themselves in the current difficult situation which many of them face.  That is the purpose of this debate today and this Estimate.</P>
    <P>The market development fund has been introduced as a support which is quick, flexible and concentrated on those firms that require support to put into place the adjustment measures needed to survive and expand in the changed marketplaces which they serve and wish to serve.</P>
    <P>The Government have ruled out a blanket provision of employment or other subsidies which would apply to firms irrespective of their needs or of the actions they were putting into place to maintain competitiveness and market share.</P>
    <P>The market development fund will be operated on a number of general principles first, it is a temporary support measure.  Firms must be expected to take measures to maintain competitiveness in order to adapt to the new exchange rates. The fund will last for no more than six months and there will be a detailed review at the end of this year, at the half <Col N="1386" /> way stage.  The Government have also directed that the fund will be subject to ongoing monitoring, particularly in the light of currency movements.  In the event of a significant revaluation of sterling and other recently devalued currencies the underlying necessity for the fund would require immediate re-examination. Second, the fund has a limit of £50 million. The provision of this level of Government support over a six month period is a generous response by the Government to the difficulties of business and this has been recognised by the representative bodies and individual firms. Third, the fund will be targeted at firms which demonstrate a willingness and an ability to manage their way out of their difficulties which would have difficulty surviving without assistance and, as far as possible, maintaining employment during the six month period of the action.</P>
    <P>The establishment and management of the fund is being supervised and directed by a management board comprising the managing directors or chief executives of An Bord Tráchtála, the IDA, and FÁS together with representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Labour and the Marine and a representative from the industry/employer bodies and from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The administration of the scheme is being carried out by a special management team drawn from experienced executives from a number of State bodies.  The team are responsible for the day-to-day running of the fund, the operation of the eligibility criteria and all decisions on whether applicants qualify for support and the level of support, if any, to be made available.  The management team are being led by an assistant chief executive from An Bord Tráchtála and the team members are located in An Bord Tráchtála's head office in Dublin.  Payments to successful applicants will be made by An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, at another gathering in the offices of An Bord Tráchtála, I had occasion to see the plan in action, so to <Col N="1387" /> speak.  I was very impressed by it.  All the agencies were working together, phone inquiries were received, forms were being returned and there was a great air of activity.  There was a very committed response from the public sector involvement. I was particularly struck by the way the various agencies and Departments were working together to ensure that the help firms need was being given with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy.  I say: &ldquo;Well done to those involved in that team.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are responding in a very fine way, as one must do in a crisis.  Too often State agencies of one kind or another are the subject of criticism. I saw them in action and there were no demarcation lines but rather a huge co-operative effort.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate before us is for £20 million to be allocated to a new subhead within the Vote of the Office of the Department of Industry and Commerce. This represents a first tranche from the £50 million commitment by the Government to the fund.  I am advised that, on the basis of the information available to date, the £20 million allocation will cover any necessary draw-downs from the fund in 1992.</P>
      <P>The second part of today's Supplementary Estimate is for an additional £460,000 under the subhead dealing with An Bord Tráchtála's administration and general expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When deciding on the establishment of the market development fund, the Government also decided that £1 million from the fund should be allocated to a number of marketing bodies in the remainder of 1992 to enable special assistance to be provided towards travel costs of firms to meet existing and new buyers and for other exceptional marketing activities.  An Bord Tráchtála is to benefit from £800,000 of that £1 million. By way of explanation I should say that the other £200,000 is broken up into £150,000 to CBF and £50,000 to An Bord <Col N="1388" /> Iascaigh Mhara.  This £800,000 will be made up through the provision of the additional £460,000 provided for in this Supplementary Estimate and the restoration of a reduction in An Bord Tráchtála's grant-in-aid of £340,000 which the Government had decided upon in their mid-year review on expenditure.</P>
    <P>This increase in An Bord Tráchtála's general marketing expenditure will underpin the efforts of the organisation to respond to the particular needs of small to medium indigenous exporters. On 2 October An Bord Tráchtála introduced a special 1-800 contact line to help firms deal with market difficulties arising from the currency devaluations.  Forty market specialists from An Bord Tráchtála's offices in Europe, the UK and the US have been recalled to Ireland and are meeting with companies throughout the country.  The specialists are visiting companies, advising them on specific difficulties and opportunities and, where appropriate, setting up market visit programmes.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála are also accelerating their inward buyer missions programme bringing overseas buyers to selected companies in the regions to discuss business opportunities.  The board will also organise a campaign which focuses on local industry successes and heightens the awareness of their contribution to the local economy.  These initiatives are an intensification and redirection of existing programmes to meet the problems which the currency crisis has caused for firms.  In recent years An Bord Tráchtála's grant-in-aid has increased significantly as a result of the support provided to it by the European Regional Development Fund which supports marketing measures at a rate of 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>The market development fund initiative has received widespread support from employer bodies, trade unions and across the entire political spectrum.  It is a speedy and targeted response by the Government to an unprecedented situation which has faced many of our businesses.</P>
    <P>The Department appreciate very much <Col N="1389" /> the briefing of Opposition spokespersons yesterday by officials of the management board and team.  I appreciate the positive response which the setting up of this fund has received from Deputies on all sides of the House.  I would welcome the support of the House for this Supplementary Estimate.  I look forward very much to the debate which will follow.  I shall avail of the opportunity to clear up any points which are raised.  I wish to say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the firms who, in very difficult circumstances, have shown great resilience in dealing with the difficult financial situation in which they now find themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State began her contribution by stating that the recent currency crisis was not precipitated by the Irish Government.  That is true.  However, the Government could have done more to mitigate the crisis, particularly for firms and mortgage holders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I said the Government, not the Minister.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance appear to be stumbling through the present economic crisis without any co-ordinated plan.  Almost every household is facing financial problems as a result of interest rate rises which could have been avoided if the Government had accepted the Fine Gael proposals put forward by Deputy John Bruton some weeks ago. Two days before interest rates were increased by 3 per cent, the Fine Gael Leader made three solid proposals to avoid this increase and save employment. These proposals were rejected by the Government even before they were read. The Fine Gael plan would have protected mortgage holders by keeping interest rates down, protected jobs through lower mortgage rates and lower interest rates, halved employers' PRSI for manufacturers and protected the value of the IR£ through action rather than talk.  Fine Gael proposed that the Government <Col N="1390" /> should guarantee that the present exchange rate would apply for foreign holders of IR£ denominated Government securities for a fixed period.  These were the only constructive proposals to come from any quarter during that crisis.</P>
      <P>I assert that if the Fine Gael advice had been followed two weeks ago we would not now be discussing this huge Supplementary Estimate which is required to bail out companies who are experiencing significant problems at present.  The pain and fear being experienced by struggling businesses, farmers trying to stock their land and mortgage holders would have been avoided if some of those measures had been put into effect.  We were told at the time that rules would have to be changed.  The very Government who were so afraid to change the rules to help the people to whom I have referred have now admitted that the £50 million subsidy scheme they propose to introduce for a minority of those affected by them is a direct breach of EC competition rules, rules which exist mainly to protect smaller countries and in the enforcement of which Ireland has a vested interest.</P>
      <P>The 3 per cent rise in interest rates has occurred only because certain nonresident investors lack short term confidence in the value of the punt and have been selling it.  If their confidence was restored their money would flow back and the 3 per cent interest rate could be reversed.  Fine Gael have put forward a concrete proposal to make this happen. We propose that the Government guarantee that the exchange rate will apply for foreign holders of Irish pound denominated Government securities for a fixed period only.  If the 3 per cent increase was to remain with us for over one year it would cost Irish businesses and other sectors £615 million.  This is based on internal borrowings of £20.5 billion, as stated in the autumn Central Bank report.  That is a huge drain on the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past number of weeks the punt has appreciated by over 10 per cent against sterling.  I know that this has eased somewhat in the past few days. This has resulted in a trade weighted <Col N="1391" /> appreciation of the punt of approximately 3 per cent.  As a result, Irish manufacturing in particular has suffered serious competitive distortions and a deterioration in business, especially in the UK, on which, as the Minister of State said, 43 per cent of our total trade depends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In some sectors; not all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Not only does this loss of competitiveness create a major risk of a rise in unemployment in the short term but a loss of contracts in the UK could have a serious long term effect on our market share.  Effective action is required to tackle the effects of the fall in sterling on our export competitiveness. This action is vital.  Fine Gael will support this Supplementary Estimate.  It is an important step forward in helping firms who have found themselves in temporary difficulties because of the present sterling and currency crisis generally.</P>
      <P>Once it was recognised that the export and import substitute labour intensive sectors were worst hit an immediate reduction in employers' PRSI should have been introduced.  Fine Gael propose that employers' contributions in manufacturing, including food, should have been reduced from 12 per cent to 6 per cent.  If administrative changes were introduced, this could have been modified to 4 per cent on the first £10,000 and 8 per cent on the balance.  This proposal is in line with the need to reform the tax system, as proposed by both the Commission on Taxation and the Culliton report.  These proposals would not run contrary to the measures being put into effect by the Government at present. This measure would lower labour costs by approximately 3 per cent.  Labour costs in vulnerable sectors, such as textiles and confectionery, are as high as 80 per cent of in-firm costs.  Lowering these costs would go a long way towards offsetting the loss in competitiveness which they have suffered as a result of the fall in sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> The direct cost of this proposal would be £125 million in a full year.  This cost has to be compared to the cost to the Exchequer of increased unemployment if nothing had been done.  Obviously this would depend on the level of ensuing unemployment.  Some weeks ago various commentators gave a conservative estimate of 5,000 job losses.  The tax loss to the Exchequer from these job losses would be approximately £20 million and direct unemployment costs would be increased by approximately £30 million. Therefore, the shortfall would have been £75 million.  If the employment shake-out was as high as 7,500 the shortfall would drop to £50 million, which, coincidentally, is the figure we are talking about today.</P>
    <P>All of this particularly the currency crisis and the extent to which Irish firms depend on exports, brings home to us the urgent need to bring forward early proposals at European level to establish a European Central Bank.  All European countries have become hostages of the Bundesbank.  During the past few weeks Fine Gael have proposed on many occasions that the Government should seek at European level &mdash; the Taoiseach might have an opportunity to do this at Birmingham tomorrow &mdash; to bring forward proposals to establish a European Central Bank without delay.  This would reduce the level of distortion in currency markets which has hit many vulnerable, export-orientated and export-dominated economies like Ireland in the past few weeks.</P>
    <P>With regard to the measures which have been announced here today by the Minister of State, I thank the Minister, the officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the IDA and An Bord Tráchtála for briefing the Opposition parties yesterday on the type of measures which will be implemented to allay some of the problems being experienced by firms in trouble.  Typical firms experiencing trouble at present are those in the clothing, food and joinery sectors. Some food firms are covered by monetary compensatory amounts by the European Community, particularly those in dairying <Col N="1393" /> and beef.  But sectors like sheep meat, pig meat and mushrooms have come under serious threat as a result of the sterling crisis and are in urgent need of attention.  I am glad that application forms for assistance have already been issued to many firms nationwide in order to ascertain whether they are eligible for such assistance.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State did not avail of the opportunity to spell out in more detail the type of action she proposes taking in the course of her introductory remarks this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do so in the course of the question and answer session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to place the appropriate guidelines on the record of the House, detailing the nuts and bolts of this scheme and how the appropriate finance will be allocated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government and An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; under the leadership of Mr. McCrea &mdash; have devised a system easily understood and implemented by way of application for assistance under this Market Development Fund.  There is one particular aspect of the guidelines in respect of which I contend the provisions of the scheme should be more flexible.  I refer to the section &mdash; No. 3, under the heading of &ldquo;Financial&rdquo;&mdash; subhead 3.4 &mdash; where it is indicated that this assistance will be applicable to companies subject to the 10 per cent corporation tax.  I would appeal to the Minister to be as flexible as possible in the implementation of this fund.  I would point out to her that there are many other export services also experiencing difficulty particularly in the tourism sector.  While realising that that is not applicable specifically to the Department of Industry and Commerce I want to avail of this opportunity to highlight the fact that there are other sectors, apart from the firms I have mentioned, experiencing short term difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the guidelines issued for application for assistance under the market development fund it is anticipated that the provisions <Col N="1394" /> of the fund will be reviewed in December when there will be a review undertaken of currency fluctuations at that time.  There is also an indication from Europe that, if we do not breach competition rules and if we get limited approval by the European Commission to implement this scheme, it cannot last any longer than six months.  I acknowledge that there must be a limit to the extent of application of any scheme.  It would be my hope that his scheme &mdash; if deemed to be ineligible and in breach of EC competition rules &mdash; will not mean that firms will have to repay the amounts of assistance approved.  Perhaps the Minister would clarifiy that when replying.</P>
    <P>I am also impressed at the speed with which payments will be made to firms by An Bord Tráchtála through a bank Giro system, that there will be no delay over the next couple of weeks, that if applications are received quickly payments will be made speedily, at regular intervals, thereby protecting firms at present experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of these temporary measures is the protection of employment and the business share built up by Irish firms in recent years.  It is important also that our market share in the United Kingdom, in particular &mdash; penetrated by very aggressive marketing on the part of An Bord Tráchtála &mdash; be maintained.  I can assure the Minister that firms are making every effort to visit their clients in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to ensure they understand the temporary problems Irish firms are experiencing.  Even though the Minister aspires to having firms further reduce their costs, thereby becoming more competitive, I can assure her that they would be doing so in any case and that it is difficult to expect them to be more competitive than they are at present.  The costs they must incur are largely those about which they can do nothing themselves but rather about which this House can do something.  I am thinking of the costs of insurance, telecommunications, transport, all of which must be addressed in any case if we are to be competitive <Col N="1395" /> apart from any fluctuations in currency in the context of the single market and the aggressive competitiveness that will arise as part of the completion of that single market.  I did say there were other sectors that would require financial assistance to which I might now refer in the context of the protection of employment and living standards generally.</P>
    <P>I contend that mortgagors should be considered also.  Though recognising that this does not fall directly within the remit of the Supplementary Estimate I might seek the Minister of State's assurance that the Government plan to bring about circumstances in which householders, mortgagors in particular, nationwide will also be considered for assistance when they have concluded their deliberations. Mortgagors should not be left hung out to dry by the Government in the face of a 3 per cent hike in mortgage interest repayments.  I predict we will see further closures of firms if we do not implement the provisions of this scheme flexibly.  We shall also see repossessions of dwellings if we do not ensure an important contribution in keeping mortgage repayments down.  When one considers that a mortgage of £40,000 will mean an increase of £80 per month in repayments one readily appreciates the huge financial strain that will impose on householders. Therefore, it behoves us all to do whatever we can, particularly in the case of the Minister for the Environment, to ensure that building societies and financial institutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the package introduced by the Minister of State.  I am particularly impressed with the fact that it deals with current problems speedily, effectively and without bureaucratic delays.  It would be my hope that the flexibility in its implementation assured us by the Minister's departmental officials will mean that sectors, apart <Col N="1396" /> from those directly in her remit, and apart from those subject to the 10 per cent corporation tax, will benefit from the £50 million fund.  Therefore, it would be my hope that the temporary exposure of our economy to fluctuations in sterling and other European currencies will prove to be temporary and that employment opportunities painstakingly built up by firms over many years will be protected, allowing them to expand further on the completion of the internal market.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will not be opposing this Supplementary Estimate. It arises because of the need to fund a new market development fund for businesses that have been badly hit by the effective devaluation of sterling.</P>
      <P>In general, the fund and the scheme behind it is a well designed one and ought to transmit money quickly, with the minimum of bureaucratic fuss, to where it is most needed.  To that extent I commend the Minister on her actions in the drawing up of the fund.  In particular may I say that whoever designed the various forms associated with the fund deserves congratulation. They are the clearest and simplest forms I have ever seen.  I am quite sure they will be a welcome innovation for the people who are used to dealing with the ever more complicated world of Irish bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>However, I do have some reservations about the scheme itself.  It is as well that I place them on the record.  For example, as I understand it, the scheme is aimed principally at labour-intensive businesses. But the criterion, if I understand it correctly, applied to measure the concept of labour intensity is a ratio of employees to sales of 15 per cent.  Unless I am mistaken that will open the scheme to a great many businesses I would not have described as labour-intensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme appears to operate on a sort of honour system.  As far as I can see there is no in-built check that will ensure that the money being paid out will be used for intended purposes only while appreciating that the scheme was drawn <Col N="1397" /> up as an emergency response and that the Minister is anxious to avoid an over bureaucratic approach, it does appear to me that a very careful eye will have to be kept on this money once paid.  If we have learned nothing else over the past few years, we must surely have learned how tempting it is to abuse public money when it is easily come by.</P>
    <P>The major reservation about the scheme is that it is designed to help profitable businesses who have run into difficulties or crisis because of external factors which we hope will be temporary. The purpose of the scheme, put crudely, is to help them ride over those difficulties and return to profitability.  If the scheme works really well in helping business to establish new and diversified markets, new sources of raw material and so on, it should help at least some of those businesses to become even more profitable in the long term than they are now.  So far so good, but there is no provision in the scheme for pay back.  Taxpayers are putting up this money, for a good and necessary purpose, but with no prospect of seeing any return on that money in the event that it helps to restore profitability in the businesses to which it is being given.  That seems wrong in principle.  In other words, this scheme would not have been designed and operated as a handout scheme.  It should be a condition of the scheme that as and when businesses return to the level of profitability they have enjoyed, and especially if they succeed in increasing profitability, they should be required to make at least some contribution to the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is also worth making the point that one of the principal reasons it is necessary to introduce this scheme is that since 1987 there has been a systematic dismantling of the existing agencies in the State sector which were geared and equipped to carry out the kind of rescue operation this scheme is aimed at.  The destruction of Fóir Teoranta and NADCORP was carried out for ideological reasons.  The folly of that destruction is becoming clearer by the day.  There would have been no need for interdepartmental committees or new schemes like this if one of those agencies <Col N="1398" /> had been kept in place and operational. They would have had the expertise, the background and the personnel to get this scheme up and running quickly and to provide the advice that will undoubtedly be necessary in drawing up individual company plans.  The Trade Board have never had that function in the past and their experience across the whole range of financial management, production and materials is very limited.  It would be nice to think that sooner or later the Government would learn lessons from their past mistakes.  There would be no need for <i>ad hoc</i> responses, no matter how well designed, if we had the proper structures in place to deal not only with crisis management but with ongoing development.</P>
    <P>This is a debate essentially about the competitiveness of business in a small open economy.  It is perhaps timely that it should take place the day before the Birmingham Summit.  On the general issue of this Supplementary Estimate, the Government have been commended for recognising and responding quickly to the crisis facing small business.  They have been further commended for making those arrangements without breaching the already established borrowing targets for this year.  The signs are that even after the £50 million we are providing today is spent we will still end the year well under target.</P>
    <P>In that context it is worth pointing out that the small business crisis is not the only crisis demanding urgent action today.  We are debating an Estimate for £50 million to meet that crisis but we are still ignoring the many other crises that face Irish families.  When will we have a Supplementary Estimate for mental handicap, for homelessness or to deal with hospital waiting lists?  Why is it enough where hospital patients are concerned to produce glossy charters which fail to mention the six hours waiting time in casualty rooms or the hour and a half one must wait for an ambulance?  None of these problems could be solved overnight by a Supplementary Estimate, but all of them could be alleviated to some degree without breaching the target for borowing. <Col N="1399" /> It gives some indication of the priority of the Government that a crisis facing business becomes an immediate preoccupation and that it is possible to and the money virtually overnight to deal with that crisis while the urgent and short term crises facing the wider society continue to be ignored.</P>
    <P>The general issue of competitiveness is at the centre of this matter.  The damage to Irish competitiveness was caused by an assault on national currencies which has done untold damage.  It tells us a lot about the Europe we live in now and the Europe we need to build.  The governor of the Central Bank said the other night that it is difficult to say what economic advantage flows from currency speculation. That remark might well qualify is the understatement of the year.  The outburst of greed and avarice that dominated the financial markets in the past few weeks should not have been allowed to happen and should never be allowed to happen again.  It became almost a war, with commentators employing military terminology to try to describe unfolding events.  Who were the speculators who unleashed their greed on the financial markets?  They were highly respectable and powerful multinational banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies and pension funds set up to ensure security for working people in the first instance.  It would be interesting to know how much money Irish banks made from the many attacks on the Irish punt. Reports suggest that the British banks made more than £1 billion from bringing sterling to its knees.  British pension funds have contributed to the thousands of job losses that may well flow from the damage to the British economy.  If we suffer job losses here, how much have Irish pension funds and banks contributed to it through their speculation in the currency markets?</P>
    <P>Let it not be forgotten that the philosophy underpinning this piracy is known and revered as that of free market forces. Whatever the markets do, even if it brings countries to the brink of financial humiliation, must be all right because, as <Col N="1400" /> they say, &ldquo;You cannot buck the market,&rdquo; to quote the high priestess of this religion, the notorious Lady Thatcher.</P>
    <P>There ought to be lessons in all of this. In the context of Europe the lesson surely is a simple one.  The only kind of Europe that will work is a highly co-operative Europe.  A Europe built exclusively on free market forces cannot survive indefinitely.  A progressive Europe must by definition be a social and responsible Europe.  A responsible Europe would be laying its plans now to ensure that greed and avarice, the desire of already wealthy and powerful individuals and companies to increase their wealth and power at the expense of those least able to defend themselves, should become a feature of history, not of the present or the future. Above all, we should remember that the Maastricht Treaty is not an <i>á la carte</i> menu.  It falls unless it applies to everybody equally.  European Union will not succeed unless it addresses the needs of the 16 million people who are unemployed in the Community, a figure which is still increasing steadily.</P>
    <P>For as long as exchange rate stability and lower inflation are the overriding priorities of European economic policy, irrespective of the level of economic activity, uncertainty and unemployment will be the consequences.  The Bundesbank which, in the interests of German unification, was prepared to accede to a one-for-one rate of exchange between the East German currency and the Deutsche Mark was far less accommodating when asked to reduce German interest rates to preserve sterling's position in the ERM.  There ought to be a lesson in that for us who have become dependent on our link with the Deutsche Mark.  Let us not kid ourselves that the Bundesbank is immune from politics or from political machinations, especially when it comes to preserving the German position at the top of the economic tree.</P>
    <P>Many Governments, including ours, are coping with the severe adjustments necessary to stay within the ERM in the face of persistent speculation.  The paradox for Ireland is that at very considerable social cost we have taken <Col N="1401" /> corrective action to reduce inflation and our public sector deficit.  Those indicators are now close to the Maastricht conditions for European Monetary Union. As soon as we get there, we will find that interest rates are up 3 per cent, increasing the social and economic burden, and that they have to rise further to stay with the Deutsche Mark.  On the other hand Germany's current deficit is well outside the 3 per cent target rate.  If Germany was to fund more of the cost of reunification through increased taxation, German interest rates could be reduced, thus helping other currencies to stabilise, especially the currencies of those countres which have the so-called economic fundamentals right.</P>
    <P>It is in the fundamental interests of those countries whose currencies are under attack to strongly urge Germany &mdash; and use the Birmingham summit to do so &mdash; to take account of the European implications of German economic policy. It is in our interests that Britain, as our main trading partner, should not be shunned but rather encouraged back into the fold.  Unless we succeed in that as part of a more coherent European approach, we will have to face the issue of devaluation. We cannot continue indefinitely coping with the present distorted relationship between the punt and sterling.  Our trading relationship with Britain is too important for us to be able to cope indefinitely with the artificial loss of competitiveness that arises from the collapse of sterling.  As far as I can see, there is no political possibility of Mr. Major and the UK rejoining ERM without some movement in German interest rates.</P>
    <P>Until the Danes and the UK pass the Treaty the current uncertainty will persist and sterling will remain outside ERM and will probably continue to fall in the medium term.  That will force us to choose between devaluation or crippling interest rates.  It is Hobson's choice. Interest rates at the current level are simply unsustainable.  They have to be brought down and Germany has to be encouraged to give positive ledership on this question immediately.  Otherwise, the special summit in Birmingham could <Col N="1402" /> mark the beginning of the break-up of the EC and not just the end of Maastricht. Without a reduction in German interest rates Irish rates cannot come down.  The consequences do not appear to have been taken on board by the Government for a period beyond some three months.  That would represent an unacceptable price for membership of any monetary union.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of the appropriate economic policies which EC countries should pursue, the most dispiriting indications are that European economies are preparing for yet another round of deflation at the start of next year.  We badly need instead, a co-ordinated European reflation to ensure that the prospects of additional growth from monetary union will materialise.  Otherwise, job losses here and throughout Europe will continue to spiral downwards.</P>
    <P>We are addressing here in a somewhat peripheral way the fundamental issue of our competitiveness as a small, open trading economy in a Europe wracked by self doubt and uncertainty.  Passing this Estimate will help for today, but we cannot address the deeper issues alone. To do that we need to build alliances with all the other countries of Europe who share our interests and use those alliances to hammer home the message again and again that there is no such thing as a two-speed Europe.  Either Europe will work for everyone or it will not work at all. We have to think well ahead on this issue. The three months or six months period is fine.  That is the time span envisaged by the Supplementary Estimate before the House, but where do we go from there?  We have to review the position of our link with the Deutsche Mark.  Is it really producing the dividends that we require?  The Minister said that this approach had paid dividends.  There have been dividends.  We have a low inflation rate but it might not be so low when the new increased interest rates work their way into the index.  There might be a major rise in inflation rates when that works through.</P>
    <P>One very undesirable dividend we have from these policies is that we have 300,000 people unemployed, the highest <Col N="1403" /> percentage rate in Europe.  That is something nobody wants and unless the Government seriously review their economic policies to date and insist on obtaining from the Germans what they have refused until now, a reduction in interest rates and a review of all exchange rates in the ERM, the prospects of bringing down unemployment will not be bright in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal and any criticism or reservations I have is not intended to mitigate my admiration for the speed with which she, the Department and the other organisations involved have moved to produce a reasonably good scheme. The crisis we have has not materialised from the clear blue sky.  It is clearly the result of a failure of politics both at national level and at European level.  It is a nonsense having had almost 14 years experience of monetarism to continue to argue that we can allow the market in whatever commodity, whether in currency or anything else, to have a free rein.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that only a short time ago the Taoiseach said in this House that intervention was not a policy which his Government would support.  Of course, the pressure of events has ensured that the Government have had to intervene; and today we have a classic example of intervention to protect jobs and to protect markets, because it is clear that there has to be political intervention and political control over markets.  They cannot be allowed free rein because we can see the misery that is created when they are given a free hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in that light that I want to say also that the speed with which Sir Leon Brittan, the Commissioner for Competition, moved to say that he felt that this scheme might be in breach of competition rules was quite astonishing.  If the European Community and the Commission, and indeed the Council of Finance Ministers, had moved as fast when the currency crisis occurred, perhaps we might not have to introduce this measure <Col N="1404" /> in the first place.  I hope that the Commissioner and the Commission approve this scheme and allow it to proceed in order to ensure that jobs in this country are protected.</P>
    <P>The question arises of what the Commission are doing with regard to the interference with competition which the unilateral decision of the British Government to pull out of the ERM has created and the refusal of the British Government to support, for instance, the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty that has created inequalities in competition within the European Community.  They are things that perhaps Sir Leon Brittan should examine to see what impact they are having.  They are presumably having a much greater effect than the injection of £50 million by the Irish Government into companies that are at risk in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt also that the problem has eased to some extent in the last week or so.  The punt reached almost £1.10p against sterling about a week ago and it has now dropped to around £1.05 or thereabouts.  However, we recognise that there are still a significant number of firms facing very great difficulties because of the increase in the value of the punt particularly in relation to sterling, although obviously it has increased in relation to other European currencies as well, and there are particular problems for companies exporting to Britain, where almost 30 per cent of our exports go.</P>
    <P>It would be totally unacceptable and irresponsible for the Irish Government or for this House to block in any way the efforts being made to save jobs, given that we have in excess of 300,000 people already in receipt of unemployment assistance and benefit.  But it has to be emphasised that the sole purpose of this money must be to keep jobs and to protect markets and there must be no question of it being used to boost profits.  The most stringent possible safeguards should be introduced to make sure that it does not find its way into private bank accounts.  Already there have been predictable calls from some of the employer <Col N="1405" /> organisations that there must be no undue red tape.</P>
    <P>I would agree that there should never be undue red tape, but I am always suspicious of organisations or anybody else who believe that there is something intrinsically wrong with bureaucracy. Bureaucracy is there in order to make organisations work.  The largest private organisations, multinational and national, have their bureaucracies and it is important that we recognise that bureaucracies in themselves are not wrong or evil or bad.  It is only when they lose sight of their objectives and the purpose they are there for that they become an obstacle to progress.  So I would urge that a jaundiced eye be cast on calls for no bureaucracy or the least possible monitoring of this scheme.  It is important that it is monitored because, after all, it is public money that is being used to assist primarily, probably solely, private firms.</P>
    <P>The current crisis must not be used either to allow firms to evade their responsibilities in relation to tax payments. Again there have been calls for the Revenue Commissioners to go easy on those firms which are facing difficulties. There should be no question of this.  Tax liability only arises where profits are made, and the law must be enforced. If there are no profits there will be no liability for taxation, so there can be no question of the Revenue Commissioners going easy on them.</P>
    <P>I note the reference to the requirement that companies' tax affairs should be in order, and that is correct.  I note also the degree of flexibility there is in that wording.  I do not suggest for a minute that jobs should be allowed to disappear simply because the management or owners of a company have failed to keep their tax affairs up to date, but I do believe that it should be necessary that where a company does not have its tax affairs in order they be obliged to do so within a certain period of time, say, two or three months, and that otherwise payments would stop.  It is important that that criteria be tightened up at least to that extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> I welcome the decision that has been made not to interfere with the employers PRSI as has been sought by some employers' organisations because I believe that any tinkering around with that system will only undermine the whole social insurance system.  Despite claims by various employers' organisations, the fact is that in many instances PRSI is the only contribution to State funds that some companies make.  Indeed it is also a fact, arising from a question answered by the Minister for Social Welfare last week, that we have one of the lowest rates of employers' PRSI in OECD countries.  We have a level of 12.2 per cent compared to 15.4 per cent in Norway, 17.8 per cent in Germany, 30.3 per cent in Spain, 33.2 per cent in Sweden and 38 per cent in France.  It is important that this spurious claim that in some way employers' PRSI is crippling Irish industry is finally knocked on the head.  I welcome the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce have not gone down that road of relieving employers of that obligation.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that the question of payment to employees should not be under threat as a result of the current crisis.  In fact I would argue that the Department and the Minister should insist on the involvement of employees of these companies in some way in monitoring the application of the money and in monitoring the progress that is being made in the use of the money in protecting the jobs, because if a company does go out of business &mdash; and no one wants that to happen &mdash; at the very least the owners of that company will have assets to dispose of, but generally the workers who will be thrown out of a job will have no assets.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more I want to say on this but I realise my time has run out. I would urge the Minister to take the opportunity to report back to the House here at an early date on how the scheme is progressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The impact of the current crisis on the economy of this country is almost certainly as serious as any other <Col N="1407" /> event in recent history and demands a response from the Government which is firm, decisive and far-seeing.  Admirable though the sentiments behind the setting up of the fund may be, it appears on examination to be a hastily devised concept put together without any great thought as to the further implications of its provisions and which will divert attention away from the real problems which the Government have continually refused to face.</P>
      <P>To begin with, the market development fund poses as many questions as it answers.  The very name is the first piece of misinformation. The purpose of the fund is to support those exporters who have found themselves exposed, principally in the UK market, as a result of being inadequately prepared for the drastic change in the relationship between the punt and sterling.  Far from being a development fund the moneys now being sought for the Department of Industry and Commerce will be used as a rescue package for the firms which I have just described; at best it is hoped that it will assist them to maintain trading viability and to stave off job losses.  The fact that applicant companies are in danger of being forced out of business does not appear to be reflected in the title.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us what exactly is meant by &ldquo;manufacturing companies&rdquo;? Is it the stereotype picture of a company based on a production line with three dimensional product packed into a cardboard box at the end of the day for shipment abroad?  While that is a valid interpretation to put on the term it surely cannot be the only one.  It seems to be an old-fashioned concept and fails to take cognisance of the manner in which our export trade has ended and diversified in recent years.  While companies manufacturing a physical, indentifiable end product still form a significant proportion of our exporters they are far from being the only ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister given any thought, for example, to the many companies <Col N="1408" /> engaged in the service industries where the product being exported is in the form of technology and expertise?  We have a sigificant business in Ireland involving the selling abroad of engineering and architectural services and these can generate important earnings.  They are also labour-intensive and would consequently react in a very volatile fashion to conditions which would impact on their foreign currency earnings.  Forward planning is a vital component in this work and because of the time-scales involved it is necessary to tie down a financial commitment well in advance of any work actually carried out.  It is easy to see the impact that the recent currency crisis would have on such companies which would have no other means of redress with their overseas clients.  Does the Minister see the market development fund catering for such companies or do they not come under the heading of &ldquo;manufacturing companies&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There are many other areas where firms and businesses providing services will suffer losses due to advance commitments regarding payment in a currency other than the Irish pound.  We have many computer service companies which do the bulk of their business abroad selling Irish technology and expertise in what might be termed &ldquo;invisible exports&rdquo;.  Does the Minister envisage that such companies, the bulk of whose spending would be in labour costs, may now be classified as &ldquo;manufacturing companies&rdquo; and came under the terms of the scheme?</P>
    <P>While on the subject of &ldquo;invisible earnings&rdquo;, can the Minister say what plan she has for the largest industry of all to be affected by the currency crisis but which does not appear to be covered by the market development fund?  I am referring of course to the tourism industry which is the largest single foreign currency earner that we have and which could well be devastated by the currency events of recent weeks.  The tourism industry in Ireland is based largely on people and is probably the most labour-intensive industry that we have and, potentially, it holds out greatest hope for job creation in the future.  Yet ironically, it does not <Col N="1409" /> appear to qualify for support in this instance.  If this is allowed to happen it will be catasrophic.</P>
    <P>The current year, poor though it may have been in terms of earnings, is now part of history and already commitments for both next year and 1994 are being made.  The Government's approach towards the tourism industry needs to be examined in the light of its potential for expansion and future growth and this should be done irrespective of the events which now force us to look at the industry in the light of sterling's collapse.  The United Kingdom forms a significant sector of the incoming tourist market and anything which would adversely affect the spending power of the visitor while in Ireland must be examined and analysed in great detail.  Experience has taught us that the tourism market in general is an unstable one at the best of times and subject to many external influences. Because of this it is imperative that we adopt an overall integrated approach to every aspect of this trade.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to comment on the criterion for eligibility for assistance under the fund by which the net trading balance of the applicant company, that is the balance between export sales with the United Kingdom and imports into Ireland, must exceed 35 per cent of total sales.  If the figures released by the Confederation of Irish Industry recently are to be believed there must be a great number of applicant companies which will fail to qualify under this heading, irrespective of how they fare in either of the other two categories.  The CII figures show that the export-import ratio for the 12 months ending in June last was 123.5 per cent; in other words, we exported 23.5 per cent more than we imported.  Taking this as an average figure we must query the reason a minimum of 35 per cent net trading balance was set as a qualifying criterion when the average for the country as a whole is only slightly more than half that figure.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister state the reason the figure of 35 per cent was chosen as the lower limit for qualification in category A and what percentage of all companies <Col N="1410" /> applying for assistance does she expect to quality in this category?  The Minister might also explain how the criteria of 60 per cent and 35 per cent net trading balances for categories B and C respectively were decided upon.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any explanation in the guidelines document, another point needs to be clarified.  The market development fund proposed to provide assistance in the form of a grant which will not exceed the equivalent of £50 per week per eligible employee for a maximum period of six months.  One of the criteria for eligibility is that total labour costs must be at least 15 per cent of sales.  Can the Minister say whether she considers that this might in fact be a penalty against a company with high sterling earnings in a less labour-intensive environment?</P>
    <P>In the overall context of this proposed fund, there is a strange irony which could only be conceived and instituted by the Government and that is that we are now being asked to fund a rescue package by the Government to help businesses in trouble because of the lack of action, even apathy, on the part of the same Government.</P>
    <P>One may pose the question how serious is the problem?  In recent days I have sought the comments of companies in my own constituency of Tipperary North and the mid-West region.  A company with over 200 employees has said:</P>
    <P>Quite bluntly, we will not survive if the present exchange rate between the punt and sterling continues.  We sell 90 per cent of our output to the UK with a margin of 5 per cent to 8 per cent which is being completely eroded by the currency differences.</P>
    <P>Another company with a workforce of more than 200 has said that the present impositions on the company's profitability due to the currency problem are unsustainable and threaten the short to medium-term viability of the company if drastic corrective measures are not taken.</P>
    <P>I have determined from a number of companies in the region that they see <Col N="1411" /> the Government's role as carrying out a realignment of the punt with sterling either inside or outside the ERM or, failing that, taking up the full extent of the exchange loss suffered by companies trading with the UK using the mid point of the band that sterling and the punt could float relative to each other within the ERM as the base.  A further alternative suggested by the companies I surveyed was the provision of a cash support system for the exploration of new markets outside the sterling area.  A fourth alternative suggested was a short term reduction in employers' PRSI or the abolition of PRSI in manufacturing industry as recently proposed by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>These might seem drastic solutions and so they are, but we have a drastic situation. The people at the cutting edge of industry and business recognise the need for courageous and decisive action.  It is highly significant that none of the companies came up with a suggested solution similar to that now being proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Irish companies in the region to which I refer and which are affected by the currency crisis constitute 75 per cent of total employment in indigenous industry in the region and, consequently, their views must be taken seriously.  There can hardly be a more valid viewpoint than that of the people who are most directly affected by the crisis.  The enormous difficulties created in this situation may well prove in many cases to be the financial straws which finally broke the camel's back.</P>
    <P>Who can deny that the costs associated with the plethora of legislation in recent years have been an intolerable burden on a great many companies and businesses? We have had legislation relating to environmental protection, health and safety in the workplace, product viability, fire and chemical control, company and private taxation and many other orders and regulations all of which are eminently desirable but which place an almost intolerable burden on many companies, not merely in financial terms but also in terms of the amount of personnel hours consumed <Col N="1412" /> in the bureaucratic paperwork involved.</P>
    <P>What has happened in effect is that a large segment of the work of the Civil Service has been transferred to the hands of private industry.  Whatever about the ethos of this, the next effect is the creation of enormous difficulties for companies, in particular new companies and businesses.  The first basic principle in relation to industry now appears to be &ldquo;thou shalt not do this until you have completed the paperwork&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The increasing complexity of running a business and complying with all the requirements is often a deterrent to small companies starting up and I feel not enough attention is being focused on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1992, contains 268 pages and is a minefield in regard to interpretation for the average person.  An increasing layer of stumbling blocks is being placed in the path of most businesses, instead of encouraging people to find their own place in the framework of Irish industry.  Indeed, a major criticism of this fund is that it represents merely the introduction of yet another layer of bureaucracy.  The Government should carry out a major study of possible ways in which a more favourable climate for start-up industries and businesses could be created.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to ask the Minister what sectors of Irish business life are covered by the fund.  What exactly is meant by manufacturing companies, and does the Minister see the services sector as part of this?  What strategy has she developed or is she developing, in relation to the tourism sector, which will be especially hard hit by the currency crisis.  Finally, will the Minister outline the basis on which the criteria for eligibility were established and the percentage of the companies applying for assistance she expects to qualify?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to join other speakers in welcoming the introduction of this new market development fund.  It is envisaged that £50 million will be available over the next six months <Col N="1413" /> to assist many of our industries which have been affected by the recent currency crisis.  This debate gives us an opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, with special responsibility for Trade and Marketing, Deputy O'Rourke, for her involvement in the establishment of this fund and her obvious personal commitment to its introduction.  Having regard to the industrial base we have established through sheer hard work over a number of years, it is regrettable that companies could be so savagely exposed because of events in financial markets which are largely outside the control of our people in the Department of Finance.  Effectively, they are being put out of business overnight. I welcome the fact that decisive action has been proposed and will be taken to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see the use of the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; at various points in the Minister's speech in regard to the operation of the scheme.  I am sure it is not possible to accurately gauge at present the different sectors that will be directly affected. Certain industries come to mind but, inevitably and invariably, there will be industries which will not spring to mind immediately.  For that reason alone, it is important that the management committee adopt the most flexible approach possible towards the implementation of the fund.  Naturally, there will be the guidance of the eligibility criteria but, in all companies there will be a varying degree of impact depending on the financial structure, the number of employees and the percentage of exports to the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the option of devaluation, and the obvious implications for our economy if we went down that road are clearly set out in her speech. The cost of servicing the national debt would increase by £1 billion per year. Over the past four or five years we have made considerable progress in regard to our borrowing requirement and the national debt problem.  At the same time we have made significant moves in the direction of tax reform and tax reduction. <Col N="1414" /> However, devaluation would be a major setback to the financial position of our economy.  A total of £8.9 million of our national debt is denominated in currencies other than sterling.  There would be real implications in those areas if we opted for devaluation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that our dependence on the UK market in regard to exports has been reduced from 61 per cent in 1972 to 32 per cent in 1991.  If we want a clear vindication of our original decision to enter the European Community, it is evident from those figures. This clearly underlines the progress we have made in the area of market diversification. It is also a tribute to companies who have foraged for new markets and to the State agency who have been to the forefront in helping to forage for those new markets.  We wish them well in their continued endeavours in those areas.</P>
    <P>I note that in 1991, 43 per cent of our net output in regard to indigenous industries went to the United Kingdom, and this is one of the obvious areas in which we are seriously exposed.  Many of the industries involved have grown up in recent years through sheer hard work and commitment.  In such circumstances, one inevitably looks to examples in their own area.  The mushroom industry in Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth has grown enormously over the last ten years. I do not wish to advocate that there should be an MCA provision for the mushroom industry because, while there might be a benefit in the short term, there could well be a downside to that arrangement because it could level the playing field, as it were, for others in the UK market.  That industry depends to a large extent on the fresh mushroom market in Great Britain to where we export approximately 16 per cent of our produce.  That is significant market penetration by any standards and that achievement over the past ten years is a great tribute to one, two or, perhaps, three pioneers who have adopted a foraging marketing approach to the selling of their produce, with an ensuing benefit to those in the primary production and supply sectors of that industry.  I am sure <Col N="1415" /> this is one area in which the Minister can anticipate applications for financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Any currency fluctuation or variation tends to affect my constituency of Louth in different ways.  In the mid-eighties, Dundalk, which is the largest provincial town in Ireland, was virtually for sale because of the seepage and slippage of trade north of the Border due to the price differential that existed at that time. There is no doubt that with the changing financial situation of recent weeks shoppers will be attracted across the Border. In the eight or nine-week lead-up to Christmas there will be an intensification of shopping and our loss will be all the greater.  Obviously, there is no ready-made solution to the problem, but it is right and proper that the social problems people in trade and businesses in towns such as Dundalk, are experiencing is underlined in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Regardless of whether it is trade and commerce or industry, it is important to be able to accurately predict the position for the future, and in making investments, to be able to plan with a reasonable degree of certainly.</P>
    <P>There are obvious difficulties for people running businesses which will be affected by the fall-off in trade.  In recent times we were delighted at the tremendous surge of industrial development in the town.  This has created a mood of optimism and has given renewed hope for the future.  Naturally it will take some time for the impact of those industries to be realised but we are glad that the rate of recruitment in many of them is being accelerated.  In a year or two the number of people on the unemployment register in County Louth will be considerably reduced as a result.  In every town and every area the pattern is similar and those in business and commerce are benefiting. I hope this trend will not change as a result of the currency difficulties.</P>
    <P>The recent currency crisis underlined the strength of our economy, as evidenced by the fact that we were able to withstand the turbulence in financial markets.  I am sure it will take some time <Col N="1416" /> for the analysts to identify the real cause of the problem but I hope they can bring forward the necessary recommendations to deal with it both in the short and the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Opposition Deputies feel it incumbent on them to nitpick on many issues.  A precedent was set by Deputy Charles Haughey of opposing everything, including the Anglo-Irish Agreement, when Deputy Garret Fitz-Gerald was Taoiseach.  However, that is not my style.  I unreservedly congratulate the Government and the Minister for their initiative in reacting so positively to industry.  That is a matter that should be above politics.  The swiftness with which the Government have reacted to the crisis should be acknowledged by every party, and I do so unreservedly.</P>
      <P>While there is a national crisis, I have to view it from a parochial perspective. We have witnessed a crisis on a smaller scale for the last 23 years, without any recognition of the difficulties by the Government of the day, including my own party.  Perhaps this was the core of my difficulty with my party in the early years when I was a Dáil Member.  The suddenness of the collapse of sterling was something that no Irish Government of any persuasion could have anticipated. The uncertainty of many of the economies of Europe at present is of great concern to all countries in the European Community.  For that reason we should promote, as far as possible, the idea of a European central bank to prevent distortion of the various money markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In providing the money, which is very commendable, I do not believe that at the end of the day the whole £50 million will be expended because it is restricted to firms in the 10 per cent corporate tax bracket who have no insurance cover.  If we cannot harmonise tax and excise duties on both sides of the Border, which has been a particular difficulty for many retailers and manufacturing firms in the Border regions in the last few years, this provision, albeit on a smaller scale, should be a permanent feature of economic life in those areas.  I am sure there <Col N="1417" /> is not a Deputy in this House who would not acknowledge that the Border region has for the last 23 years been an economic wasteland, resulting in the depopulation of towns of Dundalk and Drogheda.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a mini-plan in position. Dundalk is the first town to feel the impact of the present crisis.  Many of the industries that have survived in the Border regions depend exclusively on exports to England.  When this crisis has subsided the Minister should consider the need to stimulate and help hard-pressed businesses in the Border areas.  Some kind of rescue operation should be undertaken for retail traders who employ a significant number of people.  With the weakness in sterling and the approach of Christmas a veritable avalanche of people will descend on the North to buy the variety of attractive goods that will be on offer there.  In recent years in Dundalk we have seen a haemorrhage of funds to the North of Ireland.  As Deputy Kirk has said &mdash; and I accept this &mdash; that trend has slowed down in the last year.  The economic life of Dundalk in particular has improved as a result of the narrowing of the differential between the punt and sterling. However, this sudden crisis will result in further difficulties for those traders who have managed to survive &mdash; many have not survived &mdash; in the Dundalk region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other Members of the House I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister &mdash; the role of the Minister of State in this matter is also welcomed.  They have the full support of the House.  We are all aware that some sectors have been hit worse than others, mainly those involved with the sterling link such as the food processing and clothing industries.  These industries have been hit directly but other industries will be hit just as hard in the not too distant future.  The tourism industry will be hit next year if the present rate of exchange continues.  That is a matter that will have to be considered down the road in terms of assisting that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be made quite clear that this provision is not a free lunch for people in the export business.  The money is being <Col N="1418" /> given to tide them over a bad patch and they should not look forward to it as an annual bonus on top of their ordinary income.  I refer particularly to the mushroom industry, an industry that has been hit very hard because its market is totally concentrated on the UK.  While this money may help tide them over the short term problems, the industry will have to concentrate on new advances in technology, market development, market-driven processing and more streamlined costs.  The industry must look at these matters.</P>
    <P>Many of the companies involved in the clothing industry &mdash; there is one in my home town &mdash; will be very badly hit by the exchange rates because of the fact that their business is 95 per cent concentrated on UK multiples who buy and agree prices in advance.  This sector is badly hit because of its density of employment; its major cost is labour, and I hope it will receive sympathetic consideration from An Bord Tráchtála.  Deputy McGahon also referred to this point.  The Government acted before people realised what was happening, they appreciated the problems and stepped in to bridge the gap but, in doing so, they are not giving a firm commitment to those people.  We are trying to help people to develop other markets and the one lesson which can be learned from this crisis is that industry should not place all its eggs in one basket.  They should try to ensure that the income from their sales is spread in hard currency.  They must take that sort of initiative and I hope that the moneys provided by this scheme &mdash; or at least a major proportion of them &mdash; will be put into developing new markets in the hard currency area.</P>
    <P>We must now look to continental Europe instead of the UK.  There has been very satisfactory trading with the UK over the years, mainly because they are our next door neighbour; transport costs to the UK are much less than supplying continental firms.  Because of the strength of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Irish pound for the past number of years it has been seen as a place where if you only had the sterling difference as your margin <Col N="1419" /> of profit, profits were satisfactory, especially if you bought in volume. However, the deficit is now 15 per cent in relation to many of those industries, they have lost the sterling exchange rate profit and their imports, prior to manufacture, have also increased.  They are finding the going very tough.</P>
    <P>The food industry should learn one very sharp message from this &mdash; they should go to mainland Europe where there are better prices as long as you provide a superior product.  The co-operatives who concentrated on mainland Europe will weather the storm better than those who concentrated on the UK market.  That short term strategy is coming back to haunt them.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of timber processing industries who have recently been selling to the UK.  It was a very tight market in which they sold when the exchange rate was much better.  They have now been caught because they were not in a position to hedge in regard to forward selling of their sterling income. That was because the British building industry is in such chaos at present that importers to the UK were not prepared to give long term contracts; it was done on a once-off basis and every load was sold on the basis of the last one having been sold by the retailers in the UK.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made recently that Coillte would be a beneficiary of part of the funding which might go to these processors.  I hope they will not benefit because it is not fair that a State guaranteed organisation should look for money from this fund which is available to help front line leaders in the marketplace in regard to selling products.  I am not referring to selling raw products, I am talking about processed goods and I hope the Minister will examine that matter.  In this scheme the progress which can be made in regard to developing new markets should be taken as the criteria in relation to any further grants which might be made to industrialists.  If a certain percentage has not been put into developing further markets there should be a small penalty clause.  Of course it <Col N="1420" /> should not be a big penalty because that could mean the difference between staying in business and going to the wall.  The labour intensive industries should now move out of their traditional markets and into mainland Europe where there is a market for our superior products, which we can supply, and on which we should concentrate in future.</P>
    <P>The hard lesson has been learned and many people will feel the effects of the sterling crisis, particularly in regard to interest rates on their mortgages, and job prospects.  Many people face short term redundancy but, if that is the case, their employers should be asked to concentrate on developing new markets in mainland Europe.  Anybody in industry here at present who has more than 50 per cent of their business in the UK &mdash; or in any single market &mdash; is at risk.</P>
    <P>Once again I compliment the Minister of State for the action she has taken in leading this programme.  The fund will do an enormous amount of good in helping people to develop new markets, to help to concentrate on maintaining employment and to keep people in jobs.  If we are serious about long term development and creating jobs, we must be prepared to help people in this crisis.  The moneys from this scheme could be the difference between someone being able to stay in business or closing down.  Everyone is well aware that it is far better to pay somebody to work than to give them social welfare to sit at home, which would have happened if the Government had not taken action in regard to this matter. I hope the Minister's Department will concentrate on people who have become dependent on the UK market to seek wider markets in mainland Europe.  We are all good Europeans and we should exploit these markets fully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the establishment of this fund which is a Government recognition of the problem facing many companies, particularly those who had a high dependency on the UK market.  However, I share the reservations which have already been expressed.  I would like to think that the <Col N="1421" /> Minister will take them on board in a constructive manner and consider them in an analysis of the scheme.  Many of the regulations will exclude a number of companies, particularly small businesses, which perhaps do not have the required percentage of exports to the UK but for whom continuing access on a profitable basis to the UK market will be significant in determining whether the company will survive.</P>
      <P>There must be an inbuilt flexibility which is not in evidence on the application form.  The Minister must ensure that no firm will be excluded from benefit because they do not have access to the required percentage.  The ultimate deciding factor in the Government's determination of whether a company should have access to this facility is the cost to the Exchequer of maintaining a number of people in employment by providing access to the scheme, as opposed to the cost of paying those people unemployment assistance or benefit.  Unemployment is surely the single biggest crisis facing this country and it would be pointless to have the IDA and other State agencies doing everything possible to create new jobs without placing a similar emphasis on job preservation.  It would be wrong for this scheme, which is essentially about job preservation, to turn its back on certain firms because they do not meet certain criteria laid down for qualification for the scheme.</P>
      <P>A simple analysis of the currency crisis would be that firms exporting to the UK have had their margins completely wiped out.  There is a possibility that markets in this country which are supplied by Irish industry will be undermined by exports from the UK in particular.  Another possibility is that other markets outside Ireland and the UK will be undermined by cheap exports from the UK.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have referred to specific industries about which they are concerned.  The previous speaker mentioned the food and clothing sectors.  In the time I have available to me I should like to dwell briefly on the problems facing the timber industry, particularly as a result of the currency crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> The timber industry is a rural employer and I am sure that the Minister is familiar in her own constituency with the problems confronting the industry at present. Approximately 1,000 people are employed directly in sawmills throughout the country and about 12,000 people employed indirectly in nurseries and in the provision of other ancillary services to the sawmilling industry.  That is an enormous amount of rural employment, which, if undermined by the present currency crisis in hard-won markets secured by the timber industry, particularly in the UK, will be lost and gone forever.  It is essential that access to the new scheme be given to the timber industry regardless of the criteria that has been laid down. That access must be available in order to ensure that the industry is able to hold on to hard-won UK markets.</P>
    <P>By nature, the timber industry is a high-volume, low-margin industry.  It has high fixed overheads.  The 3 per cent increase in interest rates will have a significant impact on the continuing viability of many of our sawmills.  Serious structural problems in the timber industry are being overcome in a planned manner by the Irish Timber Council.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the plans of the council in that direction.</P>
    <P>Unless many companies involved in the timber industry are able to gain access to the new fund the present currency crisis will make many of them no longer viable.  It is because many of the industries to which I refer will not meet the required criteria that I plead with the Minister to make sure that flexibility is built into the system.  Without Government backing many of those industries will have to close.</P>
    <P>One problem faced by the timber industry is the Coillte monopoly on the sale of logs in this country.  Because it has been proven that the price of logs in Ireland is significantly higher than the price paid by manufacturers in other countries I appeal to the Minister to intervene directly with Coillte, even for the present period of difficulty, to ensure that Coillte give consideration to the crisis facing the timber industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> It is essential that our timber industry be able to hold on to hard-won export markets which are now being undermined. I make a particular appeal for the timber industry, which, I know, is a significant employer in the Minister's own constituency.  I ask that the Minister pay special attention to that industry.</P>

      <P>I should first like to congratulate the Minister and the Government for so rapidly bringing forward this scheme in an effort to help exporters who have been hit by the currency crisis.  I was particularly impressed to hear that the scheme would be flexible and would not be tied up or delayed by red tape and bureaucracy.  I have discussed the matter with several exporters and I am now very much afraid that some people who are in serious trouble may be disqualified from eligibility to this scheme by rules and regulations.  I shall use two firms as examples to illustrate my fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of the two firms, which I shall call firm A, employ about 80 people in the manufacture of children's clothes for export, mostly to the United Kingdom. Orders from the United Kingdom come primarily from large chain stores.  Firm A also sell to Irish customers such as Dunnes Stores.  The list of conditions quotes percentages of not less than 60 per cent in one part and not less than 35 per cent in the other part.  On first examination, firm A qualifies with more then 80 per cent in the former category. However, they are a couple of points short when it comes to the latter figure, notwithstanding the fact that the currency crisis poses very severe problems. The main Irish customer of firm A, Dunnes Stores &mdash; who, incidentally, showed marked preference for Irish goods, unlike some of their competitors &mdash; are now able to buy goods more <Col N="1424" /> cheaply from the UK and have consequently demanded discount to take into account the cheaper cost of imported raw materials.  Firm A have already been hindered from expanding a potentially lucrative export market by a lack of finance from the banks and other institutions and have had no encouragement whatever from the IDA and other State bodies. The fact that the firm deal mostly with chain stores and consequently have a very tight profit margin means that they are now seriously at risk.  Surely under such circumstances we cannot insist on an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; approach so far as percentages are concerned, especially in relation to marginal differences.</P>
    <P>The second of two firms, firm B, is involved in the food manufacturing industry.  This Donegal company employ 150 people and export their products to more than 60 countries.  Firm B failed to meet the criteria set out in the second category in so far as the combined total of their home and UK sales, less UK imports, is only about 57 per cent of their total sales.  However, if their worldwide sterling sales are added, as was encouraged by the Government, the percentage would increase to more than 70 per cent. The Government encouraged firms to seek markets outside of the UK, which firm B have done.  The company are facing the same competition from UK manufacturers in those markets as they are in Ireland and the UK, and now estimate that at least 30 per cent of their total business is at risk.  Without immediate help, which can be provided if a degree of flexibility is shown in the implementation of the new scheme, the livelihood of those concerned will be at risk within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to be flexible in the criteria laid down for the new scheme.  I would be prepared to bring representatives of companies such as the two I have mentioned to meet the Minister if such action was required.  Donegal has a bad enough employment situation as it is without even more jobs being put at risk.  The two firms I have spoken about today are firms that are rooted firmly in the community; they are not fly-by-night <Col N="1425" /> multinational companies whose fortunes are dictated by a board in Pittsburgh, San Francisco or elsewhere.  The future of those two firms will be decided by this Government, in Dublin.  I appeal for a flexible approach in the implementation of the fund.</P>

      <P>I join a procession of speakers who have, understandably and deservedly, expressed thanks and praise to the Minister present, Deputy O'Rourke, and I would be happy to anticipate that such compliments, coming from all sides, will not fall too heavily on her delicate ears.</P>
      <P>This is a most welcome scheme, which demonstrates the Minister's sensitivity and sense of responsibility in respect of the plight that has fallen on industry and on the people who work therein.  Naturally one is given to making a case on what one knows, and here, I would hope that in my constituency where, unfortunately, there is a very high incidence of unemployment, the spirit of the scheme rather than the letter should be applied, and that when all of us plead on that basis to the Minister she will apply the same sympathy and sensitivity to our requests as she has done in respect of the global action which has been referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask my colleagues from all sides of the House to step a little further back from our utterances and pleadings for the industrialists in our constituencies and examine the unfortunate <i>raison d'etre</i> of the action that has been taken and to look at the root cause of it.  For many <Col N="1426" /> years most people here, particularly myself, would have been very critical of a political ethos and idealism which was described as socialism in excess.  We all know that excesses in anything are always unattractive, unwelcome and prejudicial to the legitimate interests of other people.  Thankfully we saw an end to what was described as communism and extreme socialism.  People from all over the world, including Ireland, rejoiced because we had evidence that in the pursuit of that ethos there were grave injustices. We should look at what has replaced it &mdash; capitalism and the power that comes with money and finances. What we are discussing here and what we should be treating with much more consideration are the excesses of capitalism and how that has interfered with the lives of every person in our country, directly or indirectly, and whether we should challenge the right of people who describe themselves as financiers to play around with money which is, in essence, the lives, the fortunes and the health of everthing affecting the human being and whether we should be crying &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is it fair or just that any one person in the exercise of what he regards as his freedom should engage in an operation which allows them to trade in the fortunes of people and provide for themselves a licence to indulge in a lifestyle that is obnoxious and an affront to the rest of humanity.  That is the most urgent problem we have today.</P>
    <P>It appals me when I see on the television screen the representatives of these people full of excitement, giving the impression that what they are doing is vital to humanity when, in essence, it is vital to a small corps of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Tunney on his contribution.  He could not have made a better case against the unacceptable face of capitalism.  I would like to put it on the record of the House that I agree with every word he has said. I am very pleased also to associate myself with the remarks made by Deputy McDaid regarding the need to safeguard employment in our indigenous industry. His remarks about multinationals being fly-by-nights is well merited and a matter to which I intend to refer.</P>
      <P>I should say the Green Party support this emergency aid provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.  I am sure all Deputies will try to rally around to minimise the serious job losses we are facing. However, we should not have allowed ourselves to get into this position in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments, to which all the major parties in this House have, at one time or another, been part, to systematically dismantle our indigenous industry which was carefully and painstakingly built up by Fianna Fáil in the thirties.  Our textiles, footwear, tanning, paper and board industries have all virtually disappeared I sometimes think we suffer from delusions of grandeur.  We are a very small country in terms of population and natural resources.  We are a very small player in the world economic stage.  The going will always be tough and the road will always be hard irrespective of what economic policies we pursue.  However, I maintain we have taken the wrong road in the way our industry has been structured. Obviously total self-sufficiency is impractical for a country such as ours but that does not mean we should not try for a reasonable level of self-sufficiency. Obviously we do not want to produce goods, particularly food, which are unsuited to our climate.  We will always require substantial imports of a wide <Col N="1428" /> range of goods which clearly must be paid for by exports.  Therefore, some of our industrial effort must go into exports.</P>
    <P>We have become much too dependent on industrial exports.  What makes the situation even more unstable is the fact that most of our export industries are owned by multinationals.  Surely it is time to realise how volatile these companies are.  They come and go on what appears to be a whim leaving economic and social devastation in their wake.  When will we have the courage to shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;?  When will we make an effort to redevelop our indigenous industry?  I had great hope following the change of leadership in Fianna Fáil that we would see a change in policy.  I would remind the House that it is less than a year since the Taoiseach &mdash; then languishing on the back benches &mdash; stated very clearly that we needed such a change.  In a speech made before Ogra Fianna Fáil in Limerick last October, the present Taoiseach stated: &ldquo;Creating a native industry base takes longer, is slower and perhaps is not as glamorous as announcing an American firm with 1,000 jobs but it is the only way in the end&rdquo;.  We in the Green Party have been saying this for years but no one listens. Perhaps this time the Minister will listen and take some action.</P>
    <P>A modest improvement in our industrial situation could be achieved by adopting the main provisions of the Culliton report regarding the reorganisation of the IDA.  Unfortunately, the Government appear to be split on this issue and have vacillated for far too long.  The fact is that the policies of the IDA have been an unmitigated disaster for this country. They have absorbed a huge amount of public money but there has been no resultant increase in net employment.  If the Government are unwilling or unable to change the way in which the IDA work, they should close them down. Some of the money could be used to set up a different type of authority to finance, preferably by way of interest free loans rather than grants, small family businesses and workers' co-operatives.  The story everywhere in the world is that jobs <Col N="1429" /> can be created much more easily and at much less cost in small industries than in the large capital intensive multinational industries which we in this country not only tolerate but encourage.  This policy must cease; it is economic madness.</P>
    <P>The IDA's brief from successive Governments to attract foreign industry has cost the taxpayer in excess of £500,000 per job.  The cost of the IDA from 1980-90 was £1.6 billion.  Surely this is a damning indictment of the failure of our industrial policy during the eighties and thus far into the nineties?  It should also be realised that much of the relative prosperity in Ireland and in countries throughout the developed world is based on the profligate exploitation of the world's raw materials and a gross waste of energy generated from fossil fuels. Clearly our limited prosperity is not soundly based and is unsustainable. Unless we mend our ways, the fallout when the oil and coal stocks run out will be horrendous.  Let there be no doubt about it that it is not a case of if but a case of when.  If we in this country and people in other developed countries were to make a fresh start to discourage the over-consumption of consumer goods by simplifying our lifestyles, carrying out a crash research programme into the development of renewable energy and discouraging unnecessary world trade, we would make the transition that much easier.</P>
    <P>Another matter which impinges on the success of our industrial and agricultural sectors is the banking industry.  So much still depends on the support &mdash; or lack of support, as the case may be &mdash; of the banking system.  Apart from the very high interest rates now being charged here there is also sufficient evidence to indicate that the banks are operating a major credit squeeze on small businesses.  As I said earlier, these are the businesses on which the economy will become increasingly dependent to provide jobs.  The Government have now exacerbated the situation by their proposal to privatise the ACC Bank.  It is essential at a time of near national emergency that the banking system be used for quasi-social purposes <Col N="1430" /> to assist genuine viable industries which have temporary cash flow problems.  It makes no sense at all for small industries, some employing five, ten or 15 people, to be closed down by the banks for the sake of a few thousand pounds when at the same time the Government are dishing out millions of pounds to foreign multinationals.  By allowing this privatisation, the Government are restricting their manoeuvrability in this area and will clearly be unable to help these small firms.  However unpalatable ideas might appear at first sight, I appeal to the Minister to at least show the courtesy of giving them some thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>When a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce is brought before the House everyone is anxious to make a contribution on how jobs can be created, how our unemployment crisis can be solved and what action the Government and the various State agencies should take.  A recent issue of <i>Business and Finance</i> carried a headline which read: &ldquo;300,000 coping with the unemployment Crisis&rdquo;.  In the short time available to me I should like to make some points based on the experience so far of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This committee have concluded their first report.  Having consulted with the IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Finance, local authorities, the banks and a wide range of other interests the committee came to some immediate conclusions and also decided that further study was needed.  They concluded that there was a very severe shortage of equity for job creation in small industries, to which Deputy Garland has also referred, and that there was potential in that sector. They discovered that the IDA had effectively moved out of this sector and that FÁS had no role to play in this area.  It became obvious very quickly that there was a major gap in terms of supporting small companies.  I compliment the Taoiseach and the relevant Ministers on their quick reaction to the equity for jobs fund recommended by the committee.  This <Col N="1431" /> is a positive and practical step forward which I hope will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The county development teams will need some very decisive hands-on political management if they are not to be caught up in bureaucracy, red tape, more committees, more reports and more documents.  All Members of this House will have to ensure that the committees which are set up in their areas are managed by decisive people and that they are given a positive role.  A stop will have to be put to such pigeon-hole mentality as &ldquo;This is my patch, I make the decisions here&rdquo;, regardless of whether we are talking of county managers, FÁS area managers, county development teams, etc. These people who are in State employment need to recognise that positive action must be taken to help those who are not in such secure employment.  Up to now it has not been a hallmark of our capacity to be decisive and to take urgent action.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the Culliton Report, the Telesis Report, reports on the food sector, reports on rationalisation and the other major reports which have been published during the past 20 years one cannot help but feel that there is no real commitment in the Department of Industry and Commerce to reframing industrial policy for the nineties.  I am not being negatively critical just because the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not a party colleague of mine.  I hope what I am saying will be regarded as constructive criticism on the lack of cohesive action in the area of industrial policy.  This action has not been forthcoming from the Department.  There is a great need for the Department of Industry and Commerce to become the engine of our economic policy.  This was strongly recommended in the Culliton report.  It is taking far too long to implement this recommendation.  I do not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a real commitment to tackling the jobs crisis; his eye is off the ball and he is looking in too many other directions, for example, he is trying to lead his small <Col N="1432" /> political party.  His excessive private enterprise philosophy has meant that priority has not been given to the jobs crisis.  I solemnly believe that not enough decisive action is being taken in the Department of Industry and Commerce to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>When the Secretary of the Department of Finance came before the Committee on Employment it was obvious that that Department were pursuing a hands-on type of fiscal management strategy.  That Department are presently preparing the national plan, which will be submitted to Brussels, for Cohesive and Structural Funding.  The Department were examining the overall job creation position from an abstract point of view.  The only driving engine of economic growth and development, through industrial policy, must emanate from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or be switched to a Minister for employment or job creation.  At present there does not appear to be such a positive, decisive approach to job creation.  We can all tinker at the edges, can recommend various changes <i>vis-à-vis</i> small enterprise committees and so on.  I know the Minister of State present has been doing tremendous work to help exporters, promoting trade, endeavouring to relieve our manufacturers' difficulties because of the unacceptable currency fluctuations to which Deputy Tunney correctly referred. Nobody would condone the excesses of the capitalist system, leading to paper movement of money, mergers, takeovers and so on, leading to further unemployment.</P>
    <P>The bitter rewards of the Thatcher era in the United Kingdom have left their economy and its productive potential in a very sad state.  We must guard against that happening here, working towards a more cohesive industrial policy with hands on involvement.  It is no longer acceptable that the major Government thrust of hands on job creation support is left to the manufacturing sector, through the Industrial Development Authority, driven by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That will not in any way meet our requirements in the nineties.  For <Col N="1433" /> example, within the overall figure of approximately 300,000 people unemployed there are seven or eight different categories.  There are those who could find employment in the services or support sectors, there are people who will find employment in the manufacturing sector but there is a need to pull together all those sectors.</P>
    <P>As was recommended in the Telesis Report, we should concentrate on indigenous industry.  Having accepted their recommendation we must ask, what have we done about it?  In my opinion &mdash; damn little because, regrettably, that is where there is long term job creation potential.</P>
    <P>There is need for expansion of industrial policy.  Senior officials in the Industrial Development Authority tell us many job opportunities have been presented to them which, because of their mandate, they cannot even consider or report on, that they do not fall within their narrow mandate of supporting job creation.  That is a major flaw of industrial policy.  There is great need for co-ordination between the tourism and industrial sectors.  Senior officials of the Industrial Development Authority tell us that the leisure-related industry is an adjunct of large industrial organisations worldwide.  They tell us when they endeavour to attract such organisations here to create manufacturing employment they are told there are leisure-related investment possibilities, which is not their brief, but rather that of Bord Fáilte.  That is another example of a bureaucratic, red tape deterrent.  They contend there is no cohesive framework within which one Government Department can assume responsibility for, let us say, reducing the figure of 300,000 unemployed by even 100,000 over a five-year period.</P>
    <P>In other sectors, such as within local authorities, job creation will have to be addressed by means of a different industrial philosophy.  We will not be able to look back on the first half of the nineties with any satisfaction if there is not brought about a major change in attitude to job creation involving two separate Government Departments.  It is no <Col N="1434" /> coincidence that the other Minister in the energy field is responsible for the lifeblood of our economy, the largest single cost factor being power supply, fuel distribution and so on.  From those two economic Ministries no cohesive industrial policy has emerged.  We have failed in that respect.  Therefore, there is need for urgent action to be taken by those two Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to share my time with Deputy Cotter.  Like other Members I should like to congratulate the Minister of State on having introduced these measures to alleviate some of the burden on many of our exporting firms which, if not done, would have led to further job losses we can ill afford at present.</P>
      <P>It would be my hope &mdash; this matter was raised by Deputy McDaid &mdash; that the relevant moneys will be paid because such assistance is needed and is the minimum required for the purpose.  I hope bureaucracy will not slow down such payments so that they would not prove to be the benefit we would all hope.  After all such assistance should be of direct benefit to applicants and, ultimately, prevent possible additional unemployment.</P>
      <P>I contend that, as long as there is a multiplicity of European currencies, there will continue to be a repetition of the kinds of problems at present being experienced.  There is no point in any country, for parochial or other domestic reasons, striving to retain their pride and prestige through ties to a particular currency when it is obvious to everybody worldwide that the future of each European currency best lies in a single European currency unit.  If they do not recognise that fact now there is no point in their talking about it further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer briefly also to that group of people who have built around themselves a mystique, that group of speculators worldwide who zone in on particular currencies at given times on the basis of the fluctuations they observe in the marketplace and avail of that opportunity to make very sizeable gains. There is no mystique about such people; <Col N="1435" /> they are just ordinary people taking chances with other people's money for which other people pay the price.  The only common denominator is that they are average, somewhat greedier than most, but average people apart from that. The only way to combat such speculation is by a single European currency.</P>
    <P>The mobile multinationals have affected us here in the past and no doubt will do so in the future.  At present they employ approximately 100,000 people here.  Therefore, we cannot afford to lose them.  However, those who leave to improve their prospects and relocate in areas where labour costs are much cheaper should not have immediate access to the market place they have recently vacated.  That movement could be regulated simply through the GATT so that whenever a large multinational corporation pulls out of an area and moves to a centre which will be in their best interests in terms of profit-making, they should not expect or be allowed to get back into the marketplace they have vacated and gain all the profits therefrom.</P>
    <P>My last point is in regard to insurance, in particular public liability, costs and their impact on industry, job creation and firms that may be in jeopardy.  Two points arise in respect of this.  The first concerns those who insure against the kind of circumstances at present being experienced with some taking out such insurance cover while others do not because of the high cost of public liability insurance.</P>
    <P>The question I tabled in the past couple of days to the Minister's colleague was not answered satisfactorily.  I do not wish to travel down that road.  However, I do want to make the point that we pay much more dearly here, in terms of public liability and all other insurance costs, than our European counterparts resulting in fewer job opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the measures she is taking.  While welcoming her rapid initiative in alleviating present difficulties which will assist some industries in Cavan and Monaghan it will <Col N="1436" /> not be a panacea.  Having spoken on the telephone to industrialists in my constituency. I must warn the Minister of State that the mushroom industry will collapse despite her initiative.  I have been so informed by people at the very top of that industry.  I do not take any great pleasure in warning the Minister of State, bearing in mind that she has endeavoured to respond to present difficulties. However, her response is not sufficient and will not save that sector. The Minister will have to find some way of assisting mushroom producers who have been subjected to enormous pressure over the past six months.  The industry faces a £4 million loss this year.  I predict that the action the Minister proposes taking will be insufficient to save that sector.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention also to indigenous poultry and egg industries in Monaghan who produce mainly for the home market.  Cheaper products are beginning to filter in from the very strong sector in the North and companies here are being driven out of some of their markets.  They inform me that the problem will be very serious in the next few months and they are making contingency plans to put people on the dole. There are very strong indigenous sectors in Monaghan but many of them are under extreme pressure.  Some of them fall outside the terms of this initiative.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to keep a close watch on what is happening in that area.  I will keep her informed.  I am very proud of the way Monaghan people responded in the early stages of this problem.  They kept bringing to the attention of the Minister and the Government exactly what was happening.  The chambers of commerce were involved and the flow of information was very useful to the Minister and the Government.  I will continue to ensure that the Minister gets the information required.</P>

      <P>The fact that 14 Deputies contributed to this debate is a fair measure of the urgency and importance <Col N="1437" /> with which Deputies regard it.  I thank Deputies for the response from all parties and for the very constructive way in which the market development fund has been welcomed in the House and throughout the country.  All Deputies have signalled their support and by not putting the matter to a vote they are affirming their approval.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan was generally supportive and he was pleased that the forms were easy to read.  He was particularly keen that there should be flexibility.  He asked if firms would be required to repay the money.  The plan is aimed at firms who are in danger of shedding jobs, firms who would be in very grave trouble without this plan.  Deputy Hogan's question does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor also welcomed the scheme but he had reservations about firms making profits.  The scheme is not geared at enabling firms to make profits &mdash; it is geared to help them to stay alive and to maintain employment.  It is not geared towards putting money into pockets but is designed to get people over a very difficult patch while maintaining employment.  Deputy Taylor also spoke about the excessive operation of free market forces.  I share that point of view. He also referred to the undesirability of a two-speed Europe.  None of us in this House wants to see that because it is against all our principles.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa welcomed the scheme and referred to the failure of European monetary policy.  He and Deputy Hogan spoke about the alacrity with which the EC Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, stepped into the debate but we are quietly confident and reassured that Europe will understand the need for this measure.  It is an enhancement of measures already in place in that it is a development fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lowry spoke about the definition of a manufacturing company.  The scheme straddles various types of company. The team working on it have been very clear about that.  Tourism does not come into it.  The Deputy referred to the Finance Act and spoke in detail about the various criteria.  The management <Col N="1438" /> team are sending to each Deputy the criteria and the explanatory material.  It will become quite clear that the fears he expressed are unfounded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk spoke about the needs of his own town, as did Deputy McGahon. This Chamber allows Deputies to bring forward such matters.  Deputies did not specify particular firms.  Deputies Kirk and McGahon come from an area which was very badly hit by particular policies in the mid-fifties.  That problem was tackled in 1987.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis spoke very clearly about the mushroom industry and the clothing industry.  He said this scheme was designed to bridge a gap.  We all hope it will be an interim measure and that there will be an end to the currency turmoil. Deputy Ellis said that help should go to firms which are diversifying into mainland Europe or other markets.  That is precisely what we are doing.  I was glad of his warm encouragement.  An Bord Tráchtála have developed niche marketing in the countries he mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed wants inbuilt flexibility. That flexibility is there.  He talked about the clothing sector and other industries. Deputy De Rossa was worried that the excessive need to be free of bureaucracy might lead to a disregard for proper monitoring and control.  I can assure Deputies that there is very tight evaluation, monitoring and control.  I am satisfied that the management have designed a system which will be quick, responsive and flexible and which will also allow for proper monitoring and evaluation.  This will be very important in terms of our long term industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid talked about two categories of firm.  These firms should scrutinise the criteria more closely.  I would be glad to discuss the matter with the Deputy.  Deputy Tunney was supportive and spoke about the administration of the scheme.  In a splendidly robust performance he said what needed to be said about speculators.  I do not need to add to what he said.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland spoke about the need for self-sufficiency and various other policies which his party put forward.  Of <Col N="1439" /> course I received them with courtesy and listened to them.  There were germs of very good ideas in what Deputy Garland said, when one stripped away the excesses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor stressed the need for a more vibrant approach to job creation and the need for equity finance.  I agree that there is need for a more direct approach to job creation.  At one time it appeared that this would look after itself but that is not the case when we have almost 300,000 people unemployed.  The Department have taken the initiative and have been the engine for the market development fund.  I am proud and pleased that they have done so with the agencies at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I take the point about a more vigorous approach to job creation.  The Fine Gael committee identified areas in which a more vigorous approach to job creation could be taken.  Deputy Durkan spoke about the fluctuations in currencies and the difficulties involved and saw GATT as a vehicle for resolving some of our problems.  Deputies Cotter, Kirk and McGahon referred to the mushroom industry which is eligible for this assistance. The difficulty lies in the outreaches of the mushroom industry.  Consideration is being given to how we can cope with the applications.  I do not share Deputies' pessimism although I know Deputies' comments were well meant.  With help and support I hope these people can be helped through a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their support for these measures.  The Department are very grateful and the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, will be grateful too.  I hope the worst effects will be mitigated by this scheme.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1992. - International Agreement on Navigation System: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher) Pat 'the Cope' Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week this House approved the terms of the <Col N="1440" /> international agreement concerning the establishment and operation of a civil LORAN C navigation system in north-west Europe and the north Athlantic. The approval of Dáil Éireann was required in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am now pleased to have the opportunity to explain to the House in more detail the implications of this important international agreement to our fishing and shipping industries.  In particular, the new navigation system, which will be established and operated in Irish waters as a direct consequence of the agreement, will enhance safety of navigation in Irish waters and will contribute towards the protection of the marine environment from casualties at sea.  These are imperatives for my Department.</P>
      <P>I will now elaborate on the background to this agreement and say a few words about the LORAN C navigation system. LORAN C is a land-based radio-navigation system which uses shore-based radio transmitters to allow users with appropriate receivers to determine their position.  Although primarily a marine system it has potential application on land and in the air.</P>
      <P>Within the LORAN C coverage area a user with an adequate receiver can determine his or her position to within 463 metres &mdash; 0.25 nautical miles &mdash; accuracy or better.  The repeatable accuracy of the system, which permits a user to return to a specified point, ranges from 50 to 400 metres at the 95 per cent confidence level, making the system particularly useful for fishermen.  Because of its long range, the system is attractive for application in remote areas or where the user population is too low to justify the cost of a large number of short range systems.</P>
      <P>A LORAN C chain consists of a master radio transmitting station and two to four slaves.  The chain transmits simultaneously a pulsed radio signal.  The receiver defines its position on the earth by calculating the time interval between reception of signals from master and slaves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>LORAN is an acronym for long range <Col N="1441" /> navigation.  It is the second generation of LORAN type positioning systems which were established in the 1950s to support United States Naval and Defence Department needs for accuracy positioning information throughout the world.  Civilian and commercial use of LORAN C has since become widespread.</P>
    <P>LORAN C is an all-weather accurate radio positioning system consisting of more than 13 chains worldwide.  It is presently available in North America, the Far East, the Mediterranean and Saudi Arabia.  Systems are currently being built in China, India, South America and Russia.  At present, there are two LORAN C chains in operation in north-west Europe.  They are the Icelandic chain and the Norwegian chain.</P>
    <P>The opportunity for Ireland to participate in an extended north-west European LORAN C radio navigation system arose in 1981 when the US Government informed &ldquo;host nations&rdquo;, Denmark, Iceland and Norway of their intention to switch to the satellite based NAVSTAR global positioning system for military use and to cease their funding and manning support of all LORAN C stations outside the US by 1994.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure the availability of an independent alternative system in Europe, Ireland and other North Atlantic countries decided to establish and operate an extended LORAN C system in north-west Europe and the north Atlantic.  The five other countries participating with Ireland in the establishment and operation of the system are Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway.</P>
    <P>The countries party to the international agreement recognised that the satellite-based global positioning system would be used more and more in the future.  It was agreed, however, that it would be unwise to rely on GPS without a land-based back-up system for two reasons.  Firstly, GPS is at present a military system controlled by the US Department of Defence and available only when US national security permits.  Secondly, GPS is subject to interruption.  The shortcomings <Col N="1442" /> of GPS were highlighted during the Gulf War when the US re-sited satellites without warning leading to considerably reduced and interrupted service.  LORAN C and GPS are complementary systems.  In time, manufacturers will be marketing intergrated GPS/LORAN C receivers which will automatically select the most accurate system.</P>
    <P>The north-west European LORAN C system will comprise six existing stations of the Norwegian and French chains, with the addition of two new stations in Norway and one in the west of Ireland. The resulting nine stations will be operated as four chains located at Boe in Norway, Ejde in the Faeroe Islands, Sylt in Germany and Lessay in France.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the LORAN C radio navigation system will be operational in Irish waters from around March 1995. The Irish station, which will be located in County Clare, will be built and operated by the Commissioners of Irish Lights who provide a system of marine aids to navigation around the Irish coast.  The transmitter will be an essential link in the four chains which will make up the north-west European LORAN C navigation system.</P>
    <P>The LORAN C system will improve standards of aids to navigation for shipping, will enhance safety of life at sea, and contribute towards the protection of the marine environment from casualties at sea.  In particular, it will improve position fixing coverage in Irish waters and will be superior to that currently being supplied by the existing short range Decca navigator system in terms of accuracy and repeatability at long range. Adoption of LORAN C will also effect savings in Exchequer funding of a radio navigation system.</P>
    <P>The Government have opted to switch from the Decca navigator system to LORAN C for a number of reasons which I will outline to the House.  LORAN C is technically superior providing better position fixing accuracy.  Decca is a low power system which requires 24 transmitter stations to cover Ireland and the United Kingdom.  LORAN C requires <Col N="1443" /> only one transmitter station to be based in Ireland.  Decca suffers from adverse seasonal and night effects.  Being a low-powered system Decca does not have as great a range as LORAN C. LORAN C coverage in Irish waters will extend beyond that provided by Decca, especially off the south and south-west coasts.  The important fishing ports of Dingle, Castletownbere and Dunmore East are poorly served by Decca at present.  All Irish inshore waters, the Irish and Celtic Seas, and Atlantic waters up to 220 nautical miles off our western shores will be covered by LORAN C signals giving position fixing accuracy of one quarter of a nautical mile, or better, 95 per cent of the time.  This degree of accuracy is the acceptable standard laid down by the International Maritime Organisation which holds global responsibility for safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment. The offshore fisheries identified by BIM as having development potential will be accurately covered by LORAN C.  They are inadequately covered by Decca. LORAN C has wide international acceptance. EC policy, as set out in a recent Council decision, is to encourage member states to &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;support efforts to set up a worldwide radio navigation system including European regional LORAN C chains&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite the eventual advent of GPS new LORAN C chains are being built in US, China, Russia and India.  Carriage is mandatory in US coastal waters.</P>
    <P>LORAN C is a radio navigation system which is easy to use.  When the north-west European chain is complete, accuracies to within one-quarter of a nautical mile will be available to users.  The major advantages are the low cost of receivers and simplicity of use.  At present, the cost of a basic LORAN C receiver is about £500 and as more vessels use the system, receiver set prices will fall.  The primary benefit is, therefore, safety related because as receiver prices drop then there is more and more chance of the part-time inshore fisherman using the system.  This is particularly the case on the western seaboard <Col N="1444" /> of Ireland where the traditionl farmer-fisherman, cautious to spending hard-earned revenue on non-essentials, will be encouraged to install low cost LORAN C receivers because of the major advantages such a set will bring.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly explain to the House how the system will work in practice and its advantages to working seafarers. LORAN C will give the position of a vessel, be it a small lobster potting boat or a very large crude oil carrier, in latitude and longitude.  The set is simply switched on and the vessel's position is displayed automatically.  No special charts will be necessary.</P>
    <P>For the small lobster boat carrying minimal charts most receivers may be pre-programmed to give a bearing and distance to the landfall position, for example, the fairway buoy off the vessel's home port, from any location &mdash; and all at the touch of a button.  A number of positions and tracks may be pre-entered so that, for example, a craft could make its way up an estuary or channel in poor visibility, the receiver guiding it from buoy to buoy showing headings to steer, whether on track or to one side, and distance and times to run.</P>
    <P>Some receivers even have emergency locator transmitters &mdash; ELTs &mdash; incorporated in them which will, at the flick of a switch, broadcast the position of a vessel in difficulties and in which the receiver is linked to a synthesised voice. This will result in much faster on-scene response by the rescue services.  There have been incidents of searches being carried out in the wrong areas due to vessels in distress being unaware of their location or giving an incorrect position. This problem could be reduced by the use of this type of LORAN C receiver with consequent higher success rates in rescues and lower search costs.  As all LORAN C stations transmit on the same frequency &mdash; 100 kHz &mdash; no tuning is required.</P>
    <P>The safety benefits arising from LORAN C may be well demonstrated by the experience in the United States of America where after LORAN C was installed it rapidly became a major factor <Col N="1445" /> in marine safety so that it was ultimately declared the principal aid to navigation in the coastal waters of North America.</P>
    <P>Total capital expenditure on the European system will amount to about £19 million of which Ireland's share will be £1.56 million, or about 8 per cent of total cost.  Ireland has been fortunate in securing participation in the LORAN C system on very attractive financial terms. The French and Dutch Governments will be contributing 50 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, of the capital expenditure for the new Irish station.  EC funding will also be sought.  In addition, and because of the importance of Ireland to the European chain, the main equipment manufacturer has agreed to abate the costs of construction in Ireland by one million US dollars.</P>
    <P>The State will be paying for the installation of the LORAN C system and for the running costs.  The only cost to the users of the system will be the cost of purchase of receivers.  Prices of LORAN C and Decca receivers are comparable. Existing Decca wheelhouse receivers have to be replaced periodically and a dual LORAN C-Decca system will be in operation during a two year overlap period from around 1995 to 1997.  This means that users will have a five year lead-in period within which to purchase the equipment.  Prior to and following the introduction of LORAN C the Commissioners of Irish Lights will arrange a mobile educational awareness programme on use of the system to assist fishermen during the transition period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the LORAN C system is an intermediary system.  It will replace the Decca system which has been in use for many years and will ultimately be replaced by the GPS system presently used by the United States armed forces.  The GPS system is basically a satellite system but apparently it will be some years before it comes into operation, so there is no reason for anybody to object to the LORAN C system being used in the meantime.  I believe this system has a considerable number of defects and that <Col N="1446" /> the satellite system will be the ultimate in providing navigational aids.  We on this side of the House have no problem about agreeing to the LORAN C system being provided nor, consequently, to providing the money for it.</P>
      <P>What does concern us is the state of the fishery industry.  Today is probably an appropriate time to refer to events which have taken place over the past 20 years and to the negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy which are taking place and will take place over the next couple of months in Brussels.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the present policy was agreed in 1983.  That policy was to cover a 20-year period and we are having a mid-term review of that policy.  The initial policy was agreed in 1973 on our entry into the European Community. The 1983 agreement was also of considerable significance.</P>
      <P>The most worrying aspect of these policies is the very heavy bias against Ireland where fishery matters are concerned.  We possess 16 per cent of the Community's fishery grants and we are allowed to take only 4 per cent of the Community's total catch.</P>
      <P>That situation will have to be redressed and there is no better time to do it than now while re-negotiations are taking place.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty is in danger of bursting apart at the seams.  People are putting all sorts of pre-conditions on their agreement to it.  The Danes have already rejected it and the French have approved it by a very tiny margin.  A number of other countries, including Great Britain, are having very serious reservations about their participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the French and the British, in recent weeks the Danes have put down markers as regards their future participation in the European Community. I wish to make the point today that Ireland, too, should put down a marker so far as the Common Fisheries Policy is concerned.  It should be pointed out that we did not do well in the negotiations which took place prior to our accession to the European Community in 1973. Neither did we do well in the negotiations <Col N="1447" /> which led to the Common Fisheries Policy in 1983.  If other countries are going to re-open negotiations on other matters we should be the first to re-open negotiations on the extent of our catch under the Common Fisheries Policy, given the potential of the fisheries industry for expansion.</P>
    <P>However, instead of expansion what we have seen in recent years is contraction and a reduction in the size of the catch.  This has led to many fishermen being made redundant.  It is incredible that as a seafaring and maritime nation we should have so little influence on what is happening within the European Community in relation to fisheries matters. Even though we control 16 per cent of the fishing grounds we are only allowed 4 per cent of the catch.  We need jobs and we need to sustain coastal communities but we are going in the opposite direction.</P>

      <P>The Chair would encourage Deputy Deasy to come a little closer to the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this debate was postponed last week, at the request of the Government, strictly on the basis that it could be broadened to cover the fisheries industry in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be proper for anybody to pre-empt what is required by Standing Orders in respect of any discussion, that is, that one homes in or focuses or fishes in the waters prescribed.  I know nothing about that arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been led to understand by the Whip of my party that provision was made for a general discussion and that this formed part of the bargain in agreeing to take the debate today as distinct from last Thursday or Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If that agreement was reached provision should have been made for it.  There would have been no objection to the proposal that it <Col N="1448" /> be extended but the Chair was not and should have been advised about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, if the Whips were contacted I am sure that it would be verified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My own Whip would need to advise me as I was not advised of this arrangement.  I am aware that a debate was due to take place last week on the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate was due to be taken last week also. I note that the renegotiation process is proceeding at present in Brussels and that the Minister for the Marine has taken a court action against the European Community on the question of what our total allowable catch should be and of the tonnage that this country is allowed in respect of our fishing fleet.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tonnage register, this constitutes a serious dereliction of duty on the part of those who are responsible for compiling it, given that the size of our fleet has been restricted considerably. This restriction is inequitable in that large boats which have been built in recent years comprise a significant proportion of the tonnage register to the exclusion of smaller inshore boats and traditional trawlers.  As somebody in the fishing industry said to me recently, the scandal in relation to the compilation of that register compares with the scandals which have been exposed at the Beef Tribunal, that there is a bias in favour of very large boats and that a significant proportion of the tonnage allowed is absorbed by the big boats to the exclusion of small and medium-sized boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like every other Deputy in this House who represents a coastal constituency and fishing ports, I am aware that hundreds of genuine fishermen are not being allowed to go to sea in their own boats &mdash; there are dozens of them in my own constituency &mdash; because they were omitted when the register was being compiled. There is no way that they will be allowed to re-enter the fishing industry which has always provided them with a <Col N="1449" /> livelihood.  This amounts to a scandalous misappropriation of a valuable resource whereby the bigger boats absorb a significant proportion of the tonnage allowed to the exclusion of the traditional and inshore coastal fishermen.</P>
    <P>The editorial in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> sums up much of what needs to be said about the state of the fishing industry and cognisance should be taken of this.  It is a Cinderella industry and much of what we should have obtained under the Common Fisheries Policy was sacrificed so that other sectors could benefit; this is not good enough.</P>
    <P>In common with all others, we have a 200-mile exclusive fishing zone whereas our territorial zone is only 12 miles, that is, the area within which Irish law is applied.  For fishery protection purposes, our Naval Service has control or jurisdiction over the 200-mile zone and they do a very good job with limited resources. The day has come when legal jurisdiction should be extended to the entire 200-mile exclusive zone and not confined solely to within 12 miles of our coast.  Indeed, the figure used to be three miles but was increased some years ago to 12 miles.  I am advocating that it be extended to cover our 200-mile exclusive zone.</P>
    <P>I say this for a definite reason, that is that some fellow members of the European Community have abused their privileges within this 200-mile exclusive zone and in some cases have been getting away scot free with criminal and illegal activities. Two countries, in particular, have violated those fishing grounds to a massive extent, France and Spain.  The French continually fish those grounds.  In some cases, they use undersized mesh nets within six miles of our coast, because they have preferential status to do so.  They are killing off the undersized fish and are, therefore, contributing to the destruction of our fishing stocks.  They are unscrupulous and so also are the Spanish.</P>
    <P>Day in day out the Spanish fishermen break the law in an organised manner which, apparently, is supported by their Government. I do not make this allegation lightly.  We are all aware that <Col N="1450" /> since Spain's accession to the European Community they have been fishing illegally inside our 200 mile exclusive zone.  They are licensed to fish with a certain number of boats, but they are fishing with a much greater number than their licence permits.  If those boats which are fishing illegally are apprehended by the Irish Naval Service and the crew are prosecuted and convicted in the Irish courts, their fines are paid from a special slush fund.  To my knowledge, the Spanish Government are working in tandem with the companies operating those boats.  The boats are not owned by private individuals, they are owned by companies who are working in conjunction with the Spanish Government and any fines imposed are paid out of this fund.  Even in cases of criminal activity, such as ramming of other boats, I believe the Spanish Government assist the perpetrators of such criminal activities.</P>
    <P>On 31 April 1991, a Helvic fishing boat was rammed by a huge Spanish trawler approximately 40 miles off the Baltimore coast.  Those who were at the scene are is in no doubt but that the intent was to sink the Helvic boat.  Fortunately, the superstructure of the boat was sufficiently strong to withstand the ramming, but £40,000 worth of damage was caused to the boat.  It was also a frightening experience for the crew members.  Because the ramming took place outside our territorial limits no action was taken against the offending Spanish boat.  There have been numerous incidents around our coast of huge French and Spanish boats continually intimidating and, in some cases, ramming Irish boats.  Fortunately, as far as we are aware, there has been no loss of life to date.  There was an incident recently in the Smalls off the Welsh coast, but the facts of that case have yet to be ascertained.  Therefore, it would be improper for anyone to allege that some ulterior motive was involved.  There have been numerous attempts to intimidate and sink Irish boats.  For that reason, I would like the jurisdiction of the Irish Government to be extended from 12 to 200 miles to ensure that we can implement the law and that wrongdoers <Col N="1451" /> do not get away scot-free, as was the case in the past.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of our fishing industry, apart from the necessity to increase our total allowable catch, is the depletion of fishery stocks around our coast.  White fish are the bread and butter of our fishermen but stocks of that fish have been enormously depleted, particularly by the illegal activities of the French and Spanish, and also by rather indiscriminate fishing practices of some of our own fishermen.  The owners of virtually all large boats have huge repayments to meet and if stocks are overfished in the outer regions there is a tendency to come closer to shore.  Boats which were built to fish 100 to 200 miles off the coast are now fishing within a couple of miles of the coast.  This has resulted in a massive depletion of white fish stocks. The day will come when fishing for certain species of fish will have to be banned completely.  The Canadians did this recently at enormous cost to their own fishermen.  They banned fishing for cod, which is their primary species, because of the depletion of stocks and over fishing of their waters.</P>
    <P>Our stocks of white fish have reached an alarmingly low level.  A proper regime should be introduced to ensure that small boats fish inshore and that the larger boats only fish in deep waters, a considerable distance offshore.  There is no regime in place in the fishing industry here whereby zones are fixed.  In the last century when boats were much smaller and less powerful there was a regime in place whereby certain fishing such as beam trawling was prohibited.  They could only operate in certain areas.  That was in the 19th century.  We are now approaching the 21st century and anything goes in regard to fishing.  We must have a system to regulate the fishing industry here.</P>
    <P>It would have been of great assistance if the Minister had outlined to us in layman's language the practical advantages of the LORAN C navigation system, the deficiencies in the Decca system and what the ultimate advantages in the GPS satellite <Col N="1452" /> system will be in the future.  We are introducing a system which has been in use since the fifties, according to the Minister.  Therefore, it appears that the GPS system will be the ultimate one and I would like to know when the Minister envisages that system coming into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Supplementary Estimate before us this morning and support the measures outlined by the Minister in the provision of increased safety measures for maritime traffic going to and from this country.  The motion as outlined indicates very clearly the urgency of passing this Estimate expeditiously.  I would like to question why the urgency has arisen.  I would expect that an expenditure of this nature would be well planned and would be part of an on-going programme of investigation in marine safety measures.  I think it is opportune at this time to look at some aspects of the dangers to many of our citizens who make their living from going down to the sea in ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country on the western periphery of Europe, being an island nation, should <Col N="1453" /> have where at all possible the best modern technology available to operate, control and safeguard shipping in and out of our ports.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have given their services in safeguarding the lives of their fellow men and women.  The rescue services at Shannon, Haulbowline and other areas around the coast have done remarkable work down through the years with very often inadequate equipment.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have been slow over the years to grasp the significance of our position on the western approaches to Europe and we have relied heavily on the rescue services of other countries, particularly Britain whose RAF rescue unit have played such a magnificent role down through the years in going to the aid of stricken vessels off our coast.  This is done without cost to this country, a fact easily and very often forgotten.</P>
    <P>Our new rescue service &ldquo;Slanu&rdquo; have indeed in the short time since becoming operative proven that they, with the cooperation of other services, provide a first-class service and if given the resources to do so will, I am sure, make a magnificent contribution to safety at sea.</P>
    <P>I would have to mention at this point the splendid record of our Air Corps who have also played a huge role in saving life at sea and on land.  It is also opportune at this time to pay tribute to the RNLI whom I consider to be a rescue service in a class of their own.  These gallant men and women provide a remarkable service which unfortunately Governments do not fully appreciate.  Very often these seamen face unbelieveable dangers to try to save life and never ask questions regarding compensation or reward or the creed or nationality of those who are in trouble. Their goal is to save life, very often at great risk to their own.  I believe that the general public acknowledge this by subscribing generously to their flag days. A feature of these collections is that people willingly go to collectors to give money, recognising the great humanitarian work that is being done by this organisation.  The Government's subscription <Col N="1454" /> of £100,000 in the annual Estimate, which has been static for some considerable time, should at least be doubled as a recognition of their great voluntary work.</P>
    <P>The lighthouse service as we know is being dramatically changed with the mechanisation of lights around our coasts, I would have to agree that with modern technology automation was inevitable.  However, while there may be a saving of money in the operation of an automated service, there very well could be a loss of life in doing so.  While lights can be kept going without the human touch, very often the eyes and ears of vigilant keepers were instrumental in saving life.</P>
    <P>There is now a substantial increase in marine leisure activity and despite the introduction recently by the Minister of legislation governing safety at sea, which incidentally I did not think went far enough, the lives of people not experienced in adverse weather conditions could be put at risk and there will be no conscientious keeper at hand to warn and advise of the dangers around our coastal waters.  Modernisation, automation and high technology will never replace the experience in vigilance of our lighthouse keepers who have taken such pride in their work and in their traditions.  One of the most important aspects of the installation of such equipment is its effects on our fishing fleets.</P>
    <P>Any expenditure on equipment that helps or benefits fishermen, particularly their safety at sea, will be welcomed and supported by the Labour Party.  While I see that this expenditure is a step forward, we must not let this occasion pass without highlighting the size and condition of our fishing boats.  It is a fact that the vast majority of our fishing fleet are antiquated and showing the worst for wear.  Fishermen manning these vessels in rough seas and high winds show an extraordinary skill in going about their daily work.</P>
    <P>I would like once again to condemn in the strongest possible terms the criminal activity, referred to by Deputy Deasy, of some foreign steel-hulled trawlers who <Col N="1455" /> see Irish boats as a soft target for ramming in order to claim these fishing grounds for themselves.  This activity on the high seas and very often in our Irish waters which puts lives at risk should be seen for what it is &mdash; attempted murder. The Minister must act and make sure that whatever country is involved and responsible is brought before the EC and made account for their nationals' action. This despicable action has little to do with the traditional code of seamen and fishermen.  It is downright thuggery and criminal.</P>
    <P>Life at sea, particularly for fishermen, is difficult and dangerous enough without having to contend with the militant, aggressive and savage action of unscrupulous foreign pirates.  There is also, of course, the ever-present danger in the Irish Sea of the menace of submarines in the fishing grounds.  It seems incomprehensible to me in this day and age, with the threat of war between East and West practically non-existent, that war games are continued to be played in busy shipping lanes.</P>
    <P>If exercises are to be carried out I am sure that in the interest of safety, the Atlantic is the proper place for such activity.  We recently had a near miss off the Scottish coast and I shudder to think what would happen if a passenger ferry going to and from this country hit a submerged submarine.  I would ask the Minister, when meeting and speaking with his counterparts in other EC countries and with their defence authorities, to demand that all submarine activity in future would cease and that vessels, particularly submarines, would be obliged to travel on the surface while passing through the busy fishing grounds of the Irish Sea.  I do not think that this is an unreasonable condition in view of the tragedies and near tragedies which have happened.  The underwater activity of submarines, which pose a distinct threat to our fishing boats, should cease immediately.</P>
    <P>I would also like to add that any resistance by the Minister in curtailing the tonnage of our fishing fleet would be fully supported by the Labour Party.  It must <Col N="1456" /> be driven home to the EC that what is now needed in this country is bigger, better and safer boats so that our fishing industry can expand and provide the much needed employment for our people.</P>
    <P>I note that the Government have approved the ratification of the international agreement for the establishment and operation of a civil LORAN sea navigation system in north-west Europe and the north Atlantic.  Without going into the technicalities, of which the Minister has given a good outline, as to how this system operates and its functions, I note that the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; is included and I would presume that military or naval participation would be excluded.  I would appreciate if the Minister could enlighten the House if this is the case.  I make this point for very good reasons.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen drug seizures at our airports and ferry ports.  A few weeks ago nearly £3 million worth of drugs was seized at Cork ferry port by our customs and excise officers who have done a magnificent job at ports of arrival throughout the country.  However, it is a well known fact, a fact strongly indicated by the State Solicitor in Cork that drugs are coming into this country in huge quantities.  It is believed that the south and south-west coasts are very vulnerable to this activity.  I would ask the Minister if the installation of the proposed equipment could be utilised for detecting and position fixing in Irish waters suspect craft coming from abroad with drugs or contraband.  I would also like to query whether, when this equipment is fully operational, Irish vessels will have to change to the system and whether the present Decca system operated in the majority of Irish boats will become obsolete.</P>
    <P>It appears that countries such as Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and France have signed this agreement &mdash; a notable absentee from this agreement is Britain.  I would like the Minister to give an indication why this is so and to say whether this will cause confusion between the two countries in operational procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> The motion for approval before the House specifies that the sum of £550,000 be approved to enable this vital work to go ahead &mdash; i.e. the purchase of land and the signing of the contract for equipment. Judging by the information supplied to us, it would appear that there is no choice but to go ahead at this time due to the penal clause that the company or manufacturer supplying the equipment would increase the contract price by $1 million and the price of land where it is to be situated would increase by 10 per cent if funds were not available by 22 October. It would be very bad economics if this motion was not approved without delay.  I welcome the provision of such equipment to ensure the safety of all those who make their living at sea.</P>

      <P>From a quick perusal of the Minister's contribution it is clear that he should be congratulated on doing a good deal, financially speaking, and from the point of view of what we can understand of the LORAN C system.  It holds great promise for improved safety in the years ahead.  The accuracy which it will bring to bear on the location and placing of vessels &mdash; big and small &mdash; will, undoubtedly, make a further contribution to the surveillance of our waters from a fishery protection point of view and, as a result, the conservation of our fisheries, which are being systematically raped, as outlined by the two previous speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been done over many years, not just by the historical fishing countries, but by their illegals, who are almost as numerous as the legalised fishing vessels of countries which I will not name, but there is no doubt about where most of them come from.  I am a member of the Fisheries Committee in the Community and I have always raised this matter when there is a debate about conservation, fishing rights and fishery agreements.  I have warned of the damage the illegal <Col N="1458" /> take is doing to the conservation of the stocks for those who are entitled to fish legally.  It is fairly well known that fish taken in this way require a landing point. It is the old story, if there were not receivers there would not be thieves.  In particular, I will continue to ask the Fisheries Commissioner to try to ensure that illegal catches are not received.  This would be hard to implement at present but, under this new system, we might be able to do a little more.  However, it is still, literally speaking, a drop in the ocean.  We must find out where the fish are being landed because, if they are controlled at that point, they will also be controlled in relation to being scooped up illegally as they are at present.</P>
    <P>I want to elaborate on how badly off we are in so far as our fish take is concerned, which is reflected in the conservancy measures which have had to be taken because of declining stocks.  Our vast resource has been undervalued for far too long and it is really only in the last ten years &mdash; since the fisheries agreement &mdash; that we began to realise what a valuable future our fisheries would have if only we had access to at least double our present entitlement.  That is not an unduly optimistic target and I am glad that the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, is trying to ensure that we get a better deal than heretofore.  It has not been too bad up to now because we have been trying to develop an infant fishing fleet to a modern one, even though it is still infinitesimal.  The problem is that not only do we have a small take from a very large number of fish in our own waters, but because of the relatively small total take we do not have a surplus for continuous processing, where real employment can be created.</P>
    <P>A startling figure has been mentioned in relation to fishing: for every fisherman full-time engaged in other countries in the Community, seven people are employed onshore in the processing industry.  In Ireland, for every person full-time employed at sea we employ 0.7 of one person onshore.  In other words, the average is ten times greater, not because of any lack of activity on the part <Col N="1459" /> of our small and would be processors, but because we do not have the necessary raw material in continuous supply.  For that reason, any additional catch which we are allowed will be of great benefit, far in excess of the benefits accruing at present.  We did a bad deal, there is no doubt about that, but I suppose it is understandable that agriculture was of such importance to us that fisheries were not given due regard.  That, unfortunately, is the agreement under which we must now operate.  It is now at the halfway stage in relation to review and there is great opposition to a review by those who have done very well out of it. The Ministers who will be charged with renegotiating the agreement will see that there are countries who will fight tooth and nail not to have changes made because they are doing so well out of it, partially at our expense.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a third country fishery agreement arranged by the EC every six months.  This is paid for by the EC and training is given to enable third countries, who are unable to take up their own fishing quotas in full, to do so in future. Massive sums are being paid from the Community budget to secure these third country agreements.  However, the problem is that only a few countries nearest to those third country waters get any benefit and it is not reflected in the total allowable catch, as it should be.  By shifting it round, the benefit could be shared equally by all the fishing countries in the Community but they have set their faces steadfastly against that policy.</P>
    <P>Recently I had to make a report on a fishery agreement with the Republic of Guinea; it is only one of a dozen perhaps, there will be more.  There is not an iota of benefit to any country &mdash; except one &mdash; in the Community.  However, the Community are paying out of a common budget to which we all, as taxpayers, contribute.  The Department of the Marine and the Minister should now try to get additional fish take without lessening the catch of anybody else.  The present system in regard to our fisheries is nothing short of scandalous because <Col N="1460" /> from the south-west of Cork to Malin Head, Donegal, there is the greatest possible potential employment in regard to fishing.</P>
    <P>We do not have the opportunities for other kinds of employment and there is within the Community a recognition that regions such as these should be given special treatment.  The appropriate treatment for the west of Ireland is to give us a doubling of our total allowable catch. Let us start fighting now, as the Minister is already doing, because we are getting a raw deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 1 and Question No. 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 9 September 1991 the Southern Law Association wrote to my predecessor and informed him that unless significant increases were made in the fees payable to solicitors for criminal <Col N="1461" /> legal aid work they would withdraw their services three weeks later.  My predecessor responded to the effect that there was no claim for an increase before him and that such a claim would have to be submitted by the Incorporated Law Society.  Notwithstanding the fact that no such claim had been lodged, the Cork solicitors withdrew from the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme on 1 October 1991.</P>
    <P>Four months later, in February of this year, the law society submitted a claim for very large increases in the level of fees paid to solicitors who defend accused persons under the scheme.  A series of meetings involving the law society and the courts division of my Department was held to negotiate a settlement of the claim.  On 7 August a firm offer was made to the law society and they asked for six weeks to consider it.  Later, on 15 September, an improved offer was made by my Department.  However, the law society response was that the only offer which would be acceptable to them would involve a certain minimum level of fees. I had offered them over 60 per cent of an increase in fees for District Court cases but they wanted to double that figure to increases of about 120 per cent.</P>
    <P>In these critical times for the public finances, I could not afford to make such an offer on behalf of the State and on 18 September all solicitors in the Cork criminal legal aid panel withdrew from it.</P>
    <P>I think that all sides of the House would agree with me when I say that it is most regrettable that, at a time of need for restraint in public spending, the Cork solicitors should see fit to withdraw their services from the criminal legal aid scheme following refusal of an offer of increases over 60 per cent.  The offer made by my Department was both fair and generous and it included payments for certain work which up to now had not been remunerated, particularly visits to Garda stations to persons in custody.</P>
    <P>In this House today I want to appeal to the Cork solicitors to end their action and to resume their duties under the criminal legal aid scheme.  Since its inception <Col N="1462" /> about 30 years ago that scheme has operated on the basis of participation in it of solicitors in private practice.  I regard that participation as a very positive feature of the scheme and it is my earnest wish that it should continue.  That is why I am making one last appeal here today to the solicitors involved.  However, I am not prepared to see the successful administration of the criminal justice system put at risk by a situation where certain solicitors will opt out of the scheme despite very generous fee increases being offered to them.  I, as Minister for Justice with responsibilities for the operation of all aspects of the criminal justice system, cannot allow a situation to develop in which persons charged before the courts could not have their cases disposed of because of the actions of a couple of dozen people.</P>
    <P>If my appeal today is ignored and there is no return to the panel by the legal aid solicitors I will have no alternative but to put something else in place.  I cannot wait indefinitely, nor would I expect Members of this House or the people of Cork to have the patience to wait indefinitely.  If I do not get a favourable response from the Cork solicitors in the next few days I will have to make a decision on what alternative system of legal aid could be put in place to enable criminal charges to be disposed of and take immediate steps to implement that alternative system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister know that not only are solicitors in Cork withdrawing their services but also solicitors in Sligo, Galway, Kilkenny, Louth and Longford?  Would he agree that there is now a serious risk that the whole administration of criminal justice will cease and that people facing serious charges will have those charges struck out, which may lead those people to feel immune to prosecution? As this dispute has been going on for more than 12 months, would the Minister not acknowledge that it is in the national interest that he personally meet urgently with the Incorporated Law Society to determine whether the dispute can be resolved once and for all in a satisfactory manner, rather than the <Col N="1463" /> Minister abdicating his role in this area and leaving it to officials of his Department to resolve the dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely without hope that the industrial action taken by the solicitors can be brought to an end. The law society have been in touch with my Department in the past few days in another effort to resolve the dispute.  In fact, even while I speak in the House today, my Department will be in further contact with the law society to clarify what is available to the solicitors and what can be conceded of their claim. However, I have to emphasise that I cannot increase significantly my already generous offer.  I am hopeful today that there may be some resolution of this matter or that we may at least start down the road of further negotiations that will resolve it finally.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 4 and Questions Nos. 19, 29, 42 and No. 72 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Taoiseach, in reply to a parliamentary question on 7 October 1992, the Government's White Paper on Marital Breakdown, which was published on 29 September last, states that the Government propose to have a referendum on divorce after a full debate on the issues and following the enactment of other proposals on family law which are outlined in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the proposed legislation giving an equal share in the ownership of the family home is in the process of being finalised and will be introduced very shortly.  It is my intention to bring forward the Family Law (No. 1) Bill &mdash; the scheme of which is set out in the White Paper &mdash; as quickly as possible. The Bill will include important reforms regarding maintenance, new court jurisdiction and property and financial arrangements in cases of nullity, protection and support of people where a decree of divorce, nullity or judicial separation has been obtained abroad and is entitled to recognition in this country.  It will also contain new provisions in relation to declarations of marital status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> Any submissions which I receive on those legislative proposals will be fully considered and taken into account as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The purpose of setting out in the White Paper different examples of the form a constitutional amendment on the question of divorce might take was to initiate a full debate on the complex issues involved and elicit views from interested parties.  As I indicated when the White Paper was launched, the Government in finalising their proposals will have full regard to the responses to the White Paper, including, of course, responses by Members of this House.  It would be inconsistent with that approach and would not be helpful if I were to seek at this stage to anticipate the whole debate on this matter by expressing a preference for any of the examples of possible constitutional amendments contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the careful approach adopted by the Government in publishing five possible wordings to a constitutional amendment due to the complexity of the matter is in stark contrast to the approach taken by the Government in dealing with the proposed amendments to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, in which the Government have lobbed up one amendment and told the Opposition parties to take it or leave it?  Is the Minister unwilling to express a preference for any of the five possible amendments lobbed onto the political stage by way of the White Paper published by the Government?  Can he clarify whether the Government recognise that couples whose marriages have completely broken down are entitled to a second chance and that this State should allow divorce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer to the final part of the Deputy's question is that it is a matter for the people to decide. What we are saying in the White Paper is that the people will be given that opportunity and that it will be given following the debate which, I think, will be useful. Many Members of the House as well as <Col N="1466" /> organisations and groups of people would like to make submissions and comments on some of the matters referred to in the White Paper.  Also, it is important that the legislative measures I have detailed be put in place.  It is the Government's intention to see what option would be considered after that debate and to have a referendum.  I think that is a reasonable approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that what he is saying is that the Government have no view at all, that the Government do not know whether people whose marriages have broken down should be given a second chance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is premature to answer that question and it would simply preempt the decision that will have to be taken before the referendum is put to the people.  The proper way to do this is to allow the debate to proceed, see how it progresses and have further discussion on the legislative measures in the House.  We will probably have a good opportunity to expand on that as these legislative measures are going through.  That is the caring way to do it.  After that we will have the referendum.  Certainly before the referendum is put to the people the Government would have to take a decision on the matters referred to by the Deputy.  I look forward to that.</P>

      <P>If there is to be any debate &mdash; and this matter has been debated over the past 20 years &mdash; would the Minister not acknowledge it would be more informed in the event of the Government indicating whether they had any particular view on whether people should be allowed to re-marry?  Second, it would be a more informed debate if the Government indicated which of the possible constitutional amendments to permit divorce, if any, they have a preference for.  In the absence of that, there is a decision and policy vacuum and there can be no informed public discussion.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the process of a full debate on the complex issues involved would be aided at this time by attempting to concentrate on personal preferences or on the Government's preferences.  The whole idea about a debate is to seek opinions and submissions from interested parties.  The Deputy is correct in saying that following that process it is proper that the Government express their view on the preferred option.  It may be in that debate options will be put forward which people may consider more appropriate than those which have already been outlined in the White Paper.  Taking all that on board at the appropriate time the Government will express their view and we will support that view.</P>

      <P>I have one final supplementary question.  Would the Minister agree that appointing members to a censorship board is not so complex as to require 11 months of consideration after the term of office of the old board expired?  It is an extraordinary gaffe to have failed to appoint the membership of such a board until the matter was raised in the national press this week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that because of the diversity of representation on the committee and the variety of issues to be addressed, the interdepartmental committee in question agreed at an early stage in their work to operate mainly through sub-committees, which have held several meetings.  To date, the full committee have met on six occasions and a further meeting is scheduled for next week.  I expect to have the committee's first report shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if any of the sub-committees have met with the local authorities, particularly the Dublin local authorities in whose areas there are huge public housing schemes which have proved difficult to police?  Has he consulted with the estate management sections of the local authorities with a view to involving them in finding a solution to the difficult crime problems in some of the public housing schemes in this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that initially the interdepartmental committee comprised of assistant secretaries from various Departments such as the Departments of Justice, Environment, Education, Health, Labour and Social Welfare.  The Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána was also on that committee. After their first meeting the committee were expanded to include representatives of Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and the IDA.  I expect that they would have been <i>au fait</i> with all matters concerning estate management.</P>

Is the Minister aware of the recent difficulties which arose in an inner city flat complex where two members of the Garda Drug Squad had <Col N="1473" /> to call in 50 gardaí to back them up? These gardaí had great difficulty in rescuing their two colleagues.  Will the Minister outline his plans to deal with juvenile crime?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is bringing a specific instance to light.  I suggest that the best approach is to await the report and to then give an opportunity to debate the matter.  I expect that the report will be widely debated in public.  The important point is that the text has finally been prepared.  It has not yet been agreed by the committee but I am hoping it will be agreed in the very near future.  I have asked the Select Committee on Crime, whose chairperson is present, to take an initial look at the report when it is published. I believe that is a good way to proceed so far as the House and its Members are concerned.  Certainly the report will be widely discussed and debated.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Legal Aid Board that the waiting periods for applicants for legal aid in the various law centres in Dublin are as follows: Aston's Place, a two to three months' wait; Gardiner Street, a 12 months' wait; Ormond Quay, a six months' wait; and Tallaght, a five to six months' wait.</P>
      <P>The new law centre in Finglas is being fitted out at the moment with a view to it being fully operational by the end of the month.  Work on the fitting out of the Clondalkin centre will commence as soon as the legal arrangements relating to the acquisition of the premises have been completed.  The Legal Aid Board expect the Clondalkin law centre to come on-stream within two to three months.  When both of these law centres are in operation the centre at Aston's Place will close.</P>
      <P>I am examining proposals received from the Legal Aid Board for a further increase in the number of solicitors and of law centres.  Decisions as to increased resources will be taken in the context of next year's Estimates, having regard to the availability of financial resources and the overall situation with regard to the public finances.  Also, the board are seeking other possible ways of improving the level of service to clients which would not have implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> With regard to a statutory scheme of civil legal aid and advice, it is the intention to publish legislation to place the scheme on a statutory basis in accordance with the commitment given in the revised Programme for Government, that is before the end of 1993.  The timing of such publication will depend on the progress of other priority items in that programme. I should also say that the absence of a statutory scheme has not in any way hindered the operation of the Legal Aid Board in the administration of the scheme.  The problems faced by the board, almost since their inception, have had to do with financial difficulties in the wider context of the public finances. Even if a statutory scheme were in place, the development of the scheme &mdash; something we all would like to see happen as soon as possible &mdash; would still have been restricted, for those same reasons.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any views to offer on the level of the service in Dublin where women subjected to marital violence have to wait an average of six months for legal aid?  I note that at a recently convened conference on this topic the Minister gave assurances that he was anxious to protect women in these situations.  Would he not concede that the most effective relief available to women in these circumstances is easy, ready and cost free access to the courts to pursue their cases?  Would he also accept that vast areas of the country have no legal aid service whatsoever?  Can he advise the House when he will address the major gaps in this service throughout the country in his reforms?</P>

      <P>I accept that there are delays.  I should like to see the scheme developed in the way the Deputy suggests so that people would have quick and <Col N="1476" /> ready access to the courts.  Of course, much of the difficulty experienced by the board in recent years appears to stem from the development in the area of family law following the status of children Act and the judicial separation and family law measures.  Even though we have increased the numbers of solicitors and centres we still do not seem to be able to catch up with the increased demand.  The service is demand driven.</P>
      <P>When the centres in Clondalkin and Finglas are in operation there will be a total of 16 centres.  There are 39 serving solicitors at present.  There is one vacancy and I am pressing to have it filled within the next few weeks.  There will be a full staff complement then.  As resources are provided I should like to think we will be able to expand the services.  I agree with the basic concept the Deputy has articulated, that we should endeavour to improve the services if and when we can.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the civil legal aid scheme, in effect, is known as a woman's legal aid scheme because 90 per cent of cases are brought by women?  Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the figures he has given us indicate gross hardship for many wives? Is he aware that hundreds of women, with no knowledge of the law are going to court and representing themselves because there is no other source of basic legal information available to them? Would he not accept there is a need for some emergency system to fill the gap until, as he says himself, he reflects on the matter and takes action?  There is a serious crisis here.  I would appeal to the Minister to implement some emergency system to deal with present cases.</P>

Would the Minister not acknowledge and agree that until this Government acknowledge the need in this area this State will remain at risk of being brought again before the European Court &mdash; under the Convention on Human Rights &mdash; for failure to protect family life and women?</P>

      <P>I accept what Deputy Fennell said, that women have need of this service.  It would be my hope that, with the opening of the new centres I have mentioned, the recruitment of the extra solicitor, along with the possibility <Col N="1478" /> of new part-time centres being opened, the service will be improved and progressed. The Deputy has my support in that respect.  I have expressed this to her before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is need for more resources in this area.  I should like to think we might be able to get them. At least the Deputy can see that we are making some progress.  Admittedly, it is slow and the waiting lists are not acceptable but we are hoping to provide more resources.  Unfortunately, it appears that whatever resources we provide &mdash; because of the continuous demand in the very areas Deputy Fennell mentioned &mdash; there appears to be a never ending fight to keep pace with continuing demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given the House very disturbing figures.  A similar question was tabled in June last when the reply was to the effect that the centre at Ormond Quay had an eight to ten-week waiting list, now extended to six months, which is outrageous.  Is the Minister aware that organisations like Women's Aid, which deal almost exclusively with battered wives, now have no faith in the Legal Aid Board and in fact do not now refer any battered wives to such centres because the waiting lists are so long and because at least two of the three centres have already been closed to anything other than emergency cases?  Does the Minister need to await some unfortunate woman being battered to death before gaining access to the legal aid centres before he will provide the necessary resources?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The cases to which the Deputy refers do have priority rating in so far as these law centres are concerned. As resources improve, as the number of law centres increases, more and more people will be attended to within a shorter period.  There is an emergency way of dealing with such cases, of which the Deputy is well aware, in that the very <Col N="1479" /> cases to which he referred do receive priority rating in so far as receiving attention is concerned.  I am saying to the Deputy I wish it were a shorter waiting period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second aspect of the matter, when the Minister responded with regard to the statutory basis, would he agree that the single greatest delay in introducing this legislation is the departmental fear not in dealing with the administrative aspects of the services but in giving people a legislative right to such legal services? Would he agree that the reason he is not moving forward on this is simply because he does not want to incorporate in legislation people's right to a legal aid service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that there can be no autonomy for bodies with staffing implications.  Accordingly, there would have to be strict financial control irrespective of whichever method was adopted.  I might add that even if one incorporated it in a statute the principal consideration of resources and money would still be involved.  The Deputy is quite right in maintaining that it exists in other places on a statutory basis but they have been trying to row it back ever since because of the enormous cost implications. I am not advancing that as an excuse.  I am merely saying to the Deputy that, irrespective of whether it is done on a statutory basis, or on the basis now obtaining here, that consideration will have to be taken into account and the Deputy knows that.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>whether he intends to reactivate a treatment scheme for sexual offenders within the prison services; and the reason the pilot scheme in Arbour Hill Prison was discontinued.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The first objective of the prison system is to contain, in appropriate security, those who are committed to custody by the courts.  There are also a number of other objectives, including <Col N="1480" /> making available to those in custody such help, guidance, counselling, education and training as will lead them, as far as practicable, to a constructive life in the community on release.  As is acknowledged internationally, this rehabilitative objective is very difficult to realise but it is essential that it should continue to be a recognised objective of the system and that every effort should be made to achieve it as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The objective of rehabilitation assumes particular significance where sex offenders are concerned.  The nature and seriousness of the offences for which they are in custody are such that great importance attaches to reducing, as far as possible, the risk of re-offending following eventual release.  Nobody should be under any illusion that there is a ready made, easily applied and guaranteed means of achieving results in this area. Such measures as may be taken will necessarily be some what tentative in nature and subject to trial and assessment. It must also be borne in mind that not all sex offenders are at risk of re-offending, by no means all offenders would be suitable for treatment and any treatment provided would be voluntary.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I am simply trying to strike a note of realism about the nature of the problem and the possibility of easy results but I am in no way seeking to downplay the importance of trying to achieve results.  At present sex offenders, in common with other prisoners, have access to a range of medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare services in the prisons.  I am satisfied that much good work is being done in this way for sex offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also interested in seeing whether a more specialist treatment programme for such offenders can be devised which would demonstrably and significantly reduce or eliminate the risk of re-offending on release on the part of offenders who agree to undergo and are susceptible to treatment, especially those who are at greatest risk of re-offending.  I have, therefore, recently directed, on foot of advice from the director or prison medical services, that an urgent process of <Col N="1481" /> study and consultation should be carried out to establish what options might be available in this regard.  I am satisfied that if such a more specialist treatment programme is to be introduced it would have to be practicable, capable of being delivered and sustainable and should be properly evaluated at all stages to ensure that it would be effective and cost-efficient. The experience gained in the group therapy programme which was conducted by the probation and welfare service in Arbour Hill on an experimental, pilot basis will be taken into account in the process of consultation and study which I have initiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain when and why this pilot scheme was disbanded, especially in view of the Minister's very lengthy opening remarks which acknowledged the great seriousness of sexual crimes and downplayed the reality of repeat offences among that group of criminals?  The Minister has made a public commitment to seek to protect women.  This is an area where such tentative steps as have been taken to date should be maintained and developed and not rowed back on, as the reply seems to indicate.  How long has the scheme been in abeyance and why was it allowed to lapse?  Was the decision based on some dissatisfaction with it?</P>

      <P>I can guarantee Deputy McCartan that he does not have to help me to apply my mind to anything.  The programme was experimental in nature and concluded about 18 months ago.  It was developed by probation and welfare officers for a group of ten offenders.  Its objectives were to develop interpersonal relationships, to promote victim awareness and to discourage repeat offences. The programme had the full commitment of three welfare officers.  The results of the pilot therapeutic programme will have to be taken into account.  The programmes we will try to put in place following the study will have to be deliverable and they will have to be evaluated at all stages.  It is a very complex matter.  The programme was experimental and we have learned much from it.  The new study will take that on board, along with other modern techniques and understandings in this area.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister explain why that pilot study was effectively stopped 18 months ago?  Would he confirm that the welfare officers who developed a degree of expertise in that area were simply transferred from Arbour Hill to other duties?  Would the Minister agree that it was a grave error to bring that scheme to an end and explain why an evaluation of that scheme has not yet been completed?  Would the Minister agree that it should not have required the Lavinia Kerwick case to draw the attention of the Minister, his Department and the Government to the need to provide treatment for sex offenders to ensure that they do not re-offend?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the latter part of the question.  I had already expressed an interest in this matter before that unfortunate occurrence. I had indicated on assuming this office that I was taking a personal interest in the whole prison system.  There are other initiatives I have started in that regard.  I hope to be able to report on them in the not too distant future.  I have an interest in improving the whole penal <Col N="1483" /> system.  It is a long time since we had an in-depth look at it.  This is just one element.  I do not know why the scheme was stopped 18 months ago, but the experience and the wisdom gained from that programme is not lost to us.  The new study was initiated purely because I want to see some improvements in this regard. It will include the director of prison medical services, the principal of the Probation and Welfare Service and the head psychologist.  These people are directly involved and they have been carrying out some investigations.  I expect the study to be comprehensive.  It may very well lead to experimental programmes again.  The whole idea behind an experimental programme is to gain experience.  If it works well, it can be applied; if it does not work, one has to try some other tack.  We are making a good start and I would ask Deputies to recognise that there is an interest in this, not because of any case but because there is a need.</P>

This House deserves better.  A very clear and concise question has been put to the Minister because it is of such importance. The Minister has indicated that he has established a working group to examine the matter.  When did he make that decision and when was the working group established?  Would he be prepared to give us the terms of reference of the working group?  What have they been asked specifically to do?

In view of that does the Minister accept that this programme should be viewed with great urgency?

I assure the Deputy that lessons learned from any programme undertaken in any one place will be applied across the board.  The Deputy is right in that we have to reduce the risk of re-offending. That is what the whole thing is about.  It must be remembered that it has to operate professionally and be effective and that it is voluntary.  It is not something that can be put in place overnight.  That was gleaned from the experimental pilot programme which was effectively done on those ten offenders.  The lessons learned have been applied consistently, but I think something else is needed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 63 and 64 together.  The House will be aware that in October 1990 the former Attorney General requested the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare a report on the case referred to in the questions.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has completed his examination of the report of the Director of Public Prosecutions and other relevant documentation.  He has also examined the formal petitions for pardon presented to the Government in this case on 11 June last.  I am examining the Attorney General's findings as a matter of urgency with a view to bringing the matter to Government in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the form of petition came in on 11 June.  I received on August 28 from the Attorney General the document the Deputy is referring to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this has been a matter of some concern and controversy for a considerable <Col N="1489" /> length of time and that the two individuals referred to in the question are entitled to know the Government's views on the matter and have their petitions dealt with expeditiously?  Will the Minister indicate to the House, since he has received the Attorney General's report in August of this year, that the matter will be dealt with and brought to finality by way of Government decision before the end of this month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General's findings in the case were received by me on 28 August.  The findings are rather detailed and extensive.  They involve complex issues so it will take some time to examine them.  I am happy to say, although I do not want to be pinned to it, that I will be able to bring the matter to Government within a month or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the completed investigation by the Attorney General and of how the matter is ultimately disposed of, does the Minister intend to make public the findings of the Attorney General given the way in which this case has occupied the public mind and has resulted from the public trial of the two accused?  I join with the previous speaker in urging the Minister to conclude his deliberations on this matter as speedily as possible.  This case has lingered much too long and it has engendered a lot of controversy because of the delays involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request from both Deputy McCartan and Deputy Shatter.  I would like to dispose of it as quickly as possible.  I am prevented from commenting further until the Government have considered the matter and the petitions.  The matter will be considered by Government and if I remember correctly, the Taoiseach has given some indication as to the possibility of publishing the report.  If he has, that will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deliberately not pressing the Minister to reveal what the Attorney General said to the Government. <Col N="1490" /> I accept that this is a matter for Government decision.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the report is published at the end of the day.  During the course of the summer months it was announced that the Government would bring legislation into this House to provide for a reopening of cases where new evidence emerges and there was a suggestion that the report of the Attorney General in this case would be held until that legislation is passed and that it would be left for whatever body the Government put in place under that legislation to make a decision in this case.  Could the Minister confirm that this case will be dealt with by the Government and will not be postponed until new legislation is passed and implemented to deal with any other case in which there may be allegations with regard to new evidence or with regard to an injustice in a conviction that resulted from a court hearing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important point.  I want to be absolutely clear that I understand the Deputy.  He wants me to dispose of this as quickly as possible, through Government, and get a decision rather than wait until the legislation promised on 15 September&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so much saying that I would rather the Minister did that. I am just trying to ascertain whether it is the intention of the Government to deal with the issue or to postpone the making of a decision until the new body is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the intention.  I would like to dispose of this issue in the immediate future, I hope within a month, by getting the Government decision on it and settling it in that way.  On the question of the legislation referred to as announced on 15 September 1992, the Government have authorised the drafting of that Bill which I believe will be widely supported on all sides of the House.  It will include the appropriate procedures by which cases such as this one can be reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The fact that a decision <Col N="1491" /> was taken by Government in a particular way does not mean that that avenue could not be pursued if it was appropriate once the legislation is processed through the House.  The short answer is that the matter should be disposed of in the immediate future and if there is a relevance or an appropriateness attached to that legislation in dealing with that case, so be it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that legislation be before the House before the Christmas recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so.  I would give it high priority and I hope the House would agree that the legislation on the whole question of miscarriages of justice is long awaited.  I would have thought the Deputy would be quite supportive of the Minister's position.</P>

Secondly, will he accept that no nation in Europe has suffered more from terrorists in terms of loss of human life and damage to the economy than we have here?  Thirdly, will he accept that no nation in Europe has a greater interest in dealing effectively with terrorists than we here in Ireland?  Lastly, will he accept that no person charged with offences of violence against the person or offences relating to firearms or explosives should be entitled to hide behind the political offence exemption in the Extradition Act as currently constituted?</P>

I can assure the House that the Government's wish is that the Bill will be introduced as soon as possible.  It will include the provision of the amendment of the 1987 Act in the light of the Supreme Court judgment in the names of the three persons I have mentioned.  The Government have decided that the provisions of that Act should be amended to achieve greater clarity in relation to the circumstances in which offences are <Col N="1493" /> excluded from the political offence exemption.  We will be proceeding with that matter and hopefully it can be increased in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>Let me challenge the Minister on this suggestion that the Government are dealing with this item as a matter of urgency.  Will he confirm that what he has told the House today in terms of Government proposals is no more than what was included in the Programme for Government published in late 1989 which indicated that the very measure he is now talking about so many years later was then described as an interim measure to be introduced by Government pending substantial review of the extradition laws generally?  Would <Col N="1494" /> he agree that the Government are not giving anything like the priority this issue deserves, that there are far greater issues to be determined and improved in our law with regard to extradition that the Government are delaying long in dealing with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have acted wisely in these matters.  We have lived up to our obligations under the European Convention.  We have always done that.  What we are saying here is that there is need for an amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there is need for that amendment to produce greater clarity in relation to the circumstances in which offences are excluded from the political offence exemption.  We would also at this time have to amend the law to extend the circumstances in which Irish citizens may be tried here for offences committed abroad.  There are some elements like that that have to be considered.  It is very important legislation and it is being processed and progressed.  We do live up to our obligations and the Deputy has accepted that in the past in so far as international conventions on this matter of terrorism are concerned.  I agree with the Deputy that we must deal with it effectively.</P>

Does the Minister accept that there is now an urgent need to ensure that no person charged with offences of violence against the person or offences relating to firearms or explosives should be entitled to hide behind the political offence exemption?

      <P>When the Government are considering this matter of amending, renewing or expanding our extradition laws, I would ask the Minister to keep two things in mind.  First, the citizens of this State must be assured of a fair trial or have a reasonable assurance that they will get a fair trial wherever they are being extradited to.  Second, until the laws in the UK and the Six Counties have been changed and their attitudes have been shown to be different from what they are, nobody should send their dog there, never mind one of our citizens, no matter what the situation.

    <Title>International Agreement on Navigation System: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Col N="1569" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Democratic Left, I welcome the proposals made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  The agreement we are discussing represents a very important milestone in the development of sea navigation around our coast and in the wider seas.</P>
      <P>The agreement is welcome for a number of reasons.  It represents Ireland, with its nearest strategic and geographic neighbours working into a system which will operate throughout the waters on the north-west coast of Europe and particularly, the waters surrounding the Irish coast, in terms of naval, shipping or fishing activities.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the system, which will be land based, will prove to be far more reliable and available than the current satellite system to which we have resource at present.  It is particularly significant that the Minister of State has been so forthcoming and frank in regard to this matter.  The satellite system which has been available up to now in the waters concerned was under the direct control of the US marine and naval services but it was capable of diversion at times of strategic importance, militarily and otherwise, for the United States.  That is best illustrated by the reference in the Minister's speech to the Gulf War when the satellite system was simply summarily and unilaterally deflected and directed towards the needs and resources of the host nation, namely, America.</P>
      <P>The importance of this development, then, is that Ireland will have a system which will be available at all times and in all weather but which will also be under our control.  The strategic importance of that cannot be lost on any of us, particularly those concerned, as I am, with fishing services here.  I represent a unique constituency in some respects.  I am based in Dublin and my constituency includes one of our most important fishery posts, namely, Howth.  Therefore, the importance of this service is brought home to me on a daily basis by my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important aspect of this arrangement from a technical point of view, is that we will be moving away <Col N="1570" /> from the Decca system.  The Minister has graphically outlined the shortcomings of that system in terms of navigational aid to shipping.  While the Decca system has not been in the use for very long, it is almost a &ldquo;boathold&rdquo; name in the same way as many other systems are household names.  The Decca system has served us well, but it had many shortcomings. Those shortcomings will be addressed to a large extent in the development of the LORAN C system.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented by this debate, nevertheless, raises a number of questions.  We are building the network becoming part of this important scheme and taking it directly under our control but, obviously, its efficency will apply only to the extent to which vessels use the system.  The Department must take a far more stringent line in that regard.  We cannot allow the system to develop on a voluntary basis.  The overall capital cost of the system for a fishing vessel or for a sea vessel of any nature, are minuscule, in the order of £500.  However, the cost to the State in providing air/sea rescue service is colossal and such cost is often added to substantially by the inability of the rescuers to accurately pinpoint the location of vessel or, more particularly, by vessels not being able to indicate accurately where they are located.  Valuable time, energy and resources are expended in searching for such vessels when, in fact, beleaguered vessels could be more easily pinpointed.  Will the Minister ensure that from the time of the establishment of this service &mdash; which, I believe, will be around 1995 &mdash; all vessels using Irish waters and registered in Irish ports will be obliged to use the LORAN C device?  If the cost, comparable to the size of the vessel, is too great then vessels which are over a certain size should be obliged to carry and use the LORCAN C device.  It is a very useful piece of equipment.  The cost which seamen would be obliged to expend on such a device would not be exorbitant and it would enable them to pinpoint quickly and accurately their location and transmit that information to the rescuers.  In poor weather conditions, vessels would be able to plot their way home without recourse to any other chart or optical service. <Col N="1571" /> Therefore, the Department should consider the compulsory use by fishing vessels of this system once it is in place.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be investing heavily in the system.  A Deputy who spoke earlier referred to the fact that we got a good financial deal.  In that respect, I would like to ask the Minister why he uses the punt to indicate the cost.  I have the more universal dollar figure.  He suggested that £1.56 million, or 8 per cent of the total cost of the system, will be funded by Ireland.  Holland will contribute 5 per cent, 3 per cent less than what is contributed by Ireland.  I appreciate that we as a nation have a very large coastal area and we have more extensive waters available to us than have some of our European partners but, nevertheless, regard must be had to the size of the fleets of the countries involved.  In that regard Holland, with its ports of Rotterdam and elsewhere, have much greater fleets than we have.  I wonder why the figures ultimately agreed upon do not reflect the size of the shipping and fishing fleets available to nation members.</P>
    <P>In terms of membership, I would ask the Minister why our neighbouring country, Britain, is not involved in the agreement? How will the services provided by Trinity House and other navigational services provided by Britain, which have been so important to navigation in Irish waters, integrate into the overall navigational systems that will be in place in Irish waters and elsewhere?  It seems that we, together with the other partners to this agreement, are taking a different direction in this whole navigational debate.  It is important to know whether we are going on an entirely different path from that of the British.  Will the Minister comment on the proposals with regard to developments generally in that area?</P>
    <P>As we are uniting with countries whose coastal lines border the North Sea there is need to extend the North Sea agreement, not just in regard to navigation in the North Sea but in respect of all other uses of the North Sea and the way it is regulated and controlled under that agreement, to include the Irish Sea. Alternatively, a similar agreement should be put in place by the contiguous <Col N="1572" /> nations to the Irish Sea for the management of its waters.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who contributed to this debate spoke about difficulties with regard to submarine traffic, which endangers fishing vessels and other vessels, and the increased dangers in our waters from the conveyance of plutonium. One of the most effective ways of addressing these problems is to establish an international agreement for the management of the Irish Sea, similar to the agreement put in place by the Baltic and other nations with regard to the North Sea &mdash; we are observers at North Sea Conference deliberations.  This is a development that we must advocate if we are to secure the environmental integrity and safety of the Irish Sea for all its users.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I would ask the Minister of State, given that the previous system was an integral part of the US military and naval system, whether there are any residual military requirements of participants in the agreement.  The agreement brings home to us the strategic location of Ireland on the north-west coast of Europe, which is of particular importance.  I would ask the Minister whether there is any military agreement or understanding with the Irish nation as a result of this development.</P>
    <P>This is an important development in maritime safety.  In bringing into play this system, with all its advantages, as outlined by the Minister, there will be increased development of Ireland as a maritime nation.  I hope the Government will adopt the aggressive role necessary to protect our sea fisheries and develop our sea fishing industry and fleet generally. It is regrettable that we have not exploited to any serious degree the great natural resource that exists around our coast.  I hope that this development will in some way engender a realisation and an awareness in Government and abroad that we have a very valuable resource that could be developed to the benefit of everybody.  I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief comments on this agreement. On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I add my support to the agreement.  It is another example of international <Col N="1573" /> co-operation, which all of us welcome.  Any measure which ensures the safety of the lives of sea-faring people in our own and in foreign vessels which ply our waters, is to be commended. There have been, and perhaps always will be, horrifying maritime disasters involving loss of life.  Due to the tremendous power of the sea we will never be totally free of these disasters but we should do as much as is humanly possible to prevent them.  A system such as this will go some way towards making the sea safer.</P>
      <P>Not only should we ensure the safety of people but we should also be concerned about safety to the environment and to our wildlife, which has been seriously damaged in the last few years, particularly by oil spillages from the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> and, in more recent times the <i>Exxon Valdez.</i> We have a duty to further generations to protect our sea environment. We also have a duty to care for animals so that they can live their lives and procreate in a natural way.  They are of inestimable benefit to us because without the animal kingdom man would be a devalued person, at least in spirit.</P>

This system &mdash; indeed any of the systems such as Decca or the GPS &mdash; are very much intertwined with the safety of lives at sea.  Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan referred to Slánú and the search and rescue agencies. The Irish Marine Emergency Service was set up in 1991 following the recommendations in the review of the air-sea rescue services.  Those involved in the west coast search and rescue committee played an important role in this. The IMES are responsible for the operational aspects of all types of marine emergency, including search and rescue, sea and coastal pollution, shipwrecks and <Col N="1574" /> responses to casualties.  At present work is under way on the establishment of a new IMES communications centre for the Department's headquarters in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the various agencies and I should also like to pay tribute to those involved in search and rescue, particularly the coast, cliff and rescue service, the RNLI, the MRCC in Shannon and the coast radio stations.  I should also like to pay tribute to the crews of the Dauphin, which is based at Finner and the Sikorski helicopter, which is based at Shannon.  It is important to note that the Sikorski has recently flown its 186th mission.  This service was introduced in July 1991 and since then 120 lives have been saved; in 1991 a further 139 rescue missions were undertaken by the Air Corps and by rescue services based at Finner and Baldonnel, resulting in 54 lives being saved.  The services of the coast radio station at Valentia, Malin Head, the marine rescue co-ordination centre at Shannon and volunteer groups to which I referred are now integrated in the IMES.</P>
    <P>Before I answer specific questions I should like to refer to the GMDSS, the IMO's global maritime distress and safety system which has come into force in Ireland for cargo ships of 300 tonnes or more and indeed for pasenger ships.  The GMDSS will be introduced on a phased basis between now and 1993 and ships will be required to carry specialised radio communications equipment, depending on the area in which they operate.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Deasy's contribution, two negatives do not make a positive and I will not have an opportunity to refer to his various points in relation to the industry because I do not have time and it would also be out of order.  However, I congratulate Deputy Deasy on his appointment as spokesman for the Marine.  From the years I spent in Dunmore East, prior to my election to the Dáil, I know of his deep concern and interest and I wish him well.  He asked me to outline the advantages and deficiencies of the three systems.  Very briefly, the GPS is a military system controlled by the US Department of Defense, and is subject to interruption.  We cannot accept <Col N="1575" /> this; in fact it was switched off at very short notice between 22-24 November and from 29 November to 1 December 1991.  Of course this system is available to all who have receivers and it is used by many but we are not happy because it is a military system.  We are a neutral country and it could have implications for our neutrality.  There are no side effects in relation to the LORAN C system, it is a civil system and has a much longer range without any interruptions. It is more suited to our country than the Decca system.</P>
    <P>A number of the Deputies referred to the activities of submarines.  A resolution was adopted at the IMO in relation to this; there was a reference to the Irish Sea but in any area where there is a lot of fishing or shipping, submarines should travel on the surface.  The same applies to territorial water and we shall continue our efforts in the Department of the Marine, as a member of the IMO, to try to ensure that this will be done.  There have been too many incidents of this kind, particularly in the Irish Sea, and a number of our fishing vessels have suffered as a result.  If submarines travelled on the surface there would not be a difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan asked about the advantages of the Decca system.  It is a short range system and much more expensive than the LORAN C system. Even more important it gives poor coverage in various parts of the country, particularly in the south-west and south-east. He was interested in the UK and why they were not part of the LORAN C navigation system.  The United Kingdom took part in early negotiations on the establishment of the LORAN C system but they withdrew prior to completion of negotiations at a time when the contract with Decca became due for renewal. Under her new contract with Decca all stations, including one in my own area, Dunglow, County Donegal, will be automated; the remaining Irish stations have already been automated.  The contract will last until the year 2014 but there is also an opt-out clause which may be exercised by 1998.  In the meantime the UK authorities are keeping very closely <Col N="1576" /> in touch with developments within the LORAN C system in north-west Europe and the North Atlantic.  Of course it is also important to note that, while they are not party to this agreement or system, they will be in a position to get LORAN C to within 50 metres of accuracy.  We can state categorically that there will not be any operational problems as far as that is concerned.  There is a phase-in period of two years and we are quite certain that we will have the better system.  I have no doubt that the UK will be anxious to participate in this agreement sometime in the future.  It is interesting to note that Iceland were very deeply involved in negotiations.  Although they dropped out, they have now changed their position and are anxious to renegotiate with LORAN C.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan spoke about the cost and asked why Ireland should contribute 5 per cent when Holland would contribute only some 3 per cent.  Perhaps I did not make the position absolutely clear in my opening remarks.  I wish now to make it clear that the Netherlands will contribute 50 per cent of the cost of another station as well as 5 per cent of the cost of the Irish station, while 8 per cent of the cost of the Irish station will be contributed by Ireland.  I am not absolutely clear as to the reason the cost is quoted in punts.  I can only assume that the punt has been one of the strongest currencies in the western world and perhaps there is anxiety that we pay in Irish money rather than in sterling or American dollars.  That could be advantageous for the other countries.  That is a matter of detail, and I am afraid that I do not have good reasons to explain the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan also expressed fears in relation to the military aspect and possible side effects.  I can state categorically that there will be absolutely no side effects from our involvement with LORAN C.  I point out that an adequate period of some two years will be provided for the transition from Decca to LORAN C.</P>
    <P>I hope that I have answered the questions raised by Deputies.  Regrettably, the order of the House does not give me the opportunity to respond to several <Col N="1577" /> issues raised by Deputy Deasy, Deputy Blaney and Deputy O'Sullivan.  That is not to say that I have not recognised all of the issues raised as being extremely serious.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the total allowable catch, which is a vitally important issue.  I am well aware of the difficulties faced by our fishermen.  Both myself and the Minister shall continue to represent the interests of the Irish fisherman at Council level.  The 1983 Common Fisheries Policy is being reviewed in 1993. Discussions are taking place between now and the end of the year.  We have an opportunity to try to obtain a better deal for our fishermen.  In the seventies and the early eighties our industry was not as well developed as it is now and we started from a very low, narrow base.  It is my hope that the Commission and our colleagues within the Council will recognise this fact and reverse the position.  I thank Deputies for their reference to the Minister's initiative in taking the matter to the European Court.  It was important that the Minister did that.  We cannot allow ourselves to be constrained by our tonnage. We want to develop our industry in order to ensure that our young people, many of whom are unemployed, have an opportunity to make a livelihood in the industry.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for your forbearance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for being given the opportunity to raise this matter in the House tonight on the Adjournment debate.  The national school in Ballynacally, County Clare, has for some years suffered the difficulties it is still experiencing.  In 1963 the school was a two-roomed school and was built with accommodation and toilet facilities for 64 children.  In 1975 two smaller schools were closed and amalgamation meant that enrolment in Ballynacally school increased to 100 children.  In 1976 plans were drawn up for better facilities <Col N="1578" /> for that school to accommodate greater numbers of students.  However, there have been no great improvements since then.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to put on the record that at present in Ballynacally school 138 children are being accommodated in two permanent schools and two prefabricated rooms.  One of the prefabricated rooms is 17 years old and is rapidly deteriorating.  The other prefabricated room is nine and a half years old.  The toilet and washing facilities at the school are the same as they were 29 years ago, provided to accommodate the initial number of 64 students.</P>
      <P>I understand that the environmental health officer has visited the school and has given his report to the Department and, I am sure, to the Mid-Western Health Board.  It would be very useful if the Minister himself could examine the position in Ballynacally.  I have been in contact with the Minister and with the Department of Education on this matter since 1989.  It is felt that the problems experienced are ones that have had to be endured by the teachers and the pupils for much too long now.  There should be an immediate improvement.  We are not asking for anything that is not justified.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the main school building.  In one room conditions are particularly bad.  The present teacher of that classroom is Mrs. O'Dea.  The room itself is 77 square feet and has only one window, approximately three square feet.  Lighting conditions are completely inadequate.  That room is severely overcrowded when in use, and I am assured the room is constantly in use as a remedial facility for the school.</P>
      <P>I mentioned toilet facilities earlier. Because of the inadequacy of the toilet facilities there has had to be a ridiculous development.  The school authorities have had no choice but to stagger the morning break in order to avoid queues at both the boys' and girls' toilets.  As one can imagine, those staggered breaks inevitably lead to further difficulties in relation to crowd control, punctuality, noise disturbance and all of the other problems that would pertain to such movement around the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the teachers' room <Col N="1579" /> would qualify for that description.  At the moment such classification would be a gross exaggeration because the teachers do not have the facilities which they should have.  The space that could be referred to as the teachers' room is used for the storage of many school materials, which means that there is very little space for the teachers and very little opportunity for them to have their break in peace and quiet.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the prefabricated buildings, one of which is more than 17 years old and the other is more than nine years old.  The prefabricated buildings are causing a great deal of anxiety and concern not only to the teachers and pupils of the school but also to parents.  It is felt that the structure, and particularly the room occupied by the principal of the school, Mr. McCarthy, is a matter of concern, especially in bad winter weather.  This matter has to be examined and resolved immediately.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the Department of Education on 29 May 1992, stating that the question of writing tenders at that stage was being considered.  I ask the Minister today to ensure that moneys are provided in the 1993 Estimates to fulfil the promise made in 1989 of sanction for the erection of two new classrooms, a staff room and a library medical room.  Considering the inconvenience and hassle which teachers, pupils and parents have put up with for some time and their patience in this regard and after 16 years of non-action in regard to this school, the money should be allocated immediately.  Surely that is not an unreasonable request.  I look to the Minister to make that commitment today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy de Valera for raising this issue and apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Aylward.  I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to this House the Department's intentions in relation to the proposed extension to Ballynacally national school <Col N="1580" /> which has a staff of five and a current enrolment of 139.  First, I would like to say that I accept that conditions in the school are less than satisfactory and that the Minister of State and his Department officials accept as valid the case being made by the Deputy on behalf of the staff and pupils.  The Minister of State is glad to be able to inform the Deputy that planning permission has been received and tender documents to enable tenders to be invited for the project have been prepared.  He has in fact approved the following works for the school: a permanent extension of two classrooms with <i>en suite</i> toilets; a staffroom and a library/medical room.</P>
      <P>The question of going to tender now arises.  The Deputy may be aware that discussions with the Department of Finance in regard to next year's budget is ongoing at present and the allocation of funds for the primary buildings capital programme for next year will not be known for some time.  Bearing in mind that there are a number of school projects at a similar stage to the Ballynacally project and that there are a number of school boards of management vying for the limited amount of resources which will be available next year and that each school board of management makes the case that their own school is deserving of special consideration the onus falls on me to ensure that each case receives due consideration.  In the circumstances I can assure the Deputy that every consideration will be given to allowing the Ballynacally project go to tender next year if at all possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to the present shortage of toilet facilities in the school, the Department were prepared to provide a new girls toilet for the school before a contract for the extension was placed.  However, this was not deemed urgent by the school board of management as they intimated that they would prefer to wait for the new replacement classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State accepts the urgency of the case and he fully appreciates the concerns of the chairman of the board of management, the teachers and the parents at Ballynacally.  He will communicate with the school authorities in this matter as early as possible and he will <Col N="1581" /> advise the Deputy of any developments regarding Ballynacally national school. It is his intention to provide two new classrooms and upgraded facilities as soon as the capital budget allows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was expecting to be asked to share my time with another Member and if he arrives perhaps the Chair will agree to that.</P>
      <P>In 1987 the Irish people ratified the Single European Act.  This set the scene for the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.  Customs clearance agents will be casualties of this great structural change.  These agents are now and have been an integral part of the business of clearing goods through Customs. They are private firms who have used their initiative to provide an important service to exporters and importers. From 1 January 1993 this service will no longer be required.  Customs clearance agents will be put out of business on that date.  They do not wish to be put out of business but it will disappear and they will be required no longer.  They will have no means of earning a living after 1 January and their livelihoods will be destroyed.  The business in which they have been engaged will not offer them any sustenance at that stage.</P>
      <P>I understand that the INTERREG II programme makes certain provisions for assisting people whose lives are disrupted by the introduction of the Single Market. There are provisions for giving assistance to Customs officers who work for the State.  I imagine there are provisions also for assisting employees of private operators, the Customs clearance agents.  I understand the Government propose a form of retraining which is of no use whatever to the Customs clearance agents.  They do not wish to be retrained, they have had their training in business. They are business people and have been acting as such for many years.  Most of them want the opportunity to get into business again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Government, who know this has been coming for the past five years, to take action and assist <Col N="1582" /> these people in one form or another by compensating them for the loss of business. The loss of business has been brought about by the concerted action of the 12 member states.  I am sure that if the Irish Government wish to do so, the INTERREG II programme could be used to assist these private operators.</P>
    <P>I tabled questions on the matter in the Dáil last April seeking information on the INTERREG II programme and asked what the Government proposed to do for these people and their employees.  The responses I got at the time were such that I decided the Government had not paid any attention to this problem up to that time.  It is clear to me now that they have not thought about it.</P>
    <P>There is not a large number of these people along the Border corridor but the number is significant.  Even if only one person was forced out of his job, by outside agencies, that person should be compensated. I am asking the Government, at this late stage, to examine the position carefully and when they have all the facts before them to decide on a package which will adequately compensate these people for the loss of business.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take cognisance of this fact and will immediately ensure that the Government put a programme in place because 1 January is very close.  Obviously these people have to make plans for the future.  We cannot dump them on the road one morning and hope they will survive; we must ensure that they know in advance what will happen to them and what assistance they can get which will enable them to reorganise their businesses.  I look forward to the Minister's response and I hope he will have something sensible to say on this very serious problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance who regrets that he cannot be present in the House to reply to this matter.  I realise that the payment of compensation is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Single Market is to improve the competitive edge of Europe in international markets.  The free circulation of goods and people in the Community will help to achieve this <Col N="1583" /> objective by reducing the time and costs involved in transporting goods between the member states.  However, the removal of customs barriers and formalities as part of the measures to improve the free circulation of goods from 31 December 1992 will affect certain areas of employment such as customs clearance in intra-Community trade. With 1993 on the horizon a number of firms have already started to diversify.</P>
    <P>While there are no specific arrangements in place to compensate customs clearance agents directly for loss of earnings resulting from the internal market, there is broad range of training schemes operated by FÁS, as well as advice and grant support schemes from the industrial promotion agencies, which is available to individuals and firms wishing to diversify into other areas of business.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission has put forward proposals for assistance in this area both through the existing Structural Funds and through further <i>ad hoc</i> measures.  These proposals concentrate on retraining and assistance for developing new businesses and for local development initiatives. There are no proposals at EC level for compensatory grants or income supplements.</P>
    <P>The Commission takes the line that it is primarily up to the sector itself and the member states to take the necessary social and economic measures.  However, in the light of a study carried out in all 12 member states, the Commission has decided that back-up measures are required at Community level.  These back-up measures come under three headings: measures under the European Social Fund, measures under INTERREG and measures outside the Structural Funds, which are the subject of a regulation now before Council.</P>
    <P>The operations eligible for ESF support relate to training and job creation. As far as INTERREG is concerned, the Commission has identified four specific areas: restructuring of the companies concerned, retraining and reorganisation of staff, adaptation of goods-handling sites at frontiers and the creation of replacement jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above measures, the <Col N="1584" /> Commission has included a one-off budget heading of ECU 30 million in the draft Community budget for 1993.  These resources are designed to provide assistance for the areas of the Community which are particularly dependent on customs clearance activity and to assist the companies most severely affected to maintain employment through diversification. The measures to assist these companies will include assistance in planning and restructuring, market research and technology transfer, co-financing of conversion investment, diversification and restructuring.  A draft Council Regulation to implement these measures is now under discussion.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this that the support being made available from the EC through the Structural Funds and otherwise is directed at helping the companies concerned to diversify into new area and helping to retrain the employees affected to assist them in finding alternative employment.</P>
    <P>In early July 1992 FÁS contacted the representative organisation of customs agents and offered its services in the area of training.  At a meeting on 30 July 1992 in the Department of Finance, it was agreed that a representative of customs agents would liaise with FÁS, in relation to all training-retraining proposals.  To date progress has been slow and while work is continuing with some of the larger firms, no project has yet been finalised with FÁS.</P>
    <P>The four executive agencies which operate under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; the Industrial Development Authority, Shannon Development, EOLAS and An Bord Trachtála &mdash; provide a range of financial and other services to assist firms These services are fully available to the customs clearance agents.</P>
    <P>The IDA are the agency responsible for fostering the objective of regional industrial development, and their programmes for Irish industry operate throughout the country, except in those regions which come under the remit of Shannon Development or Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The IDA provide grant assistance to firms in the manufacturing and international services sectors which <Col N="1585" /> have specific projects which will increase employment or expand output.  The authority also provide advisory services to firms especially in the area of assessing the feasibility of a project.  Shannon Development operate a similar range of services for Irish firms located in the midwest region.</P>
    <P>EOLAS, the Irish Science and Technology Agency, assist firms to develop, apply and promote science and technology. They provide technical and consultancy services directly to Irish industry with the aim of raising the level of technological competence and competitiveness in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>An Bord Trachtála are the agency responsible for the promotion and development of exports.  The full range of advice, services and incentives provided by ABT are available to companies involved in customs clearance which wish to diversify into other relevant trading activities.</P>
    <P>The agencies will assist in every way possible custom clearance agents who wish to establish projects in the manufacturing and international traded services areas.  The IDA are currently advising and assisting a number of such companies by way of feasibility grants. ABT are also involved where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that Ireland has made and continues to make every effort to ensure that the proposed EC funding is geared to Irish needs and that the State agencies will provide whatever assistance is feasible through their existing training and industrial promotion schemes.</P>
    <P>A number of customs agents' representative bodies and individual nonaffiliated members have met officials of my Department and other Departments and agencies primarily involved on a number of occasions to discuss the proposed EC funding and the assistance which can be provided through existing national schemes.  It is envisaged that further such meetings will take place.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Minister for Health is present in the House to respond to what I would term a simple request.  The parents of mentally handicapped children in Clonmel are angry and totally disillusioned at the closure of the integrated pre-school which is run by the local Mental Handicap Association.  This is due entirely to the inability of the South Eastern Health Board to provide adequate funding to keep the pre-school open.</P>
      <P>This school has been in operation for the past ten years.  However, due to the shortage of a mere £6,500, the sum necessary to pay its running cost for a full year, this school has been forced to close.  The school caters for handicapped children in Clonmel, those who for various reasons are unable to attend the day care centre in Cashel some 15 miles away.  Some children are either too young or, sadly, too ill to make that journey.  The cost of running the school had increased from £2,000 to £6,000 due to the fact that the teacher who was in charge of the school and who was willing to take minimum wages has, unfortunately, left her position. It is now necessary to employ personnel who must be paid the standard wage.  To date, the local Mental Handicap Association have provided £1,000 and the South Eastern Health Board have given a grant of £1,000.  If the school is to reopen the Department of Health must provide a grant of £5,000 towards the running costs of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a disgrace that there is no pre-school in Clonmel for children with special needs.  Without such facility children born with disabilities are being denied the opportunities to progress.  The cost involved in keeping the school open is not high and would represent money well spent.  I can guarantee the Minister that no audit will be necessary to ensure that the money is well spent.  The services for the mentally handicapped cannot and must not continue to be run on a shoestring. The pre-school can only be reopened when and if the necessary finance is made available by the Minister's Department.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider my request.  I have a <Col N="1587" /> report on one of the victims affected by the closure of this pre-school who, unfortunately, is too ill to make the journey to Cashel.  The Department of Health would be making a kind gesture if they provided the £6,500 necessary to reopen the school.  I can guarantee the Minister that a decision of that nature would be greatly welcomed not only by me and the people involved in the school but by all the people of South Tipperary who want to see the best facilities provided for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I can say without hesitation that the Clonmel Mental Handicap Association are the most successful in the country. The services, facilities and resources had been provided for children in South Tipperary because of the fantastic success of the fund-raising of that association and the enormous amount of co-operation and hard work on the part of voluntary workers on that committee.  Regrettably, they cannot see their resources going into providing the wages of personnel to reopen this school, and it is for that reason alone we make this appeal to the Minister for Health.  If it were within our resources in South Tipperary certainly we would do so, but because there are so many other demands on the mentally handicapped association, they consider it necessary to make those a priority.  We call on the Minister to resolve this problem for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform Deputy Ahearn that the pre-school referred to was for children both with and without disabilities which was supported by both the County Tipperary Association and the South Eastern Health Board.  The service was run on a 5-day-week basis between 9.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. and catered for six children, two of whom had disabilities.  The teacher who was providing the service could not continue and an alternative teacher was sought.  However, it emerged that the cost of employing a new person was going to be considerably more.  Previously the service was costing £2,200 approximately per annum &mdash; as Deputy Ahearn said &mdash; to which the South Eastern Health Board contributed a grant of £1,000.  The proposed <Col N="1588" /> service had an estimated cost of £6,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The County Tipperary Association could not fund the extra cost of the service. The health board did not have the funds available other than the funding made available for the development of new service in 1992.  There was no further consultation with the health board about the closure of the pre-school.  I understand that the health board are meeting with the County Tipperary Association on Friday next to discuss their funding for services.</P>
      <P>I should say that the two children with disabilities have been successfully placed in other pre-school according to the information available in my Department.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the improvement of sevices for people with mental handicap is one of my main priorities.  The Government have made available an additional £5 million revenue and £1 million capital this year for the development of those services.  The South Eastern Health Board region have received the second largest allocation &mdash; after the Eastern region &mdash; in view of the special needs obtaining there which were made very clear to me and which prompted my increasing the amount being made available to the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware all new developments in the mental handicap services are agreed and implemented in line with the priorities identified by each regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee.  The additional services being provided this year in the South Eastern region have been agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee, on which the County Tipperary Association are represented, and approved by my Department.</P>

    <P>The following services in South Tipperary have been agreed and are in the process of being put in place by the health board and voluntary organisations &mdash; six workshop places and up to five residential places by the Tipperary Community Workshop; eight activation <Col N="1589" /> places and eight residential places by the County Tipperary Association; eight residential places and one respite place by Camphill Communities.  Grangemockler; increased services in the Cashel Day Care Centre.  In addition the Camphill Communities will provide four residential places and three emergency places spread over their services in the South-Eastern region.  The board also propose to increase their own paramedical staff to provide a more comprehensive service to pre-schools, day-care centres, residential centres, from which the overall services within the region should benefit.</P>
    <P>I must point out to the Deputy that all of the additional funds available this year have been allocated.  Further developments will depend on the funds made available to me in 1993 and future years for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I hope the forthcoming discussions to which I referred will be successful.  In view of what the Deputy has said, I will take another look at it.  She can be assured that the recommendations of the report on disabilities will be implemented by Government over the seven-year period.  What the Deputy has said is perfectly true, that it should receive top priority and be of great concern to Government.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two-minute statement by Deputy Cotter on a matter appropriate to the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss the matter of apprenticeship training with the Minister for Labour this afternoon.  I am aware that there is a new apprenticeship programme on the way which I think is due to be put in place some time next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position today, and has been for some time past, is that school-leavers wishing to become apprentices are experiencing great difficulty finding appropriate places, which has been the case for the past five years.  I have intimate knowledge of this because, before being elected to this House in 1989, I <Col N="1590" /> worked in a secondary school.  I have maintained constant contact with school-leavers anxious to become apprentices and assisted them in finding places, indeed shared their frustrations when they were unable to do so.  In the years prior to 1989, as time progressed, I found my frustration and theirs was becoming more acute.</P>
    <P>There had been a great tradition associated with this apprenticeship scheme nationwide, which was very effectively supported by FÁS and from which a stream of qualified people, with all the requisite skills, emerged over the years.  Approximately five years ago this stream began to dry up.  Today, as a result, we have a very dangerous skills deficit in our economy.  I hear this from people and my experience bears this out.</P>
    <P>The reasons for that deficit were, first, the downturn in the building industry and, second, difficulties experienced with company profits when everybody was seeking to save a shilling here and there. Of course, whenever an employer took on an apprentice he had to pay the FÁS levy along with paying the apprentice concerned during the period he or she was away, perhaps for a year, off the job, for the 15 or 16 weeks or whatever training period.  Companies and individuals could not afford that expenditure and the whole scheme became clogged up.</P>
    <P>I know there is a new scheme in the offing, and I would ask the Minister to assess carefully whether companies will respond to this new scheme which no doubt will comprise multi-skills and so on.  But I predict that, unless companies are willing to become involved and spend a few shillings of their own in order to make the scheme operable, we shall encounter a woeful problem in the future, with that skills deficit about which I have spoken becoming more acute.  Indeed we might even have a continuation of the type of circumstances and experiences about which I am hearing at present.  For example, I know parents who have actually paid the FÁS levy for employers to encourage them to take on a school-leaver.  I know also that in many cases their sons and daughters taking up such places agreed to work without wages.  I should hate that <Col N="1591" /> type of practice to continue in the future because it is most unfair and inequitable. I draw that to the Minister's attention this afternoon so that, when he is putting the final touches to his new apprenticeship scheme, he will take these matters into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the recruitment of apprentices rests with employers.  But FÁS encourage employers to take on the maximum possible number of apprentices each year to ensure that sufficient skilled people are available in future years.  In the past FÁS have followed a practice of sponsoring a number of apprentices to meet any anticipated shortfall due to unexpected increased demand for skilled persons from existing or new employers.</P>
      <P>FÁS have responsibility, under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and the Labour Services Act, 1987, for the regulation of apprenticeship in the sectors of industry which have been designated by FÁS under the 1967 Act.</P>
      <P>A new apprenticeship system will be introduced in 1993 following extensive consultations based on a FÁS discussion document published at the end of 1989. The document proposed the introduction of a single standards-based system leading to craft worker status which would allow for internationally recognised certification based on uniform industry agreed standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outline of the new system was agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Funding arrangements for the new system have also now been agreed by the social partners under the auspices of the Central Review Committee. The necessary legislation is being prepared to arrange for the collection of the employer contribution which will part <Col N="1592" /> finance the cost of apprenticeship in future years.</P>
    <P>The board of FÁS have established a National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee &mdash; NAAC &mdash; to advise the board on the implementation of the new apprenticeship system in accordance with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The committee is representative of FÁS board members, the social partners, an educational representative and FÁS staff.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made on the development of the new system. Agreement has been reached on a curriculum and assessment model.  A survey has been completed on the training requirements for 25 trades and subject matter experts have been contracted to develop curricula.  Mechanisms for the recruitment of disabled persons and other disadvantaged groups, including women, are being considered.  It is planned that two pilot schemes for bricklaying and motor mechanics will commence in November 1992.  The two pilot schemes will be conducted using the new curricula material developed by the teams of subject matter experts.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the recruitment of an additional 1,000 apprentices to the currently designated trades, bringing the number to around 3,500.  In addition, FÁS are currently exploring how the new system might be extended to occupations outside the currently designated apprenticeships. The National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee have agreed criteria for the designation of further trades or occupations. Initial research is now being undertaken.  This would have the effect of considerably increasing apprenticeship opportunities for young people.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 16 October 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me the opportuity to outline, in a general way, the measures I have been taking with a view to improving, where possible, the effectiveness of the day-to-day workings of the Aliens Division of the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust that it will not come as a surprise to the Deputy when I say that, in common with Deputies on all sides of the House, I have been concerned for some time about the public impression of the general operation of our system of immigration <Col N="1503" /> and visa controls.  My concern arose initially from my experience as a Deputy, and before I took on my current responsibilities as Minister for Justice, but it is an area in which I have taken a personal interest since my appointment with a view to some changes taking place.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, I called a meeting of the staff of the Aliens Division of my Department in order to convey my concern, and the concern of Deputies from all sides who have approached me in this matter, and to see what could be done to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  The meeting was attended by all levels of staff in the Division, including senior officials with responsibility in this area.  I think it would be fair to say that the meeting was an educational one for all concerned but I took the opportunity to make it clear that I thought that something needed to be done and that changes needed to be made.</P>
    <P>Arising from that meeting, a number of areas were identified where it was considered that, on the face of it, a detailed examination could lead to improvements. In general, they covererd the broad scope of the work of the Aliens Division but the primary areas where it was felt that benefits could accrue from a thorough study were: (1) work procedures, including management control systems; (2) training, including training for departmental staff and immigration officers as well as for the Garda Síochána in general; and (3) liaison arrangements between my Department and the Garda authorities with regard to immigration controls generally.</P>
    <P>I have asked that recommendations in these areas be submitted to me as soon as possible and I intend to have another meeting with the staff in this area shortly to assess progress.</P>
    <P>I have asked, also, that the possibility of computerisation of procedures be specially examined.  This is a somewhat specialised area with considerable resource implications and it may turn out to require a more detailed or professional examination.  It will certainly be a more long term study than the initial examination <Col N="1504" /> of the other areas I have mentioned but it is an area with possibilities and the preliminary study will form a basis for further work in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Deputy will be satisfied that I have gone some way in putting the wheels in motion.  Before I finish, I want to emphasise that the fact that I am of the view that improvements can be made in no way reflects on the professionalism or abilities of the staff of my Department who work in this area.  As I say, I have discussed this whole area with those who are involved in the day-to-day operation of immigration and visa controls and they have impressed me as dedicated and talented people who are operating a system of essential controls in difficult circumstances with end results which, inevitably, do not please everyone.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear, in fairness to the staff, that there is a large volume of work to be dealt with in the Division. Visa applications are running at about 350 a week, applications per annum for naturalisation have almost doubled in the past three years while, in the past four or five years or so, the volume of EC-related work in the immigration field has grown out of all recognition.  For example, this year alone to date nearly 100 meetings on immigration matters have had to be serviced at a Community level by staff from the Aliens Division.</P>
    <P>Coping with the volume of work has been a substantial achievement in itself. That is not to say that improvements in procedures and systems cannot be made which would enhance the service provided by the Division.  My own philosophy is that all areas of work can benefit if the time is taken to stand back a little to examine the basic work procedures and management systems.  We can all learn to our advantage from some quiet reflection.</P>
    <P>It would be misleading of me if I were to leave the House under the misapprehension that a review of the working operations of the Aliens Division of my Department could be expected to lead to significant changes in the Government's policy on aliens controls.  Our policy will still remain the same, to <Col N="1505" /> encourage tourism and travel for business and educational purposes.  However vigilance against illegal immigration, particularly by those who would wish to use Ireland as an easy back-door to other European destinations, will continue to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given careful consideration to the question of mandatory sentences for persons convicted of rape and have concluded that it would not be advisable to provide for mandatory sentences in such cases.</P>
      <P>The courts are not generally lenient with persons convicted of rape, the average sentence imposed being between 5 and 12 years imprisonment.  In more serious cases heavier sentences have been imposed including one of life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>There have been exceptional cases where the sentence imposed has caused public concern because it has been viewed as being excessively lenient.  I want to emphasise that what I am speaking of here is a public perception and nothing that I am saying in this reply is intended to comment on or indicate any opinion in relation to any individual case. I believe that the way this issue should be addressed is not to introduce mandatory sentencing but rather to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to apply for review or appeal of a sentence which appears to him to have been unduly lenient. The Criminal Justice Bill, 1992 which I recently presented to the Dáil sets out a legislative structure providing for such review.  Incidentally, I have discussed this matter with relevant interest groups including the Council for the Status of Women and the Rape Crisis Centre and they agree with my approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of parole, I have powers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 to grant temporary release in individual circumstances.  Persons committed to prison are reviewed regularly either by my Department or by the Sentence Review Group.  Cases are reviewed by reference to well established criteria including assessment of whether a release would constitute a threat to the community <Col N="1507" /> and whether it would be reasonable to grant release at a particular stage in view of the crime committed, the offender's criminal record and any compassionate grounds which warrant special consideration.  These criteria accord fully with international practice.</P>
    <P>The final decision to release in all cases rests with me and before deciding on any release my main concern is to ensure as far as practicable that the release of any prisoner will not constitute a threat to the community.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in parts 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the question, in so far as it is available, is set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  It should be noted that figures in relation to the strength at the Garda College, Garda Headquarters and specialised areas in the Dublin Metropolitan Area are not included in the tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to part 3 of the question I <Col N="1508" /> have consulted with the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána on the desirability of supplying on a countrywide basis the specific information on individual Garda stations which the Deputy has sought. The Commissioner is opposed to such information being made available on the grounds of security and crime prevention generally.  I am in agreement with the Commissioner on this matter and I propose therefore to circulate instead a table giving the information requested by the Deputy on a Divisional basis.  I trust the Deputy will appreciate the reasons for my dealing with this question in this manner.</P>
    <P>As regards part 6 of the question the detailed allocation of Garda manpower is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I would, however, like to point out that the size and population of an area are but two of a number of factors to be taken into account in assessing the police needs of any particular area.  Any attempt to compare levels of service in different areas would also need to take account of other matters including the overall resources available to an area, such as support staff, transport and other facilities, as well as the incidence of crime in that area and any special policing needs or problems that exist there.</P>
    <P>It would be seriously misleading to regard the ratio of gardaí to population in any area as an accurate measure of the level of Garda service provided for that area.  The overall deployment of Garda resources is kept under regular review by the Garda authorities and adjustments are made as necesary in the light of changing needs and circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to bringing all Garda accommodation up to a proper standard.  Over £35 million has been spent over the last seven years on the Garda Building Programme.  To date in 1992 five new stations have been provided &mdash; a Divisional Headquarters station at Dún Laoghaire, 2 District <Col N="1533" /> Headquarters stations at Kells and Tipperary and 2 smaller stations at Charleville, and Monasterevin &mdash; new station accommodation has been provided at Rathkeale and Dunboyne through the refurbishment of existing premises and major refurbishment was carried out to Carrick-on-Suir station.</P>
      <P>In addition, substantial resources have been directed towards the maintenance of Garda stations.  For example, £2.3 million was spent in this way in 1991 and more than £2 million will be spent this year.  Although this programme of expenditure has seen most of the worst black spots dealt with, there remain areas which require attention.  I recently initiated a review of the Garda Building Programme to assess Garda accommodation needs, having regard to changing Garda requirements and to make recommendations as to how these should be met on the most cost effective basis. The review will help pinpoint the objectives we must set ourselves in relation to Garda accommodation for the years ahead.  It is not possible at this stage to list and detail the specific projects which will be carried out, but the maximum amount of work will be done in the light of overall priorities and available resources.</P>

When the scheme was being introduced the Government of the day decided, on grounds of policy, that some of the Committee's recommendations should be excluded from the scheme.  That is the prerogative of Government.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that any citizen of this country is denied an effective right of access to the courts because of insufficient means.  Also, I would deplore a situation, if it ever arose, where a person who satisfied the test of financial eligibility and otherwise met the criteria for grant of legal services as set out in Part 3 of the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice, was denied such legal services. There are, of course, delays.  I am fully aware of the view that the scheme will require further development so that the waiting period which applies in some cases can be shortened.</P>
    <P>The opening of the three new Law <Col N="1536" /> Centres in December last at Dundalk, Letterkenny and Castlebar and the reorganisation of the Board's services in Dublin, leading to the replacement later this year of the Aston's Place Law Centre with a Law Centre in Clondalkin and another at Finglas, are a step in the right direction.  In the context of the 1993 Estimates, I am examining proposals from the Legal Aid Board for a further increase in the number of solicitors and in the number of Law Centres.  However, as has been said so often before by myself and by my predecessor, decisions involving additional expenditure must have regard to the availability of financial resources and the overall situation with regard to public finances.  This remains the situation.  In addition, the Board is continually seeking ways of improving the level of service to clients which would not have cost implications.  In addition the Government proposes to introduce legislation to place the scheme on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Waiting periods for applicants for Legal Aid and the number of staff employed at each Centre.</P>
    <P>The length of time it takes for a client to secure an initial appointment with a Legal Aid Board Solicitor and the number of staff employed at each Law Centre are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>In so far as insurance and motor tax evasion are concerned, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the most recent survey carried out by them showed that evasion levels had fallen since the last survey in 1987.  This fall in the level of evasion is, to a large extent, due to the intensive campaign of road traffic law enforcement carried out by the Garda in recent years.  There is, however, no room for complacency and I can assure the House that there will be no let-up in the Garda anti-evasion drive.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a number of anonymous letters have been circulated in recent months to schools in the Dublin area and to parents which warn of the availability and danger of drug-laced tattoos and transfers.  I have of course always stressed that the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for young people is as important as the Garda response in solving the problem of drug abuse and I believe that they should therefore be fully informed on the dangers of drug abuse.  I would not, however, condone a situation where parents and others responsible for the care of children were being unduly frightened by unsubstantiated claims about the availability of these drugs.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that no evidence has been found to suggest that transfers such as those referred to by the Deputy are being given to schoolchildren or other young people in this country.  I would however ask the Deputy or anyone who might have evidence that this type of drug is available in this country to bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda Síochána so that the matter can receive the fullest investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that I am very concerned <Col N="1539" /> about the growing drug problem, including the danger of development of drug products specifically geared towards the young and vulnerable.  In this respect I recently held a conference with senior gardaí on the drugs problem and I have given my full backing to the use of all the resources necessary to combat the scourge of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are of course alert to the dangers of drug products being developed particularly to appeal to young people and their strategy for dealing with this problem involves a strong emphasis on measures directed at activities and locations where young people may be exposed to illegal drug dealing.  These measures include in particular intelligence-gathering and surveillance, as well as targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects.  The Garda authorities also avail of the Garda Schools Programme in appropriate circumstances to warn young people of the danger of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also taking all appropriate measures, in co-operation with the Customs authorities, to prevent the importation here of all illegal drugs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the drugs problem is being kept under continuing review and that no effort will be spared to tackle it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 40 together.  The distribution of court business and the listing of cases is a matter for the judge or judges in each individual circuit.  The county registrar can list cases only on the direction of the circuit judge.</P>
      <P>Section 32 of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, requires that Circuit Family Law Court hearings shall be held in a different place or at different times or on different days from those on which the ordinary sitting of the circuit court are held.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that county registrars, on the direction of the judges, are complying with this generally by setting aside specific days each term for the hearing of family law cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1543" /> There are a few exceptions to this where the volume of family business is small and where separate sittings are not warranted and in these cases a separate time is allocated.</P>
    <P>The question of whether sufficient time is set aside is a matter for the judge.  It is my understanding, however, that where there are backlogs of cases this is caused, mainly, by the high number of adjournments granted to allow negotiations between the parties.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the volume of family law cases being dealt with by the Circuit Court particularly since the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which effectively moved a majority of cases dealing with marital breakdown to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The subject of family courts is at present being examined by the Law Reform Commission and the Government propose to consider that subject further when the commission's report has been received.  In the meanwhile I am keeping the situation under review and I will be asking the Circuit Court rules committee to consider procedures which would expedite family law cases in the Circuit Court.</P>

However, a Serbo-Croat who had been living in Belgrade did arrive in Dublin from Paris in late August and sought political asylum.  In accordance with the international principle of claiming asylum in the first safe host country, he was returned to France and sought asylum there.  However, shortly afterwards it became known that he did have some tenuous links with this country and accordingly, through our Embassy in Paris, contact was renewed and he was given permission to enter the country.</P>
      <P>He has sought political asylum here and his application is being considered in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted on prison officers, which was introduced in 1990 and made retrospective to cover injuries sustained from 1 April 1986, members of the Prison Service may claim compensation for pain and suffering arising from injuries criminally inflicted.  The extent to which they can obtain that compensation is a matter for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to members of an Garda Síochána, the Garda Síochána (Compenstion) Acts, 1941 and 1945, which apply to members of the Force only, provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that members of an Garda Síochána who suffer injury, maliciously inflicted on them in the course of or in relation to the performance by them of <Col N="1545" /> their duties as members of An Garda Síochána, may apply, with the authorisation of the Minister for Justice, to the High Court for compensation.</P>
    <P>The High Court, in assessing compensation, shall have regard to the pain and suffering occasioned by the injuries to the applicant.  Compensation for pain and suffering is not available under the general scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.</P>

      <P>Section 98 of the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, makes it an offence for any person to intercept telecommunications messages.  There are certain exceptions to that provision, one of which is when the interception is done in pursuance of a direction issued by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications under section 110 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under administrative procedures at present in operation the Minister for Communications only gives a direction requiring an interception where there is in force a corresponding authorisation by the Minister for Justice applying to the interception.  The request for an authorisation must be made by the Garda <Col N="1546" /> Commissioner or an army officer of a rank not below that of colonel and the only grounds on which an interception may be authorised are that it is required for the detection of serious crime or for security purposes, information as to which can be got in no other way.  The task of deciding whether a communication should be intercepted in accordance with those criteria has been regarded by every Government since the foundation of the State as essentially an executive function and I do not propose to change the position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Bill, 1992, at present before this House, places on a statutory basis the power of the Minister for Justice to authorise interceptions of communications and the procedures for such authorisation. In doing so it introduces two new provisions for oversight of the exercise of the Minister's powers in that respect.  First, the operation of the Act will be continually supervised by a judge of the High Court.  Second, a legally qualified referee will be appointed to investigate complaints of improper authorisation by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 49 together.  I am at present in the process of improving medical care facilities.  The following is a brief outline of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Doctors are appointed on a part-time basis to each prison and place of detention. They are responsible for the primary medical care of prisoners.  They are <Col N="1547" /> assisted by prison medical orderlies who provide round the clock cover in all closed prisons.  Where necessary prisoners attend outside hospitals for specialist in-patient and out-patient treatment.</P>
    <P>Psychiatric services are provided by visiting psychiatrists employed by the health boards.  In the case of Dublin institutions psychiatrists from the forensic service of the Eastern Health Board at the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum provide regular weekly assessment and treatment sessions.  Prisoners requiring in-patient psychiatric care may be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Director of Prison Medical Services, who was appointed in 1990 on the recommendation of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System (1985) (the Whitaker Committee), has reviewed the level of medical care being provided by doctors and psychiatrists having regard to present day needs.  On his advice I have authorised negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation, which represents prison doctors and psychiatrists, on revised contracts which would have the effect of enhancing the level of medical care.  I am also considering the employment of some qualified nurses for the prisons.</P>
    <P>My Department employ three psychologists for work in the prisons and steps are in train to recruit a further three psychologists in 1993.  My Department is also at present about to recruit a pharmacist to supervise the provision of prescribed medicines to persons in custody.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to mention that construction work on a special accommodation unit in Mountjoy Prison for prisoners suffering from a variety of medical conditions, including prisoners who are HIV positive, is almost complete and will be brought into operation in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, given the current level of medical care and the improvements in train, that the needs of prisoners are being addressed adequately.  I will, of course, be keeping the position under review.</P>

      <P>I believe that it is extremely important that I, as Minister for Justice, am in tune with how the public have been affected by and view the crime problem.  For this reason since coming into office I have adopted as far as possible an open door policy in terms of listening to and responding to the community's concern about and attitudes to crime.</P>
      <P>I have availed of various opportunities to involve myself in forums of public debate on crime-related issues.  In March of this year I appeared on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which was devoted to the crime problem, so that I could hear at first hand people's experiences of and attitudes to crime.  More recently I hosted a Safety for Women Conference which was held in Dublin Castle and at which there was a very wide representation of interested parties.  In addition, in the wake of the disturbing incidents of violence which occurred in O'Connell Street recently I visited the area in the company of the Assistant Commissioner for the Dublin Metropolitan Area in order to see the situation for myself.</P>
      <P>I am, therefore, very much aware of the public attitude to crime and while I appreciate that there may indeed be a value in more academically based and structured surveys, my priority at present is to use all available resources on more practical and effective measures to prevent and detect crime.  I will however keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The assumption underlying the question appears to be that the norm is for claims initiated by plaintiffs in the High Court to proceed to hearing, that there is a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; length of time which it takes for these claims to come to hearing and that it is within the power of the State to expedite progress of such cases between lodgment of claim and hearing.  The actual position is that only 10 per cent or less of such claims proceed to court hearing, the length of time between lodgment of claim and hearing in those cases which do proceed to hearing varies considerably and for the most part the progress of a High Court case, once lodged, rests with the parties and their legal representatives until they serve a notice of trial.</P>

I am satisfied that the measures taken by the Garda authorities have been effective in dealing with this problem as is evidenced by the fact that the combined figures for recorded larceny and unauthorised taking of motor vehicles in 1991 decreased by 5 per cent on the corresponding 1990 figure, bringing the level of such crime down by over 47 per cent on the level recorded in 1981 when the problem peaked.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are continuing to monitor this situation and will take whatever further measures may be appropriate to prevent and detect this type of crime.</P>

      <P>Regulation 7 of the European Communities (Merchandise and Road Transport) Regulations, 1977 was a special provision which enabled the grant to a family member of a Road Freight Certificate and Merchandise Licence in cases where the holder of same died, in order to ensure the continued operation of the business.</P>
      <P>This provision allowed the new holder to satisfy the three main requirements of financial standing, good repute and professional competence only during the remaining period of the licence.  Consequently, when the licence expired, any application for a new licence in these circumstances would require applicants to satisfy all three requirements.  This means that such applicants, apart from meeting the financial standing and good repute requirements, must also in their own right, meet the professional competence requirement, either by obtaining a Certificate of Competence themselves or by designating a holder of such a Certificate as their Transport Manager.</P>
      <P>The 1977 Regulations have been superseded by the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations 1991 and 1992.  These latter Regulations have similar provisions covering similar circumstances relating to the death or incapacity of a licence holder.</P>
