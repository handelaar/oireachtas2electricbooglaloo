    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas, the report of any enquiry or investigation which he orders to be conducted under this Act, or other enabling legislation.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>I wish to apologise on behalf of Deputy Gilmore who, unfortunately, has to attend the funeral of a very close friend. I am substituting for him.  During the debate on this Bill on Committee Stage the case was very strongly made by Deputy Gilmore, particularly in the light of the terrible tragedy as a result of the collision between the <i>Hasselwerder</i> and the <i>mv Kilkenny,</i> previous incidents of collisions in Dublin Bay and other horrendous incidents at sea that inquiries should be held.  However, the results are kept secret by the Government.  Everybody must be aware that because of the amount of trade and shipping engaged in, for example, in Dublin Port alone, and the history of accidents and death, we must make public reports produced by civil servants and results of inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment which simply calls on him to lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report of any inquiry or investigation which he orders under this Bill and other enabling legislation.  There is a great deal at stake, the whole question of public safety and the lives of fishermen and seamen.  The sad result of the most recent collision is that seamen lost their lives. We should be able to reassure the public, the shipping lines and passengers who travel on bigger and mightier liners that when an incident occurs and is duly investigated the findings will be made public.  I <Col N="536" /> cannot see any logical reason for keeping the reports secret.</P>
    <P>There have been many incidents in Dublin Port and although there have been inquiries and, presumably, reports, the incidents have continued.  One must ask if plans have been implemented as a result of the reports.  What are the causes of these incidents?  One would have expected that if an inquiry had been held into an incident in Dublin Port five or ten years ago the Department of the Marine and the port authorities would activate whatever plan was recommended to prevent a recurrence.  However, subsequent to reports on previous incidents there have been more incidents.  It is important that the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I commended Deputy Gilmore for tabling such an amendment and my party and I supported it.  As we pointed out then we felt it was a public accountability issue.</P>
      <P>I have always been impressed with the openness of the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, in his former ministeries and the reform he brought to them. Therefore, when this amendment was withdrawn to be considered on Report Stage we were hopeful that the Minister would accept it and that there would be a new and more open policy in his Department in regard to laying such reports before the House and having a full and open debate on them.  I know there is an urgency about this Bill and I will not go through the points we enumerated before.  When there is a public inquiry its report should be debated to reassure the public that, having learned from this, it will not happen again.  It is only by open debate that we can honour the work of the inquiry.  We also owe such a policy to everybody who is tragically affected by the accidents requiring inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully support the Minister's remarks in regard to confidentiality and perhaps certain technical legalities. However, apart from those matters, the <Col N="537" /> remainder of a report should be published and debated.  It would be very sinister if that was not the case.  I know the Minister is not interested in a cover-up and that his staff work hard to ensure that the Department of the Marine are seen as the protector and standard bearer for safety at sea and for amending rules and regulations to ensure that accidents the subject of these inquiries will not happen again.  Even in fairness to them, the matter should be looked at again and the Minister should indicate that in the near future &mdash; perhaps not under this Bill &mdash; he will be able to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last accident in Dublin Bay, not alone do we have to take into consideration the human side but also the whole threat to our environment as a result of pollution and cargoes being carried.  When areas like this are seen to have been mishandled and where there is a need for a tightening of regulations, not alone will the public be grateful, they will fully support what the Department of the Marine may have to do as a result of such inquiries.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that this matter is of great importance to the public, the accountability of this House and the future monitoring and learning from such inquiries; they take this amendment very seriously and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a traditional reluctance by the Department to publish any report of this nature.  If one looks at marine accidents and tragedies here there is a history of not making the reports of inquiries public.  One reason given was to save the relatives from further hurt.  However, the Ballycotton tragedy should be a turning point because the relatives in that case demanded &mdash; and eventually succeeded in winning &mdash; a public inquiry.  The Captain Kirwan report was confidential and confidentiality was pledged to the people who gave evidence at that inquiry. However, I felt that if there was loss of life &mdash; and in this case a number of lives were lost &mdash; there should be a reluctance on the part of a Minister or Department to say that confidentiality should be <Col N="538" /> recognised because when lives are lost there is an onus on the Minister and the Department to make sure all the facts are made public.  I ask the Minister for the Marine, who is new to the job, to break with the tradition which has existed in his Department for quite a while whereby the findings of inquiries are not divulged to the public.</P>
      <P>I supported Deputy Gilmore's amendment from the outset as I felt there was a need for it.  I believe the Department of the Marine are slightly different from most other Government Departments. There have been a number of tragedies at sea over the years and I believe fishermen's organisations are in favour of the findings of inquiries being divulged and a full report being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This would enable us to assess the information and hopefully prevent such accidents occurring in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Ballycotton tragedy.  I got the distinct impression from the relatives of the people who lost their lives in that tragedy that they wanted to know the facts.  In fact, on several occasions they implored the Minister to make the facts known to them.  There was secrecy, doubt and innuendo about this accident and a public inquiry had to be held before the truth was known.  I think this matter is before the Attorney General at present.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is necessary for the Minister to break with the tradition in his Department and make known the outcome of inquiries.  If there is a legal reason why he cannot make this information public then obviously he has to follow the advice of his legal people.  The Minister should say at this stage that he will make public the findings of any inquiry which costs the taxpayers money. I again ask the Minister to look favourably at this amendment which is necessary and timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one intervention on this Bill in support of amendment No. 1.  I have to say that I am deeply concerned about the procedures which <Col N="539" /> apply in relation to transport related accidents and inquiries.  These include aviation matters, shipping matters, rail transport and road transport.</P>
      <P>The first thing we have to establish is that in many cases Departments of State &mdash; in the case of shipping it is the Department of the Marine &mdash; have a vested interest in the role of the rescue services and the way they perform, the infra-structural facilities, terminal facilities, port facilities, harbour facilities and the role of their inspectorate from the point of view of safety.  Of course, the State may even be a shareholder in companies such as the B &amp; I whereby they would have a direct interest in the matter.</P>
      <P>As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, I have put down a question to the Minister today in relation to the accident involving the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i> While not wishing to involve myself in that issue now, I have to say it is a matter of public interest that there should be as a matter of routine &mdash; in other words, automatically &mdash; publication, the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas the results of any such inquiry, and debate in this House.</P>
      <P>To give another example, a train was recently derailed at Ballycumber.  There is no guarantee that any report will ever be published about this incident.  Proceedings may be taken by any injured party.  I understand proceedings are being taken in the case involving the <i>mv Kilkenny.</i> No conclusion may be reached as to who was responsible for this accident and what lessons can be learned.  The whole purpose of an inquiry is to establish the cause and ensure that such accidents will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of direct concern to this House that we tighten up the procedures. I have no doubt that Departments will advise Ministers against, as the Taoiseach calls it, opening the shutters.  The publication of the results of inquiries should be made mandatory.  Yesterday I had discussions with a large publicly owned transport company who told me that the only option is a judicial sworn inquiry <Col N="540" /> which could cost £2 million.  If any transport operator, the B &amp; I or anyone else, were to be saddled with the costs of such an inquiry needless to say it would be totally prohibitive.</P>
    <P>There is a major gap in the system at present.  On the one hand, there is the beef tribunal, a major inquiry, where everybody is legally represented and there are huge senior and junior counsel fees &mdash; it is a very costly procedure; it is the worst extreme &mdash; while on the other there is nothing.  Therefore, there is a gap in our system of public scrutiny.  There should be scrutiny right across Government Departments, not only in relation to the transport issues dealt with in this legislation, for example, pleasure craft and a very limited range of facilities, but also in relation to the issues dealt with under general merchant shipping legislation such as an accident which may occur on the southern or central corridor any day of the week.  There is also the ongoing conflict about whether the Department of the Marine or the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications have responsibility for such matters.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the advice he gets on this matter, I appeal to the Minister to give a commitment to the House that he, in conjunction with his Government colleagues, will reassess the position in relation to accidents and public safety so that there is a clearly defined procedure whereby reports of such inquiries will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and there will be ministerial powers to ensure that all such reports are made public as a matter of routine.  This is a vital matter of public interest.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment or, failing that, to give a commitment on a wider Government level.  Fine Gael support Deputy Gilmore's amendment as we believe it is vital that this matter is rectified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would be very valuable to Deputy Yates if he very carefully read the transcript of what he has just said. He has analysed the problem very well. <Col N="541" /> He pointed out that there can be a gap between a public sworn inquiry, where there is an allocation of blame etc., and an investigation by an inspector of my Department.  When one looks at the gap one can see that it arises because of matters such as confidentiality.  Are people going to give an inspector the information which he or she may require or will they only give it in the case of a full legal inquiry where all their interests are protected by the relevant people who are there to look after them and where they feel certain that regardless of the outcome their interests will be properly and duly protected?  That is one approach. It is a very costly and time consuming approach.</P>
      <P>If one does not follow that approach then one has to follow an administrative or policy approach.  If you take a policy approach you have to ask for people's co-operation.  Deputies have asked why the confidentiality aspect should be respected as it is a matter of public interest, importance and safety.  If the people concerned decide that they are not prepared to give information unless it is on a respected policy basis then one will not get to the root of the problem which, as Deputy Yates spelt out very clearly, is to find out first and foremost the cause of the accident.  The Deputy is quite right.  The Department of the Marine are not in the position of allocating blame to anybody.  Their task and the task of the legislation is to establish clearly the cause of such accidents, to protect the public and ensure that that is done immediately.  There is no point blaming the people who are involved.  I know Deputy Yates and others did not set out to blame anybody in particular, but there is a suggestion that somebody is covering up or hiding something.  The people concerned will outline the traditional views and the traditional advice that is given to a Minister who is in the position to deal responsibly with reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates would get full marks for pointing out that reports undertaken by the Department of the Marine staff are primarily a safety review.  That is the first objective.  These reports are undertaken <Col N="542" /> to identify quickly the causes of an accident.  In compiling such reports Department of the Marine staff take statements on a confidential basis in an effort to ensure that witnesses contribute freely to safety investigations, especially in cases where negligence or a disregard for basic safety measures has been a cause of the tragedy.  In those circumstances there is a great likelihood that people will be reluctant to give information unless it is on a confidential basis.  It would, therefore, be a breach of faith if, after such undertakings were given, the Minister or the Department disclosed the information to a third party.  Such disclosure could, it is feared, prejudice the willingness of witnesses to speak freely in the aftermath of future marine casualities. Release of such reports or the statements on which they are based would, therefore, be contrary to the public good.  They would not serve the purpose to which Deputy Yates spelt out so eloquently as being the first purpose of the investigator on behalf of the Department and the people operating from that Department. There are various other good reasons given, which would be the traditional position established over a long period.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Yates was not here last week when we discussed Committee Stage.  I accept that we cannot all be here all the time, but I went a fair distance on that occasion, particularly in relation to the current case.  I spelt out the difficulty in relation to the <i>mv Kilkenny</i> and the <i>mv Hasselwerder</i> and gave an undertaking to publish the report of the findings of the investigation.  That is a major step forward and, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, is a break with tradition.  I want to proceed with caution, with due consideration and in a responsible way.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the three Opposition spokespersons called on me to release the reports of marine accident investigations.  On that occasion I was sympathetic to the view that marine accident investigation reports should be made available to the House and to the general public, there are good policy reasons this has not been the practice heretofore but notwithstanding these, <Col N="543" /> the time has come to alter policy in this area.  I wish, therefore, to announce to the House that on an experimental basis my Department will, unless legally debarred from so doing, release a report of marine accident investigations undertaken by the Department of the Marine. This is being done to allay public concern reflected by Deputies from all sides of the House for greater disclosure in the interest of maritime safety.</P>
    <P>This new policy will have implications for the conduct of inquiries by the marine surveyors of my Department.  Work has already begun to devise a new <i>modus operandi</i> for future investigations.  I would like to make it clear that this new policy will apply to the <i>Kilkenny-Hasselwerder</i> collision of November last and to all subsequent marine accident investigations conducted by the Department. However, as earlier investigations were conducted under different circumstances with certain guarantees of confidentiality being given, the new policy will not have retrospective effect.  After a trial period the chief surveyor of my Department will be asked to advise on the extent, if any, to which the new policy impeded the primary aim of marine accident investigation, that is to establish the cause of an accident and set about preventing its recurrence.</P>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that there will be often a time lag between the date <Col N="544" /> of an accident and the date of publication of the related report.  Delays can occur where the pursuit of civil or criminal proceedings arising from a casualty effectively prevents release of a departmental report until after the completion of the legal process.  I trust that this significant policy change will receive wide support and will be an indication of an effort on my part to move to a more open and frank style of administration in the maritime safety area.</P>
    <P>I trust that the position I have adopted meets the case put so eloquently by Deputies Yates, Barnes, O'Sullivan and Byrne.  I hope the Deputy will withdraw the amendment because it would be restrictive and could not be complied with in practice.  I know the purpose of the amendment is to have the question debated and to try to make progress in that area.  I trust that the Deputy will recognise that the step I am taking today is a substantial one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's proposal is a move in the right direction but, as he said, he is considering this change only on an experimental basis.  Although we recognise it as a step in the right direction it falls fundamentally short of what is needed and does not satisfy Deputies on this side of the House.  Therefore I will be pressing it to a vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> In page 7, line 24, to delete &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£10,000&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>All three Opposition spokespersons spoke on Committee Stage of the need to raise the maximum penalties provided for in the Bill.  I agreed to examine this proposal before Report Stage.  In the week that was available to me I have considered the matter and decided to take on board the views expressed. Accordingly, I am proposing amendments to sections 6, 8, 11, 12 and 13.  The amendments proposed will double the maximum fine on conviction for an indictable offence, and thus for offences involving passenger ships, that is ferries carrying more than 12 passengers, the penalties will be raised from £5,000 to £10,000 and from £50,000 to £100,000.  I thank the Deputies for their contribution on the subject and I am glad to be able to accommodate their wishes on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed with us on Committee Stage as to the danger of carelessness particularly with regard to ships carrying a large number of passengers.  I welcome the fact that fines have been raised, but we also suggested that custodial sentences should be increased for careless or irresponsible behaviour which led to damage or the tragic loss of life.  The spokespersons on this side of the House felt that not alone should the fines be increased to take account of the enormity of such a crime but that there should be some type of punishment to reflect the public attitude to a ship offering standards which could result in the deaths of people or pollution on a wide scale since pollution is not alone an attack on the environment but an attack on the quality of life of the people in that environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the fines have been increased but why was not the jail sentence looked at?  We do not demand that people be put in jail and the key thrown away, but the punishment should reflect the crime having regard to the type of service offered and the number of passengers <Col N="548" /> and staff who might be involved.  It should reflect the level of irresponsibility and carelessness involved.  The maximum penalty should certainly be a very heavy fine or long sentence, if it is called for.  I wonder why the period of imprisonment was not looked at?  It needed to be extended because of society's need to impress upon people who are responsible for carrying passengers, staff and dangerous cargo the seriousness of any breaches of the law.  Such breaches must be viewed by society as deserving a longer sentence. While I welcome the increase in the fines will the Minister say why the seriousness of the breaches outlined is not reflected in the sentencing of offenders?</P>

      <P>By increasing the fines and tackling the problem with such speed it appears the Minister means business.  I welcome the Minister's approach in the Bill.  It was pointed out on Committee Stage that the fines were derisory for large companies because they could pay them, motor on and do the same thing again.  The Minister, by increasing the fines substantially, has brought into sharp focus his attitude to people who blatantly breach the regulations laid down by the Department of the Marine. He also indicated the very good reasons the regulations were put in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome his approach and I fully support him.  The fines under the previous legislation bore no relationship to present living standards.  The fines will apply for a number of years but should we look at the possibility of indexing the fines in the legislation?  I do not know if there is an impediment to doing this.  If there is we should in future legislation index the fines imposed on people who blatantly and indiscriminately breach the regulations laid down by this House and by the Department of the Marine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in supporting the amendments proposed by the Minister.  A fine of £100,000, with the possibility of a two year jail sentence for breaches in the insuring of passenger ships, is not too punitive.  It could be <Col N="549" /> argued that because of the scale of disasters on passenger ships any fiddling with the insurance cover of the ship would be an extreme breach of the intentions of the Bill.  The Minister has increased the fines in a number of sections.  The fine for uncertified passenger ships will be increased from £50,000 to £100,000 and that is welcome. We will support the additional fines to be levied in the event of breaches of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their support for my amendments.  In regard to sentencing, a period of two years was considered an adequate sentence for the offences involved, such as non-certification or false declarations in surveyor's certificates.  The prison sentence will be the same whether one has a great deal of money or very little money, but the fact that one may have a great amount of money may mean that a higher cash penalty will be levied.  The fine of £100,000 is the maximum and it will be left to the court to decide the amount of the fine.  That represents a very substantial improvement.  The fines are substantial and they will remain at that level for some time.  I thank the Deputies for their support.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) make provision for competency certificates for pleasure boat owners/users, and</P>
      <P>(f) Make provision for rules governing public safety with regard to speedboats, water-skiing and the use of pleasure boats in sporting activities, and any other activities which need to be regulated in the interest of public safety.&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>This amendment was debated at length on Committee Stage and the Minister indicated that a special committee were sitting to discuss various aspects of safety on leisure craft and so forth.  I have given very careful thought to the two parts of my amendment and I have examined sections 19 and 20 in detail.  The Minister argued that he had certain powers under section 19 to make regulations on the competency of skippers and crews and I accept the Minister has those powers in regard to fishing vessels but my amendment is slightly different in that it deals with the competency of users and the owner of the boat to handle that craft on the waterways and in the sea.  My amendment deals with the competency of the user of a pleasure craft, whether on his own or with passengers, to handle it &mdash; let me hasten to add that this is not for reward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well understand that there may be <Col N="551" /> opposition to the curtailment of anyone's freedom but having spoken to a number of people involved in sea rescue operations I believe there always has to be someone to go out and rescue someone who gets into difficulties with his boat. At present there are no rules or regulations for someone who wishes to purchase a boat, a yacht or a cabin cruiser. I am trying to ensure that the person who goes out in his boat on the river or sea is competent to handle the craft.  I realise it is difficult to try to include this in legislation.  However, we all agree that the emphasis in the Bill is on the safety of the public and those who use the sea. There is a need for some type of registration in regard to people who use the sea and the rivers.  A person without sufficient competence could decide to take a boat from Cork to Baltimore, Schull or Dingle.  After a few hours it might be discovered that the boat was overdue and would have to be regarded as missing.  A problem is that there might not be a record of the type of boat being used. The RNLI and various other agencies would have to be alerted.  Very often they save lives in such circumstances.  There is a need for those who wish to use the sea to have some means of competency assessment so that they will be reasonably safe under normal conditions.  Of course, the elements can change within a matter of minutes.</P>
    <P>I toyed with the idea of requiring the registration of boats and there is much merit in that idea when one considers the safety aspect.  It is not right to put the lives of other people at risk due to one's own inexperience.  Anybody taking a boat out to sea must know the nature of the risks and responsibilities.  The competence of skippers and crews is another matter; I am referring to the individual.  I am asking the Minister to make provision for competency certificates for pleasure boat owners and users.  I do not believe the powers contained in the Bill will be adequate in this respect.  It is necessary that people who use the seas have a basic standard of seamanship.  Many yachting clubs and boating schools are doing an <Col N="552" /> excellent job in teaching boys and girls the basics of good seamanship and all credit is due to them, yet the regulations allow a person who has not sufficient competence to charter a cabin cruiser and sail out from Cork harbour to the open sea.  In the interests of general safety there should be some regulations.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people have more leisure time and are engaging in marine sporting activities.  We have wonderful strands at places like Youghal and Owenahincha and others along the west coast, off which people use speed boats and water skis. This can be a danger to people swimming. Certain local authorities have tried to ban water skiing because of complaints but they have difficulty in enforcing the ban. In some parts of Cork grave exception has been taken to the use of speed boats close inshore where young people are swimming.  Anglers get very angry when having fished quietly in a lake for two or three hours the water is disturbed by a speed boat.  Jet skis and water skis are becoming increasingly popular and this is our opportunity to enshrine safeguards in legislation.  A ban by local authorities will not stand up in court unless it has some legislative backing.  We have wonderful beaches which are enjoyed by many people but a speed boat can spoil everything by coming inshore.  I am not aware of existing regulations to curtail that type of activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome the safety committee which the Minister has set up and I ask that provision be made for rules governing public safety with regard to speed boats, water skiing, the use of pleasure boats and any other activities which need to be reglated in the interests of public safety.  The Minister might bring in regulations at a later stage but these matters should be incorporated in the Bill.  It is now a matter of major public concern.  I can understand the difficulties with regard to competency certificates for individuals but it must be remembered that the volunteers in the rescue services risk their lives to rescue those who have foolishly ignored weather warnings and got into danger.  I ask the <Col N="553" /> Minister to look at the amendment sympathetically.</P>

      <P>My sympathy goes to an angler on a nice quiet stretch of beach, or fishing from rocks in some secluded bay, when these speed boats arrive, with their attendant noise, disturbing the overall tranquility of the area.  I suffer a similar problem when I try to get away from all the tensions of everyday life.  I get up early on Sunday mornings to travel into the Wicklow Mountains when, to my horror, even though I might have been there from, say, eight o'clock in the morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy O'Sullivan's concern about safety generally. This is based on personal experience.  I remember, at approximately 17 years of age, going youth hostelling around Achill Island.  I had never before been on a boat in my life.  I remember an occasion, a Welsh boy and I, aged about 16 and 17 years respectively, hired a rowing boat, but when we were given oars we had no idea how to use them.  Yet we rowed out into that waterway and there were certain stages of our rowing expedition that worried us enormously.  Even as a more mature person I remember spending a holiday around Castletownsend, when I hired a tiny motor-powered boat taking it out into deep sea waters, which also caused me not a little worry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that it appears very easy for boat owners to hire out boats to members of the public, who have no training or competency, who may not have even basic swimming skills, in the <Col N="554" /> event of an accident or getting into troubled waters.  This raises the serious issue of whether individual owners of pleasure craft, paddle boats, rowing boats, speed boats, etc. should be able to hire such vessels to people incapable of handling them.  The time has arrived when we must address the issue of whether such boat owners should be capable of hiring out vessels without any assurances that their hirers are capable of manoeuvring them.</P>
    <P>Then there is the ancillary problem of practical life-saving jackets and equipment not being adequately covered or provided.  For example, paddle boats or rowing boat can be hired without their owners providing the requisite life jackets.  That should be done automatically.</P>
    <P>I do not make these points to be a killjoy but rather to highlight the fact that many inexperienced hirers, or indeed people without any experience whatsoever, can gain access to our waterways, placing young lives in danger.  One often sees very young children in these pleasure craft.</P>
    <P>We should give serious consideration to Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment ascertaining whether the provisions of this Bill cannot incorporate some of the sentiments expressed in the course of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we spent some time on this amendment on Committee Stage I will not repeat my argument.  We welcomed the information furnished by the Minister to the effect that he and his Department had established a committee with a view to drawing up rules and regulations for the control or usage of such vessels, in particular, ensuring that an adequate safety element is incorporated while protecting others' rights to engage in water leisure activities which are becoming increasingly popular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While none of us would wish to be killjoys, but rather would want to encourage every aspect of water leisure activity, I predict that the committee established will have a difficult task drawing up the requisite regulations.  Deputy O'Sullivan could not over-emphasise this aspect and <Col N="555" /> was right to have spent so much time expressing his anxieties about people's competency, contending that it would appear that all that was required are the necessary funds with which to invest, even in large pleasure boats, enabling people to take off into the blue horizon. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, he could buy a cabin cruiser tomorrow and take it out to sea without being questioned by the authorities.  I must say is occurred to me, as he made that point, that his electorate might well question such eventuality, of course, for very different reasons. Deputy O'Sullivan has made the point well about the need for such a committee to address that issue.</P>
    <P>Of course there should be a requirement that the requisite life-saving equipment be furnished to all hirers of boats, particularly people hiring pleasure craft, which is what the provisions of this Bill are all about.  Perhaps the Department of the Marine, with this committee, could lead to some Government decision being taken on this matter generally.  Here I have in mind the many sailing schools nation wide who not alone foster a love of sailing and train people in its skills but also invest much time and energy encouraging life-saving skills at sea.  Bearing in mind the large amounts of moneys allocated to other sports and recreational activities, a legitimate case can be made for those sailing schools not only being maintained but developed considerably. Since I do not engage in sailing myself I am not aware whether such sailing schools already receive lottery funds.  If not, I should like to see greater emphasis being placed on this as an ever increasing pleasure activity or sport, one we should like to encourage, particularly on the part of people who did not perceive it as being open to them to date, it being perceived as a more privileged activity.  We must remember that those sailing schools offer the most incredible service to young people by way of training and facilities generally.  I should like to think that consideration would be given to allocating lottery funds to that type of sporting <Col N="556" /> activity, backed up by the necessary life-saving skills and equipment.  This is another aspect that might well be considered by the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barnes has put a very good point in that there are some minor lottery funds being allocated to organisations such as the Sea Scouts in my constituency.  She made an absolutely valid point when she said that we are an island nation and our ignorance of the sea and its ways generally is frightening. It is terrifying to think of the numbers of young people who go out in boats without any skills whatsoever.  Therefore, Deputy Barnes' point is deserving of endorsement and support.  This would be a worthwhile area into which to channel funds and assistance.</P>
      <P>I might point out also that some vocational education committees have become involved in providing sailing courses.  For example, in County Wicklow, in the Blessington lakes area, there is a sailing course run by a sailing club &mdash; which would have been regarded by many as elitist which clearly is not &mdash; in conjunction with the vocational education committees.  These are worthwhile efforts and should be the beneficiaries of such supporters.  No doubt if such lottery fund allocations are channelled into such sailing clubs, there will be people who will argue that it is wrong, that they are elitist clubs, whereas the reality is that many are endeavouring to open their doors to young men and women who heretofore had no opportunity whatsoever of engaging in sailing activities. That is a good, healthy trend.  I rose simply to support the point made by Deputy Barnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it very clear, as I did on the last occasion we discussed this matter, that I have powers in this Bill to undertake the actions recommended by Members here.  For example, section 18 provides me with powers to make regulations to ensure the safety of passenger boats, their passengers and crews, whereas section 18 (2) (e) allows me to ascertain and test the <Col N="557" /> standards of competence of masters and of any other members of crews of vessels, the subject of licences, at any time I consider to be necessary.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 20 a merchant vessel safety working group is being set up to advise me on safety procedures and standards required on Irish passenger boats.  It is not appropriate to require that the owner of a passenger boat pass a competency test as he or she may or may not be involved in operating the vessel.  The whole question of the need for competency tests for pleasure craft is being examined by a recently established pleasure craft safety working group.  Section 20 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations make such provision as he considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of ensuring the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants. </P>
      <P>I have the enabling powers and the power to make regulations.  We have also set up a mechanism whereby we can examine the whole question and see what is the best approach to take.  Because of the concern expressed by Deputies regarding the need for a competency test for pleasure craft users I have arranged that this matter be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the pleasure craft safety working group.  I will rely heavily on the advice of this committee as to how best this area of the pleasure craft operation should be regulated in the interest of maritime safety.  Early indications from the committee as to the opinion of the group &mdash; they represent the different interests &mdash; are that the subject of pleasure craft safety should be more appropriately dealt with by means of voluntary codes of practice rather than statutory control.  I will bring to their attention the points raised here in the course of this debate and I trust they will give due weight to those views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of jet skis, speed boats, the tranquility of the waters and so on, is currently being examined by the recently established pleasure craft safety working group.  I have arranged for the matter to be placed on the agenda for the next <Col N="558" /> meeting of that group and I will be guided by their approach.  It is not a matter we can solve here in detail.  All we can do here is take the enabling powers to make the regulations.  We will then be in a position to adopt the recommendations after they have been fully considered by the committee.  I should mention that local authorities have powers under section 94 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, to licence pleasure boats and boatmen or persons assisting in the charge or navigation of such boats.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recognise that we in the Department of the Marine are making immediate arrangements to tidy up this area to secure improvement, to look after the whole question of safety and to take on board the questions which have been raised here by Deputies.  These are matters with which I am familiar.  I know the circumstances in which small pleasure boats can be used and the lack of use of safety jackets and other safety equipment.  All of this costs money and it also means a certain discipline.  People have to discipline themselves to realise the sea can be treacherous even when it is calm. It is amazing that individuals do not want to use the equipment even when it is beside them, when there are rules and regulations in force and which might have saved their lives in particular circumstances.  I can assure the Deputies &mdash; and I have given evidence of this in regard to the committee which has already begun to work &mdash; that I am taking this matter very seriously.</P>
    <P>I note what has been said by Deputies Barnes and Roche about the lottery funds.  Incidently, this morning I met a group who are training young people. They did not come to me as Minister for the Marine but as their local TD.  They have already received a grant but they cannot get people to agree about a place in which to train young people.  There are a number of sailing groups for young people on the north side of Dublin.  These Deputies from the south side should come to the north side sometime and get their special pass and we will make sure <Col N="559" /> the bridge stays up until they have gone back again.</P>

I take on board the point made by the Deputies in relation to future uses for the lottery funds among other moneys.  I hope Deputy O'Sullivan will accept I have the necessary powers &mdash; I have already shown I am prepared to take action in this area &mdash; and that he will leave it to me to get on with the job.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said that he has the necessary powers.  Section 20 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may by regulations make such provision as he considers necessary or expedient for the purpose of ensuring the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the relevant section in which he can use his powers if necessary to introduce a series of regulations which would, perhaps, mean competency tests for a person to take out a boat, or the registration of pleasure craft.  Certain fishing craft and craft used for ferrying purposes for profit would be regulated and registered and perhaps the Minister would look at that aspect.  I welcome the Minister's positive response because he has identified with his committee that he will be taking action on their recommendations.  The people with whom I have spoken and those involved in the sea have indicated it is time certain regulations were introduced where people under any circumstances would not be able to go to sea ill-equipped.  Perhaps we should examine the VAT rates on life jackets which are very important to <Col N="560" /> people who are messing about on the river.  If I am not mistaken the VAT rate on life jackets is 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the light of what the Minister has said and because of the assurances he has given me that he will be guided by the committee I will withdraw my amendment.  I would ask the Minister to put before them the suggestion that perhaps it is time regulations were made whereby people would have to register in the interests of safety, so that if a boat, a yacht or whatever was lost at sea there would be some central computerisation system whereby the rescue services could identify within a matter of minutes the craft, its colour, the number of occupants and so forth.  Frequently much time is lost in trying to identify the colour of the boat or yacht, the number of people on board and so forth.  Even in this day and age there are people who will go from one location to another without giving the rudimentary facts that they will be out for four hours and if they have not returned after four-and-a-half hours it is time to institute a search.  Some of those yachts have radios on board and, indeed, a back-up service.  Therefore I welcome the Minister's assurance and withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening, before I adjourned the debate, I was referring to the question of accountability in relation to An Bord Pleanála.  Before An Bord <Col N="561" /> Pleanála were established, the Minister for Local Government was the appeals authority.  No matter what decision he made, at least he had to go before the people to seek re-election to this House. For what I think were good reasons An Bord Pleanála were then set up.  However the Minister for the Environment retained discretion to ask An Bord Pleanála to hold oral hearings.  I am disappointed we have moved away from that provision during the past few years and that it is now proposed that, under section 12 of the Bill, the board will have sole discretion to hold an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>An oral hearing forms a very important aspect of our planning procedures because the public are given an opportunity to make representations to the board.  As a member of a local authority, I have attended many oral hearings.  I should say that great credit is due to the board for the way in which they hold these hearings.  Very often the developer is represented by senior or junior counsel who has extraordinary expertise in relation to the planning procedures, while local community representatives make the case for the community.  The inspectorate who preside over these hearings on behalf of the board give every assistance to these local community representatives in making their case.  I wish to acknowledge that now.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage we are asked to comment on the contents of the Bill, or on issues that we feel should be addressed in the Bill.  This morning I would like to address an issue which I feel should be addressed in the Bill.  The local authorities are required to draw up a development plan every five years.  They have to go through a detailed procedure before this is achieved.  Following long and detailed discussions with their planning committee a draft development plan is put on display for three months in order that the public may view it and make their views known.  These are then considered and an amended draft development plan is put on display for a period of one month.  Following this the development plan is initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> If a developer submits a planning application to build a housing estate on land which has been zoned &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; or &ldquo;open space&rdquo; this would amount to a material contravention and if the local authority wish to consider this application they would have to initiate the material contravention process whereby an advertisement is put in the newspapers for at least one month to inform the public that such an application has been received and any objections received are considered.  Under new legislation three-quarters of the council would have to agree to the material contravention.  It is most unlikely, however, that a local authority would consider using this procedure if land had been zoned &ldquo;amenity&rdquo; and the manager would have to refuse the planning application.</P>
    <P>The applicant could then appeal the decision of the local authority to An Bord Pleanála who, without holding an oral hearing or going through any procedure under this legislation, would be able to make a decision which runs contrary to the development plan of the local authority.  It is only reasonable in a planning Bill of this nature that An Bord Pleanála should be required to go through the same procedure that the local authority are required to go through in relation to a material contravention of the development plan of the local authority.  I also believe that if they make a decision which runs contrary to the development plan they should outline to the local authority the reasons they made that decision. Other speakers have said that An Bord Pleanála should be required to explain all their decisions to the local authority but I would not go that far; in cases where they make a decision which runs contrary to the local authority's development plan they should be required to make their reasons known to the local authority.</P>
    <P>On each occasion the board hear an appeal, which involves a material contravention of a development plan, an oral hearing should be held.  Such a provision should be included in the Bill.  That is one of the weaknesses of our planning procedures.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 a local authority will <Col N="563" /> be required to respond to a request from An Bord Pleanála, with the documentation requested, within 14 days.  As the planning Authority may find it difficult to comply with this request from An Bord Pleanála within the 14 days specified, I suggest that this period should run from the date the request is received by the planning Authority.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 7, a request from An Bord Pleanála for observations on the grounds of an appeal can be misdirected if deliveries are delayed for a variety of reasons.  I suggest, therefore, that the time limit should run from the date the request is received by the planning Authority.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister for the Environment will be allowed to make regulations.  Under section 18 (2) (c) the Minister may make regulations under which the board may invite an applicant to submit to the board revised plans or other drawings modifying the development to which the appeal relates.  Under this section also the board will be enabled to grant permission in respect of the modified development.</P>
    <P>A number of problems could arise in relation to this matter.  I suggest that because such cases have given rise to difficulties for the planning Authority and other parties in making considered comment, there is a need to write into the Bill a requirement that any material submitted by the applicant should be circulated to all the parties involved to allow them make a considered comment on it.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member &mdash; I am also chairman of their planning committee &mdash; find it difficult to issue planning decisions within two months of the date an application is received.  Up to some years ago this requirement was satisfied by sending a decision by registered post or by hand within two months.  However, the High Court decided in the Freeney case that the decision must be received by the applicant within two months.  Unfortunately, the planning Authority have no control over the matter once their decision has been handed over to the care <Col N="564" /> of An Post.  In addition, an applicant may not be present at the address to receive it.  I strongly recommend, therefore, that the Bill should be amended to state specifically that it would be sufficient to issue a decision by registered post or to deliver it by hand within two months of the date an application is received.  These are changes which I would like to see made in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation; the local authority now have to make a decision within two months and An Bord Pleanála will have to make a decision within four months.  That is a reasonable request to make of the board and it will speed up important decisions in relation to development and employment.  I hope the board will be able to comply with the four months period and speed up the planning appeals decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 1963, represented a major departure in local government.  It set down new challenges to local authorities and to their members.  However, these challenges have at best been inadequately addressed.  The Act has never operated to its full potential, it has been subject over the years to change, some of which I welcome.  Nevertheless there is a need to look at the totality of the Act and the dual purposes which the Act was intended to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act was important for a number of reasons; two particular reasons spring to mind.  First, it marked a major departure from the approach adopted to local government by successive Administrations.  From the foundation of the State the trend has been and, as can be seen in the recently published Barrington proposals, continues to be in favour of greater centralisation of local government.  Through the twenties, thirties and forties increasingly the tendency was to remove smaller units of local government and to increase the controls on the fewer number of local authorities which remained.  This centralist tendency is evident throughout the history of the State. There are, of course, reasons put forward for these changes, economies of scale, <Col N="565" /> greater efficiencies and the potential to limit corruption, or at least the curtailment of the opportunities for corruption in so far as members of local authorities were concerned.</P>
    <P>The second reason the Planning and Development Act is important is that not only did it reverse that trend, it gave a new and positive role to local authorities. It charged the planning authorities identified in the Act with planning for development and the emphasis in virtually every discussion on the Planning and Development Act has been the planning control aspects of the legislation rather than planning for development.  It is because I believe that the proposals in the Bill will help to reorient the planning process that I particularly welcome them. Incidentally, I should have said at the outset that I congratulate my good friend, Deputy Smith, on assuming the office of the Minister for the Environment.  I wish him well and if this legislation is a foretaste of things to come, we have every reason to be confident that the Minister will make a worthwhile contribution to his office as he did previously in the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>The central purpose of a planning Bill, the planning of rational and well ordered development, is a point which has been lost sight of and, as a result, there have been chaotic consequences in the planning area.  The Bill before us is welcome because it addresses some of the potential areas of chaos.  The basic Act requires, as Members know, each county council, corporation, county borough, borough corporation and urban district council planning authority to draw up a development plan for their areas and to revise it at regular intervals.  The aim of the development plan is twofold; first to control all significant physical development and at the same time to provide a blueprint within a geographical area for all future development.  It is the first element which continuously receives attention and emphasis.  The sterilisation of worthwhile development was never intended to be a part of the planning process yet, all too often, that is the effect of the <Col N="566" /> current looseness in the central legislation.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with specific elements in the new Bill, I wish to briefly address another point.  The basic Act went further; it gave for the first time statutory recognition to the development role which could be played by local authorities who were encouraged at that time to become development corporations.  Uniquely in the drafting of their development plan they were given a free hand and the plans were not subject to central control or adjudication.  In addition to preparing a development plan and implementing planning control, the Act enabled the same planning authorities to become involved in urban renewal, to facilitate industrial and commercial development by providing sites, to contribute to training and research, to enforce control, to enter into agreements with land owners for joint developments and to support forced development of sites which had lain fallow, to assist bodies and persons to provide amenities and to make a wide range of amenity orders.  They are just a small sample of the positive side to the Planning and Development Act which are largely ignored.  In short, the Act provides not just for local authorities to act as planning control agencies, it provides a much more positive role for local authorities to plan for developments in the interests of the whole community.</P>
    <P>To be fair, there are examples all over the country where local authorities act as &ldquo;motors&rdquo; for development.  In my constituency we have many fine examples. In Bray there is very imaginative use of the council's planning role in an urban designation granted by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, which I welcomed at the time.  The two have come together with the developer and the town hall, a fine building, has been effectively rebuilt.  A new commercial hub for the town is being created.</P>
    <P>The urban district council, Wicklow County Council, and the IDA have cooperated in the development of lands on the outskirts of Bray for industrial use. It is another good example of local authorities using the powers under the Act <Col N="567" /> to operate as the &ldquo;motor&rdquo; for positive development.</P>
    <P>While there are examples of the Act being positively used there are, unfortunately, many more examples where it is not being used positively, where rights conferred in the Act have been used to stymie development.  On occasion they have been used to defeat worthwhile development which would have given jobs and helped to develop areas in a very positive way.  One of the most spectacular examples of this in my area was the rejection of proposals to site a specific plant, the Sebulite factory, in an empty factory building in Kilcoole, County Wicklow.  I refer to this case because it illustrates the importance of some of the specific proposals introduced in the Bill.  The example which I gave is a case study in how things should not be done.  For reasons which I will never understand, the development authority, the county council and the IDA failed, in spite of urgings from myself and other public representatives, to be open with the local community and to take the people of the village into their confidence.  In this regard I acknowledge the role played by Deputy Kavanagh in support of my case.</P>
    <P>As a result of failure to be open in the planning process, extraordinary exaggerated stories were circulated as to the dangers associated with the proposed development, and they took root.  People who were positive in regard to the creation of jobs were convinced that the environmental and health costs of the development would be far too high. Faced with a High Court challenge the promoters decided that this would delay the project for two years and they pulled out.  There is no doubt in my mind that the approach adopted in this case by the planning authority, the IDA and a small group of people turned something which could have been positive into something divisive and negative.  There is equally no doubt in my mind that in this case a major foreign multinational company.  3M, which had previously frustrated the efforts of the same company, Sebulite, to locate in a County Kildare location, or <Col N="568" /> one of their local representatives cleverly manipulated opinion and abused the very openness of Irish planning law to stymie an effective and potential competitor. Under the law as it stands no doubt this was not the first time this happened.  I have no doubt that the law without amendment would be abused in this way on many further occasions.</P>
    <P>Given the effective degeneration of planning which can be seen all over the country, the changes proposed in this Bill are particularly welcome.  As the Minister said, the preliminary purpose of the Bill is to streamline and speed up the planning appeals system so that An Bord Pleanála will be able to determine the vast majority of appeals within four months. I believe every Member of the House welcomes this proposal.  It is fundamentally wrong that planning appeals should be allowed to drag on for interminable periods, frustrating the community, developers and citizens who have a right to their view.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  The proposal to introduce a four month period for the hearing of appeals is welcomed by everyone.  I suggest to the Minister that this aspect be closely monitored and, if necessary, supported by a specific requirement in later legislation.  I will come back to this point later.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes the establishment of new procedural arrangements for legal actions challenging the validity of a planning decision.  The aim of this is to facilitate speedy determination of such actions.  This proposal is particularly welcome as it will prevent our courts being used as a means of stopping development.  We all accept the need for effective development control systems.  The development control process must subject development proposals to detailed examination to ensure that they match up to the exacting standards which Irish people rightly demand nowadays. However, at the same time it is very important that the system of planning and planning control should be able to give conclusive decisions to citizens' proposals for development within a reasonable timescale.  If it takes too long to <Col N="569" /> reach a final decision worthwhile projects can be abandoned and imaginative developments stymied.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that in many cases this country is competing with other countries for internationally mobile projects.  Any view abroad that our planning system is inefficient or that it takes too long to give a decision could well influence companies to go elsewhere.  In the case of the Sebulite plant in Kilcoole to which I referred, it is interesting to note that after a protracted planning period and threats of High Court action, which would have held up the development for another 18 months or two years, that corporation moved to Newry in County Down and within three weeks had received all of the necessary permits and permissions to go ahead with the development.  The village of Kilcoole and north County Wicklow lost 250 jobs directly as a result of this.  When one considers the mobility of international investment and the competition for this type of investment I have no doubt that this case will be cited by planning authorities and development agencies in other states to illustrate how difficult it is to set up in Ireland.  I do not want to see dirty industry here but equally I do not want to see Ireland as a whole and, in particular, County Wicklow, being identified in the international mind or the business community mind as a no go area for development.  We need jobs.  We do not need jobs at any cost; we need clean jobs.  It is frustrating in the extreme for anyone interested in employment to see how the planning process was abused in this case.</P>
    <P>Delays in the planning appeals stage are a frustration we all recognise.  The main problem currently confronting the development control process under the planning Acts is the time it takes An Bord Pleanála to determine planning appeals. Although there has been some improvement in this respect in the recent past the time taken to decide individual cases still cannot be viewed as satisfactory.  A number of elements of the planning system seem to contribute and exacerbate the delays.  There is no obligation at present on an appellant to submit the <Col N="570" /> grounds of appeal when appealing thus putting the onus on the board to request submission of the grounds for that appeal.  This is a ridiculous situation in law.  I know of the multi-million pound development which was stymied by a one line letter handed into an Bord Pleanála one hour before the time for appeal expired.  The writer of that letter said he would make known the basis of his opposition at a future date.  In fact, the writer of that letter, and supporting letters which were submitted after the planning appeal period had expired, never indicated the specific basis of their objection.  Nonetheless the development was stymied and, as a consequence, jobs were lost.</P>
    <P>The second point which causes frustration is that appeals will typically involve the board in circulating a lengthy series of submissions and counter-submissions between the parties.  Anyone who takes an interest in planning accepts that this process borders on the farcical with views, counter-views rebuttals and counter-rebuttals going backwards and forwards interminably.  It is only right and proper that this ping pong or table tennis game, so to speak, should be stopped.</P>
    <P>The third factor which causes delays is that a party to an appeal could make a further submission when the board's consideration of the appeal is well advanced.  The board might then have to circulate this submission to other parties, effectively creating a chain reaction of views, counter-views, assertions and counter-assertions.  The termination of an appeal can also be delayed when a request is made to the board at a very late stage for an oral hearing.  It is ridiculous that in effect people can come in at the eleventh hour or 59th minute and start to change the rules, move the goal posts and demand an oral hearing. Very frequently this is done by people who do not necessarily have a positive reason for their actions.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who like to tar everybody who makes an appeal with the brush of obstructionism.  Of course that is not the case.  The vast majority of people <Col N="571" /> who use the planning and appeal processes are citizens exercising their bona fide rights.  Unfortunately in a significant minority of cases this is not the truth.  The reality is that the circumstances have to be changed.  The Minister is doing this in an imaginative way in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to speed up the determination of appeals by placing clear time limits on the various stages of the appeals process.  I welcome this proposal. The Bill will help to define clearly the rights and duties of participants in appeals concerning submissions to An Bord Pleanála.  I also welcome this proposal.  These changes will enable the board to decide the bulk of appeals within the four month period, and section 2 will establish a legal objective for them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important to ensure that there is a balance between speed and the preservation of existing rights.  This balance is struck in the Bill.  The Irish planning appeals system is very open and democratic and any person can make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a planning authority's decision.  This position will not be changed significantly &mdash; indeed, it may not be changed at all &mdash; in the Bill which seeks only to ensure that effective procedures are put in place for dealing with appeals.</P>
    <P>However, I question the openness of Irish planning law.  A German or Japanese tourist travelling across Ireland for the first and possibly last time in their lives may see an attractive area which he believes is worth preserving.  He may then be told in the local pub that a planning appeal has been submitted in relation to that area.  He can become a party to the planning appeal without showing any interest in it.  I wonder if a balance is struck by such openness.</P>
    <P>Is it not time that we considered how the system operates in other jurisdictions?  For example, in other EC countries is there a requirement that people show an interest in a development before they can become involved in the planning appeals process?  The Bill introduces new requirements concerning appeals.  Under <Col N="572" /> section 4 an appellant would have to set out the grounds for appeal and unless that is done the appeal will be invalid. This is a very important provision and I welcome it.  It will return a degree of justice to the planning process which has been lacking in recent years.  These new provisions will put no imposition on objectors, rather they will help to level the playing field.</P>
    <P>The rights of other parties are also dealt with in the Bill.  It is fundamental to the proper discharge of the board's role that they take account of the views of all parties to an appeal.  Section 7 ensures that the other parties will have a fair opportunity to state their case by requiring the board to send them a copy of an appeal and by allowing them a month to make their submissions.  This period will allow a comprehensive response to the appeal and will ensure that the board are fully appraised of the views of parties when making their final decision.  This is reasonable.  Some criticism has been levelled on these aspects of the Bill, but I cannot understand the basis of such criticism.</P>
    <P>There is an important set of safeguards in section 9 which should commend themselves to all Members.  The proposals ensure that appellants and other parties will have a fair opportunity of making their case to the board.  However, it is possible to foresee circumstances, perhaps in the case of a particularly complex planning appeal, where the board might consider it necessary to ask a participant in an appeal to make further submissions by way of clarification of the issues. Section 9 proposes that the board request further submissions where they consider it appropriate and that this be done in the interests of justice.  That is a fair and reasonable provision.  Those people who fear that the timetable being introduced in the Bill may in some way prevent the fullest exposition of all arguments should realise that this provision ensures that the board approach the issue in a reasonable, rational and just way.  It is an important provision and has a great deal to commend it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The provisions dealing with oral hearings are particularly important.  Section 12 proposes that any request for an oral hearing of an appeal will have to be made at the outset of the appeals process.  I think everybody would agree that this is a fair and reasonable proposal.  It seems to be a very sensible provision which will overcome the problems posed for the board and for citizens who wish to get involved in bona fide developments where a request for an oral hearing is received when consideration of the appeal is almost complete.  The position under the current law is intolerable and needs to be addressed.  This provision may, of course, have the effect of encouraging all objectors to ask for an oral hearing.  However the requirement that fees be lodged may operate as a deterrent to any overdue enthusiasm for oral hearings.  The point made by the last Fine Gael speaker about the determination of hearings being left solely to the discretion of An Bord Pleanála is a sensible one. There should be no ministerial involvement in that area.</P>
    <P>The board's objectives for determining appeals is also dealt with in the Bill. Given the new procedures proposed in the Bill it seems quite feasible for the board to determine all but the most exceptional planning cases within a four month period.  The approach in the Bill to setting a four month time limit for decisions is sensible and practical and will be welcomed by all interested in rational development.  It is important that this matter be kept under review to ensure that there is no slippage.  If a slippage occurs in the future the Minister should quickly intervene to ensure that we do not go back to the bad old days.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions as far as legal proceedings are concerned are particularly important.  I welcome the provisions dealing with legal challenges to the validity of decisions in the planning process by planning authorities or by An Bord Pleanála.  They will not interfere with citizens rights of access to the courts but will facilitate the expeditious determination of any court case.  This should ensure that a citizen wishing to undertake <Col N="574" /> a permitted development can do so within a reasonable timescale where legal actions arise.  The courts have a role to play here in that they should not permit threatened court actions to frustrate a citizen's right in vexatious cases.  I do not wish to delay the House but I could instance cases where, to my knowledge, rich and powerful individuals have intervened, threatened court action and gone as far as issuing proceedings simply to frustrate positive developments from which communities could have benefited. That is unacceptable, and the Minister, by introducing changes here, has taken a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister's announcement that he will bring forward on Committee Stage amendments to allow access to the Circuit Court for orders against unauthorised developments and to substantially increase the fines for planning offences is welcome.  It is fundamentally wrong that abuses continue and that law breakers can downface their local planning authorities through the use of tricks and devices.  It is right that the Minister should set about ending that process. One case comes to mind of an illegal development in a highly scenic area of County Wicklow where for years people have been in and out of courts while the developer, without planning permission, has been allowed to use and abuse the law.  That situation should never have arisen.  I welcome the changes proposed in this regard.</P>
    <P>The procedure introduced by the Planning Act, 1976, whereby any person can go to the High Court for an order against a development carried out without planning permission or which does not comply with the terms and permission granted has shown over the years to be effective.  However, the process has been too slow.  By allowing orders to be sought in the Circuit Court the effectiveness of the procedure will be enhanced and matters will be speeded up.  It will certainly mean that planning authorities wishing to enforce the law will have a less costly and less onerous legal avenue open to them.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the maximum <Col N="575" /> fine of £10,000 for conviction on indictment under the Planning Act as it now stands is totally inadequate, particularly bearing in mind some of the serious offences involved.  The Minister's proposal to raise the maximum fine to £1 million is very welcome.  It will ensure that the penalty is a real deterrent to the small minority of developers who might otherwise be tempted to flaunt the planning laws with an eye only to profits.</P>
    <P>Overall the Bill's approach is a reasonable one.  A fair balance has been achieved between the need for a thorough and efficient development control process and the public interest in having final decisions on development proposals made within an acceptable period.  I commend the Bill to the House and I compliment the Minister on the very important changes he has introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to welcome the Minister and compliment him on his recent appointment to a very important ministerial porfolio as Minister for the Environment.  I am sure he will face many challenges in that position.</P>
      <P>The Bill is to be commended.  As far as public representatives are concerned, its main objective is to set a time limit of four months for the making of a decision. All public representatives are extremely concerned at the lengthy delays experienced in the decision-making process of An Bord Pleanála.  At times we also feel helpless when dealing with such an august body as An Bord Pleanála trying to expedite a matter of concern to our constituents.  Up to now An Bord Pleanála have been taking more than a year to reach decisions on applications.</P>
      <P>While people certainly have a right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála, in many instances the objections made are somewhat trivial and result in considerable expense and hardship being suffered by those who apply for planning permission. Any effort to speed up the planning appeal system and thus reduce the lengthy waiting time has to be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> One has to recognise that the process cannot be speeded up by magic.  It is obvious that if An Bord Pleanála take a considerable time to expedite planning appeals at present there must be a reason for that.  One has to ask whether An Bord Pleanála have the staff and resources necessary to implement the planning laws and to carry out their work.  The answer appears to be that An Bord Pleanála do not have sufficient staff.  In my brief experience in the House I have noted serious deficiencies in the implementation of legislation that has been enacted.  Quite often those deficiencies have arisen because the manpower resources are not adequate to truly bring into operation the spirit and intent of the legislation.  I hope that in the implementation of this Bill An Bord Pleanála will be given the required resources in order to achieve the Bill's objective.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister review the overall planning scene and the planning controls we have at present to determine whether it might be time for a change?  As a member of a county council I am aware that county councils feel that the exercising of planning controls is one of their true functions.  The power of local authorities has been eroded over a period and although there have been attempts to restore functions to local authorities there are still major deficiencies. Although it is a statutory function of the county manager to become involved in planning applications, any public representative may become involved.  We usually become involved when an applicant runs into difficulties.  Quite often we are, if anything, a mediator between an applicant and a county council.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that although a county council may have to make a decision within two months quite often it takes much longer.  I often wonder whether that might be because our planning system is clogged up with applications. Many applications for planning permission, perhaps for ordinary houses, go through fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>Applications for house extensions amount to about 25 per cent of planning applications and the reject rate of those <Col N="577" /> applications is as low as 1 per cent. Should there be a certain amount of deregulation concerning such extensions? Could the process for dealing with such applications be streamlined to speed it up?  Do we need planning permission for such extensions?  I pose those questions because in my experience applications for house extensions go through rather easily.  How many of us have found that such an application concerns a retention? Often it is only when an individual decides to sell a property that this or her lawyer suddenly discovers that it is necessary to apply for planning permission for an extension to the property which was built some years previously. It is often the case that the individual believed it was not necessary to obtain permission to carry out the extension.</P>
    <P>Another matter that causes much concern, especially in rural areas, relates to applications for what is classified as ribbon-type development outside towns.  In many instances individuals building a house need apply for permission to instal a sceptic tank.  I understand caution is exercised in regard to the installation of sceptic tanks and it is usual for health board officials to become involved if their is an element of doubt.  There must now be many areas where it is compulsory to dig a trial hole or to carry out percolation tests at a very early stage.  Would the whole planning process be speeded up if early on it was pointed out to the applicant that because of the region involved and its planning application history the first requirement would be for the applicant to dig a trial hole?  I make that point because applicants face much frustration because of the very lengthy process of having an engineer visit the site, prepare a report, and request the health board to carry out a sceptic tank investigation. The county council may recommend the digging of a bore hole and the visit of a health inspector.  A further element of doubt may arise in respect of prevailing weather conditions and percolation tests may be suggested.  Should the prevailing planning regulations be examined to determine whether it is possible to proceed with an amount of deregulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> Although a council may make a planning decision there are many other aspects involved in such a decision such as safety and fire risk.  Probably 40 per cent of the planning conditions imposed on individuals have no relevance to planning.  How sincere are some of those conditions in relation to what the council are trying to apply?  Quite often there appears to be a lack of enforcement of such conditions and I can understand why that might be the case.  Most officials feel constrained and pressurised.  How often has a condition of planning permission for a house recommended that a wall be erected or a hard shoulder near a roadway for safety or traffic considerations yet four or five years later nothing has been done although the house has been built?  It is possible that an applicant has not met such a condition because of financial constraints.  It is quite common for an individual to say that a condition will be met when he or she has the money available.  How serious is the intent of the council or the local authority when making such conditions?  Should such conditions include a recommended time scale for the implementation of it?</P>
    <P>In relation to the planning process I should like the Minister to consider the aspect of privacy, a matter I have taken up with my local authority and one I am sure others also raised.  Quite often the planning office in the county council is crowded and people have to do their business in public.  That is not good enough.  I have been critical of this in my own county.  The right to privacy should be available to anybody dealing with council officials.  This is something which should be examined by the Minister in relation to all local authority planning offices.  In local authorities the people involved in planning always appear to be under pressure and I compliment them on the work they do.  To introduce conditions and time scales without being able to enforce them demeans the whole planning process.</P>
    <P>Very often when a person gets planning permission for a house in a scenic location, they are mean-minded enough to join an organisation like An Taisce in <Col N="579" /> order to object to further development in the area.  That certainly happens in the west.</P>
    <P>The planning process has been helped by the recent changes with regard to the section 4 process.  My county has never encouraged that process.  The use of section 4 orders has helped to demean the planning process.  Limerick County Council have been successful because there has been a unanimous agreement not to support section 4s as such.  In my county council section 4s do not apply, so constituents do not go from one party TD to another trying to get planning permission.  The history of section 4 orders is well known and people in Dublin are well aware of abuses in that area.  I welcome the recent change with regard to section 4 orders.  I appeal to my colleagues in other county councils to reconsider their use of section 4s because they are not in the interests of the public and it does not help the planning process.</P>
    <P>The procedures under the draft development plan are convoluted.  The intention is to involve the public but I wonder if in any county the public are truly involved in any draft development plan for the county.  Usually the advertisement put in the local paper is that the plan is available for viewing by the members of the public in the local county council office.  How many members of the public actually go to the trouble of studying the draft development plan and how it applies to their area?  I wonder if a better system could be evolved which would really involve the public.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  I have already clarified my reservations in relation to the success of the four month process. Success can be achieved only if we beef up the division in An Bord Pleanála to achieve this objective.  This is a worthwhile Bill, however, we need to reconsider the whole planning process to try to ensure it is not demeaned as a result of deficiencies which exist in the planning process.  We may not need legislation but perhaps an examination of what is there to try to get better value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the contributions from the Fine Gael Party.  They appear to be far too close to the development and industry lobby.  I would have thought that they had a duty in the House to provide some kind of balance to the Fianna Fáil attitude to development, but that is their right and privilege, while it gives me no pleasure to say that.</P>
      <P>I accept what Fine Gael say about section 4s and I agree with what Deputy Finucane said, that on the whole Fine Gael have a much better record than the Fianna Fáil Party when it comes to section 4s.  The type of section 4s to which I am referring are, of course where individuals are trying to get planning permission for something which has been turned down by the local authority planners.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party &mdash; Comhaontas Glas &mdash; I wish to state that I have grave problems with many of the provisions of this Bill.  In particular, I have a problem with the main purpose of the Bill which is to reduce to four months the time allowed to An Bord Pleanála to determine appeals.  The Minister referred to the need to avoid delays in the planning system.  At the risk of being pedantic I would make the point that delays are an inevitable feature of the planning system. Time has to be taken in this area, particularly with major projects.  I would have thought if the Minister had prefixed &ldquo;delays&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;undue&rdquo; this might meet the Bill, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the House to a typical example of the way in which planning permission can be granted hastily.  I refer to the application by Merril Dow or a chemical plant in east Cork.  This application was dealt with in the same time frame as an application by a nearby farmer for a hay shed.  I am not convinced by the Minister who in blaming existing planning procedures for what he describes as &ldquo;a serious competitive disadvantage&rdquo; in attracting industry.  The Minister refers to the fact that the proportion of cases on hand for more than six months now stands at 2.8 per cent. This, of course, is very commendable in <Col N="581" /> so far as it is in no one's interest that the system should get snowed under with appeals.  It would seems to me that this Bill was drawn up in the context of the serious delays which were occurring at the board, but the Minister has now clearly been overtaken by events and it removes the main <i>raison d'tre</i> for the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that appeal decisions are not rushed in order to give preference to quantity over quality as often careful decisions are needed to resolve complex cases.  In this context the board's comments in their 1985 annual report on page 5 are relevant:</P>
    <P>Many appeals are probably cases that have raised difficult issues at local level arising from the implementation of the provisions of the Development plan, the protection of amenities and the need to reconcile proposals with the proper planning and development of the area.  A number raise contentious Third Party Issues.  These cases by their nature require more time for processing and careful consideration, a factor which is sometimes overlooked in criticisms of the system </P>
    <P>This is clearly a case where the board at the time were more than satisfied with the time scales, and the Minister certainly has not made the case for any change.</P>
    <P>Another problem we have with the Bill is section 4 which provides that all appeals must be lodged within one month of the decision to grant planning permission.  This, in itself, is not unreasonable but what is unreasonable is that even in the most complex case the entire grounds for the appeal must be stated and no further grounds can be introduced at a later stage &mdash; perhaps at an oral hearing.  This period is quite unrealistic as in many cases an environmental impact statement would be required.  The Minister in his speech strays from the Bill and makes references to the planning application stage.  He refers to the recommendation of the special task force on employment.  I would now ask him to publish the report compiled by Frank Benson and Associates on the planning <Col N="582" /> system presented to the Industry Policy Review Group.  What is really needed now is a complete review of the planning laws.  I would remind the House that the Principal Act &mdash; the 1963 Planning Act &mdash; is nearly 30 years old.  Apart from the major revision of legislation comprised in the 1976 amending Act, there has been no substantial review of planning law as such.  There are many defects in existing planning legislation, in particular, the concept of &ldquo;retention planning&rdquo;.  This was intended as a transitional measure in 1963, in other words, a planning application process where somebody can apply for permission to retain a structure or even a group of structures &mdash; as has happened in the case of several houses in Bray and Bundoran, County Donegal &mdash; once they have been built.</P>
    <P>This is an outrageous situation.  The developers know they need planning permission but they proceed to build and then plead that as the building is now up, and does not look too bad and the structure must remain.  That type of carry on is totally unacceptable in this day and age.  We all know this device is still used by developers as a means to evade enforcement action.  Local authorities often encourage people to go for &ldquo;retention&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;regularise&rdquo; their situation.  The major problem is that there are no significant penalties if one breaches the terms of any planning permission.</P>
    <P>There is no definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; of a local authority development plan in the legislation.  This means that the local authority managers define what is &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;.  For example, Howth House, in County Dublin was in a residentially zoned area, yet Dublin County Council, on the advice of the manager, gave planning permission for a significant commercial development there without going through the process of a &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;.  There is no protection for &ldquo;conservation areas&rdquo; which aim to protect groups of architecturally and historically important buildings such as the squares within Trinity College or Kenilworth Square, Dublin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> Developments by the State and local authorities are exempt from the normal planning process and thus cannot be formally appealed.  In particular I would like to refer to the latest antics of the Office of Public Works who seem determined to impose these so-called interpretative centres in wilderness areas or areas of extreme sensitivity, such as those at Luggala, Mullaghmore, Dunquin and the Boyne Valley.  It is quite appalling that these faceless Fascists should be able to completely ignore the views of elected representatives, residents, such groups as An Taisce, the Mountaineering Council of Ireland and local environmental groups in the relevant areas.  A change in the law is absolutely essential to make these people amenable to democratic control.</P>
    <P>There is no statutory recognition for action area plans for a defined area within a wider local authority functional area, for example, Athlone environs plan prepared by Roscommon County Council.  No planning permission is required for the demolition of buildings that are not used as dwellings, unless they are listed buildings.  Many of our finest commercial and industrial buildings are not listed, for example, mill complexes at Saggart, County Dublin, where I worked for three years, and I know it well.</P>
    <P>I seem to be reciting a list of problems but I am afraid there are a great many problems with the existing planning procedures.  Local authorities are not bound to provide an opportunity for public examination and comment before deciding on &ldquo;submissions in compliance&rdquo; by developers in relation to conditions and there is no appeal process if somebody considers the condition is not in compliance with the original permission. There is no obligation on applicants or local authorities to notify their immediate neighbours about their planning applications which could affect their neighbours.  This is a source of considerable friction at present.  There is no obligation on an applicant to provide a notice on site as well as in a newspaper, a very simple matter.  An Bord Pleanála are not <Col N="584" /> obliged to make available their inspector's reports for public examination and have strenuously resisted doing so.  That is a very important example of the lack of any proper freedom of information in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a uniform standard of definition for scheduled towns, say, a town being a centre of population with over 1,000 people.  For example, Rush is a schedule town in County Dublin but Dundrum and Shankill are not.</P>
    <P>The application of financial incentives under the Urban Renewal Act, 1986, should be dependent on the preparation of a special local authority development plan for those areas involving public consultation.</P>
    <P>Now, I must deal with the doubling of planning appeal fees by the Minister's predecessor.  The new charges represent a 100 per cent increase in two years in a period when inflation has been less than 10 per cent.  The previous increase in 1990 represented a 38 per cent increase in just over five years.  Planning appeal fees have increased by 278 per cent since 1984.  I have received representations from An Taisce who are very concerned that those on relatively low fixed incomes, such as people dependent on social welfare or pensioners, will be unable to afford the third party appeal charge of £100 in order to exercise their right to appeal a local authority decision which could adversely affect their dwelling, amenities or the whole neighbourhood to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>If the Government insist on persisting with this colossal increase in planning appeal fees there is a real danger that by the time the Environmental Protection Agency is operational &mdash; whenever that will be &mdash; the public will no longer be able to afford to participate in the planning appeal process since individual submissions to an appeal once somebody else has initiated an appeal have also been doubled to £30 representing a 300 per cent increase since 1984.</P>
    <P>These increases are pricing out any democracy in the planning appeal process to the ordinary people, to residents' and tenants' association and leaving this the <Col N="585" /> reserve of the well off and wealthy sections of our community.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that at least a proportion of the appeal fee should be refundable for a bona fide application? Perhaps one could go further and provide that all the appeal fee be refunded.</P>
    <P>In cases where An Bord Pleanála grant planning permission they are entitled to ignore that such planning permission is in &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; of the development plan.  This in my view makes a complete nonsense of the development plan, if An Bord Pleanála can simply ignore the fact that it exists.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unrealistic in its desire to determine almost all planning appeals within four months.  This unrealistic approach is compounded by restricting every party to a one submission approach.  Unfortunately these negative features far outweigh the positive features of attempting to provide a one month appeal period for all parties and of requiring the local authority reports to be available to the public from the date of decision.</P>

      <P>I intend to support the development of our National Museum to the fullest extent that resources will allow.  Their work of preserving and presenting the national collections is of crucial importance to our cultural life.  Since 1987 the grant-in-aid has been almost doubled and improvement works costing nearly £2.2 million have been carried out.  The capital programme at the museum will continue with proposed projects costing a further £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a feasibility study has recently been completed for a building at <Col N="587" /> the Custom House Docks to house the decorative arts collection.  I will also encourage the museum's director and staff to assist local museums by way of advice and the loan of some of its artifacts on a temporary or permanent basis where suitable locations are provided.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and congratulate him on his appointment.  There are about six million items in the National Museum collection.

      <P>The Deputy has asked a very specific question and I will be glad to get that information for him if he puts down a separate question or contacts me directly.  The director's plan to ensure that artefacts are displayed regionally and locally is to be encouraged.  This type of development is one I would support. It is important to present the national collection locally.  The proposed capital investment of a further £2 million will ensure that type of development takes place.</P>

      <P>I welcome the National Museum's plan to open a Famine museum at Strokestown in County Roscommon in my constituency.  What further plans exist for decentralising the museum?  There are at least six major archaeological sites which are very poorly developed and would have no interpretation facilities for a visitor.  Does the Minister accept that it would be good policy to have branches of the National Museum and interpretative centres sponsored by the National Museum at these sites?</P>

      <P>The Deputy refers to a particular project in Stokestown House.  I am aware that the director and his deputy have been in touch with the people behind this project.  It is a project which would warrant my support.  Other plans <Col N="588" /> for relocation relate to the Custom House Docks site.  Part of the museum's collection is to be in a purpose-built museum to be created there.  This purpose-built accommodation will place the museum in the forefront of modern museum development.  Funds have been allocated for this project and a feasibility study has recently been submitted to this Department.  The type of development here could relate to folk life or other projects, such as a coach museum or a museum of the decorative arts.  I have had a look at some of the plans for that site.  The project has exciting potential.</P>

How soon does he expect the project at the Custom House Docks to begin?  Did I understand him to say that a feasibility study has been completed and is with his Department?  Will he clarify the position?  Many of us will remember that when the Custom House Docks proposal was being promoted all these matters appeared to be settled and clearly in place and it seemed that there would be a whole range of cultural and other developments.  None of this has happened.</P>

I am not in a position to give a timescale but I will pursue this project on a personal basis and I hope to get in touch with the Deputy as soon as I have specific details on the matter.  I did talk about regionalisation, about making our national collection accessible to people locally, which is one aspect, but there are other very basic major capital works planned &mdash; the heating system at the National Museum, creating improved <Col N="589" /> fire escapes; and at the National History Museum, roof repairs.

      <P>It is a question relating to the four divisions in the National Museum.  Perhaps there should be another division.  I know there are four divisions covering folk life, Irish antiquities, art, industry and so on.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be proper that the national monuments section, at present the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, be a division of the National Museum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to the need for major improvements.  I referred earlier to major plans for improvement works.  For example, I talked about the necessary control of the heating system, the sums involved there ranging from £750,000 to £1 million and the final phase of the roof repairs costing approximately £800,000.  Deputies will see there will be major works undertaken in the coming year.  From my early contacts with the people in my Department I am satisfied that a substantial capital programme has been prepared at the National Museum which will continue so that the investment, which really began to improve from 1987 onwards, will be continued.  The Deputy's suggestion is something I would have to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the basic regulation on the management and conservation of fishery resources in Community waters&mdash;Council Regulation No. 170/83 &mdash; the EC Commission was required to present a report to the Council on the fisheries sector before the end of 1991.  That report was circulated in December last.  The purpose of the report is to stimulate discussion and to provide guidance for a debate in the various Community institutions prior to the tabling by the Commission in 1992 of proposals for the regulation of the fisheries sector in the period 1993-2002.</P>
      <P>In the Commission's extensive report, at present being considered by a Council working group, there is clear acknowledgement of the need for special attention and concentrated support from Community resources and instruments to improving economic and social cohesion in the Community's more remote regions where fishing accounts for a substantial proportion of jobs and income.</P>
      <P>During the coming discussions on the Common Fisheries Policy review at the Council of Fisheries Ministers, I will be pressing the Commission &mdash; as part of Ireland's case for a better deal in fishing &mdash; to bring forward specific and meaningful proposals that will reflect, in relation to the fisheries sector, the Treaty commitments on cohesion.</P>
      <P>I am encouraged by the report's commitment to economic and social cohesion in the context of disadvantaged fishing communities.  Ireland, as an Objective 1 region, in which significant sectors of the fishing industry are considerably under-developed, should be entitled to priority treatment under any measures designed to bring about cohesion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened to hear the Minister say that special attention is being devoted to this, one of our greatest resources.  Bearing in mind the Community commitment to social cohesion, in the light of the fact that sea fishing contributes 0.5 per cent only of our GDP and fishing overall 1 per cent of our jobs, and that in the most disadvantaged areas, <Col N="592" /> would he say whether investment over and above the other quotas could be made here, particularly in downstream, land-based jobs, affording maximum value to landed fish where there is a huge gap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The review is a major one affecting all our coastal communities and our overall fishing industry.  Indeed, the future viability of such coastal communities is dependent on it.  I am aware that it is dependent on having realistic, workable fishing quotas and on our having the fishing capacity, the capacity in boats, to catch all the fish available to us, including those we are not catching at present, approximately £10 million worth which we would hope to catch with different boats.  All that will be a priority as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>I realise that in some coastal communities employment created by the fishing industry and its ancillary activities can amount to 25 per cent of overall employment.  Therefore, it is vital that we get a good package.  I might add it will not be easy because various restrictions and constraints obtain already in relation to conservation as distinct from development, but it will be my intention to ensure that the maximum quantity of fish is processed as far as possible down the line. For example, there is an initial processing stage when the product can be exported, or there can be more value-added processing, all of which requires investment.</P>
      <P>From the harbours and fishing facilities I have visited and seen so far, it is quite clear that many projects await investment, in which the fishing communities are prepared to invest but for which they need the requisite funds.  I will be very committed to obtaining those funds for them.  Indeed I see the doubling of the Structural Funds as a key element in this. It will be our task to get as much of those funds as possible having got the requisite recognition of the importance to us of our fishing industry.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to (1) the serious concern expressed by Irish fishermen at the continuing breach of EC fishery regulations by UK-registered Spanish trawlers off our coast and (2) the allegations that landings of fish have exceeded the two ton per month quota at Castletownbere and that no departmental inspectors have been present when these landings have occurred; if he intends to take action to remedy this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of, and share, the concerns of fishermen about the activities off our coasts of UK-registered Spanish fishing boats who disregard Community fishing control regulations.</P>
      <P>The operations of all fishing boats, including those of UK-registered Spanish boats, are monitored closely at sea by the Naval Service and onshore by my Department's sea fishery officers.  Over the past three years 16 of these boats have been detained for suspected infringements of Community fishery regulations.  Fifteen of the boats in question were subsequently charged with fishery offences.  To date seven cases have been dealt with in the courts and fines totalling £144,000 have been levied.</P>
      <P>The enforcement of UK boat quotas, established for the purposes of managing quota allocations, is a matter primarily for the UK authorities.  The Irish protection services do not have a function with regard to the monitoring of internal UK management regimes.  My Department's sea fishery officers when inspecting landings from UK-registered Spanish boats are concerned mainly with ensuring that the boats comply with all relevant Community regulations.  It is, of course, open to the UK authorities to take action against any of these boats on the basis of periodic returns which my Department send to the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not accept any suggestion that my Department have not been monitoring landings by these boats at Castletownbere.  Under an arrangement with the boats' agents, my Department's sea fishery officer at the port is informed in advance of all landings and despite an <Col N="594" /> increase in recent months in the number of landings, periodic monitoring has continued to take place.</P>
    <P>The level of monitoring is designed to ensure that Community regulations are being adhered to by the UK-registered boats landing in the port.  The position will be kept under constant review and I am prepared to consider strengthening these arrangements if necessary.</P>
    <P>Boats fishing off our coasts which land their catches at our ports help the local economy by creating employment onshore and also make it easier to monitor the activities in our waters.</P>

Is he aware that the Harbours Act, 1946, is a major bureaucratic stranglehold on the efficiency of Irish ports?  Is he further aware that Irish ports are three times more expensive than their counterparts in Northern Ireland resulting in a huge flow of exports, of traffic and of freight out of this country through non-republican ports in the South?  Can he now give a commitment to update the Harbours Act, 1946, as a matter of Government priority?</P>

      <P>The task of the review group was to review the policy and the legislation.  I realise the legislation needs updating.  We do not have very long to wait at this stage as I am satisfied the report will be available before the end of March.  We will be in a position then to take action which I expect will be along the lines the Deputy would be seeking. The question of how expensive a particular port is depends on many factors. Of course, the nearer one is to the other side is a help because there may be a great volume of traffic coming and going on a regular basis.  The current investment which is taking place in ports is designed to improve access and make the ports more efficient and more competitive.  A more substantive discussion can take place as soon as we have that report.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the plans, if any, he has in this year's budget for increasing investment in fisheries research and development, considering that Ireland has the lowest investment in this area within the European Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision has been made under my Department's Vote for 1992 for the expenditure of £2.4 million on marine research and development.  This represents an increase of 140 per cent over 1991 expenditure in the area and reflects the funding provision this year for my Department's measures under the marine sub-programme of the STRIDE &mdash; Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development in Europe &mdash; operational programme for Ireland. The expenditure is being 75 per cent funded by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the STRIDE programme for Ireland gives particular, and very welcome, recognition to marine research and development and will allow for a total investment of £8 million in the area over the next two years.  The agreement of the EC to co-finance marine investment under the programme is a recognition of the development potential as well as the acknowledged need to apply additional resources to <Col N="598" /> secure and develop that potential.  The planned total investment under the marine sub-programme of STRIDE addresses the need to build up national capability in marine science and technology which will underpin further development in the sector, including the fisheries and aquaculture sector.</P>
    <P>My Department's expenditure measures under the STRIDE programme fall under three main headings: (1) investment in the Department's fisheries research centre to provide essential equipment to support the fishing and aquaculture industries; (2) the establishment and equipping of a marine data centre under the Department's aegis as a national centre for a marine data management and (3) investment in the marine research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i> to provide specialised equipment for the national marine research vessel.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures directly applicable to my Department's research and development effort, the STRIDE programme includes funding in other centres of marine expertise as follows: (1) investment in the Martin Ryan marine science institute at UCG to fit out laboratories and facilities with a full range of oceanographic equipment; (2) investment in the coastal engineering and resource management centre at UCC to equip the hydraulics laboratory and coastal management unit to European standards.</P>
    <P>I am certain that this structural investment over the next two years in key areas of marine expertise will strongly support research and development in the fisheries sector and will contribute to its continued development.</P>
    <P>I would stress that the funding now being made available through the STRIDE programme will complement existing expenditure which my Department already commits to (1) fish stock assessment and research; (2) fish pathology; (3) aquaculture monitoring and research and (4) water chemistry.  Under my departmental Vote for 1992, in addition to funding under STRIDE, the fisheries research centre has an allocation of £750,000 from which a wide range of <Col N="599" /> activities under these headings are funded.  While available resources in terms of both staff and facilities have been deployed to maximum benefit up to now the welcome additional investment through STRIDE will greatly assist the objective of enhancing and underpinning activites in the fisheries sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is scandalous that there has been a lack of investment in marine research and development over the years?  At 2.3 per cent of the total Government budget for research in all fields, it is one of the lowest in the European Community.  Can the Minister say if most of the investment for this year will be directed to the marine institute and when data on research will come on stream to help us fight our case in Europe and underpin development in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific information on when data will come on stream given that the centre is only being set up at this stage.  I agree with the Deputy when she says that there has been a lack of research and that this data should underpin the development which we know is possible in the fisheries and aquaculture industries in developing and marketing new products to which we referred earlier.  If we do not have technology of a sufficiently high standard in competing internationally we cannot expect to win markets and outlets and hold on to them. I agree with what the Deputy has to say in that regard but that will be one of the benefits to be gained under the STRIDE programme.  Indeed, the fisheries industry has done particularly well under that programme by comparison with any other sector.  The other sectors covered under the programme are the environment, forestry and food in general. The amount allocated to the marine is by far the greatest.  A total of 10.6 million ECUs has been allocated to the marine, 4.4 million ECUs to the environment, 1.33 million ECUs to forestry and 0.88 million ECUs to food in general.  As the <Col N="600" /> Deputy can see, there is a heavy emphasis in the programme on marine research.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline, (a) the number of licences which have been issued for the removal of sand over the last ten years, (b) the beaches involved and (c) the amount of sand removed on each occasion; whether he intends to issue any further such licences this year; and if so, if he will outline the amount of sand and the locations involved.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in a table which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.  The table schedules the permissions granted under section 3 (3) of the Foreshore Act, 1933 for the removal of sand from the State foreshore since 1 January 1982, with particulars of the locations involved, the dates of authorisation and the amount of sand authorised under each licence.  Such licences are temporary in nature and are for no more than six weeks duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In total, 211 such licences were granted in the period in question.  Details of licences are forwarded to the relevant local authority and Garda Síochána as being best placed to monitor compliance with the terms of the said licences.  The <Col N="602" /> preservation and protection of our beaches and seashore is now an important environmental priority.</P>
    <P>Apart from direct amenity losses such removals can have a deleterious impact on the seashore generally.  The small scale removal of sand for various purposes from the foreshore in many localities around the coast is a long established practice.  In some instances, indeed, rights to remove beach material may have been gained in common law, based on the customary exercise of those rights.  It is generally acknowledged, however, that advances in technology have increased the practical scope for large scale removal of beach material and I am aware that this practice has increased substantially, in pace and scale in recent years.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that any further licences will only be issued where I am fully satisfied on the basis of consultation with, <i>inter alia,</i> local authorities, that the removal involved would pose no threat to the local environment and is otherwise in the public interest. There are no such applications on hand in my Department at present.  In addition, I will be deploying all the existing powers available to me under the 1933 Act to protect beaches from large scale depredations.  These control mechanisms include the serving of prohibitory notices or the making of prohibitory orders. These will be utilised to the full as, for example, in the case of Ballybunion, County Kerry, where a prohibitory order was made in 1990 and a 1977 licence to remove beach material was revoked last year.</P>
    <P>I am working on proposals for Government which are designed to strengthen substantively the State's capacity to protect the foreshore and seashore against damage from removals of beach material. The envisaged approach, which has been the subject of detailed consultation with other Departments, includes the creation of appropriate offences and penalties for unauthorised removals.  The question of enforcement will also be comprehensively addressed as will the key question of the use of mechanical diggers and the like.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply; I intend to study it.  I am glad he referred to Ballybunion because the situation is very bad there.  Is the Minister aware that, since the licence was revoked, sand has been removed from the beach?  Will he agree that the present fine of £10 for removing sand is totally inadequate and that we urgently need legislation in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the same regulations apply in the sense that if sand is taken from the foreshore it is under the aegis of the Foreshore Act and the same conditions apply.  Over the year people took small quantities for very simple purposes which had virtually no effect. However, the problem has increased in recent years since the advent of mechanical diggers which means that people take substantial quantities.  This must be controlled.</P>

      <P>In his former position as Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Woods, is aware that some western farmers, particularly those living near the sea, use sand as a mixture for compost and fertiliser purposes.  Is that covered by the Act to which the Minister referred?</P>

      <P>Much of that sand comes from inland sources as well as being taken from the beach.  Obviously licences apply if anyone wants to use sand for the kind of purpose to which the Deputy referred; it would depend on the quantity and the position in relation to the foreshore and the beach.  There are substantial problems in relation to many beaches which must be tackled and I am keen to address them.  We will have an opportunity in this House to discuss the proposals being prepared and various elements will be taken into consideration at that time.</P>

      <Quest>if he will reconsider his attitude to the request for compensation from the skipper/owner of the Marie McClements which was dragged along the water by a submarine on 27 November 1989, causing considerable damage to the trawler, particularly as it is impossible for the individual in question to take legal action against the British Government on this issue.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very seriously concerned about the dangers that submarines pose to shipping.  At a recent meeting of the International Maritime Organisation General Assembly, a resolution was proposed by Ireland on the avoidance by submerged submarines of fishing vessels and their gear and was passed unanimously.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the resolution was twofold: first, to ensure that submarines navigating through areas where vessels are known to fish use all available means for determining the presence of such vessels and their fishing gear; and second, to ensure that a submerged submarine, if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its fishing gear is available, will avoid that fishing vessel and any fishing gear connected to it.  The International Maritime Organisation &mdash; the specialised agency of the United Nations which deals with the safety of shipping and the prevention of pollution from ships &mdash; is asking its members to bring these recommendations to the attention of submarine commanders and to develop local agreements to promote safety in areas used by submarines and fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular incident to which the Deputy refers, it would be inappropriate for the Government to intervene in this case as claims for compensation in respect of damage to fishing vessels are essentially a civil matter.  I understand that no contact was made by the skipper of the vessel at the time of the incident with the marine rescue co-ordination centre.  My Department were notified of the incident on the following day by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.</P>
      <P>The <i>Marie McClements</i> was not registered in Ireland in November 1989 and under inernational maritime law and practice, it is the flag State of a vessel which takes any necessary action relating to a vessel registered under its flag.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the information.  However, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, said on 21 May 1991 in the Official Report, columns 1,599 and 1,600 that in <Col N="610" /> cases involving unidentified vessels the Government take whatever action is open to them to assist identification to facilitate any action for damages that may be taken.  Arising from that, will the Minister say what action the Government have taken to assist the skipper in this instance to identify the operator of the submarine so that he may seek civil recompense?  Does the Minister propose to assist the skipper practically and, if so, what measures do the Government have to stop the irresponsible activity of submarines in Irish waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements were made at the time and subsequently.  No contact was made by the skipper at the time of the incident and the Department were not made aware of it until Mr. Doyle contacted the Irish Fishermen's Organisation.  Subsequently my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs received correspondence from the person's solicitor inquiring about compensation.  The reply indicated that claims for compensation in respect of damage to fishing vessels are essentially a civil matter and that the most obvious course would be to pursue the claim through private insurance.  I do not think there was enough information to establish identity and it is very different to get information after the event.</P>

If so, what action ensued? What is the status of the Minister's reply this afternoon when he said he is urging self-discipline, if you like, arising from the resolution of the International Maritime Organisation?  If the Government cannot identify what submarines are operating, can they not do anything about unidentified submarines and not help in specific cases?  Did the Minister's offer of assistance in identifying the submarine involved mean nothing as far as the skipper is concerned?</P>

I know the Deputy is standing in for Deputy Ryan, but the question referred to compensation, which I answered.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the various elements of these questions, I would like to stress the importance of the special whitefish boat licensing scheme for the further development of the Irish fishing industry.  Prior to its introduction, it had become apparent that we could not hope realistically to catch a significant proportion of our unused whitefish quota allocations off the west and south west <Col N="613" /> coasts, valued at about £10 million annually, unless a number of suitable all-weather whitefish boats, capable of fishing in safety in our deeper offshore waters, could be brought into the fleet. The scheme, which provided for the entry of a maximum of 20 boats, was designed essentially to fill this gap.  A key feature of the scheme was a provision for the phasing in over a five year period of the now established licensing priciple of 100 per cent capacity replacement.</P>
    <P>The response to the scheme from fishermen was very encouraging and a total of 50 applications was received.  The number of applications from counties Donegal, Kerry and Cork was 19, 15 and nine, respectively.  The geographical distribution of the remaining applications was County Galway, one; County Clare, one; County Wexford, one; County Dublin, two and County Louth, two. Of the 20 licences approved, four were allocated to County Donegal, ten to County Kerry and six to County Cork.</P>
    <P>Eight of the successful applicants had already and acquired boats before licences were granted.  Of the boats in question, five had been detained in 1991 for illegal fishing.  BIM assistance in relation to development projects was given to two of the successful applicants during 1991.</P>
    <P>The legal basis for the issue of the licences is derived from section 222B, inserted by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    <P>The principal criteria used in assessing applications were the following: compliance with the terms of the scheme as regards size of boat etc.; assessment of the area of operation proposed for the vessel, the target species and the fishing methods to be employed; economic viability; economic link with the Irish fishing industry; applicant's record in fishing; adequate infrastructure at the applicant's designated landing port; job creation potential of project and regional balance, where possible, in the distribution of licences.</P>
    <P>All the offers of licences made have been taken up and eight boats have already entered the fleet.  The success of <Col N="614" /> the scheme in achieving its objectives will be carefully monitored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Can the Minister confirm that of the 19 applicants from County Donegal, four were successful; of the 15 applicants from County Kerry, ten were successful and of the nine applicants from County Cork, six were successful?  In view of what he said about regional balance, can the Minister explain why the success rate of County Donegal applicants &mdash; less than 25 per cent &mdash; was so much less than the success rate of applicants from other counties &mdash; approximately 67 per cent in each case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was likely that the licences would be taken up by people who were going to fish off the south-west, west and north-west coasts.  The criteria were applied across the board &mdash; these can only be described as objective criteria &mdash; and the allocations were made on the basis of these.  Beyond that I could not give details of the individuals involved. Four licences were allocated to County Donegal, ten to County Kerry and six to County Cork.  I am aware that other people in County Donegal are very anxious to get licences and that they would make use of them.  However, the licences were allocated on the basis of the criteria set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that eight of the successful applicants had vessels brought in before the licences were granted.  Can the Minister say how this squares with the principle of 100 per cent fleet replacement and Community rules?  As the Minister said, five of the vessels in question had been arrested as they were stateless vessles.  One of these vessels was arrested on three occasions during 1991 while another vessel was arrested only two weeks before the licences were issued.  Can the Minister indicate how, if at all, this squares with the requirement for 100 per cent fleet replacement and the proper application of EC rules in the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the fact that a boat had previously received a penalty would debar it from further participation in the fishing fleet or fishing generally. With regard to the allocation of licences, as the Deputy will be aware these were made by my predecessor on the basis of the criteria set out.  People who do not receive a licence will naturally be disappointed.  I understand that some applicants may not have been in a position to take up a licence but obviously others were and naturally they were disappointed.  This is something about which I would be concerned, and I will look into the matter.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I should also like to congratulate my constituency colleague, Deputy Gallgher, on his appointment as Minister of State.  I am sorry I did not have the opportunity to welcome the Minister to County Donegal last week.  Perhaps his office will do me the courtesy of letting me know in advance the next time he intends visiting County Donegal.  Any announcements or commitments the Minister has given to the people of County Donegal, whether to Mná na Mara, Killybegs or Burtonport, will be carefully monitored by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was not responsible for the allocation of these licences and we know who was responsible.  The <Col N="616" /> allocation of the licences incurred significant media comment at home and abroad &mdash; it was seen as a bit of a scam. The four licences given to County Donegal were regarded as a fig leaf when compared to the number of licences given to other counties.  Will the Minister say if the regulations governing the issuing of licences to County Donegal fishermen preclude them from fishing in area six?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem for fishermen who are precluded under the regulations from fishing in area six.  I am looking into the matter at present.  I discovered from talking to some of these people that although they have the licence to go further afield they naturally feel that they should be able to continue to fish in this area.  That is a matter I will consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the serious cutback in capital development to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, he will outline the plans he has to encourage and promote the fishing industry, particularly the shellfish industry in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government remain committed to the continued development of the fishing industry, including the shellfish sector.  In this context my Department have requested Bord Iascaigh Mhara to review their capital development programmes in order to <Col N="619" /> ensure that optimum use is made of allocations provided for capital purposes. With this objective in mind, national capital grant levels have been reduced to the minimum necessary to attract continued funding from Community aid schemes.</P>
      <P>The total funds made available from the Exchequer to BIM this year, which amount to IR£7.55 million, constitute a very considerable commitment by the State to the development of the industry. I will, however, keep the level of funding under review.  Should it emerge that genuine sustainable development opportunities will be missed because of any lack of finance, I will consider whatever possibilities may be available to ensure that such difficulties will be overcome.</P>
      <P>As regards the shellfish industry in particular the extent and nature of available funding will be reviewed with BIM to ensure that grant aid is directed as effectively as possible in order to maximise take-up of Community assistance, and to stimulate further commercial growth in the sector to the greatest extent achievable.  Production of the key shellfish species, which are mussels, oysters and clams, remains on a strong growth path.  Output was over 20,000 tonnes in 1991 with employment reaching over 1,000 jobs of which about 300 are full time.  The industry offers a significant source of supplementary income for many people in disadvantaged coastal areas.  It is envisaged that production will continue to expand and has the potential to reach 35,000 tonnes by 1996 with commensurate increases in employment.  The commercial development of new species such as scallop and abalone is also showing promise and will, it is expected, contribute to overall output over the next few years.</P>
      <P>To maximise the potential of the sector, and bearing in mind existing budgetary constraints, I have directed BIM to give the highest priority to assisting the shellfish industry in the context of the agency's aquaculture programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>An investment programme in commercial ports covering the years 1989 to 1993 and costing approximately £69 million is under way at present.  These investments are being funded in part by <Col N="621" /> the EC through the Operational Programme on Peripherality.  The programme is assisting projects at the ports of Cork, Dublin, Rosslare and Waterford and at seven other important local ports. The Operational Programme on Peripherality provides that harbour authorities can receive EC aid of up to 50 per cent of their approved project costs.</P>
      <P>The current investment programme will help our key ports to offset the effects of Ireland's peripheral location so that our exporters and importers do not suffer competitive disadvantages in relation to their European counterparts.  It will also ensure that Ireland has sufficient port facilities and services to meet the anticipated increase in trade following completion of the Single Market.</P>
      <P>Before the end of 1993 I am hopeful that the Cohesion Fund as agreed at Maastricht will be operational and will provide additional funding for ports.  In that context I will shortly be inviting the harbour authorities to prepare plans for further development in the context of the post Maastricht situation.</P>
      <P>I also propose to review the fishery harbour development requirements in this context.  Post-1993 I am hopeful that Structural/Cohesion Funds will support even greater investment in ports and harbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For commercial ports a good deal of further development could still take place.  What is already happening under the existing programme constitutes substantial change and will have a major impact, but there is a great deal of further work to be done.  Unfortunately, development that is taking place in several of our ports also involves harbour improvement, which makes an extra demand on funds and on the grants that will be available through both the <Col N="622" /> Structural and the Cohesion Funds.  I believe that there is a great deal of work to be done in that area, that we can use as much money as we get, and that there is great scope for development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the 50 per cent level of EC grant to harbour authorities puts a great strain on the finances of authorities, in that there is no finance available other than from the authorities commercial activity in harbours?  Perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of increasing the level of grant to 75 per cent, as is received by local authorities from the EC Structural Fund for road construction.  Does the Minister not agree that harbour authorities and local authorities should receive the same level of grant aid for similar construction work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will realise from what I have been saying that I feel very much that way about the issue myself in that there is a great deal of work to be done, that the work being done is having a tremendous effect and that it is increasing the capacity of ports to create jobs within the port area itself and to assist in job creation much further throughout the country.  I have already begun an attempt to gain a 75 per cent grant on the grounds that Irish ports have suffered from a lack of investment for a long time, that the operational programme has been very successful in redressing the neglect in investment and that Northern Ireland ports, which are in competition with Southern ports, do get grants of up to 75 per cent.  I shall make a very strong case along those lines.  I consider the case to be very important and I accept the point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>We all concede the necessity to provide some balance in the need to process appeals within a reasonable time to facilitate development. However, having given the matter great thought, I have no doubt that this Bill does not provide that balance.  The Bill is weighed very much in favour of developers and against objectors.  It gives insufficient time to enable major projects to be properly evaluated.  Accordingly, I will be opposing this Bill.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, ar an gcéad dul síos, mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí uile a labhair i bhfábhar an <Col N="668" /> Bhille seo.  Ní raibh ach Teachta amháin a labhair ina choinne.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have taken part in the debate, which I have found constructive and informative.  Deputies' contributions have raised a number of important issues relating to the Bill and, as far as possible, I will endeavour to respond to them.  Reference was made in the course of the debate also, to some very general planning matters.  I would remind Deputies, however, that the Bill is intended, as indicated by its Long Title, to deal only with the legal framework within which An Bord Pleanála operate and legal proceedings relating to planning matters.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, to address all these general matters in the present context. Neverthless, I have noted the various views expressed and they can be considered in the context of any future proposals for change to planning law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested in his contribution that the Bill takes short-cuts and that its constitutionality might accordingly be open to question in certain respects.  I do not accept that this is so. Every effort has been made to ensure that the streamlining measures proposed in the Bill will not interfere with the essential fairness and thoroughness of the appeals system nor with the rights of participants and I am advised that the proposals are acceptable in legal terms.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore contended that the Bill will tip the balance of the appeals process in favour of development interests, and Deputy Cosgrave suggested that the new procedures might put voluntary bodies in difficulties.  However, we have sought to strike a fair and just balance between all relevant interests.  I am satisfied that the Bill will not confer an unfair advantage on any particular sector and that it will not inhibit the exercise of the right to appeal to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies expressed differing views about the proposed requirement to submit the full grounds of appeal within the appeal period.  Deputy Ferris was of the opinion that such a requirement would aid the effective operation of the appeals process, but Deputy Gilmore <Col N="669" /> thought that it would be too onerous. This requirement is a necessary element of a streamlined appeals system.  It was not put into the Bill lightly and I am satisfied that it will be possible to make a full and detailed appeal within the period allowed.  I would remind Deputies that the Bill takes account of the effects of the new obligation by proposing to increase the appeal period for &ldquo;third parties&rdquo; from three weeks to a month.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the question of resources for the board, and suggested that it might be necessary to remove the ministerial control over staffing levels.  I would point out, however, that section 10 of the 1976 Planning Act is simply the standard form of provision in relation to the staffing of bodies such as the board.  Moreover this ministerial power has not given rise to problems for the board in practice because any staffing proposals received by my Department in recent years have received a favourable response.</P>
    <P>As for the specific resources implications of the Bill, it is true that the new four-month time objective for determining appeals will place certain additional pressures on the board. However, these will be offset to a large extent by the reduction in the amount of work in individual cases caused by the Bill's streamlining measures.  The expectation is, therefore, that the board are not going to need extra resources because of the Bill.  Nevertheless the position will be kept under review to ensure that the board are in a position to operate the new appeal procedures effectively.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore expressed the view that current delays in the board can be attributed largely to lack of resources.  I cannot accept this, because the board have been very well treated in terms of resources in recent years.  The unavoidable fact is that there are aspects of the legal framework governing appeals which inhibit expeditious decision making. Undue delays will not be eliminated unless the law relating to appeals is modified in the manner proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like also to put the record straight about the board's staffing in 1988 <Col N="670" /> and 1989.  The board's annual reports for those years show that there were 59 employees at the end of 1988 and 61 at the end of 1989.  Contrary to what a number of Deputies suggested, the board's staffing actually increased over the two years.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath voiced concern that the proposed new procedures might not allow an appellant to clarify matters arising on an appeal.  Section 9 would give An Bord Pleanála a discretionary power to request a participant in an appeal to make a further submission on any matter which arises during the appeal, exercisable where the board consider it appropriate in the interests of justice to do so.  This power could be used, for example, if the board thought it appropriate in the circumstances of a particular case to offer some person a further opportunity to address a specific issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris inquired about the intent of section 2 (4) which allows the Minister for the Environment to vary or suspend the four-month time objective for determination of cases by the board. I can assure him that this is merely a reserve power, designed for wholly exceptional circumstances which would disrupt the board's operations.  In the normal course the four-month objective will apply and the board will be expected to comply with it in all but the most exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell and others dealt at some length with what they termed the accountability of the board and suggested, among other things, that the board should not have power to initiate material contraventions of a development plan, that the board should be generally answerable to an environment committee of this House, and that a planning authority should be able by a two-thirds majority to call on the board to account for their decisions.</P>
    <P>As regards material contraventions, the position is that the board can, in accordance with section 14 of the 1976 Planning Act, grant permission for development even if the proposed development contravenes materially the <Col N="671" /> development plan of the planning authority concerned.  The board, must however, have regard to the plan and could only grant permission for a development which would contravene the plan if it was satisfied that the proposed development would nevertheless be in conformity with the proper planning and development of the area concerned. Planning authorities also have power to grant permission in material contravention of their plans and it would be unduly restrictive if the appellate body in planning matters did not have such power.  Moreover, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to require the board to consult the body against whose decision an appeal is being determined before exercising this power.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of the board's answerability or accountability, I would point out that the board are a statutory independent body whose powers and duties are clearly laid down by law.  They must discharge their functions in accordance with the law and can be held accountable by the courts for any failure to do so.</P>
    <P>Given the nature and role of the board, I am not convinced that an arrangement such as general answerability to a committee of this House would be appropriate.  It would be wholly inappropriate, in my view, to require the board to appear before planning authorities to explain their decisions, when their principal function is to act as the appeals body in relation to decisions by those same authorities.  Deputies will, of course, be aware that the law requires the board to give the reasons for their decision on an appeal.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Deputies is the question of publishing inspectors' reports on appeals.  I do not view it as necessary or appropriate to require publication of such reports.  The inspector's report is an important input into the determination of an appeal but it has to be borne in mind that responsibility for deciding an appeal rests with the members of An Bord Pleanála.  The board must consider the inspector's <Col N="672" /> report but are not bound by it.  I do not see what is to be gained by publishing these reports, especially since, as I mentioned just now, the board have to give the reasons for their decisions.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the recent increase in the fees payable to An Bord Pleanála in respect of appeals.  I would like to make it very clear that there was no ulterior motive for this increase &mdash; the fees were raised simply to ensure that persons taking part in the appeals process make a reasonable contribution towards the substantial costs of the process.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the new fee levels are unreasonable, or that they will inhibit the exercise of the right of appeal to the board.  I would point out also that, even after the increase, income from fees will meet only a quarter of the board's running costs.</P>
    <P>Reference was made also to alleged suspicions of corruption in the planning process in certain areas.  The planning process must, of course, operate in accordance with the highest standards of probity and integrity, and the Planning Acts make detailed provision for declaration of interests by persons involved in the process.  I wish to add only that it is the clear duty of anybody with evidence of departures from the essential high standards to bring them to the attention of the relevant authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern referred to the need for speedy decisions at planning authority level as well as at the appeals stage.  I am in complete agreement with the Deputy on this.  I have recently conveyed to planning authorities my view that further information should be sought from applicants only where there is a clear need and that as many cases as possible must be decided within the statutory period of two months.  I will be monitoring the position closely and will take whatever action may be necessary to ensure expeditious decisions at planning authority level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave emphasised the importance of special amenity area orders as a means of protecting significant amenity areas.  The making of such orders <Col N="673" /> is, of course, primarily a matter for planning authorities.  If an order was made by a planning authority and confirmed by the Minister for the Environment, An Bord Pleanála would have to take account of it in dealing with appeals relating to the area in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin and others felt that the power to grant permission for retention of development is undesirable in some respects, and that it might encourage some developers to &ldquo;try it on&rdquo;, by building first and seeking permission afterwards.  A survey of planning applications in 1986 undertaken by the environmental research unit showed that 12 per cent of the applications in that year were for retention.  The environmental research unit's report indicates that many of these applications arose from solicitors' inquiries at the time of sale of a property, or were to regularise a situation where a development was not constructed in full conformity with the permission granted. I feel that a power to grant permission for retention is valid in principle for minor instances of non-conformity.  It is not to be seen as a licence for developers to build first and seek permission afterwards.  I would point out that any developer undertaking development without the necessary permission leaves himself open to an order under section 27 of the 1976 Planning Act and to prosecution under section 24 of the 1963 Act.  As I have already indicated, I will be proposing on Committee Stage that the maximum fine for conviction on indictment should be raised from £10,000 to £1 million.  This will represent a very real deterrent to developing without the required permission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, and Deputy Gilmore also, mentioned the importance of good public notice arrangements for planning cases.  I agree fully with them on this and would like to inform the House that this matter is currently being examined as part of a review of planning regulations that is in progress in my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle questioned whether the holding of an oral hearing of an appeal should be at the absolute discretion of An Bord Pleanála.  I consider that it should, <Col N="674" /> because it is only the board who can decide by reference to the facts of a particular case whether the holding of a hearing is necessary or appropriate.  It is for this reason that the Bill proposes to drop the Minister for the Environment's power, which has not been used to date, to make regulations specifying types of cases for which hearings must be held.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche illustrated well the reason why the measures proposed in the Bill are so necessary for the effective operation of the appeals process.  He went on to question the openness of the appeals system, which allows any person to appeal against a planning authority's decision.  The Irish planning system is undoubtedly particularly generous in the opportunities that it allows for public participation.  However, I view this as a good thing, because it ensures that all relevant interests can be heard before important decisions about proposed developments are made.  As I made clear at the outset of the debate, it is not my intention to curtail existing rights of appeal to the board in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland questioned the Bill's underlying approach of trying to speed up the appeals process.  Nevertheless, Deputies generally have indicated their acceptance of the principle that the planning process has to operate in accordance with reasonable timescales.  I would emphasise once more that the new procedures will not compromise the fairness of the process, and that all interests will continue to have a reasonable opportunity to make their case to the board.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by the general acceptance by Deputies that legislative action is essential to ensure that An Board Pleanála can give decisions on appeals within an acceptable period.  I believe that the measures proposed in the Bill are a practical and realistic response to the difficulties posed for the board by the current statutory framework for appeals and I look forward to the continuing co-operation of Deputies in the passage of the Bill through the House.  I am heartened by indications from Deputies that we will be able to put this legislation on the Statute Book at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to amend the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, to provide additional powers to more effectively deal with the problem of dangerous dogs.  The Bill also provides for increased licence fees and for varying licence fees by regulations and it makes amendments to certain provisions of the 1986 Act which have been found in practice to be deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of incidents both here and in Great Britain in the past 12 months have highlighted the threat which certain types, or breeds, of dogs present to humans.  People have been killed.  We have read about and seen in full colour on our television screens some horrendous injuries inflicted by dogs, not just on childen but on able-bodied adults as well. <Col N="676" /> Figures available to my Department indicate that in an 18-month period to November 1991 over a 1,000 incidents of dog attacks were recorded by dog wardens as part of their daily routines of which over 70 attacks were classified as serious and resulted in hospitalisation and medical treatment for the victims concerned.  A further 240 incidents resulted in the victim receiving some form of first aid. Clearly, this is a situation where we must take action.  This action must be measured action which deals with the threat but which allows the vast majority of dog owners to enjoy their dogs without undue restrictions.  To do this we must have the power to identify the types of dogs which pose a threat to our safety. We must have the power to deal with them and to neutralise the threat which they represent.  The Bill will allow me to do this.</P>
    <P>The dog has for centuries, even millennia perhaps, been described as man's best friend.  To very many people it is still that.  Unfortunately, as in so many other areas of human activity, the dog's friendship has been abused by man &mdash; admittedly in a minority of cases. Unfortunately, this minority has made special efforts to breed strains and crosses of dogs which will have a particularly nasty temperament, they have crossed these with larger and more powerful breeds and they have used them for unacceptable purposes such as dog fighting, animal baiting and the furtherance and protection of criminal activities.  There is no place in our society for such animals. Thankfully, we do not as yet have a serious problem with this type of animal in this country.  This Bill will provide me, as Minister for the Environment, with the necessary powers to ensure that we can prevent a serious problem from occuring.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning, while dealing with the issue of extremely dangerous dogs, that our neighbours in Great Britain have taken measures to deal with their dangerous dogs and, in the process, highlighted how deficient were our laws. Last year they enacted new legislation <Col N="677" /> which effectively banned certain particularly unsavoury types of dogs.  One of the ways of complying with this legislation was to export the animals concerned &mdash; in other words, to remove them to another country.  This Bill will give me power by regulation to ban the importation of certain classes of dogs, a power which does not exist at present.</P>
    <P>The public concern expressed at the time of last year's serious dog attacks, about which I spoke earlier, and the public demand for action highlighted the limitations of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, in terms of mounting an effective and suitably targeted response to the problem.  Our first concern was to ensure that certain dogs &mdash; those with the capacity or the tendency to inflict serious injury &mdash; would not have the opportunity to do so when in public places.  It was against this background that the Control of Dogs (Restriction of Certain Dogs) Regulations, 1991, which require the muzzling, leashing and identification of specified dogs when in a public place, were made last June.  This Bill allows a much greater range of options to be taken.  It will, therefore, enable a more flexible and effective response to be mounted.  It will also permit urgent action to be taken should future circumstances so demand.</P>
    <P>I think it is worth mentioning here that we have received a very substantial amount of correspondence from dog owners, clubs and other bodies criticising the muzzling regulations and criticising this Bill.  Much of this correspondence has been reasonable and reasoned; some of it has been disturbing in its tone and in its lack of concern for the safety, comfort and welfare of others.  I should also say that we have received a considerable volume of correspondence from people who supported the new measures, people who were frightened to use public parks and facilities because of fear of certain dogs, people who feared for the safety of their children, elderly people, joggers. There is a balance to be struck between these interests, bearing in mind the overriding need to safeguard the safety of the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> My objective is to establish an effective system for the control of these dogs. While the restrictions imposed by the 1991 regulations go a long way to deal with the immediate problem, I must consider what other measures would be useful in securing public safety.  To this end the Bill now before the House will enable me, as Minister, to make regulations prohibiting certain dogs from public places or specified public places, prohibiting the ownership, keeping, purchase, disposal, abandonment, allowing to stray, breeding or importation of dangerous dogs, requiring the insurance of certain dogs and, ultimately, requiring the destruction or sterilisation of dangerous dogs.</P>
    <P>Apart from dealing with the matter of dangerous dogs, the Bill also provides for increased licence fees and provides wider power to vary licence fees by regulations. It also provides for higher fines and for wider use of on-the-spot fines.  It will, thus, give me power to deal with dogs in a variety of different ways having regard to the level of threat which I consider the different types of dogs may present to the safety of people.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation also offers the opportunity to make a number of amendments to provisions of the Control of Dogs Act, 1986, which have been found in practice to be deficient.  These include restricting a general dog licence to dogs kept at one premises, requiring the production of a dog licence before recovering a seized dog, empowering a dog warden to enter premises where a guard dog is kept &mdash; he can only enter premises where more than five dogs are kept at the moment &mdash; and a tidying up of offences provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like now to deal in some detail with the main provisions of the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill, 1991.  Section 1 is a standard definitions section, while section 2 provides a new definition of &ldquo;general dog licence&rdquo; as a licence entitling a person to keep a number of dogs at a premises specified in the licence. Relating the general dog licence to a particular premises as proposed in the Bill will eliminate certain abuses of the <Col N="679" /> present dog licence system whereby dog owners may get around the licensing provisions by an umbrella organisation obtaining one licence to cover all dogs registered with it.  Minor amendments, consequential on the new definition of a general dog licence, are also provided for in this section as well as a transitional provision to protect &ldquo;old style&rdquo; general dog licences current immediately before the commencement of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will increase the level of licence fees from £5 to £10 for an ordinary dog licence and from £100 to £200 for a general dog licence.  The section also restates the power to vary licence fees by regulations and to prescribe different fees for different classes of dogs.  This is an important power.  It gives me the option of graduating licence levels to reflect the fact that certain kinds of dogs, the ones with the most potential to inflict injury on members of the public, require a higher level of policing by the dog warden service; such an option may also encourage dog owners to opt for more benign dogs.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 4 is to require a person when claiming a stray dog to produce a current dog licence or a general dog licence in respect of that dog.  Under the existing arrangements, any person claiming a stray dog must satisfy the local authority or the superintendent of the Garda Sióchána as the case may be, that he is the owner of the dog or has been authorised by the owner to claim the dog, make a declaration to that effect and pay for any expenditure that may have been incurred in respect of the seizure and detention of the dog.  The production of a current dog licence is a logical and reasonable requirement, which will help to establish the bona fides of the person claiming the dog and will also go some way to combating the very real problem of the large number of dogs which remain unlicensed.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will amend and extend the powers of dog wardens to seize and detain dogs, to enter premises and to demand production of a licence.  The effect of the amendments will be, firstly, <Col N="680" /> to empower a dog warden to enter premises, other than a dwelling, where he believes a guard dog or more than five dogs are being kept, Under present legislation, he can enter premises only if he believes more than five dogs are kept there and, secondly, to extend the powers of the local authorities in regard to dogs seized by wardens.  At present, unclaimed strays can be held for five days before they can be put down.  Under section 5 dogs seized for breaches of the Acts or regulations and held pending court proceedings may be put down unless the owner within five days agrees to pay the reasonable costs of keeping the dog pending the decision of the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 6 substitutes a whole new section for section 19 of the 1986 Act.  In fact, this is the heart of this Bill.  Section 19 of the 1986 Act empowers the Minister to make regulations in relation to the registration and operation of premises in which dogs are kept, the regulation of the use of guard dogs, the muzzling and identification of dogs, including licence identification, and the exemption of certain classes of person from the requirements of regulations made under the Act. The guard dog regulations of 1988 and 1989, which provide controls over the use of guard dogs and cover the construction, registration and operation of guard dog kennels, were made under section 19 of the 1986 Act.  The Control of Dogs Act (Restriction of Certain Dogs) Regulations, 1991, requiring the muzzling, leashing and identification of 12 specified types of dogs in public places, were also made under that section.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 6 will allow a more comprehensive range of options to be taken to deal with the problem of dangerous dogs and reduce the threat to public safety posed by such dogs.  The Bill will permit tough new measures to cover a wide range of dog control arrangements.  These new provisions, which can be tailored to meet different circumstances and to deal with different kinds of dogs in different ways, strengthen existing powers relating to the <Col N="681" /> identification, muzzling and leashing of dogs.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the new section will enable me to make regulations for all or any of the following purposes: to make provision for the registration and operation of premises where a guard dog or more than five dogs are kept &mdash; the existing powers under the 1986 Act relate only to premises where more than five dogs are kept; to make provision for the regulation of the use of guard dogs; to make provision for the muzzling of dogs or specified classes of dogs, either generally or in specified circumstances; to make provision for the prohibition of specified classes of dogs in public places or specified public places; to make provision for a ban on the ownership, keeping, purchase, disposal, abandonment, allowing to stray, breeding or importation of specified classes of dogs, which, in the opinion of the Minister, have such characteristics as to cause them to be a danger to the public; to require the sterilisation or destruction in a humane manner of certain dogs; to make provision to require the owners of dogs or specified classes of dogs to effect insurance against injury or damage caused by the dogs to person or property; to make provision for the identification of dogs or specified classes of dogs and of their ownership either by details attached to a collar or by other means; to make provision for certain exemptions from all or any of the regulations and to classify persons or dogs for the purposes of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Thus the Bill will give me the power to deal with dogs in different ways having regard to the level of threat which I consider different types present to public safety.  For example, I could prohibit one type of dog from public places, while prohibiting the ownership, keeping, purchase and so on of another type.  In extreme cases I could require the destruction of all dogs of a particularly unsavoury type as well as prohibiting importation, purchase and so on, or I could make all the other prohibitions but allow existing owners to keep their dogs provided they were sterilised, insured <Col N="682" /> and complied with other restrictions, such as not being in public places.</P>
    <P>Section 7 simplifies the offences provisions of the 1986 Act and provides for a maximum penalty for all offences of £1,000 and/or up to three months imprisonment.  Sections 8 and 9 make minor amendments to various sections of the 1986 Act consequent on the redefinition of offences.  Section 8 will enable on-the-spot fines to be imposed in respect of prescribed breaches of regulations.</P>
    <P>I consider this latter provision to be particularly important from the point of view of effective enforcement of the new legislation.  The wider application of the on-the-spot fine system envisaged under section 8 will allow greater scope to effect proper dog control &ldquo;on-the-spot&rdquo;&mdash; where it matters.  This has been a problem, for instance, with the regulations requiring the muzzling, leashing and identification of specified classes of dogs introduced last summer.  It is not possible under present legislation to include breaches of these regulations under the on-the-spot fine system.  Finally, section 10 sets out the Short Title and provides for collective citation, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>I know that emotive terms such as &ldquo;draconian measures&rdquo; have been used by certain pressure groups to describe the new powers the Bill will provide to deal with dangerous dogs.  I want to assure dog owners that I will not be taking draconian measures against anybody or against any dog.  My duty is to protect the public.  I will do whatever is necessary, no more.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that some organisations and bodies and individuals involved with dogs and animal welfare consider that dog legislation, such as the muzzling provisions introduced last year, and this Bill, are discriminatory.  These groups favour deed or behaviour-orientated legislation. Their argument is that it is dog owners who should be held responsible for their dogs' behaviour, that dogs should be proven to be a public menace before being restricted.  While dog owners should be encouraged to act responsibly towards their dogs and to exercise effectual control of their pets when in public <Col N="683" /> places, I would be very slow to endorse deed or behaviour-based legislation for the control of dangerous dogs.  It is difficult to accept the argument that a dog must be proven to be a public menace. Such a concept would be difficult to administer and would, at best, be an unreliable method of ensuring public safety.  Inevitably, it would result in dog attacks being made before the particular dog could be dealt with.  To apply controls to a particular dog after he has shown a vicious tendency, could well be too late to save an innocent person from serious injury or worse.</P>
    <P>The principle of allowing a dog a &ldquo;first bite&rdquo; is an outdated and unacceptable one.  My responsibilities require me to err on the side of public safety.  It would be very difficult for me to defend a &ldquo;deed or behaviour&rdquo; approach to dog control in the event of an attack involving serious injury, especially to children.</P>
    <P>The Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill, 1991 is an enabling Bill &mdash; regulations will be required to bring the more substantial provisions of the Bill, once enacted, into force.  In framing the new legislation, it is important to get it right. To this end, it is important that all interested bodies have an opportunity to give their views and advice.  It was for that reason that my Department, in July 1991, wrote to various organisations and individuals informing them of the intention to introduce legislation to provide additional options to deal in a comprehensive manner with all aspects of dog control and inviting their views on the most effective methods of implementing the legislation.  Submissions have been received from all the various bodies and these are currently being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>I would describe this Bill as a comprehensive approach to the problem of dangerous dogs.  The Bill is an enabling one.  In formulating the regulations necessary to implement it, I will be taking account of the extensive consultations my Department have had with animal welfare organisations and other organisations concerned with dogs.  I will be <Col N="684" /> taking account, also, of the views expressed by others.  We now have eight months' experience of operating the muzzling regulations and we can learn from that.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted I propose to replace existing regulations with a comprehensive new set of regulations which will provide a measured and flexible response to the problem of dangerous dogs.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the problem presented by certain types of dogs is serious and that the public's demand for action is such that it merits the overall approach to tackle it as set out in this Bill.  I am happy, therefore, to commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Control of Dogs (Amendment) Bill is of interest and of concern to a great many dog owners, many of whom consider that the Minister is barking up the wrong tree with the provisions of this Bill.  To summarise the main point generally, the problem is not dangerous dogs but dangerous owners. This Bill does little or nothing to circumscribe owners who ill-treat dogs or who provoke them so badly that they become dangerous.</P>
      <P>I have very serious reservations about this legislation because the Bill was conceived in panic as a reaction to media hype following a few horrible attacks by individual dogs both here and in Britain on individuals, but especially in Britain. Of course, any right thinking person will want to have sufficient legislation and regulations to maximise public safety and to do so with the minimum intrusion, alienation, or difficulty for dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a feeling that the provisions of this Bill, or the potential for regulations under it, is the equivalent of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  I have had discussions and lots of correspondence with a large number of very responsible dog owners throughout the country who are deeply perturbed about some of the provisions of recent regulations and of this Bill.  They are particularly perturbed about the muzzling requirement for certain breeds.  There <Col N="685" /> are certain other breeds which because of physical attributes cannot be muzzled. It is pointed out that the very fact of muzzling certain dogs can cause that dog to be irritable, to be more dangerous than it would otherwise be, to be out of sorts, with the potential for knocking people down and for causing traffic accidents because of being disoriented by muzzling.  I do not think the Bill before the House reflects sufficient balance on the part of the Minister in relation to the question of the muzzling of dogs.</P>
    <P>There are some provisions in the Bill which are welcome.  Would the Minister not agree that quintessentially this is the type of Bill which should be dealt with by a special committee of this House which could hear evidence from experts in the veterinary field, the Irish Kennel Club, dog owners and especially from representatives of the campaign against muzzling, who have been extremely articulate in putting forward a case against muzzling of dogs?  They have been articulate, balanced and reasonable. They have not been hysterical and they have faced up to the reality that certain individual dogs can be dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech has indicated that a large number of deputations was received in respect of this Bill. Clearly, those deputations were not received by the present Minister, who is in his post only for the last couple of weeks.  Before this Bill proceeds to Committee Stage, I would ask the Minister to meet deputations from such bodies as the Irish Kennel Club, the campaign against muzzling and also organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  I am sure the Minister, like myself, wants to take every reasonable step to protect the public against the dangers of attack from a dangerous dog.  I am sure he also wants to take every reasonable step open to him to ensure that dogs are treated properly. This comes back to the central failure of the Bill to deal with the question of the ownership of dogs.</P>
    <P>It is still possible for young puppies to be bought as Christmas presents only to be abandoned within weeks or months. <Col N="686" /> This practice is not referred to in this legislation.  Nothing in the Bill, so far as I can see, gives the Minister power, by regulation or otherwise, to control the initial ownership of a dog.  The question of ownership of dogs is a key question. The ownership of a dog is in certain circumstances not acceptable if the persons concerned do not have adequate space to house the dog &mdash; a factor to be taken into account &mdash; or if previously they have neglected, ill-treated, trained or provoked their dog in such a way as to be a danger to themselves, their families and the public in general.  There ought to be more definite control.</P>
    <P>There are features in this Bill which are welcome.  I welcome the idea of a general dog licence.  A dog licence to keep an unspecified number of dogs should apply to the person and the premises.  The holder of such a licence should also be required to have individual licences in respect of each dog aged, say, more than four months or thereabouts. Individual licences should be for the life of the dog and the cost should be about £50 at current prices.  An identification number or code unique to that dog should appear on each licence and on a disc or badge to be worn by the dog whenever it is in a public place.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 4 of the 1986 Act are not being enforced, a problem common to all legislation enacted by this House.  I mentioned yesterday during the course of the debate on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill that we enact legislation but do not make regulations to enforce it. This is another case in point.  Any person can purchase a licence in a post office without any questions being asked. Indeed, the description of the dog which appears on the licence could be applied to almost any dog of the same breed.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in section 6 (2) (d) to (h) are dangerously broad and are not specific.  It will be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce this section.  In the view of some, it is possibly unconstitutional.  In their view the provisions of subparagraph (o) which provide for the classification of persons are clearly <Col N="687" /> repugnant to the Constitution.  These clauses should relate only to persons convicted of specified offences or to dogs declared dangerous by a judge.  Section 6, therefore, is the section with which we have most problems.</P>
    <P>In relation to muzzling, this is an extremely cruel practice and can be interpreted by some dogs as severe punishment.  Consequently, it can often lead to a gentle dog being turned into a dangerous one.  It is impossible to muzzle some breeds and for others it can cause suffocation.  It does not prevent a dog from scratching, knocking down a person or causing a traffic accident due to the fact that the dog is irritable or has been alienated.  There should be some recognised tribunal or office with power to order that a specific dog, rather than a breed of dog, be muzzled.  This should be treated as an alternative to the destruction of the dog and debarring individuals from owning dogs.  It may well be that a good owner of a dog would be debarred because of the behaviour of one of his dogs rather than because he was cruel or showed a lack of attention to training. That is the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Minister will have power to make regulations in regard to sterilisation.  Sterilisation will not necessarily alter the disposition of a dog and it should, therefore, be used only as a means of controlling population.  I would like the Minister in reply to indicate what function will be served by granting him the power to order that certain dogs be neutered.</P>
    <P>I think it is the unanimous view on all sides of the House that dogs should be controlled and that there should be clear regulations relating to the control and ownership of dogs.  However, there will not be unanimity on the specific provisions of the Bill; there are too many disparate views for that.  We owe it to ourselves to ensure that whatever legislation we pass in this respect is not only effective but will not be avoidably cruel even for a small number of dogs.  For this reason I ask the Minister to consider my <Col N="688" /> proposal that we establish a special committee of the House to deal with Committee Stage of the Bill.  As I said, such a format would permit us to invite experts to appear before the committee to assess the effect of certain sections.  It would be useful to do this and be of great help in processing and improving the Bill and in ensuring it gains wide support among the dog-owning community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have grave reservations about the contents of this Bill even though I acknowledge and recognise that certain breeds of dog have to be controlled in a responsible manner.  I note the Minister indicated that he will be taking &ldquo;measured action&rdquo;.  I have no great objection to referring the Bill to a special committee of the House because it is necessary that we tease it out at great length rather than merely reacting to what has happened here and abroad.  We were shocked and horrified by the damage and serious injuries caused, particularly to young children, by certain breeds of animal.</P>
      <P>I come from a county noted for the breeding and rearing of good dogs.  I object, therefore, to certain aspects of the Bill, in particular the proposal that the cost of a general dog licence be increased from £100 to £200.  It is my experience that those who keep and breed dogs in Cork city for sporting purposes are responsible people.  They walk their dogs in the countryside and feed them well before going to work, that is if they are lucky enough to have a job to go to.  People in Cork city and county look after their dogs well and are very loyal to them.  I assure the House that the dogs in turn are very loyal to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has a responsibility to introduce legislation to control certain breeds and that there is a need to do so.  Those who breed and cross breed specific breeds of dog and who import and export dogs for fighting purposes must be condemned because this amounts to cruelty.  I will help the Minister in any way I can in outlawing that activity but we must not throw out the baby with the bath water in this instance. <Col N="689" /> I have great reservations about the impact this Bill will have on those who act responsibly when it comes to looking after their dogs.</P>
    <P>For many years now I have been a dog owner.  I bought my dog in the local dogs' home and had him for 15 years.  He was a companion for my children and was not a cross dog.  Indeed he saved them from attack from other animals.  He responded to the love and care shown to him and repaid their loyalty.  That is the reason I have grave reservations about the proposal in this legislation to muzzle animals who have been tremendously loyal to both children and adults.  It is an emotional subject for people like me: unfortunately, I had to get the dog put down when it became ill.  It is a hard thing for many people, especially the elderly, to do.</P>
    <P>Crime is now rampant throughout urban and rural areas and people see a dog as probably the best burglar alarm they can get.  A faithful dog, bred from a pup, gives a certain amount of security, especially to the elderly, who very often do not have anybody to visit them.  The Minister will agree that a dog also gives companionship and I am sure he has no intention of legislating in respect of a dog of that nature.  That is why it is difficult to implement the Bill in its entirety.  The Minister, who is new in his Department, should have discussions with the various groups who have made very strong representations regarding the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Having been involved with the Guide Dogs' Association, I know that an animal can become like a human being and I am sure that the Minister has no intention of trying to muzzle an animal of this kind. Nevertheless, the legislation covers the ownership of all dogs.  There are times when I despair of people's cruelty to animals.  Many young people are not taught, either at home or in school, the value of the loyalty of a dog which comes from owning it over a long period.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that pups are given as Christmas presents and dumped in a short time because they are considered a nuisance.  This is very sad <Col N="690" /> because it means that the dog is not valued by the recipient or the person who gave it.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to push ahead with legislation which has such hard and fast rules. The Minister referred to &ldquo;measured action&rdquo; and I hope he will expand on that when he replies to this debate.  I owned a dog for a long time.  He would go with anyone and even stay overnight with other people.  They felt quite happy and secure with him, even though he was a labrador, a breed which has no great fighting characteristics.  He had a tremendous amount of loyalty to those who loved him.</P>
    <P>I am worried about some aspects of the Bill.  There is no provision for the implementation of guidelines defining a guard dog or indeed a dangerous dog. Many of us have different breeds of dogs, some are docile and effective.  However, I should like to know who will decide what breed of dog is dangerous.  For too long local authorities have been given the responsibility for looking after dangerous and stray dogs.  Before further legislation is implemented we should examine whether local authorities can effectively implement existing legislation.  My experience is that they do not have the resources to do so.  Dog wardens are limited in what they can do; and, if the dog licence is increased to £10, as envisaged in the legislation, there will certainly be a strong reaction.  This will result in many stray dogs, they will be hungry and are liable to become vicious because they can be ill-treated.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about raising the general dog licence from £100 to £200.  It would be a retrograde step and there will be a strong reaction from people who a have multiple licence. Some members of dog clubs keep five, six or seven dogs each, which would mean that clubs would have to pay £200 for each dog and this would be out of all proportion to what is envisaged in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill may do something about keeping dogs off the street in the short term but it is not a viable means of solving the problem of homeless or abandoned dogs <Col N="691" /> in the long term.  The Association for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Cork have a home which is dependent on voluntary funding and a small grant from Cork Corporation.  They do tremendous work and cover all aspects of cruelty to animals.  Dogs and cats constitute one of the major problems with which they have to contend.  Every year there is a crisis because funding is scarce.  The same applies to voluntary workers.  They do a very difficult job with scant resources.  If we are serious about bringing in amending legislation then we must also be serious about funding.  Until such time as local authorities and voluntary groups, like the one in Cork and others around the country, get proper funding, we are going nowhere with legislation because it cannot be enforced.  That is the worst type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Certain breeders keep dogs for profit or to fight.  Staffordshire bull terriers are vicious when they are bred to attack other dogs.  These dogs should be banned and I would certainly support the Minister in that regard.  However, he has produced legislation which will be impossible to implement and which is perhaps not necessary in many cases.</P>
    <P>All breeders should have to await a licence until the appropriate agency have performed a background check on the applicant and visited the proposed kennels.  A standard licence is issued to people, yet we do not know whether they can breed dogs.  Some people are irresponsible enough to cause hassle for genuine dog owners.  As a result, all dog owners get a bad name.  An agency should be established to consider whether or not, to be blunt about it, people are fit to keep dogs.  There is an educational aspect to the breeding of dogs.  Yet some people leave their dogs outside the door and hope for the best.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of people who breed dogs for sale to shops and other people.  While this is acceptable in certain circumstances there is not adequate legislation governing the sale of dogs for profit.  I take issue with certain <Col N="692" /> aspects of the Bill.  We can go through these in more detail on Committee Stage and put forward certain amendments.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about some of the points made by the Minister.  The Minister regards the increase in the level of licence fees from £5 to £10 for an ordinary dog licence and from £100 to £200 for a general dog licence as reasonable.  I regard these increases as unreasonable in certain circumstances as a £10 licence fee will be exorbitant for some people while the £200 licence fee will be outside the means of some clubs. For many people whose only enjoyment is drag hunting, this will be the last straw. I believe these people will react strongly to the proposed increase in licence fees. I ask the Minister to look again at this aspect.</P>
    <P>I also have reservations about providing a blanket licence for all dogs without taking into consideration whether or not a person can afford the fee.  A fee of £10 may not be regarded as much money by many people but for some people it can be a large sum at certain times.  I know elderly people who reared their dogs from pups and I have seen the devastating effects the death of their dogs can have on them.</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about certain aspects of the Bill as it may be too heavy-handed in some cases.  I accept what the Minister is trying to do but I believe he should legislate for people who own and breed vicious dogs.  Sometimes these people can be seen patrolling the streets of our cities at night with these dogs. They use them to scare and attack people and for criminal purposes.  I have no hesitation in supporting the Minister in his efforts to eliminate that type of activity, which is criminal activity at its worst. These dogs have been trained to attack people and in many instances they seriously maim and injure people.  As I said, I would have no hesitation in supporting such legislation.</P>
    <P>It is intended in this Bill to control all dogs and to ensure that certain, breeds of dogs are muzzled.  As was seen recently in Cork, some people would rather go to jail than put a muzzle on their dog.  I <Col N="693" /> suppose they have very good reasons for this.  They strongly believe that their dogs have been properly bred and looked after and that they have protected them over a long period of time.  I have no hesitation in saying to the Minister that he has taken a gigantic step in this Bill in trying to control dogs.  I believe all Deputies are of the view that steps should be taken to control vicious dogs.  However, we should not in any way inhibit genuine dog lovers who hunt on a Sunday or take their dog for a walk.  I believe all Deputies genuinely respect those people.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he was taking measured action.  In this context I ask him to consider allowing a committee to examine this matter so that he will have an opportunity of sitting down with the various organisations and members of dogs clubs who are directly involved, who can make a contribution and who possibly have more experience than the Minister.  Even though I have been a dog owner for the best part of 20 years they certainly have more experience in this area than I have.  These people love their dogs.  The Minister has only got the views of people who believe their rights are being infringed.  As I said, the Minister has gone too far in this legislation.  I ask him to look again at the Bill and engage in consultations with the various organisations involved.  Having done this, he may decide to come back to the House with an amended Bill.  If he does this he will get the support of people on this side of the House in his efforts to stamp out once and for all the cruel methods people use for breeding dogs to fight other dogs and injure people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I know that he brings great experience to his post.  I wish him every success in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were talking about the greyhound industry I know the Minister would be able to give us good advice from what is happening in his constituency.  However, he would need the wisdom of Solomon to try to solve some of the problems <Col N="694" /> which have arisen in regard to the breeding of vicious and dangerous dogs during the past number of years.  The Minister summed up the position very well when he said that dogs are often regarded as man's best friend and that the problems arise when, in a minority of cases, dogs are abused by man.  I hope the Minister will be able to resolve this problem by way of the regulations to which he referred.</P>
    <P>During the mid-eighties many elderly people living alone were attacked.  These people were advised, particularly by the Garda to put their savings into financial institutions and get a dog to protect them. This advice was carried in the local papers and was referred to by the clergy in their sermons.  Over the past number of years adults and children alike have been killed by vicious and savage dogs.  The rearing of dogs for fighting purposes and protection of criminals is particularly disgraceful.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the situation that has arisen as a result of the 1986 Act. We have a saying in this country that a man's home is his castle.  I have great sympathy for people who have been attacked by dogs in their own houses and gardens.  In one case where a man was attacked in his own garden by a vicious dog the case was brought to court, but the judge could not order that the dog be put down because of a deficiency in the 1986 Act.  There was no definite provision in that Act for the destroying of animals, as was the case in the legislation of 1877, and there was no penalty for failure to destroy a dog.  I am amazed that the provision in the 1877 legislation was eliminated in 1986.  I am glad the Minister will have power under this legislation to ensure that penalties are imposed in relation to the controlling or destroying of dogs.  As the Minister has said, it is important to clarify this issue.  Many people will not use public parks and public amenities for fear of being attacked by dogs.  However, it is unacceptable that people could be attacked in their own home or their back garden, as happened in the west two <Col N="695" /> years ago, and the courts had no power to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's statement regarding the importation of certain classes of dogs.  In recent years vicious dogs have been imported into this country and people involved in crime, dog fighting and so on have been able to exploit the law in this regard.  Under this legislation we will be able to prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill dealing with dog wardens.  We have a tendency in this House to introduce very good ideas but we do not provide the finance to implement them.  Local authorities continually introduce schemes for litter wardens, environmental officers and so on, but it is not possible to implement the legislation properly if funding is not available to do so.  That is certainly the case with dog wardens and I would like the Minister, when replying to give us some information on that issue.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the introduction of regulations in this area.  I agree with the Minister that some people abuse dogs. That is the kernel of this whole problem and that is the reason we are discussing this issue today.  The problem received massive publicity last year when serious injury, and in some cases death, was caused to children and adults by marauding dogs.  I hope that under this Bill the Minister will be able to resolve these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was astounded to see this Bill on the Order Paper last Friday. There are many major crises to be dealt with, such as employment and so on, but we are spending our time legislating for and penalising dog owners as a result of the sins of very few people.  The publication of the Bill by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Flynn, was a knee-jerk reaction to a problem which misrepresented the position of dog owners. I am astounded that the Bill is being followed through by this Minister, who is &ldquo;flying blind&rdquo; with legislation on which he has not had consultations and to which he has not given much thought.  It has <Col N="696" /> been presented to the House today in the exact form as it was published by his predecessor.</P>
      <P>I spoke in the House last week about the problem of wandering horses and animals, a problem that has caused death in this country.  Recently, a person was killed in Cork as a result of a horse running along a national primary route.  A lorry swerved to avoid the horse and collided with a car, killing one man and seriously injuring another.  That is a much more serious problem than the one we are dealing with.  Damage is caused to gardens in the suburbs of cities and towns by wandering animals.  These animals are also a danger to children on their way to and from school.  We are spending hours discussing dogs and dog control when there are much more relevant and pressing issues to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>However, as the Bill has been introduced, there is a responsibility on us to deal with it.  At the outset I would ask the Minister to take a fresh look at the legislation as published by his predecessor.  I agree with the suggestion that this matter would be better dealt with by a committee.  Groups such as the Irish Kennel Club, the organisation campaigning against muzzling, the ISPCA and the Guide Dogs' Association are genuinely concerned about certain provisions in the Bill.  I am also concerned in this regard.  I would ask the Minister to consider again putting the matter into committee.  He should not have to take responsibility for a Bill published by his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a sneaky way of imposing further financial penalties on dog owners by increasing dog licences.  It will penalise genuine dog owners and sporting and recreational clubs.  The harrier clubs in Cork city engage in drag hunting, an activity which attracts thousands of people from throughout Cork city and county.  Organisations such as these, which exist on a shoestring, will be penalised by this legislation.  The Government are using the scare of last year as an opportunity to increase dog licences.  This will not result in a more effective implementation of the legislation and <Col N="697" /> regulations.  It is the local authorities who appoint dog wardens, but they receive no money for this purpose.  Therefore the legislation will not be implemented properly.  This is an example of legislation without guidelines for implementation. As I have said, this is a knee-jerk reaction to a problem highlighted many times last year, more in the British media than in the Irish media.  The Minister referred to cases that arose here, but the problem is not as serious as he outlined.</P>
    <P>The Bill is faulty in terms of its definitions.  I will refer later to the definition of classes of dogs and guard dogs.  The Bill provides for a ban on the ownership and purchase of specific classes of dogs which in the opinion of the Minister for the Environment have such characteristics as to cause them to be a danger to the public.  In effect, that will allow the Minister to ban the ownership of any breed of dog he feels needs to be banned. To my knowledge, there is no bank of information here, there are no statistics and there have been no studies carried out on the behaviour of certain classes of dogs.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what studies have been commissioned.  It is not good enough for the Minister to have an opinion about which dogs might be dangerous.  Statistics, and the results of studies, should be produced before any Minister or any individual decides to ban a breed of dog.</P>
    <P>The Bill was inherited from the previous Minister who showed himself to be no expert on dogs in his decision to muzzle dogs that do not have a muzzle. The muzzling of bulldogs was a prime example of the previous Minister's lack of knowledge.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to reconsider the matter.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the banning of certain classes of dogs in public places. However, many of the studies carried out show that a large percentage of accidents involving dogs take place in the home.  Why is there an obsessional attitude taken in relation to public places? I ask the Minister to reconsider that measure also.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;dangerous dog&rdquo; should attach to a dog's behaviour rather than <Col N="698" /> its breed.  I shall illustrate that studies show that it is not the so-called dangerous breeds of dogs that have been involved in most of the incidents but the dogs that are classed as placid or docile.</P>
    <P>I shall quote at length from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 24 August 1991 and the article &ldquo;Dog bites to children&rdquo; written by Sara Levene of the Child Accident Prevention Trust, London, to illustrate the points I have made.  It states:</P>
    <P>Dog bites to children continue to receive media attention, and there have been recent changes in legislation intended to control particular breeds. To detail the size and nature of the problem we analysed data from the Department of Trade and Industry's home and leisure accident surveillance systems (HASS and LASS) for the calendar year November 1987 to November 1988.  These systems record relevant accidents presenting to accident and emergency departments in a representative sample of 22 hospitals throughout the United Kingdom. HASS incidents occur in the home and its surrounds; LASS incidents occur outside the home but exclude work and vehicle accidents.</P>
    <P>Case listings and cross tabulations were obtained for dog bites to children under 16 years old.  Over 2,000 cases were recorded at the 22 hospitals; a breakdown by age and sex is presented in the table. </P>
    <P>I shall not present the table to the House. The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>With the department's own multiplier, this implies that in the United Kingdom as a whole there were about 25,000 dog bites in the home and 33,000 in &ldquo;leisure&rdquo; situations &mdash; that is, a total of over 55,000 dog bites to children presented to hospital in the 12 months studied.  There may have been other incidents treated at home or by general practitioners.</P>
    <P>Most home accidents (21%) took place in the living and dining areas; most leisure accidents (38%) took <Col N="699" /> place in the street.  Children were commonly playing (HASS 45%, LASS 29%).  Home accidents commonly involved the head and face (45%) whereas leisure accidents most often involved the legs and buttocks (42%). Puncture wounds were the most common injury (HASS 42%, LASS 44%).  Referral was usually to home (HASS 73%, LASS 63%), and referral rates to outpatient clinics and to general practitioners were considerably lower than those for children's accidents overall.  Only three children required admission to hospital for more than six days.</P>
    <P>The breed of dog was recorded in 487 (36%) of HASS incidents.  The three commonest were mongrel (114), German Shepherd (66), and Jack Russell (49).  Dobermanns were mentioned 22 times and Rottweilers 13 times.  Pit bull terriors were not mentioned. LASS incidents recorded breeds in 237 (27%) cases, the three commonest being mongrel (63), German Shepherd (52), and Jack Russell (17).  There were 13 incidents involving Dobermanns, eight Rottweilers, and one pit bull terrior.</P>
    <P>The article concludes:</P>
    <P>These figures show that dog bites to children are common but rarely serious, and that many incidents take place in the home.  They suggest that measures to control particular breeds in public places offer at best a partial solution. </P>
    <P>In further correspondence to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 23 September 1991, R.P. Cole from the Wessex Centre for Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery, Odstock Hospital, Salisbury, stated:</P>
    <P>Of the 22 injuries resulting from dog bites (in all age groups) treated by our department over two years, only three were caused by so-called dangerous breeds (all by German Shepherd dogs).  The commonest breeds were Jack Russell terrier (four) and spaniel (four). </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> Before I read the report I would have considered the spaniel to be one of the friendliest, quietest dogs one could have, but here it is regarded as one of the major offenders.</P>
    <P>The point I make is that dogs should not be condemned according to breed or type because the only statistics I am aware of show the position should be quite the opposite.  I ask the Minister on what grounds he bases his proposals this evening.  What studies were carried out by his Department before be brought forward the legislation?  What evidence can the Minister give about &ldquo;all of the accidents recorded&rdquo;, as mentioned in his Second Stage speech?  Has the Minister a breakdown of the dog breeds involved? It is correct that the most dramatic and the most serious accidents indicate the involvement of a certain class of dog but we have to consider the general position rather than the highlighted, dramatic and serious incidents.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>These findings are consistent with those reported by Dr. Levene.  The fact that in all but one of our cases the dog was either known to or owned by the victim (and therefore unlikely to be reported) shows how difficult it would be to reduce the incidence of these mutilating and disfiguring injuries. </P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in a constructive rather than a negative way, to think again on the matter.  There is no point in passing faulty legislation.  I congratulate the Minister, who is new in his post.  He should have given more thought and care to the legislation he inherited before he produced it in the House.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is no definition of a guard dog, there is no definition of classes and there is no mention of the tagging of dogs, which should be considered so that a dog could be directly traced to its owner.  The system of collars for dogs is one that is open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I fault the Minister for introducing the Bill without giving it proper preparation and thought.  I criticise the punitive measures in relation to licence fees that would penalise people who enjoy the <Col N="701" /> countryside, enjoy dogs and involve themselves in a healthy pastime that gives pleasure to thousands.  To penalise them by introducing legislation to control dangerous dogs was sly and cynical.  We are penalising sportsmen who have given so much time to the community down through the years.  I appeal to the Minister to delete the proposal to increase the cost of dog licences because it will affect many innocent people involved in innocent, productive sports.  I will introduce amendments on Committee Stage in relation to that and other matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a life-long dog owner and animal lover I was aghast when I heard about this Bill.  I saw it as a knee-jerk reaction to some very tragic and unsavoury incidents involving children that occurred mainly in the UK.  The Bill has been hastily cobbled together. While I am happy that the Minister will take a measured approach to this Bill, he should take on board representations made by the responsible canine associations and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and he should consult with the veterinary surgeons instead of listening to senior civil servants with no particular experience in this area.  The Minister should listen to the responsible canine organisations rather than reacting to the media who, unfortunately, tend to set the political agenda in this country with increasing frequency.</P>
      <P>Much hysteria has been engendered. The dog is undoubtedly man's best friend and can give more affection, fidelity and loyalty than some people can.  Indeed, hundreds of thousands of people enjoy the company of their dogs.  This response to those unsavoury incidents is a knee-jerk reaction and the proposals in this Bill have not been fully thought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal to muzzle a dog is cruel. A dog, just like a human being, can be claustrophobic.  A muzzle may be too small for a large dog.  It can turn a tame animal into a savage animal.  It can frustrate an animal and can eventually turn him into a vicious dog.  If there is a problem with a dog it would be better to put <Col N="702" /> him down than to muzzle him, restricting his liberty and in some cases his liberty to breathe.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited this Bill.  Some of the financial measures envisaged in it are farcical.  The service charges and the proposal to charge, perhaps an old lady whose only companion is a dog, an exorbitant licence fee is bizarre.  It is ridiculous.  The imposition of strict financial penalties will not cure this problem but it will cause hardship to individual dog owners.</P>
    <P>The problem is that there are certain types of dogs bred specifically to fight for gambling purposes or to appease blood lust.  Those dogs should not be allowed into this country.  The incidents in which ordinary common or garden dogs are involved are very few and, as Deputy Bernard Allen said, British statistics show that most incidents occur within the home.  A child can be playful and pull a dog or hurt him in a vulnerable area and the dog would turn on him.  That is a problem, but there are very few recorded incidents here where dogs have attacked people.  The introduction of this Bill has been a knee-jerk reaction to what happened in England.</P>
    <P>A measured approach is needed and I am sure the Minister will be sympathetic to the needs of hundreds of thousands of people who keep dogs.  We should publish a list of the species of dogs which are not acceptable here.  We probably introduce more legislation in this House than does any other Parliament in Europe.  Despite the trenchant claims for more and more legislation, this House should be given a holiday for a couple of years and the laws we have enacted should be implemented.  The Garda Síochána and the local authorities have a role to play here.  For many years they have turned a blind eye to the control of dogs.  It is a fact that most Garda stations have not even a humane killer and if a dog is injured in an accident and is dying on the street in many cases the Garda Síochána are unable to put the dog down humanely and they have to send for a veterinary surgeon.  Many a dog has died without the aid of a humane killer.  That <Col N="703" /> is a very small bit of equipment to have provided in Garda stations.  If gardaí are going to ask people who own dogs for sums up to £200, then they should buy humane killers out of the proceeds.</P>
    <P>The Minister should keep an open mind on this and take on board suggestions from the responsible dog associations who know more about it than anybody in the Minister's Department. The canine associations and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are the only people who can help educate the Minister in a meaningful way.  I hope the Minister will take on board many of the suggestions made here today, that there will not be a hysterical reaction and that as few dogs as possible will be proscribed.  I hope the Minister will draw up a list of unwanted species, particularly dogs from South America which are brought here specifically to kill other dogs and for gambling purposes. The Minister should also examine dog baiting which has been going on for many years and to which a blind eye has been turned by all authorities.  Dog baiting, otter baiting, the digging out of foxes and so on, are nefarious practices and should all be examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>May I extend my best wishes to the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment?  I hope the Minister will bring in a very balanced Bill in the fullness of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in his new Ministry.  Having read through the Bill, it appears to me to have more bite than bark.  What caught my eye in the first paragraph is that the Minister proposes to increase the licence fee for dogs.  I think part of the problem to date is that very few people have bothered to licence their dogs.  If everybody who owned a dog bought a licence for it I believe the income generated would be far in excess of that at present. I have three dogs and in fact I only bought the dog licences yesterday because I had received a reminder from the local authority to do so.  This is the first time I ever <Col N="704" /> received a reminder to buy a dog licence from the local authority and I am delighted that the local authorities are sending reminders out.  I then forked out £15 for the licences, but I understand that next year it will cost me £30 to licence my three dogs.  A great many people have dogs in order to protect their property. Indeed most times burglars will not go near a house with a dog; if there are two dogs, they are less inclined; and, if there are three dogs, they are again even less inclined to burgle that house.  Dogs are as good a burglar alarm as you can get. Most people will agree with me on that, particularly in view of the high crime rate at present.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a higher licence fee for guard dogs and I have no objection to that.  I remember meeting one security guard who told me that it cost more to hire the dogs per hour than what he was paid per hour.  At that time he was earning £3 per hour but it cost £3.50 per hour to hire the dogs.</P>
      <P>A great many old age pensioners have a dog.  I know that £10 might not seem all that much, but a great many people have more than one dog and perhaps the Minister might consider the idea of a discount of some sort when a person has more than one dog.  Perhaps the Minister would look at this area again before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Sometime ago a dog strayed into our home which was very bedraggled and sad.  We brought the dog to the vet, who later described him as a lurcher.  Indeed, we incurred veterinary fees for the dog, as indeed most people do who care for their pets and ensure that the dogs get their injections.  We then had four dogs but sadly the lurcher went out on the road six months later and got run over and we are now back down to three dogs. People who love animals will care for them.  I love dogs and I hate to see a dog suffer.  While it is humane to put down a dog who is suffering more by being kept alive, it is very hard to put down a young animal.  As everyone who loves dogs knows, every dog has his own personality and one tries to keep any dog if one can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whole industries have grown up <Col N="705" /> around the care of pets.  Someone has to manufacture dog food, dog leads and the various toys that dogs like to play with, even though we do not go in for many of those items.  Will the Minister consider having a sliding scale of licence fees where people have more than one domestic dog?  For example, it could cost £10 to licence the first dog, £5 for the second dog and perhaps £2.50 for the third dog. I think such a move would be popular. Indeed, I think we could generate sufficient income to fund the dog warden service if the local authorities pursued the collection of the £5 licence fee more vigorously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill that protect the public from dangerous dogs.  The Garda Síochána have gone into certain homes in my constituency and were greeted by vicious dogs who had been turned on them by their owners.  I met a garda who had to run quite considerable risks because of dangerous dogs.  This is adequately covered in the Bill and I do not disagree with the actions being taken at that level.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate that a muzzle causes discomfort to a dog.  Muzzles have to be worn only by certain breeds of dogs when they are out in public.  I accept the statistics that the Minister gave us in the course of his Second Stage speech and that figures indicate that in the 18 month period to November 1991 over 1,000 incidents of dog attacks were recorded by the dog wardens as part of their daily routine.  I think it is important that we protect the public from vicious dogs but I do not understand why a more comfortable muzzle cannot be developed.  This is surely an opening for somebody with ingenuity who can come up with a muzzle that is more comfortable for the dog while at the same time protects the person in the street from attack.</P>
    <P>We have to differentiate sharply between dogs which are, as the Minister said, &ldquo;man's best friend&rdquo; and those which are engaged in professional guard duty. Our domestic pets also act as watch dogs. There is no question about that and it is very important that people are not charged too much for protecting their <Col N="706" /> own property which cuts down on the time that the Garda spend investigating burglaries.  The Minister should certainly come down heavily on people who allow their dogs to run wild and who have no interest in this dog except in training him to attack other people.</P>
    <P>The imposition of an on-the-spot fine is a good idea.  This reminds me of a story told by a former Member of this House, Mr. Seán Browne, about a sergeant of the Garda Síochána in County Wexford who was a little troublesome.  He met a young fellow walking his dog in the main street in Enniscorthy and asked if he had a dog licence.  The boy replied that he had not a licence because he had not the money to buy one.  The sergeant told him to buy one and warned that he would call to his house next day to check.  On the following day the sergeant called and the boy produced the licence.  When the sergeant asked where he had obtained the money to buy it the boy replied that he had sold the dog.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the Minister's reply.  I look forward to participating on Committee Stage and I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  Shortly after I became a Member of this House in 1981 I was part of a deputation to the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice regarding the problem of stray dogs.  That Government lasted only a short time and several Ministers for Justice subsequently held office.  In 1986 we eventually got all Ministers to agree that one Department should look after this problem.  That was the first step towards the introduction of legislation.  I should like to think that I played some part in convincing the parties in Government to allow one Department to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to increase the fee for an ordinary licence from £5 to £10 and to increase from £100 to £200 the fee for a number of dogs owned by one person.  In my county we appointed a dog warden three or four years ago.  Dog wardens have certain powers but they are <Col N="707" /> not sufficient to solve the problem.  An enormous number of stray dogs were putting sheep farmers out of business.  I had envisaged that the dog warden would be given responsibility for collecting the licence fee but this is not the case.  Only 25 per cent of dog owners purchase licences. Fewer than 2,000 people in County Meath have paid for a dog licence but there are about 25,000 dogs in the county. It costs Meath County Council £30,000 to run the dog warden service.  That money comes from badly needed funds which could be used to provide other services. A dog warden has powers but not the power to collect the licence fee.  The scheme should work on the basis that the warden has power to collect the licence fee and if a person is not prepared to buy a licence the warden should be enabled to take the dog.  If that became the practice we would not have nearly as many stray dogs.</P>
    <P>Some people have voluntarily set up dogs homes.  I know of one couple in Navan who lived in an estate when they started this work two or three years ago. They have since moved outside the town and now have room to cater for a large number of dogs.  In 1991 they found homes for 425 animals.  This undertaking is funded by voluntary subscriptions.  Perhaps a very small amount of money should be made available, perhaps from lottery funds, to people like that who are providing a badly needed service.  More than 50 per cent of those 425 animals would have been put down but for the work of these people.  They look after and vaccinate these animals and they charge only the veterinary costs to the individual, about £20 in most cases.  They are not making a profit.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this legislation is not getting down to the nub of the problem.  We are not giving dog wardens the power to collect licence fees.  There is no need to increase the fee by 100 per cent.  If proper management powers were given to dog wardens who are policing the system, we would quadruple the licence fee income without any increase. There is no question that this is the <Col N="708" /> proper thing to do.  Under this Bill we are simply doubling the fee and letting the system continue.  Only a very small number of dogs will be licensed and no one will bother about the rest.  It will clearly be seen that we are not tackling the problem.  I am against this Bill for that reason.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider what I am saying because it does not make sense to double the cost of a licence simply because 85 per cent of people do not pay.  The Minister should not think he will increase the licence yield because I can tell him he will not solve the problem by so doing, rather he will make it worse.</P>
    <P>Special consideration should be given to people who establish voluntary homes to care for stray, unwanted dogs.  Such people should be given some allocation of funds &mdash; they are not seeking huge amounts &mdash; to ensure they can undertake that work without having to beg every penny they need at shopping centres, by way of weekend collections, or anywhere people congregate, at shows or other events, in order to cater for such animals.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the dog is a very friendly animal.  Indeed, many members of the public would consider they can look after dogs in their homes.  We are all aware from where many stray dogs emanate.  Many are bought as presents for children at Christmas but, when the children return to school, people suddenly realise the job entailed in looking after the animal in the house, which may often be in a built-up area.  This leads to many problems and many dogs are allowed to stray.</P>
    <P>If we refuse to examine those two aspects then as a Parliament we will have lost the opportunity to legislate in order to ease rather than increase the burden on people who are prepared to pay, while giving wider power to dog wardens. Many dog wardens are doing excellent work throughout the nation.  They certainly are in my county.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that we are going somewhat over the top with regard to the muzzling of particular dogs, perhaps <Col N="709" /> over-reacting to some minor incidents. We should certainly ban the entry of particular breeds of dogs to this country.  In addition we should seriously consider the information Deputy Allen furnished to the House with regard to the overall position &mdash; the numbers and types of accidents that have occurred here and in England over the past couple of years.  It could well be argued that the legislation introduced in Britain has not changed the position there very much in real terms since the majority of accidents involve children in their homes.</P>
    <P>There is need for major improvements in the provisions of this Bill if we are to solve the problem.  Merely increasing the licence fee will not solve the problem without giving dog wardens power to collect such licence fees on the doorstep, which would be the sensible thing to do.  Indeed, I would contend that, if the Minister did nothing else, they would be worthwhile. Having spoken to many wardens I am convinced that the majority of them would be quite prepared to solve the problem on the doorstep, if a dog owner is not prepared to pay the licence fee within a day or so, a dog should be taken away. during which a dog may be taken away. That is the only way the legislative provisions can be enforced.  Increasing the licence fee from £5 to £10 will not solve any problem.  We should remember also that local authorities are starved of cash. I am sure the Minister's eyes have been opened since his appointment at how little cash there is available to tackle major problems.  Yet we passed legislation in this House to ensure that local authorities would provide dog wardens in each county, costing huge amounts of money we cannot obtain because the majority of people being asked to pay £5 are not paying even that amount.  Lo and behold, we now introduce this Bill the provisions of which will require them to pay £10.  One must ask if there is any sense in that.  I contend there is absolutely none unless dog wardens are given power to collect the licence fee.  That is what I am advocating.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take on board some of the points made in the course of <Col N="710" /> this debate.  If it takes another six or seven years to introduce amending legislation in this area we will have missed an ideal opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt but that all Members of this House are very concerned at the number of people who have been killed or seriously injured by dangerous dogs here and in Great Britain in the last year.  In spite of the many dogs that have had to be destroyed on foot of court orders, there remains a large number of potentially dangerous dogs who will undoubtedly cause injury or even death in the future.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glass, I would have to say I do not agree with the manner in which the Minister proposes to tackle this problem. We have had a foretaste of departmental thinking with the introduction of the draconian muzzling regulations by a former Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that dog owners generally are up in arms about these muzzling regulations, that dogs who have shown impeccable behaviour over many years have had to be muzzled? Some breeds of dogs which the Minister has included in his order are not suitable for muzzling and this regulation is immeasurably cruel to them.  It is a particularly ludicrous regulation in that it applies also to bulldogs, a harmless dog with a flat face.  Presumably the only way one could muzzle a bulldog would be to fit some kind of head cage which would completely encompass the dog's head. This regulation was a hasty, ill thought-out move, as are some of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Many dog owners feel very strongly about these provisions, ordinary citizens, upholders of the law, who have said they would rather go to jail than muzzle their dogs.  These are not extremists but ordinary people.  I must inform the Minister that there is very real disquiet among many dog owners about the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister has had an opportunity of reviewing the overall position, I hope he will introduce less stringent <Col N="711" /> muzzling regulations for dogs.  There appears to be an attitude or trend of thought in official circles that large dogs only constitute a threat to life and limb. People may tend to forget that children are very vulnerable to attacks by small dogs; even the toy dog breeds can be dangerous if they attack a two or three year old child.  When canvassing for the Green Party in the local elections I called on a man who showed me a scar on his face which had been caused when he was three years old by a toy breed dog which knocked him down.  We must remember that it is not always large dogs that do the damage, small ones can as well.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to dangerous dogs.  The Minister has power to ban ownership of any breed of dog he dislikes without the need for objective proof or statistics in regard to the behaviour of the breeds concerned.  The Minister's opinion is sufficient.  One would have to question the Minister's expertise in this matter, bearing in mind that a predecessor of his, the Minister for Justice, showed himself to be no expert in this area by his hamfisted handling of the muzzling regulations, demonstrating little or no understanding of dogs.</P>
    <P>We must remember also that there are many elderly people whose dog is their only friend and protector, especially while out walking.  What protection will their dog be when muzzled?  It is extremely unlikely that such a person would own a dog that would attack unless to protect its owner under extreme provocation, much the same as in the case of a normal human being.</P>
    <P>There is too much scope in the provisions of this Bill for the making of ministerial regulations.  For example, this Bill empowers the Minister to ban all dogs, of any breed he chooses, from being taken out for a walk in any public place. This gives the Minister far too much power.  I submit that &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; dogs should be defined by their behaviour not by their breed, since there are wide variations in character in any breed.  Responsible, well behaved owners should not be restricted or penalised because of the <Col N="712" /> breed of dog they own.  As the Minister should know, very often it is the owner who is at fault.  Because of their lack of understanding of animal welfare or because they are bad owners or train or breed fighting dogs, the Minister should legislate against them and not against the type of dog.</P>
    <P>We would all agree that the breeding and importation of pitbull terriers, which are specifically bred as fighting dogs, should be prohibited.  There may well be other breeds of this nature &mdash; and I am sure they could be dealt with &mdash; but the scope of the Bill should not extend to dogs such as German Shepherds or Dobermans.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the contents of a number of submissions sent to the Minister but I see no reference to them in the new Bill. A previous Minister said he would consult with the various relevant parties but this has not been done.  This Bill has been introduced and there is a suggestion that consultation will take place after the Bill is passed and before introducing the regulations.  It would appear that the Minister wants these sweeping powers before consulting the relevant parties.  Such arrangements would render consultation pointless.  It is evident that the Minister has already made up his mind on what he intends to do.  This is why the dog owners with whom I have been speaking are very concerned.  I fear the Minister will introduce more draconian measures if given a free hand.  The Department have already shown themselves to be capable of making ill-considered and ill-informed muzzling regulations which are arbitrarily applied to a random selection of dog breeds.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the issue of licence fees.  I agree totally with what the previous speaker has said in this regard. The licence fee of £5 is quite sufficient and if genuine efforts were made to collect it, it would provide sufficient revenue to run the dog warden service.  It is essential that we have identification of dogs. There is controversy about what form this should take but we all agree that dogs, when they are out in a public place, should wear some form of identification. <Col N="713" /> Also, for certain breeds of dogs there should be compulsory insurance to provide protection for people when attacked.  I think nobody would disagree with those provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to guard dog regulations which were introduced in 1988.  The Green Party would have very serious ideological problems about the whole principle of keeping guard dogs.  It must be a nonsense in the context of over 270,000 people being unemployed that security firms employ dogs instead of people.  Even on economic grounds, it is absolutely insane to give dogs this precedence over people.  The fact is that these dogs are allowed to roam freely behind wire.  It is well known that children can get in over these fences &mdash; not burglars or robbers &mdash; and they are savaged by these dogs.  Too many cases of this type occur.  We need to rethink this whole area of the use of security dogs.</P>
    <P>Because of the various points I have raised I will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to avail of the opportunity to make a small contribution to this Bill.  I do so as one who has dealt with and handled dogs since I was a small boy, as I am sure has been the case with most other Members of the House.  There are one or two things I would like to say in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>It is true that, following proposals in relation to muzzling of dogs etc., there was an outcry by people who genuinely thought they knew their animal well and that there was no possibility that the animal would behave otherwise than in a docile fashion.  As one who has dealt with such animals over a number of years I am sorry to say that is not the case.  Any dog, without provocation, can at the snap of the fingers change and do something completely out of character; that is the real danger.  People have got to realise that many of these animals &mdash; I am speaking about the varieties which have caused the problems and which are dealt with specifically in this Bill &mdash; have been domesticated to a large extent, but some are bred for a particular purpose and have caused serious problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> A minority of animals that have been well cared for, well trained and so on can be quite normal but the possibility of an outburst is one for which we pay very highly.  There is no comeback if a child is savaged or a person is attacked.  One cannot then say that normally this animal was a domesticated, docile creature; it is completely against that animal's character that he or she should have behaved in that fashion.  There is no compensation for the person concerned.  Neither is it any compensation for the person concerned that the dog, the animal or the owner had insurance for that purpose. We have seen photographs in some of the newspapers and television pictures in the past three or four weeks of a young person recovering having been savaged by a dog.  The legislation is justified and I put down a Private Notice Question on the subject some months ago which was disallowed for various reasons.</P>
    <P>There are certain breeds of dogs which have been introduced to this country in the past number of years for reasons of machoism, for want of a better word.  The local toughs want to have one of these animals and to be seen dragging them around so that they will put terror and fear into the hearts of all normal, civilised human beings.  The one way to eliminate that problem is to ban them completely, and over a period of eight to ten years the problem will disappear but we must muzzle those in existence.  I do not think anyone would expect to be given permission to walk a pet tiger without a muzzle and that is how it must be compared.  Some animals may be normal for a period but suddenly they can snap.  I had an experience several years ago of seeing a well known variety of household pet behave in a most peculiar fashion, seriously injuring at least three people and would have killed somebody had it not been that a number of bystanders were prepared to take action.</P>
    <P>Genuinely concerned people are worried about their pets being muzzled.  I can understand their anxiety, their fear and so on because they have known the animals over a period and presume that that animal will not react in a particular <Col N="715" /> fashion.  The statistics in relation to the number of attacks by a specified number of animals are unacceptable and repeat attacks by the same breed of animal are not acceptable.  In the US the number of attacks over a ten year period by pitbull terriers has been very high.  Those dogs have been used to intimidate people, to assist in robberies and in other criminal acts.  In a civilised society we cannot stand idly by and allow this to happen on the basis that individuals have the right and freedom to own these animals.  The greater common good has to take precedence and I hope this is what is intended under the Bill.  While those who own animals are concerned that the ways these animals can be used will be curtailed it is a fact that we must balance one against the other and, as I understand it, that is the purpose of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their interesting and positive contributions to this debate.  The major objective of the Bill is to ensure that we are in a position to deal comprehensively with the problem of dangerous dogs.  Happily, we do not have too serious a problem at present but it is an area where new problems will develop as time goes on.  The best way to ensure that a serious problem does not develop is to have the power to take appropriate action quickly when this is called for to nip potential problems in the bud.</P>
      <P>That is the reason I was surprised by a number of the contributions to this debate.  Some Deputies seemed to infer that because we did not have a major problem on our hands we should wait until something happened before doing something about it but this runs contrary to what Deputies say in the House.  Normally, they ask what is the reason we do not try to anticipate what difficulties may arise, prepare for them and provide leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, it was suggested that, in a knee-jerk reaction, someone suddenly decided during the past two days to prepare a Bill and bring it before the House <Col N="716" /> without consultations.  Following tragic developments last summer, we consulted with all the interests involved and published a Bill, as far back as last October. Therefore, the suggestion that, in a knee-jerk reaction, we are rushing a Bill which was published last October through the House in late February runs in the face of what many Opposition Deputies have been saying: let us reform the House and try to deal with Bills more quickly.  The only way we can deal with a Bill is to have it discussed in the House.  It is very difficult to accept the contention, therefore, that we are rushing a Bill, which was published six months ago, through the House.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on us that we have so badly treated what has been rightly described as man's best friend.  There is a real need for us to change our approach and attitude towards dogs.  We must encourage &mdash; if necessary, compel &mdash; children through education, where possible, to adopt a more responsible attitude to dog ownership.</P>
    <P>One of the most beautiful sights at this time of the year is a hillside with a flock of sheep, both ewes and lambs.  Yet, tonight in different parts of the country the torn bodies of these little animals will be strewn across fields and ditches.  I said, and most Deputies would agree with me, that a dog is man's best friend.  I have a dog called Prince and, like Deputy Durkan, I am aware of the loyalty that that little animal is capable of showing. There are approximately 750,000 dogs in the country but less than one-third are licensed.  I, as Minister for the Environment have no wish to introduce legislation which sets out to deliberately cut across or make the task of good owners, who care for loyal dogs, more difficult but what are we faced with?  Only one-third of the dog population is licensed which means a huge number are uncared for and straying.</P>
    <P>Is it right that a young child in this city should be afraid to walk into a public park today or any other day?  We can make all the arguments we like about breeds and about the way we should regulate them but surely there has to be an <Col N="717" /> onus on the public to look after their dogs.  Even though a great number are very careful and manage their dogs to the best of their ability we have to face up to the fact that many dog owners do not license their dogs or care for them.  As a result, there are many marauding dogs in fields, on farms, in our towns and cities who pose a threat.  I hope during the course of the debate on Committee Stage we will be able to reach a consensus that this is not a knee-jerk reaction, that these proposals have been teased out during the past few months, that ongoing representations are being made and that, in the final analysis, we will have a measured and coherent way of bringing about a change for the better.</P>
    <P>Apart from the problem of specially bred and trained dangerous dogs there is also the problem of unwanted and uncared for dogs.  As Deputies have outlined, these were provided as Christmas or birthday presents for children without any consideration being given to the demands a dog makes in terms of care and attention.  At best these dogs become known as &ldquo;latch key&rdquo; dogs.  This means that they are shunted out of the house in the morning and left to run loose all day. At worst, these gift dogs become strays and a greater nuisance and hazard.</P>
    <P>Another illustration of irresponsible dog ownership is the ownership of dogs which because of their size and temperament are not suitable for life in confined urban circumstances.  Big dogs, which would be fine in an open rural environment where they can run off their energy harmlessly, fret and become agitated when confined in small back gardens.  These animals can cause problems when released in a public open space.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that the Bill was a panic measure.  I cannot understand how he could reach such a conclusion. He also suggested it was a sledgehammer with which to crack a nut.  I certainly would not like to be Deputy Mitchell if the onus was on him to face a parent or to visit in hospital a patient who had been savaged, with cuts to the face, hands and limbs, by a dog &mdash; some of us have had this experience.  I do not agree we are <Col N="718" /> using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  On this side of the House we are not saying we have a monopoly of wisdom.  We listen to the other views to make the Bill better.  I do not understand how Deputy Mitchell could consider his contribution was of help to me in advancing and developing the proposals before us.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and O'Sullivan suggested I should have consultations with interested bodies but, as I said, consultations have taken place with interested bodies.  I received submissions from them and they will be given the fullest consideration before the regulations are made.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for his positive and helpful contribution.  I assure him that his concerns and suggestions will be taken into account.  I also assure him that I will be taking measured and considered action.  I will not be making rash or ill-considered regulations.  The important point is that the Bill is very flexible and will enable me to take measures appropriate to the circumstances.  I want to come back to the question of flexibility, having the kind of regulatory system which can be called upon to deal with situations which we perhaps do not anticipate now but which would not require another Bill or a three or six months' wait before we could deal comprehensively with problems which may well develop.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell and Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan suggested that there should be control on the ownership of dogs.  I can imagine the cries about draconian measures if we went down that road.  It is extremely difficult to isolate the breeds which may cause problems, but heaven help the Minister who has to decide that it is the owners who cause the problems.  I hope that somebody else will be in my place when a decision of that kind has to be made.  There were suggestions about how regulations might be framed and these are matters which will be considered when the Bill is passed. Suggestions will be taken into account as well as all the other views we have received.  Deputy Jim Mitchell asked what was the purpose of sterilisation, one <Col N="719" /> of the options for regulations.  The intention is to have a facility to allow a particular breed which we want to eliminate to die out naturally by way of sterilisation instead of demanding that the dog be put down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan talked about funding for dog control measures.  This funding comes from dog licence fees and obviously more money will be provided by the higher licence fees.  One of the big problems is the low level of licensing.  I covered this earlier.  It is an area in which we will be encouraging local authorities to be more active.  He also suggested that it was wrong to have a standard licence fee.  This is acknowledged in the Bill, which allows me to set different levels of fees for different types of dogs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen questioned the priority given to this Bill.  The Bill was presented last October and is only now being considered, which hardly supports the view that it has been rushed.  He also mentioned wandering horses.  Of course, it is a matter which must be addressed; but it hardly justifies not dealing with the problem of dangerous dogs.  We should not confine ourselves in this House to channels which force us to deal with one problem at a time.  I hope we have enough confidence in ourselves to take on quite a number of problems at the same time and deal with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also quoted statistics from a document published in the UK regarding the breeds of dogs and the relationship to accidents recorded in hospitals.  He said there were only three cases out of so many thousands which were serious from the point of view of the hospital.  I want to say two things about the statistics to which he referred. In trotting out statistics one would have to take account of the total number of the breed in the country relative to other breeds, and whatever breed is in the majority is likely to have the most accidents of some kind or another; we all accept that.  However, when it comes to very serious accidents arising from dangerous dogs you will find that the breed to which he referred is far down on <Col N="720" /> the scale.  In this instance we are talking about very powerful dogs who have demonstrated in no uncertain terms their capacity not just to inflict minor injury but the kind of injury which is lasting, sometimes permanent and, in regrettable cases, lethal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt raised the question of a possible defect in the 1986 Act in relation to the powers of the court to order the putting down of a dangerous dog.  I should like to discuss with Deputy Michael Kitt the case which he mentioned as I am not aware of it.  We will look at this matter because, as I understand the legislation, that legal authority has been available to the courts since 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen thought that the increase in licence fees was unreasonable.  The present fees have been in existence since 1984 and I see nothing wrong in a substantial increase now.  However, in view of the measures being adopted, the resources which become available in the context of the dog warden system being improved, or any other suggestions which enable us to ensure a much wider and more successful collection of these licence fees, it could well be that this could afford an opportunity in the future in regard to licences.  I was trying to ensure a realistic increase, bearing in mind that the last increase was made in 1984 and I hope we will have the kind of dog warden service which will be adequate to meet the need.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also referred to the incidence of dog attacks in the home, I have already covered that.  Deputy Briscoe talked about the licence fee and the value of dogs for security purposes. However, £30 for his three dogs is very cheap for his peace of mind.  He said that the £10 licence fee is likely to represent only a fraction of the cost of a visit to a veterinary surgeon.  While I do not want to make light of this, it is extraordinary &mdash; this has nothing to do with Deputy Briscoe's contribution &mdash; that sometimes, when it comes to charges, licence fees or proposals of that kind for a national service, we are often worried about the amount; yet, when it comes to something <Col N="721" /> which many of us might not regard as important on a comparative basis, we seem to be much more free in what we can afford.  This is an increase after eight years and I hope it will be helpful in widening the scope of the dog warden service to take account of some of the overall problems at present, enabling us to manage them better and to control them.  If we can do that, then whatever scope or opportunity there may be to take account of those will be sympathetically considered and taken on board.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon described the muzzling regulation as harsh.  I should like to point out that the muzzling requirement applies only to a dog in a public place; there is no restriction on a dog in its home or garden.  We will, in the context of the regulations, make sure that muzzling as an option could in the long run find acceptance as far as specified dangerous breeds are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly suggested that dog wardens should be allowed to collect licence fees and issue licences.  This is possible within the existing legislation and indeed some local authorities are beginning to move in that direction.  It will be interesting to see how this works out and certainly we must encourage any action which will achieve a higher level of licensing.  I am sorry that Deputy Farrelly is not here because I understand he made a real contribution in stimulating interest in the 1986 Act.  I am now affording him the opportunity to collect almost directly those licences in County Meath and I expect that the 2,000 licences which were paid this year will be suitably enhanced before we talk about the matter again.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their thoughtful and considered comments. When the Bill is enacted I will be making comprehensive regulations to replace those currently in operation.  I will be taking account of all the views I have received and of the experience we have had in the operation of existing regulations.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his kind words of welcome.  The purpose of this Bill is to dissolve the Land Commission and to provide for attendant matters.  The Bill was previously before the House in May 1989.  However, before Second Stage was completed the Dáil was dissolved.  It is now necessary to start the legislative procedure again.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill in 1989 the Minister gave a brief outline of the history of the commission.  It is not necessary to repeat this.  The full text is available in the Dáil Official Report of 2 May 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all acknowledge that the Land Commission are an ancient institution who have been closely associated with the land situation in this country for over 100 years.  Starting in 1881 as a rent fixing body, they took on the responsibility in later years of buying out the landlords and making the tenants proprietors of their holdings.  While much of this work was done before independence, it was only under native administration that the operation was completed.  By 1930 over 400,000 holdings had been bought out, covering an area of approximately 14 million acres.  In the process landlordism was abolished and the land of Ireland was back again in native hands.  Such a transformation in the land tenure system <Col N="723" /> could only be described as a major social revolution.</P>
    <P>With the completion of land purchase the Land Commission moved on to the third phase of their long and varied career.  This was to improve the physical conditions of so many of our holdings. These conditions were rather grim, particularly in the west of Ireland.  The holdings for the most part were small and badly fragmented; the productivity of the land was low due to lack of drainage and farm buildings were primitive.  To meet the situation the Land Commission embarked on a vast programme of structural reform which aimed, through the acquisition and distribution of land, to enlarge and rearrange small holdings and generally to relieve congestion.  One of the constraints in achieving the latter aim was the fact that in areas where the problem of congestion was most acute there was often little land available for acquisition.  In such circumstances the only way of getting land was through migration. This meant that a land holder gave up his home holding and was given a new holding elsewhere.  The land given up was then used to enlarge and rearrange the remaining holdings.</P>
    <P>This programme changed the face of rural Ireland.  The worst agricultural slums were abolished through migration and distribution, holdings were enlarged and rearranged, fragmentation was reduced and farm size increased.  New <Col N="724" /> buildings were provided to replace the old ones and water supplies were laid on. The overall effect of these improvements was to give hope to the smaller farmers and provide them with a solid base on which they could build for the future.</P>
    <P>By the end of the seventies, however, it was generally accepted that the Land Commission had outlived their usefulness.  There were a number of reasons for this.  In the first place the pool of large estates available for acquisition had declined considerably.  Accordingly, the Land Commission found themselves acquiring smaller unused properties, the acquisition of which in general proved long and tedious as owners availed of their statutory rights to oppose proceedings to the limit.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton in moving the motion last night said Fine Gael had no inflexible demands in relation to the composition of the Jobs Forum.  I welcome that approach.  What is equally important is that the same openness should apply in regard to its terms of reference.  May I take it that the Deputy will honour the commitment given when he said that Fine Gael were prepared to approach the Forum with open minds and no preconceived agenda?  He said that no institutions would be sacrosanct in the pursuit of employment aims and also that it was not his intention to inflict undeserved wounds on this Government for presiding over the worst jobless figures in the history of the State.  That poses what I consider to be the most important question in the whole debate: who is responsible for job creation?  Are the Government or the private sector responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton rightly said that between the years of 1987 and 1991 Irish GNP increased by 25 per cent, yet during that period employment increased by only 5 per cent.  Do Members not accept that that record is not good enough to create wealth and that there has to be a fair distribution of the fruits of growth? That was not in evidence during that <Col N="730" /> period.  There was substantial growth in GNP but the jobs did not come on stream.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bruton and Ahearn referred to the present social welfare code as a potential disincentive to employment and suggested the rationalisation of means testing so that no one would lose out by taking a job.  Any proposal of that nature would inflict further suffering on the poorer section of our population.</P>
    <P>What is needed most here is the introduction of statutory minimum wage legislation.  Such legislation is already in force in some European countries and in the United States.  I am glad that the Minister for Finance is in the House.  I regret very much that in his capacity as Minister for Labour he resisted the introduction of minimum wage legislation.  That would be one positive way to get us out of the poverty trap.</P>
    <P>There has been a growth in the number of people who are in part-time employment.  They are being exploited, by the major supermarket chains in particular. Such exploitation is now organised on a grand scale.  People can be employed part time for the greater part of their working lives.  That is a problem that will have to be tackled by any forum that is set up.  I hope that in the openness envisaged by Deputy Bruton some consideration will be given to that abuse.</P>
    <P>In addition, there should be an increased tax free allowance for the lower paid.  The notion that means-testing of social welfare benefits will reduce the jobless figures does not stand up to close examination if one considers the current jobless figure of 276,000 and compares it with the figure used by the Minister for Finance of 18,000 jobs created last year. For every one who refuses employment on the basis that a loss of social welfare payment would be suffered there must be at least 20 qualified people waiting in line for a job.  It is a fallacy to suggest that part of the problem is that people offered employment will not accept it on the basis that they will suffer a loss of social welfare.  That is an area the forum should examine.  I do consider there is <Col N="731" /> little relationship between the number of refusals and the number of jobs on offer.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Bruton's reply to the debate I should like him to indicate whether he intends to pursue the eight-point programme he announced on 21 May 1991. Whilst I agree with the thrust of his programme, I have serious reservations about the fifth point which proposes to dispense with unfair dismissals legislation in certain cases.  Granted, the Deputy did include the proviso that that would be by agreement with the unions.  That is something I would not favour.  Whilst I am not trying to pre-empt any decision to be taken in the discussion, I feel the unfair dismissals legislation is fundamental labour legislation which offers the greatest protection to workers.</P>
    <P>Whilst it is everyone's business to help to defeat unemployment, I do not feel the existing workforce should be asked to shoulder an unfair share of the burden.</P>
    <P>I wish to address my remarks to some gentlemen in the business community who for a considerable time have been writing the political agenda as well as the economic and social priorities of our society.  One of the leading industrialists said, without the slighest shame, in a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme that unemployment would not come down.  Worse, he said that he as a businessman had no responsibility whatever in that matter.  I am not suggesting that those views were representative of the entire business community in Ireland &mdash; far from it &mdash; but they were representative of an extremely powerful businessman who had great influence on the Government and the commercial life here.  At the moment several inquiries are in progress and I do not wish to mention his name or to quote him; it would be unfair to do so.  Nonetheless, his remarks were indicative of the attitude of the business community, that they have no responsibility in that regard.  The paradox is that through State grants and tax incentives the State is spending £800 million per annum to support those business activities.  That did not strike the individual to whom I have referred, or some of the so-called <Col N="732" />&ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;, as being extremely odd. They receive vast sums of money in support from the State yet they consider they are not obliged in any way to take responsibility for job creation.</P>
    <P>At a recent James Larkin commemoration Mr. Cockburn, a British-born citizen who has lived in Ireland for many years and is now a journalist in the United States, was invited to lecture.  He pinpointed one of the problems with multinational companies as being that many of them go for the cheap labour market.  Cork people experienced that move in the closures of Ford and Dunlop. Ford moved out of Cork because they could have their cars produced more cheaply in Spain.  Dunlop moved to the Far East, where they could get both raw materials and cheap labour.  For how long can we hope to move the lines of production to the cheap labour market and hope to maintain our markets on this side of the world?  That will not go on indefinitely.  There is ample evidence that there is now a concerted effort on the part of multinational companies in particular to go to the cheap labour market to the detriment of the Western World. They cannot on the one hand complain about the loss of markets and the loss of profits and then seek to avail of cheap labour.  Fortunately, the more socially responsible members of the business community are changing their attitude in this regard and feel they have some obligation.  I welcome the endorsement by the employer organisations of the forum on unemployment.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the trade union movement are at last realising that they have a definite role in job creation.  The growth of centres for the unemployed making various courses available in language and office procedures is a definite contribution to tackling the problem of the unemployed, but it is only an initial step.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton in his opening remarks said that he was open to suggestion.  As confirmation of that I would ask him to take on board the Labour Party amendment on this issue.  There is a willingness on the part of my party to participate. <Col N="733" /> We see our amendment as a very positive step in that regard and we hope that Deputy Bruton will see his way to taking it on board, getting us off to a firm start. There are many areas that have to be addressed.</P>

Exploitation is taking place in an organised fashion throughout the country.</P>

      <P>The present surge in unemployment is partly the outcome of the success of the economic policies pursued in the 1960s and early 1970s.  During that period the trend in emigration was reversed whereby more people were coming into the country than were leaving.  The children of the families who returned to the country at that time have now entered the labour market.  To accommodate this exceptional increase in the labour force would require unprecedented levels of economic growth and job creation.  The present increase in unemployment represents, in effect, the shortfall between the growth in jobs and the growth in the labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How long is this situation likely to last? The ESRI in their &ldquo;Scenario 2000&rdquo; envisage the rise in the numbers of Irish people of working age increasing from 68 per cent of the population in 1988 to 71 per cent by 1996.  After that pressure will tend to ease so that a more rapid decline in unemployment levels can be expected at that stage.  The age profile of the population and of the labour force will also change over that period.  Instead of this higher proportion being under 30 years, fewer young people will be entering the labour market.  This means that more <Col N="734" /> stable population and labour force patterns will be in place in keeping with current trends in Europe.</P>
    <P>The question is what are we doing about it?  What are the Government's policies to respond to these developments?  The first priority is to maintain a sound, competitive economy for stimulating growth and expanding employment.  In approaching this task we must not lose sight of what has been achieved in recent years.  GNP growth has averaged over 4 per cent a year and reached 7.5 per cent in 1990 compared with a negative growth rate for the mid-1980s. We have achieved one of the lowest inflation rates in Europe and rates of personal taxation have been significantly reduced, particularly for the lower paid. We have a stable exchange rate. Exchequer expenditure has been brought under control and a satisfactory industrial relations climate has prevailed, together with moderate pay increases.  In addition, significant gains in competitiveness have meant that we have increased our market share in terms of exports despite the prolonged global recession.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's winter bulletin acknowledged that:</P>
    <P>the overall performance of the economy would have been worse but for the positive effect of the competitiveness gains which have been achieved over recent years.  This has to be contrasted with the experience of the mid-80s when there was negative growth, a stagnant economy, decline in output and fewer people at work due to a high level of borrowing, high public expenditure, high taxation and declining demand.  Since 1987 we have succeeded in stimulating growth; we have more people at work even though there are more people looking for work. </P>
    <P>There can be no complacency in that regard.  While Deputy O'Sullivan can criticise the number of people who have been put back to work since Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987, he supported policies in the mid-eighties which ensured that fewer people were at work when the <Col N="735" /> administration which he supported came to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was indeed, longer than the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Against that background there can be no compromise on the economic strategy based on social consensus.  This Government's approach is based on a consultative philosophy of participation by the social partners.  Progress is monitored by all the parties through the Central Review Committee.</P>
      <P>Adherence to the agreed strategy is all the more essential with the decline in world trade.  Unless we maintain and improve our competitiveness during the current global recession we shall not be able to exploit and capitalise on the opportunities presented by the increased demand when the recession ends.  If we can learn anything from past mistakes that is one of the major lessons we have to learn.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the complexity of the employment creation process.  It involves employers deciding to meet market demands for products and services and it also involves decisions by employers on how the goods and services are to be produced.  Such decisions are affected by international conditions, economic policy in this country, industrial relations, wage rates and many other factors.</P>
      <P>There exists a number of committees and institutions to deal with the employment issue as it stands.  The Central Review Committee, which has responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> have devoted a considerable amount of their work to looking at elements of the programme dealing specifically with increased employment and reduced unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force on Employment are representative of employers organisations, trade unions, individual employers and official agencies and was <Col N="736" /> set up a year ago.  The task force have made a series of recommendations to Government on specific actions that could be taken to increase employment levels or reduce unemployment levels. Those are being considered as a matter of urgency.  There now exists a Government committee comprising the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance, the Environment and myself to follow up on the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group.  There is an expert committee monitoring the implementation of the Culliton report also.  This committee of the Government is supported by a Committee of Departmental Secretaries and others.  Until recently we also had the Sectoral Development Committee.  Much of the work of the National Economic and Social Council which is representative of agricultural interests, industry, employers, the construction industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the National Youth Council, has concentrated on the employment problem.</P>
    <P>All of these bodies have representatives of the ICTU, the FIE and many other interested parties.  There is no shortage of advisory bodies on which any concerned organisation may have their say.  Do we need another?  As Deputy Bruton stated last evening, the problems associated with job creation and unemployment will not disappear by appointing another body.  There is no &ldquo;quick-fix&rdquo; solution.  At the end of the day sustainable, viable employment must be found in medium term and long term employment strategies that are soundly based and capable of generating the growth and wealth which will improve the standard of living and quality of life for all sectors of the community, and will increase job opportunities for all.</P>
    <P>The Government accept that people who wish to participate in finding a solution to this problem, which will confront us over the medium term, should be accommodated in an appropriate institutional structure.  The Taoiseach will announce his proposals in this respect in a few weeks.  We live in a parliamentary democracy.  Every Deputy has a mandate <Col N="737" /> to represent any sector of the community. Based on this principle of consultation and consensus, differences of opinion and the rights of interest groups to be heard must be accommodated.  In giving expression to this principle parliamentarians have the primary role instead of so-called or, in many cases, self-appointed unrepresentative &ldquo;experts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruairí Quinn made a point last night which should be addressed.  He suggests that whatever body might be established as a result of this debate shouold deal not only with strategies for long term job creation but also address the prospect of the numbers who may not find work in the period ahead.  I agree with him.  The Culliton report recommended that FÁS should recognise the sharp distinction between the support activities for the unemployed and &ldquo;industry relevant&rdquo; training.  Social training is needed to help people who have been unemployed for some time.  In my view training must be directed at integrating them into the workforce and to provide, in a flexible way, the opportunities to allow people to regain their motivation and, in some cases, their self-esteem and to develop and update their skills.</P>
    <P>This will involve a closer interface between the education and training bodies.  I intend to consider action in this direction as a matter of urgency in the context of the Green Paper on education to be published shortly and the White Paper on manpower policy which I hope to present some time in June or July.  In this way my objective is to stimulate more mobility in the labour market between those who are unemployed and those who are at work.  If one looks at the statistics available in my Department one sees that there is a surprising amount of mobility in the labour force at present, although we have to admit there is a hard core of people who find they are unable to get on any of the schemes or avail of opportunities to improve the skills that are provided under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>Of course, we cannot be complacent. What can be done immediately in the <Col N="738" /> interim, given the demographic realities we have to face?  I am glad to say that on Monday last I finalised the details of the job training scheme with Commissioner Papandreou, who is responsible for the Community Social Affairs portfolio.  A new departure for the two schemes &mdash; the job training scheme and the employment subsidy scheme &mdash; is that the aid rate from the Commission will be 75 per cent instead of 65 per cent, which has been the norm up to now.  In addition, in relation to the job training scheme, the Commission has agreed to our proposals that employer funding could be used to match and draw down ESF funds, thus obviating the need for Exchequer funds. This concession was achieved from the Commission following strong arguments from us in relation to the difficult budgetary situation we are facing.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme, which I intend to launch early next week, is already operational and FÁS are receiving applications to participate from employers.  In very brief terms, an employer will receive a subsidy of £54 per week in respect of each additional worker taken on above a base level of last November, if that worker has been on the live register for two months.  Payments will be made in arrears, as the scheme is specifically designed to encourage employers to take on people who are on the live register.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme represents a major breakthrough in support for training by employers.  FÁS studies indicate that well over half of Irish employees receive no training of any sort in a year. Figures for training by Irish employers show that only 20 per cent of trainees receive formal off-the-job training each year.  In addition there has been little increase in the amount of employee training in Ireland over the past number of years.  This is a matter which has to be addressed if we intend to update and improve the skills base in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme will involve both directed training and work-place training.  Directed training is a planned <Col N="739" /> and directed programme which is insulated from immediate operational pressures and will in all likelihood be carried out in FÁS training centres.  Work-place training is training under normal operational job pressures on the factory floor, with commercial or other pressures applying, but planned and structured to afford the opportunity to further practise skills and competencies so as to give trainees the opportunity to reach experienced worker standards.  That is a new departure and a new component in our training programme which I hope will become a long term feature of our training methods in the future.  The training therefore, must be both structured and supervised.  It will be based on a plan agreed between FÁS and the employers before training starts.  Employers will be paid 75 per cent of the normal FÁS training allowance.  This scheme represents, I believe, a major improvement in our training arrangements and one on which we will build in the future.  Based on initial figures in the Department of Labour in its first month of operation, we are very hopeful that the job subsidy scheme can take as many as 12,000 people off the live register this year.  By going down the country and ensuring that FÁS are actively involved in publicising this at public meetings throughout the country, and encouraging employers, I intend to ensure that people will see the merits of this scheme, because it offers a great opportunity to Irish employers.  We have heard a great deal about overseas industry but we are giving Irish industry the opportunity to put their shoulder to the wheel in order to deal with what is the major problem facing the country at present.</P>
    <P>The success of the two schemes depends on the take-up by employers. We have put the funds from the Community in place and the initiative now, as I have said, rests with employers.  The problem of unemployment is one which affects all society, not just Government, and all of us must play our part in trying to solve it.  I therefore appeal in the strongest terms to employers to avail of both <Col N="740" /> the employment subsidy scheme and the job training scheme to the greatest extent possible.  It is in their interest to do so.</P>
    <P>I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the contribution made by the European Social Fund to training and retraining in this country.  Without such assistance we would not have been able to provide what I believe to be the sophisticated facilities and quality of training which obtains in Ireland at present.  In the years to come, the European Social Fund is likely to have an even greater impact on our system of training and even on aspects of our education system.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring forward a well thought out proposal which will involve our national training authority getting involved in the European labour market.  It is quite clear that we are not creating the number of jobs we need in our economy and, indeed, must provide if we are to deal with the unemployment problem.  Too often and for far too long the political system has kept its head stuck in the ground, ostrich-like, and has been afraid to look at the job opportunities available in the European Community.  I believe that our young people in particular are as entitled as anyone else in the member states to be in a position to take on board the opportunities that exist in the European labour market. There is good reason to believe that there are prospects for getting European funding for our national placement authority, FÁS, becoming involved in the manpower agencies in Europe.  Our young people should have the option to work in Europe.  We are putting our head in the sand if on the one hand we talk about an integrated Europe but are not prepared to look out for the job opportunities that may be available to our people in Europe.  We are being inconsistent and illogical.  When Monet and the others set up the European Community their idea was to create the free movement of capital, services and labour.</P>
    <P>We have demographic problems which means that we are not providing the level of jobs required to deal with the unemployment problem.  No Government of any political colour could provide an <Col N="741" /> immediate solution to that problem.  That is open honest politics and it is about time that everybody in this House faces up to that fact.  As Minister for Labour I will ensure that whatever alternatives or opportunities are available, either in this country or in Europe, the people who seek job opportunities will be given some options and that we will be fighting for those jobs in the same way as every other member state is fighting for jobs for their people.</P>

      <P>Let no one be in any doubt that the task facing us as a nation in endeavouring to meet the challenge of providing jobs for the unprecedented numbers of people who are seeking work in this country is an enormous one.  The enormity of the problem means that there are no instant or short term solutions. When we look at factors such as the demographic pressures for the remainder of this decade, it is clear that a fundamental change is necessary in our traditional approach to the problem.  There will be some 58,000 entrants to the labour force each year during the nineties, representing a net increase of over 25,000 per annum.  The great irony is that if for a moment one puts to one side the current high unemployment levels, the fact is that <Col N="742" /> the Irish economy has put in a very creditable performance in 1991.  This happened despite economic disimprovement and rising alarm in some of our major export markets.</P>
      <P>Last year our economic growth was relatively good compared to the OECD average.  Other OECD countries have severe problems.  Yet our exports increased &mdash; a considerable achievement at a time of economic recession internationally.  The overall public finances outturn for the year was very close to the budget estimates for last year.</P>
      <P>International trade is critical to Irish economic development.  Exports account for over 60 per cent of our gross domestic product.  For this reason one would expect Ireland to be hit particularly badly by adverse trading circumstances, such as world trade growth falling to 3 per cent in 1991 compared with 5 per cent in 1990, coupled with marginal output growth in the total OECD area and a fall of 2 per cent in UK output.  Yet in that same period exports of manufactured goods from Ireland increased by an estimated 8 per cent in volume terms.  This export performance was not confined, as many critics regularly carp, to the branch plants of multinational firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be available shortly.  It was in fact widely spread across the manufacturing sector.  On the home front, our economic growth in 1991 was twice the OECD average; and the ESRI expect a modest but broadly based recovery in output for 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some impressive successes for our economy therefore.  The credit for much of this must go to the Irish people generally, as they have taken a view that moderate policies to restore and maintain the competitiveness of our economic activity are fundamental for our ability to trade and prosper.  Since <Col N="743" /> 1987, therefore, there have been impressive gains in non-agricultural employment, especially in services employment. This was a notable achievement for Ireland.  In previous international recessions, job shedding was a significant problem here.  The more competitive edge of recent years has enabled us to hold steady this time.  Yet we cannot be content with our record as regards increasing the numbers at work, not only to meet the demands of new entrants to the workforce each year, but to make serious inroads into the live register, now standing at over 276,000 and in particular the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>It was because of my concerns with the effectiveness of industrial and job creation policy that I set up, last June, the Industrial Policy Review Group, also known as the Culliton Group.  Their report has met with a strong endorsement on all sides in this House and outside. The Government have responded with equal determination to see that the report and its radical agenda for change are implemented.  We set up a task force on the implementation of the Culliton report to get speedy action on the wide range of recommendations coming from them. What is different, innovative and challenging about the Culliton report is that it takes such a comprehensive approach and goes well beyond what might be traditionally regarded as coming within the remit of industrial policy.  It addresses a wide range of deep seated obstacles to growth in our economy and underlines the need for changes, not only in our industrial support systems but also in our job training, education, energy, transport and other fields.</P>
    <P>There has been a general view that the Culliton group was right: that it is now time for a broad and extensive change in the ways in which all these key issues impact on industrial policy.  Nor does the Culliton report overlook the vital importance of our taxation policy as a vehicle for encouraging economic growth and job creation.  One particular quote from the review puts it succinctly:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation. </P>
    <P>This was the view of successful industrialists.  We would ignore it at our peril. The Progressive Democrats, and indeed the whole Government, fully endorse those sentiments and the recent budget gave evidence of our determination to act in this key area.  Now the Culliton report will not become just another report in an endless series; it will be acted upon.  It is, in my view, the best prescription for long term sustainable growth, development and job creation. But, as Culliton itself makes clear, there are no quick fixes, no easy solutions and further significant progress on the jobs front will be slow.</P>
    <P>My emphasis so far has been on the need for change and to bring about the reforms in our systems that will put more people to work.  We have to recognise, however, that no matter how successful this Government or any Government are in addressing the unemployment crisis by creating jobs through industrial policy reform, tax changes, securing more overseas investment, etc., serious long term unemployment will remain a feature of Irish life for the foreseeable future.  In view of this, and being determined to effectively address the sense of alienation and hopelessness felt by the unemployed and their families and to ensure that they are accorded meaningful participation in society, I am anxious that the initiative to be taken by the Government in this area is one that primarily addresses the needs of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Among the useful contributions which the forthcoming forum should address are the following: (1) to carry out a detailed analysis of the labour market, covering its composition, participation rates, and forecasting the trends for the next decade; (2) to carry out a detailed analysis of those on the live register, including such issues as skill levels, age, duration unemployed, work experience, socio-economic factors, and to more <Col N="745" /> accurately assess the real level of unemployment; (3) to examine measures that could increase the overall level of employment, including an assessment of working time initiatives such as job sharing, part-time work, reduced working hours in lieu of wage increases, and limits on overtime; (4) to look at what changes are needed in the Social Welfare system to facilitate unemployed persons to take up casual employment; (5) to examine measures that could be adopted to involve the long term unemployed in projects, like the social employment schemes; (6) to examine the scope for involving the unemployed more fully in the educational system and vocational training so as to build their personal development and skill levels ranging from basic literacy to specific vocational skills; and (7) to examine the interaction of the social welfare and other support services with the income tax system in order to identify the extent of both the unemployment and poverty traps and to examine measures that could be adopted to alleviate both.</P>
    <P>I also believe a major challenge which this initiative or forum must address is to enable the unemployed themselves, through unemployment action groups and the like, to present their own views and proposals.  That is essential if their rightful frustration and sense of alienation is to be effectively addressed.</P>
    <P>We have many initiatives and proposals to be implemented to improve the jobs market.  They include the Culliton report obviously, the Task Force on Employment, the central Review Committee of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> That is why this new initiative must focus primarily on the plight and the needs of the unemployed themselves.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny. I congratulate Deputy Bruton on introducing this motion, which will at least help to concentrate our minds on the issue.  However, when we read the <Col N="746" /> motion it does not seem to be very helpful.  It involves sitting for months preparing reports on a whole series of areas. Paragraph (h) of Deputy Bruton's motion reads:</P>
      <P>(h) based on the above studies, to seek to reach agreement on a comprehensive programme of structural reform of Irish society, designed to achieve both a higher long term level of economic growth, and a higher level of employment for any given level of economic activity and... </P>
      <P>That is supposed to be the significant paragraph.  I cannot make head or tail of it.  For example, how one reaches agreement on a comprehensive programme of structural reform of Irish society which will create jobs in some way or other is not specified.  I was most disappointed at the Minister's contribution when he came up with the old canard that you cannot get jobs here at home; you never will get jobs here at home, so head for Europe. Indeed, the Fianna Fáil amendment does not appear to be much better.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what are the demographic realities of Irish society which mean that the serious problem of unemployment is likely to persist.  I do not understand.  Are there too many children born, too few people dying?  Or is it that people are not emigrating in sufficient numbers?  It has to be one of those three.  The demographic realities are comprised in the numbers of our people, our resources and how we are going to put them all to work.  That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Labour Party are prepared to use those terrible words which have been an anathema in recent years, &ldquo;full employment&rdquo;.  Everybody tells us now there is no such thing, never again will we have full employment that this is not on and that people will have to learn to live without jobs.  There was a fellow called Paddy Wally who featured on a radio programme on eight consecutive Saturdays a couple of years ago.  He informed us that people should not be looking for jobs, that people should learn how to use their leisure time and such nonsense.  No other country in Europe, <Col N="747" /> if not worldwide, engages in that line of despair.  Of course, there can be full employment if one organises one's society and uses one's resources properly.</P>
    <P>There are a whole lot of causes advanced for our present levels of unemployment, such as the necessity for tax reform, social welfare reform, technological developments and so on.  These are all advanced as causes of job losses. The most highly developed country in the world, technologically, is Japan where there is no problem.  They have full employment.  Therefore it will clearly be seen that these are not the real causes.</P>
    <P>Are the Government serious &mdash; and I wonder whether Fine Gael are serious since they adopt the same ideological line &mdash; in contending that it is not the responsibility of Government to create jobs?  We have heard this thrown out time and time again from those benches, that it is not the responsibility of Government to create jobs.  I say it is the major responsibility of Government and, indeed, of Members on all sides of the House.  We must remember that if people do not have the right to work they do not even have the right to live.  Therefore, it is a major responsibility of Government to ensure that everybody is put to work and to get rid of these ideological hangups to the effect that we must stay out of it, leave it to the market, leave it to anybody else but not to us.  That is a total cop-out of Government; they contend they are not to blame, when of course they are to blame.  Indeed, all of us in this House are to blame and are blamed. That is why people have such little regard for politics and politicians.  We are all seen to be responsible &mdash; Government, Opposition, the lot.  Yet nobody comes up with any solutions, identifying what is wrong and why we have been in this position consistently over so many years.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that the main cause is our failure to industrialise on the basis of our resources.  We have said that for years.  Telesis said it some ten years ago.  The recent Culliton report <Col N="748" /> said the same thing; it referred to indigenous industries and resources, the basis on which jobs can be created here.</P>
    <P>There is now the ridiculous circumstance in which a Finnish state company &mdash; of course, State companies are out the window here; there is a fierce ideological hang-up to the effect that they must be broken up, privatised or whatever &mdash; have now taken total control of our main lead and zinc wealth in Tara and Galmoy and have also taken a major stake in our other mineral development companies.  This means they have taken total control of our basic mineral wealth for the purpose of providing jobs in their country.  We export all our mineral wealth without creating any jobs or industrial development from it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy appears to be interested in breaking up the ESB.  One of the first tasks to be undertaken by any jobs forum must be to get rid of that idea. Such ideological hand-ups are held by people who are paranoid about some companies doing a fantastic job, doing what they have been asked to do, which is to go out and expand into new areas and then everybody proceeds to hit them on the head and forestal them.  The Minister for Energy says there are people in the private sector interested in purchasing ESB generating stations, expensive commodities, and are even prepared to build new electricity generating stations.  I say to the Minister for Energy and to the Government that if there are such people they should be asked to put their money into building a smelter here to smelt our lead and zinc.  This would form the basis of a huge industrial development with regard to parts for such commodities as washing machines, cars, or whatever, for export or otherwise.</P>
    <P>If one thinks in those terms one is thinking of a whole new industrial development, not merely of 100 jobs here and there, but thousands of jobs and the spin-offs that would increase rapidly.  But we do not think in those terms ever since we asked Rio Tinto Zinc to prepare a report for us and they said, &ldquo;No, you could not have a smelter here, there are <Col N="749" /> so many smelters in Europe with under-capacity in need of all your lead and zinc to keep them running at full capacity&rdquo;. In fact, we are exporting sufficient to keep two smelters going in Europe.  Of course, we accept their statement and reply, &ldquo;Your smelters must be maintained; take all our lead and zinc; we will not build a smelter here&rdquo;.  That type of nonsense makes everybody sick.</P>
    <P>When one is talking about jobs one must get down to basics and talk about where they can realistically be created. For example, some years ago the beef industry was targeted and people kicked up murder about live cattle being exported.  I must say that this was mainly on the part of animal lovers who objected to the horrific conditions to which the animals were being subjected.  It was decided to target the beef industry with a view to processing these cattle rather than exporting them live.  I will ignore all of the scandals involved; that is another story.  Fantastic progress was made in developing a processing sector within the beef industry.  We must process our resources, of which we have such a wide range.  For example, Coillte Teo, are doing an excellent job developing our timber industry but have failed to get the pulp mill they had been expecting.  This means we export thousands of tonnes of wood chippings and wood, again to Finland, where they are put through their pulp mills.  One can see the rolls of paper arriving here on the same ship that transports our wood and wood chippings to Finland because we do not have the requisite processing facilities.</P>
    <P>A number of people have drawn to my attention the fact that when travelling through the State one sees the country white with sheep.  Dairy and beef farmers who at one time would not have known one end of a sheep from the other now have them and receive the requisite subsidies, headage payments or whatever. All one ever hears in market reports deals with the price of lamb on the Paris market.  Of course, there is no mutton any longer; it is now all lamb.  Nobody appears to realise that these sheep grow wool.  I have never heard a market report <Col N="750" /> on the price of wool.  I might add that the price of wool one month ago was almost exactly the same as it was in the sixties, just four shillings per pound.  That is an absolute scandal.  All this wool is baled and exported unprocessed.  As far as I know it is uncleaned.  A handful of people, I would estimate some six or seven, control these exports and make a damn good thing out of it.  It is worth about £10 million to £15 million.  They are not interested in putting that money back into the processing of the wool or any such project.  It will clearly be seen that a wide range of our resources are being exported.</P>
    <P>We live in an era in which leather goods have become more popular than ever, with everybody possessing leather coats and jackets.  In fact we have more skins and hides than we know what to do with; they are all exported in their raw state as we have no tannery here.  Our so-called entrepreneurs are interested only in making money for themselves and they do this by taking money from other people.  They are not creating new wealth by property acquisitions.  By various deals on the Stock Exchange they are accumulating large sums of money, but they are not interested in developing or creating wealth.  The Government are not creating the right climate.  They ought to know that after six or eight years, because people who make money will not invest it.  They may buy a couple of horses, but nobody is building a smelter or anything decent such as a pulp mill for our timber or putting their money into an area where jobs can be created.  If a jobs forum is set up it must deal with specifics and say where the jobs will be created.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Mac Giolla for sharing his time with me. I welcome the fact that the Fine Gael Party have chosen this most important subject for Private Members' Business. In fact, my colleagues and I produced a policy document in February 1987 calling for the establishment of a jobs forum. We campaigned in the general election of that year on that particular issue. Unfortunately, it has taken five years for <Col N="751" /> that to be realised in the House, although I have many reservations about the outline of the forum as suggested.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the amendment in the name of my colleagues and I, which reads:</P>
      <P>In the second line, to delete the words &ldquo;and of the social partners&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, and social partners and the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed&rdquo;; and after line 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(a) to consider the economic and social problems faced by the unemployed and their dependants, to discuss the adequacy of income levels and support services for the unemployed, to examine the relationship between work and social welfare payments, and to make appropriate recommendations on these matters.</P>
      <P>That amendment raises a number of issues which I would like to have more time to deal with, including in particular the interaction of the social welfare system with the taxation system and a number of issues raised by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in their document.  Also there is now in existence an organisation that represents the unemployed.  For that reason, in view of the fact that the unemployed have most to gain from any success this debate may have, they ought to be formally involved in a structured way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burden on the economy arising from unemployment is horrendous.  The cost in terms of extra social welfare and tax foregone is more than £2,000 million per annum, or the equivalent of 10 per cent of GNP.  While the traditional line of economists has been that unemployment can only be dealt with when our fiscal affairs are in order, the evidence now is that the economy cannot be put back on a sound footing until we get more people off the dole queues and into productive employment.  The economic cost is only part of the picture.  Of even more significance is the human and social cost: <Col N="752" /> the broken families, the lives destroyed, the talents wasted by the scourge of unemployment.  Poverty, crime, vandalism and social alienation are all too common in communities demoralised by constant mass unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking indictment of our society that in all the recent scandals involving the privatisation of State companies, which led to huge fees for select firms and massive profits for a handful of businessmen, not one additional job was claimed to have been created.  If some of those at the top of Irish business channelled half the energy into job creation that they devote to feathering their own nests, we would be a far healthier society.</P>
    <P>If Ireland is to put in place an industrial base capable of creating a sufficiency of employment opportunities for both the present and future generations, a radical new departure is required in national industrial policy.  This will necessitate a massive diversion of the nation's resources &mdash; financial, human, organisational and institutional &mdash; away from their current uses and into a concentrated and single minded effort to create homebased industrial structures of establishing secure and stable foreign markets for Irish goods and of passing the benefits of these markets on to the Irish population at large in the form of jobs and a comfortable standard of living for all.  Such a bold and imaginative new departure will require able and courageous political leadership with a breadth and length of vision which has hitherto been notably absent from the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>In order to establish a national cross community concensus on the crisis situation which exists regarding unemployment in Ireland and on the need for a major innovation in the area of job creation, I am happy to support the convening of what I would prefer to see as a national forum on employment creation.  The immediate purpose of this forum would be to hear evidence from the broadest possible range of interest groups concerning approaches to tackling employment creation.  Its broader purpose would be to sharpen awareness <Col N="753" /> throughout Irish society of the seriousness of the situation and to mobilise popular support behind the measures for industrial expansion which will be required.</P>
    <P>In order to follow through on the deliberations of this national forum, I believe that one element of particular significance missing from the Fine Gael motion is an organisation to follow through on what ever proposals may come from that forum; thus there is the necessity for the establishment of a statutory national industrial development council.  This could be charged with formulating a broad strategy for industrial development and identifying the measures required for implementing this strategy.  The report of the national forum would form the initial agenda for the national industrial development council.  The council would draw their membership, according to a formula to be agreed, from the Oireachtas, the public service, business interests, trade unions, the unemployed, environmental, consumer, social interests and so forth-in other words, all those with a legitimate interest in economic development and employment creation.</P>
    <P>It is vital to the success of this strategy that, once agreement has been reached, all parties would take responsibility for securing full co-operation with and commitment to the objectives of the strategy within their respective constituencies.  In their work the national industrial development council would be supported by their own professional secretariat, adequately funded, in order to ensure recruitment of personnel of the highest calibre.  In addition, the national industrial development council would be advised by two key committees: first, a consultative committee made up of technicial experts from third level colleges, research institutes and the research departments of the social partner organisations; and, second, a local authorities committee whose function would be to advise the national industrial development council on the regional dimensions of its industrial development strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>From the analysis presented earlier in this document that I am outlining as an input to this forum, it is clear that if it is to hold out any prospect of seriously tackling the Irish unemployment crisis the national industrial development, council's strategy must, first, identify industrial sectors and sub-sectors with long term growth prospects and in which Ireland is capable of developing a comparative advantage in international markets.  Second, it must identify or establish a core group of firms with a potential to exploit fully these potential advantages.  Third, it must identify or establish firms or institutions capable of supplying essential inputs of products and services from within Ireland to the core group of exporting firms. Fourth, it must rationalise and co-ordinate the State's business support agencies with a high priority focus on the target sectors and companies.  Fifth, it must create a supervisory co-ordinating planning body to establish specific objectives and targets and to oversee the pursuit of these objectives and targets.  Sixth, it must restructure the semi-State sector, the public service and the political institutions of the State in order to create a new dynamism in support of the massive national effort required by the proposed industrial policy.</P>
      <P>I suggest, in making that input, that action is required under three headings: industrial policy, which I have dealt with in passing, the democratisation of various institutions and the question of a living income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that our industrial policy is out-of-date and it is generally agreed on all sides of the House that we are getting poor value for money.  An industrial policy therefore is required which <Col N="755" /> will direct the development of large successful indigenous industry, allow small enterprise to flourish and provide guidelines as standards for businesses of all kinds.  State intervention and assistance must be more selective than in the past, much more highly targeted and less wasteful.  There must be an interventionist European Community industrial policy with convergence of the regions as a major target.  Jobs must be brought to the people, not the other way around.  European Community intervention is also needed to encourage European multi-nationals to co-operate with each other and to invest in other European Community countries, especially those on the periphery.</P>
    <P>A good industrial policy is useless without the active involvement and commitment of people.  Successful enterprises are ones in which a team of workers, operating more or less as equals, pull together to provide a really good product.  Democratisation in the workplace requires greater flexibility in working hours, patterns of work and even types of work.</P>
    <P>On the question of a living income, it seems there is a need for radical reform of the tax and social welfare systems with a view to their eventual integration.  Such a move would remove the various poverty traps which result from the irrational interaction of several systems working at cross purposes, not just tax and social welfare but also the way in which PRSI is charged and entitlement to medical cards assessed.</P>
    <P>Finally, the tax system should reflect new social and economic priorities, such as the encouragement of efficient job generating and environmentally acceptable industry and the discouragement of parasitic non-productive or environmentally damaging enterprises.</P>
    <P>While we are having this debate on the macro-economic solutions to the crisis of unemployment I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a receiver was sent in today to a modern electronics company in Clondalkin in my constituency called Atlantic Magnetics <Col N="756" /> where 150 people have been put out of work despite the fact that the order books of that particular company are full and they are incapable of meeting demand.  I will be dealing with that matter later on the Adjournment debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Deputy Mac Giolla for sharing his time with me.  I am happy to support this motion in the name of Deputy John Bruton which calls on the Government to establish a national forum on jobs. There is a necessity to establish such a forum which would present politicians and the political system with a real challenge.  Indeed, it is probably the nearest we will get to having a national Government.  Each Irish person, be they at home or abroad, consistently questions the inability of politicians to create jobs or the environment in which sustainable jobs can be created.</P>
      <P>This forum could turn out to be a farce and completely useless if it is not made quite clear to those who participate in it that they should not merely come up with ideas but rather implement ideas which are there in abundance.  Umpteen reports have been produced at great cost during the past 15 years.  These are stacked in offices throughout the land.  If there was a quick fix or easy solution it would have been found and implemented long ago.  It is only fair I should say that this forum should have the capacity to be a national political success or else it could turn out to be a farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to think that the members of the forum would set about, as a matter of urgency, creating an environment where initiative and hard work will be rewarded and where people can vent their ideas without having to travel abroad.  I also hope that the forum once established would not be hijacked by their members when it comes to announcing that jobs are to be provided or ideas that might lead to the creation of jobs.  I recall an occasion prior to this Government being formed when the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, appeared on a platform with the then Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce <Col N="757" /> and both announced that an industry was to be established in Longford.  That is not what the forum should be about.  They should address the inability of Government down the years to create the right environment.</P>
    <P>We should be honest and own up to the fact that there is a huge black economy operating here.  No one can blame able bodied people with skills for not sitting at home and using those skills.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to comment on this matter when a question was put to him in the Dáil prior to Christmas.</P>
    <P>In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance mentioned one of the training schemes that the Minister for Labour, whom I welcome to the House and congratulate on his appointment, would be implementing.  Yet, after officials of FÁS had been brought to central locations for training in relation to that scheme fax messages were received in the Department of Labour from the Department of Finance to the effect that the scheme had not yet been cleared, that there were internal union difficulties and that they should not proceed.  There is an old saying that one should not cackle until the egg is laid.  I would like, therefore, to have this matter cleared up.  If the Minister makes an announcement in the House he should be able to back it up.</P>
    <P>I would now like to quote from the Official Report of 24 June 1986, Volume 368, column 1146 which states:</P>
    <P>Young men who went to school with me can see no future in this country. They are not afraid to work, and enterprise is very much alive in young people.  There is no need to take my word for it: Brian Patterson, Director General of the IMI, said that those who say that the spirit of enterprise is dead are wrong.  Our young people are full of it, the black economy is driven by it and the enterprise allowance scheme has been swamped by it. </P>
    <P>They are not my words, rather they were uttered by Deputy Cowen who is now Minister for Labour.  Six years on, he is faced with the responsibility, in part, of <Col N="758" /> having to grapple with the consequences. The statement he made at that time was quite accurate.</P>
    <P>Finally, the bishops' conference in the west pointed to the clear need to establish a forum which would be active and deal, as a matter of urgency, with this problem. People are clutching at straws, communities are dying before our eyes and a sizeable proportion of the population are desperately hoping that not only will the Government provide some consolation but will create the right environment in which their sons and daughters, who have ideas, are willing to take the initiative and work hard, can be rewarded at home. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to a decent chance to earn a living for oneself and one's family is one of the most fundamental in our society.  On that there is general agreement.  On the positive side, it must be said that the performance of the economy in recent years has, indeed, been remarkable.  Inflation has been substantially reduced, the trade balance has been dramatically turned around while we have maintained a fixed exchange rate link with the mighty Deutsche Mark for more than five years now.  My point, therefore, is that these achievements have been translated into real economic activity as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period from 1988 to 1990 was one of exceptionally rapid growth for our economy, when private sector employment increased more rapidly than during any other period since the Second World War.  Indeed, it was a commendable achievement for the economy to continue to record positive growth during 1991 and to hold employment at these higher levels in the face of the worst international economic recession since the thirties. However, given the sheer scale of the unemployment problem, clearly much more needs to be done.  Low inflation and sound financial balances are not an <Col N="759" /> end in themselves; they are only intermediate objectives of economic policy and are not substitutes for the jobs which are necessary for those who do not have them at present.  Unless they are accompanied by strong and lasting economic growth, which will facilitate the creation of meaningful and sustainable jobs for all our citizens who wish to work, they add little to the welfare of overall society.</P>
    <P>In searching for a solution to the employment problem a number of key issues need to be kept in the forefront. First, we should not underestimate the size of the problem confronting us.  Secondly, we should recognise that there are no quick fix solutions and dispel the notion that Governments can create sizeable and lasting employment.  Thirdly, recent rises in unemployment should not obscure the considerable achievement of employment creation in recent years; the policies of the last five years are the way forward but the foundations laid now urgently need to be built and expanded upon.  The size of the problems is very large.  In the absence of emigration &mdash; that is an assumption, of course &mdash; some 15,000 new entrants will flow into the labour force each year.  We have to find employment not just for these new entrants but for those already unemployed.  I have first hand knowledge of an accute unemployment problem in my own constituency, Dún Laoghaire, and the challenge facing us is enormous.</P>
    <P>We have not in the past achieved the pace of job creation which seemed to be necessary in the short term for a sustained period, but we cannot be put off by the size of the task.  Between 1988 and 1990, when international conditions were more favourable than they are now, net new jobs were emerging at the rate required in the immediate period ahead.  If we did it once we can do it again, but let us not fall into the trap of the quick fix.  The way forward is to build on the success of the economic policy which has been implemented since 1987.  Much of the economic success in that period can be attributed to the partnership approach <Col N="760" /> based on consensus between the Government and the social partners.</P>
    <P>Because of the provisions of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Irish companies have been able to notch up substantial gains in competitiveness.  In that context the consensus idea behind the Fine Gael motion is indeed praiseworthy.  Having said that however, the structure which will emerge to address this most urgent problem of unemployment must not lead to another talking shop, that must be avoided at all costs.  What is needed is a search for all possible further improvements which will aid the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report, a very important document in its own right, identified current training and education policy as being inadequate for the needs of a modern and growing economy.  Another area offering scope for improvement is the process of intergrating the tax and social welfare codes and reducing the disincentives to job creation which remain in the system.  In the past the gap between the cost to the employer of recruiting a worker was well in excess of the take-home pay of the employee.  Progress has certainly been made in achieving a better balance between employment and capital incentives in industrial promotion, but more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>We must proceed on a number of fronts at the same time.  Any illusion that one single initiative will be sufficient to tackle a problem so large and intricate will be doomed to failure.  A more comprehensive political dimension, as advocated &mdash; or certainly implied &mdash; in the Fine Gael motion to the search for strategies for job creation may well prove another important further step.</P>
    <P>In relation to a forum or whatever it is called, the structure which will give expression to the need to formulate those strategies will be of fundamental importance and in that context I look forward to the Government's proposals in that regard.</P>

I wish to thank all the Members who contributed to the debate last night and tonight.  There is a general recognition that this is one of the most important problems which must be faced by Members of this House.  There is a large level of acceptance of the proposal which we put forward.  We thought that there would be an all party attempt to see what could be done to prevent the present level of unemployment &mdash; at a record high of 276,000 &mdash; from escalating.  We had hoped to devise and develop strategies to bring that unacceptable level down, because it is not good enough any more for Members of this House to bemoan the rise in unemployment figures.  The unemployed have heard enough pious platitudes, they now want action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to tackle the problem is to involve political parties, trade unions, employers and the agencies involved in training and industrial development in an effort to put in place the long term economic planning which will create sustainable jobs for our people in the future. Our approach, as Deputy Hillery said, must be multi-faceted; we must tackle training policies, education, industrial and Government policy.  This requires all Members, as Deputy John Bruton said last night, to set aside the traditional adversarial model of political exchange which has existed for over 70 years and adopt in its place the kind of consensus approach which demonstrably worked in other countries &mdash; for example, the Netherlands and Sweden.  It also worked on another occasion in this country in <Col N="762" /> relation to the other important problem facing us, Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many commentators agree that structural factors contribute to the high rate of unemployment existing here, a rate twice that of most of our European colleagues.  These structural factors include our taxation system.  Real and significant reform in this area will require a broad consensus.  The kind of piecemeal tinkering of the last few years will not achieve results.  Radical reforms are required and they will need support from all parties in the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report provides a good starting point for the identification of new strategies and policies for industry, although it is not the gospel.  It has one glaring deficiency: there is no mention in it of what could be developed for rural areas and the tourism industry is not dealt with either.  Having said that, there are many very good ideas in the report which should be looked at.  The organisations dealing with industrial training development must critically assess their role and function.  It is crucial to match the training provided with the potential job market.  This means long term strategies and plans.  It means a real examination of how money from the European Social Fund is being spent and the same applies to money from all the other funds in Europe.  It also means reassessing the role of the IDA for the nineties.</P>
    <P>Part of the role of the new forum will be to assess and examine all the State agencies which have been examined over the years to see if they are still functioning in accordance with their terms of reference.  Sometimes we have a tendency to think that because a body exist, even if they were set up 20 years ago, they are doing a good job, without ever examining their role.  Deputy Mac Giolla fell into that trap earlier tonight when he accused Minister Molloy of having an ideological interest in dismantling the ESB.  The ESB have been in existence for 70 years and it is time they were re-examined.  Equally, a charge might be levelled at Deputy Mac Giolla that he is caught in an ideological timewarp; he said that because the company are in existence they should <Col N="763" /> remain there.  I do not think there is any harm in examining all State agencies, including the ESB.</P>

      <P>An assessment of management, training, etc. in all these agencies should be undertaken.  If possible, outsiders should be brought in to examine each agency and Government Department to see whether changes would be of any benefit to the community.</P>
      <P>The recent survey of the experience of school leavers in 1990 demonstrates the enormity of the challenge facing us. During the past 12 months alone, youth unemployment increased by a massive 23,000 a rise of 40 per cent.  If we do not understand and appreciate the implications of that, then we are not fit to be Members of this House.  Thirty-two per cent, or one in three students who left school in June 1990 were unemployed 12 months later.  Emigration has eased off, but we are not providing any work for those who are staying at home; these people have to join the dole queues.  One of the saddest things I heard over the past two years was Government Ministers defending the rise in unemployment by saying that emigration was no longer available as a safety value.  This clearly demonstrates the failure of the Government to tackle the unemployment crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still rely on factors such as emigration to alleviate the unemployment crisis.  The recent census shows that 23 per cent or one in four school leavers have emigrated by the time they reach their early twenties.  We cannot and must not condemn another generation to long term unemployment or emigration.  The last number of years have shown a rise in cynicism and an increasing lack of confidence in our political process.  I do not think any of us who hold clinics at the weekends or who come into contact with youth organisations or organisations who <Col N="764" /> speak for the unemployed can be in any doubt about the low level of regard young people have for Members of this House, the institutions of State which are supposed to gear the economy of this country for their future, and politics in general. This is not a good thing.  Other European countries are experiencing the same decline in support for political parties with, unfortunately, a rise in support for extremist groups.</P>
    <P>As political leaders we must demonstrate that we can make this process work.  We must show young people that the Members of this House are capable of providing them with a future in this country.  We must all co-operate in doing this.  The industrial climate is changing and we are facing a new era which some commentators call the third industrial revolution.  The policies and practices which we have taken for granted for too long must be changed if we are to provide the necessary 25,000 new jobs every year.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which has contributed to the success of the Japanese and the Germans is their innovative approach to industrial policy and their ability to accept change quickly.  One of the characteristics shared by both these countries is the involvement and co-operation of the workforce in the decision making process.  Indeed, in some instances decision making has been developed by the workers to ensure that they are informed and consulted in every aspect of planning for the future of their industries.</P>
    <P>The completion of the internal market by the end of this year will present us with huge opportunities as well as huge challenges.  Not alone will the European market of 320 million people be open to us, but our market will be open to other countries.  We need to harness the resources of our entire community to provide employment for our people and enable them to participate fully in the development and progress of our society.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that for the past twelve months Fine Gael have been proposing the establishment of an all-party jobs forum to tackle the major problem of unemployment.  Indeed, it was Fine <Col N="765" /> Gael who proposed the New Ireland Forum, which tackled on an all-party basis the other and perhaps more intractable problem facing this country.  This forum, from which the Anglo-Irish Agreement flowed, has now been accepted by virtually everybody, perhaps belatedly by Fianna Fáil.  If our proposal to establish a jobs forum had been accepted 12 months ago, as it is being accepted now, perhaps some solutions could have been put in place by now to help the unemployed.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, after Minister Ahern's contribution last night Fine Gael hoped that no vote would be necessary on this motion.  However, when Deputy Quinn asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business this morning whether there would be consultations with the other political parties before the formation of the forum the Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance made clear yesterday evening, we are listening to the debate with interest and we will take into account the points being made.  We will then proceed to decide on what we believe are the appropriate structures to involve all the various sectors in the discussions. </P>
    <P>When pressed further by Deputy Quinn, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>We already have the proposals and the views of the Opposition parties. We had them even before the debate and we listened to see if there were any new ideas forthcoming. </P>
    <P>I am afraid it is quite clear that there is <Col N="766" /> not going to be any consultation with the Opposition parties before the forum are set up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was evident in this House over the past two days about the recognition by all parties that this was a major problem which needed to be tackled on an all-party basis.  I regret that this all-party approach to our unemployment problem could not be fully supported by the Government and that they have decided not to consult with the other political parties before the structures of the forum are set up.  This is a retrograde step by the Government.  I believe that the spirit which existed in the House last night has been destroyed.  I hope that as a result of the vote tonight the Government will realise that all Members of the House &mdash; I am not singling out any party &mdash; are considerably concerned about the long term damage which will be caused to the political fabric of our society if we do not find a solution to the job crisis.  I believe the jobs forum suggested by Fine Gael can make a contribution to solving this problem.  However, this issue must be approached on an all-party basis and there must be all-party involvement in the setting up of the necessary structures.</P>

      <P>Baineadh geit agus stangadh as an phobal i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall Dé hAoine seo caite nuair a d'fhógair Telectron na Farraige Móire go bhfuil siad ag scaoileadh 73 chun bealaigh láithreach.  Tá an tionscal seo ag cur oibre agus fostaíochta ar fáil ar eastát tionscail Ghaoth Dobhair le beagnach 20 bliain agus tá an dearcadh coitianta ann go raibh sé ar cheann de na tionscail ba dhaingne agus ba bhríomhaire sa cheantar. I mbarr a réime bhí breis agus 200 ag obair sa mhonarcha.  Faoi láthair tá 135 ansin ach tar éis ráiteas na hAoine seo caite beidh an líon sin laghdaithe go dtí 62, is é sin titim níos mó ná 50 faoin gcéad den fhoireann oibre.</P>
      <P>Is buille tubaisteach é seo, ní amháin do na hoibrithe atá ag cailliúint a bpost ach do shaol eacnamaíochta ghnó an cheantair chomh maith.  Tá ardcháilíochtaí agus scileanna oibre agus bainistíochta ag na fostaithe sa mhonarcha seo agus is mór an chaill don cheantar iad anois a bheith fágtha díomhaoin, gan obair gan saothar.  Tá dualgais agus freagrachtaí ar go leor acu, cuid acu i ndiaidh tithe úra a thógáil nó a cheannach agus íocaíochtaí le déanamh ar iasachtaí agus mhorgaistí ó bhainc agus ó chumainn fhoirgníochta. Tá teaghlaigh á dtógáil ag go leor acu chomh maith agus is olc an cás gur dócha gur ag brath ar liúntais leasa shóisialaigh a bheidh siad feasta lena gclanna a thógáil ó seo amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní bréag a rá gur tragóid do mhórán acu ar tharla ag an deireadh seachtaine agus is eagal liom gur beag dóchas atá acu, sa ghearrthéarma ar a laghad, fostaíocht nó obair eile sa cheantar Ghaeltachta sin a fháil.  Tá easpa dóchais agus misnigh le mothú ar fud an cheantair.  Tá amhras agus imní ar dhaoine faoi cad atá i ndán dóibh.  Nuair a dhúnann tionscal láidir idirnáisiúnta den chineál seo, cad atá i ndán do thionscail eile nach bhfuil an tacaíocht ná an t-urra céanna taobh <Col N="770" /> thiar díobh.  Anuraidh bhí an tionscal seo i mbarr a réime &mdash; trealamh teileachumarsáide á tháirgeadh agus á onnmhairiú ar fud an domhain, chuig na Stáit Aontaithe, an Eoraip agus ilchríoch na nAfraice.  Bhí traenáil á cur ar fáil sa mhonarcha do dhaoine ó chríocha eile.</P>
    <P>Tá cuimhne mhaith ag muintir an cheantair ar na scórtha a tháinig ó Kenya agus a chaith bliain sa mhonarcha anuraidh ag foghlaim mhodhanna táiríochta agus oibre.  Chruthaigh sé seo muintearas idirnáisiúnta idir bunadh na Gaeltachta agus bunadh Kenya.  Ach is eagal liom go bhfuil deireadh leis an nós sin anois agus má bhíonn daoine ag fágáil na tíre tá contúirt mhór ann gur oibrithe Ghaeltachta a bheidh ag cuartú fostaíochta thar lear.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuimhnimid ar na monarchana eile atá dúnta agus na poist eile atá caillte le bliain anuas, ó Chill Cártha go dtí an Fál Carrach, is cinnte go bhfuilimid ag dul in araicis ghéarchéim dhífhostaíochta i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall &mdash; Éadach Chonamara i gCill Cártha, monarcha Mhic Dhaibhid sna Gleanntaí, a rabhamar ag caint air sa Dáil seachtain ó shin; Nuvotem i gCroithlí ar sheachtain ghearrtha trí laethanta; Mótar Ruibéar sa Chlochán Liath atá i mbaol le mí anuas &mdash; ach tá áthas orainn a chloisteáil tráthnóna ón Aire Stáit go bhfuil siad ceart go leor aris; Smailcbhia, Eastát Ghaoth Dobhair, a bhfuil a dtríoblóidí féin acu, agus an Fál Carrach atá fágtha, d'fhéadfá a rá, gan post tionsclaíochta.  Is cinnte gur ábhar imní agus éadóchais ar tharla le bliain.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh Udarás na Gaeltachta agus an Roinn féin páirt níos gníomhaí a ghlacadh i bhforbairt na tionsclaíochta i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  An chéad chuspóir is gá a thabhairt chun críche ná an 62 atá fágtha i dTelectron a chosaint agus a chaomhnú.  Tá sé ríthábhachtach go mairfidh siad seo agus ba chóir don Údarás gach cabhair agus cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh leis seo a chinntiú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na hoibrithe atá ag imeacht, caithfidh siad téarmaí agus coinníollacha flaithiúla iomarcaíochta a fháil.  Thug siad seo uilig seirbhís fhada dhílis don tionscal agus caithfear roinnt leo go fial.  Bhí mé <Col N="771" /> ag labhairt cheana féin leis an bhainistíocht faoi seo agus tá súil agam go seasfaidh siad lena ndualgais i leith a n-oibrithe.  Chomh maith leis sin caithfear tréaniarracht a dhéanamh fostaíocht eile sa Ghaeltacht a chur ar fáil dóibh siúd atá ag cailliúint a gcuid oibre.  Tá siad uilig traenáilte go hard i mbainistíocht agus i dtáirgíocht agus is cinnte gur bhoichte an áit an Ghaeltacht gan iad. An rud is measa a d'fhéadfadh tarlú ná iad an Ghaeltacht a fhágáil agus a gcuid scileanna agus traenála a chur ar fáil i dtíortha eile.</P>
    <P>Caithfear, i mo thuairim, níos mó béime a chur ar fhorbairt infrastruchtúir, go speisialta na bóthre atá chomh tábhachtach sin do thionscail atá lonnaithe sna Gaeltachtaí i gceantair imeallacha na tíre, i bhfad ó chalafoirt agus ó mhargaí na hEorpa.  Sílim go bhfuil dúnadh na monarchan seo, nó ar a laghad cailliúint 65 phost ina bhuille mór d'fhostaíocht i nGaeltacht Ghaoth Dobhair, na Rosann agus Chloch Cheann Fhaoilidh, agus tá sé ag cothú éadóchais, imní agus lagmhisnigh sa cheantar.</P>

      <P>Is cúis mhór díomá domsa chomh maith na fadhbanna atá ag comhlachtaí áirithe i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall i láthair na huaire.  Maidir le Telectron na Farraige Móire anseo, is buille tubaisteach é go mbeidh a gcuid post á gcailliúint ag 73 den fhoireann ag deireadh na míosa seo chugainn nó tús mhí Aibreáin, rud a chiallaíonn nach mbeidh ach 62 duine fágtha sa tionscal.  Deirtear liom nach bhfuil obair ann don 135 atá fostaithe faoi láthair agus, dá bhrí sin, go bhfuil an fhoireann á laghdú acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bím féin i gcomhairle go leanúnach le hardbhainistíocht Údarás na Gaeltachta féachaint an bhfuil aon bhealach ann chun na jabanna a shabháil agus chun réiteach a fháil ar an scéal tubaisteach seo.  Tá sé socraithe agam féin agus ag príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis dul go Sasana Dé hAoine seo chugainn chun labhairt le hardbhainisteoir mháthair-chomhlacht Telectron na Farraige Moire chun brú a chur orthu obair a dhíriú chuig an mhonarcha i nGaoth Dobhair, le poist a chaomhnú an oiread agus is féidir.  Tig <Col N="772" /> le foireann oibre Telectron bheith cinnte de go ndéanfaidh mise gach rud is féidir liom a dhéanamh ar a son.  Tá a fhios agam cé chomh mór is atá an comhlacht seo ATNT, agus go bhfuil monarchana acu ar fud an domhain agus tá súil agam go mbeadh siad sásta obair a dhíriú chuig Gaoth Dobhair ionas go mbeimid ábalta na jabanna atá fágtha ansin a chaomhnú nó fiú jabanna eile a chruthú ansin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an chomhlacht eile seo Nuvotem i gCroithlí, tá laghdú sna horduithe ó chomhlachtaí sna tionscail chlosamhairc.  Tá socraithe ag an chomhlacht gníomhú ar bhonn seachtaine trí lá ar feadh tamaill.  Tá an chosúlacht ar an scéal go leanfaidh cúrsaí mar sin go dtí, b'fhéidir, deireadh na míosa seo chugainn.  Ní miste a rá nach drochscéalta amháin atá le cloisteáil.  Cuireadh in iúl dom tráthnóna inniu go bhfuil cinneadh déanta anois ag bainistíocht Ruibéar Mótair an t-ionad atá acu ar an gClochán Liath a choinneáil ar siúl ach pointe áirithe a bheith soiléirithe leis an cheardchumann.  Tuigim go mbeidh an cruinniú sin ann ag tús na seachtaine seo chugainn agus tá mé an-dóchasach faoi thodhchaí an ionaid sin.</P>
    <P>Is drochscéal é nuair a chailleann daoine a bpost i gcomhlacht ar bith ach caithfear brú ar aghaidh le fuinneamh chun tionscail eile a aimsiú ina áit.  Bí cinnte de go leanfaidh an tUdarás go dícheallach lena gcuid iarrachtaí chun tionscail fhiúntacha a fháil do Ghaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  In ainneoin na ndeacrachtaí atá ann i láthair na huaire i dtionscail áirithe, ní mór a rá gur éirigh leis an Udarás thar na blianta an fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoina scáth i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall a mhéadú.  Mar shampla, i dtuarascáil na bliana 1980, nuair a bunaíodh an tÚdarás, bhí 1,694 dhuine ag obair go lánaimseartha i dtionscail faoina scáth sa Ghaeltacht sin ach ag deireadh na bliana seo caite bhíothas tar éis an líon sin daoine a mhéadú go dtí 2,249, méadú thart ar 33 faoin gcéad.  Tuigim go maith an cás atá déanta ag an Teachta McGinley agus tuigim go maith cás na n-oibrithe sna monarchana seo, agus, ar ndóigh, cás na ndaoine go léir atá dífhostaithe sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá mé ag tabhairt gealltanais go leanfar ar aghaidh i gcomhar leis an <Col N="773" /> Údarás chun jabanna a chruthú do na daoine sin.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana, beidh mé féin agus príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis ag bualadh le hardbhainistíocht mháthairchomhlacht Telectron na Farraige Móire Dé hAoine seo chugainn agus ndéanfaimid ár ndícheall na jabanna atá fágtha a chaomhnú.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has given notice of his intention to raise the matter as to the implications for employment in the Clondalkin area of Atlantic Magnetics being put into receivership with a consequent risk to 150 jobs and if the Minister has any plans to assist in the sale of the firm as a going concern or find a replacement industry. Deputy Rabbitte knows the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for permitting me to raise this most important issue, since this factory in my constituency in Clondalkin was unnecessarily put into receivership causing devastation in the lives of 150 people who were employed at that plant.  The decision to force Atlantic Magnetics off Clover Hill Estate in Clondalkin into receivership and throw 150 workers onto the dole queue is an indictment of our commercial practices and company law and a personal tragedy for the members of the workforce concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Atlantic Magnetics is a modern company producing a quality product.  They are unable to meet the full extent of market demand, and they have a trained and committed workforce.  Arising from a series of events triggered by the main bank involved, 150 workers have now been shabbily disemployed.  A company in the electronics sector with full order books indicating a demand of three and a half times what the company can presently meet are now forced, because of a shortage of working capital, to stop production.  While this House tonight engages in a macro-economic debate on the jobs crisis, the local economy in Clondalkin is being deprived of a successful wealth generating plant that in reality has potential for expansion.  When the <Col N="774" /> Receiver entered the plant on Monday, work was in progress on an order for an Irish software company.  Work was stopped immediately on the instructions of the Receiver and that Irish software company are now obliged to source that order abroad.  In fact, so shabbily have the workers been treated that they have not been paid for working last Monday.</P>
    <P>I have formed the personal opinion that the Goodman collapse provoked the decision of the main bank concerned to effectively foreclose on this company which had expended considerable outlay on new equipment &mdash; £1.5 million was spent on new equipment in 1990.  The experience of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, and specifically the experience of the Examiner process was a disaster.  The bank managed to obstruct the release of funds desperately needed for working capital and thus frustrated the Examiner.  The drawn out resort to the courts wasted precious and valuable time and money and although the Supreme Court decision was ultimately positive, it was too little too late.</P>
    <P>Effectively the capacity of the Examiner to secure the necessary major investor was frustrated by the deficiency in the Companies Act.  There was no working capital to meet increased demand.  The result is that a potentially successful modern company is on a life support machine.  Workers with an excellent industrial relations record &mdash; I should say there is no trade union involved &mdash; find themselves without wages and with a likely delay of up to eight weeks before the Department of Labour will resolve their entitlements.  The Government must actively intervene to ensure the retention of employment in this plant at Clondalkin and to close the loopholes in the Companies (Amendment) Act that this tragic case has exposed.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and I welcome him to the House.  I mean no disrespect to him when I say that I had hoped his senior Minister would respond to this debate.  It is all very well for us to discuss unemployment in the abstract.  However this modern successful company had orders on the books that would keep them going <Col N="775" /> for five months but because of an action triggered off by a financial institution, 150 workers in my constituency are unemployed tonight.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to appreciate the extent of the personal devastation of these workers and to take whatever steps are necessary.  I do not care whether that means assisting in finding an investor through the receiver mechanism or taking equity participation in the company that will cause it to flourish.  I do not believe the Government can stand idly by and allow this plant to close down. The only person I did not speak to today was the Receiver but I would like to ask him why the management told the workers that he would keep the company going on an ongoing basis.  He has not done that; he shut production down immediately.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about an clapped out uncompetitive factory.  This is a modern factory with new equipment.  The teething problems with machinery have been sorted out.  The trained workforce have an excellent productivity rate.  We have a good product and market demand.  It is imperative that the Minister ensures that the receivership is not allowed to leave that plant closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I have been keeping ourselves informed of the situation affecting Atlantic Magnetics Limited and we share the Deputy's concern at the company's return to receivership and the consequent threat to the jobs at the plant.</P>
      <P>Atlantic Magnetics was established in 1989 following a management buy-out of the Memorex-Telex floppy disc facility in Clondalkin.  The company manufacture and market floppy discs for the Irish and European markets.  The management buy-out was supported by MADCORP and the IDA provided assistance for the company's development plans.  The company performed well until recently when losses were incurred due in particular to severe price competition on their export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> The Deputy will appreciate that the electronics industry is global in nature, highly competitive, cyclical and characterised by short product life cycles.  Overall the European floppy disc market has been subject to increasingly severe price competition from Far East countries which has tended to erode profit margins. At present the EC Commission are investigating a complaint from European floppy disc manufacturers concerning alleged dumping of floppy discs from Far East countries.  Such investigations are, however, normally detailed and time consuming and as such offer no immediate remedy to Atlantic Magnetic's problems.</P>
    <P>Due to the difficulties facing the company Atlantic Magnetics were placed in receivership on 18 October 1991.  The company subsequently sought to have an Examiner appointed and succeeded.</P>
    <P>The Examiner recommended trading and began work on a scheme of arrangement aimed at restructuring the company.  It was quickly apparent that in order to survive the company needed an injection of fresh equity.  A number of companies in the magnetic media market expressed interest in Atlantic but no firm commitments were forthcoming before the time limit on the period of examinership which expired on Monday last, 24 February.  Consequently the Examiner reported to the court that he had been unable to restructure the company and thus the company returned to receivership.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I wish to assure the Deputy that we are fully conscious of the adverse impact both economically and socially of the possible loss of jobs at Atlantic Magnetics Limited.  We understand that the company are continuing to trade while orders on hand are being serviced.  In the meantime I can assure the Deputy that the IDA are keeping in very close touch with developments and working closely with the Receiver.  Every effort is being made to secure a take-over of the plant as a going concern and to save the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>In this regard I am aware that a number of parties has expressed an interest in taking over the company and these interests are being explored by the IDA <Col N="777" /> in conjunction with the Receiver.  It is impossible to say, at this stage, what the precise implications are for employment but I have asked the IDA to keep me informed of developments.</P>
    <P>The House will realise, of course, that while the support agencies play an important role in helping industry develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which the company positions itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment.  It affects a great many people particularly young people not only in Cork city but throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Recent reports from the Garda on the availability and distribution of drugs in the Cork area must be a matter of serious concern to all citizens, particularly parents of young children because it now appears that they have been targeted by drug pushers in the city and county.  It is well known that the Garda Síochána are keeping schools under surveillance with the objective of apprehending those ruthless people who are encouraging young children to take drugs in order to get them involved in their despicable trade.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly endorse the stand taken by the Cork State Solicitor and the remarks by Judge Clifford that drug dealers would receive maximum fines and sentences on conviction.  Recently people have called for the setting up of drug treatment centres and I agree with their demand.  There is a growing need for the treatment of drug addiction.  The Southern Health Board are doing their best in view of the limited resources.  The Garda drug squad are doing their utmost to contain the problem with the limited resources available to them but we must go much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health boards, the courts and the Garda Síochána are all involved after the drugs arrive here and I suggest this is why the Minister must act.  We must cut off the supply of drugs at source.  The supply <Col N="778" /> lines of the drug barons from the Continent, Britain and this country must be severed once and for all.  That is why I propose the setting up of a drugs enforcement agency modelled on the one operating in the United States very successfully.  It is necessary for the expertise of the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the Army and Naval Service to be co-ordinated to form a force to counter drug trafficking to this country.  The provision of fast launches manned by naval personnel with the right to stop, search and arrest commercial and leisure craft entering our coastal waters is essential if we are to get to grips with this evil trade.  My information is that the south and south-west coasts have been used for the importation of contraband. The unguarded nature of our coastline makes it relatively easy for those unscrupulous criminals to land drugs with very little risk of capture.  Legislation would be needed to set up this force, but I believe every Deputy would endorse any action by the Minister to curb those evil people who trade on the misery of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. P. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom leithscéal an Aire Dlí agus Cirt a ghabháil os rud é nach bhfuil sé ar a chumas bheith anseo anocht.  Tá sé as an tír, mar atá a fhios ag Teachtaí.  The Minister is aware from ongoing contact with the Garda authorities that Cork is one of the areas in which drug-related offences occur and as recently as 19 February he made a detailed statement on the drugs situation in the Cork area in response to a question tabled by Deputy Allen.</P>
      <P>Drug offending generally is a matter which is taken very seriously indeed and I would therefore like to reiterate what the Minister said about the problem both generally and more specifically in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prevention and detection of drug-related offences in Cork, as elsewhere, is continuing to receive priority attention from a law enforcement point of view. The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that they monitor the situation <Col N="779" /> very carefully and that they constantly review and adapt their strategies to deal with the drugs situation.  These strategies include close liasion with customs authorities and continuous international co-operation with police forces abroad so as to curb the supply of illicit drugs to this country.  The Garda authorities report that this type of co-operation is particularly important in the Cork area, where the long coastline produces a need for special policing strategies and where a number of successful joint Customs and Garda operations have been mounted.</P>
    <P>The Garda in Cork have received and will continue to receive a very high level of training in drug law enforcement and they place a strong emphasis on countering illegal drug activity.  They are assisted in this by the Cork, Limerick and Dublin drug units and other specialist units as required.  Specific measures employed to deal with the problem in Cork include the use of Garda patrols and specialist units, intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, as well as targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects.  The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that these measures are very often directed at activities and locations where young people may be exposed to illegal drug dealing. These measures have resulted in some important detections for drug-related offences.</P>
    <P>In the short time available I do not intend to go into detail on the very many important initiatives which are being taken to counteract drug abuse and trafficking.  Indeed, it would not be in the interests of effective law enforcement to disclose some of the measures in place to deal with the situation.  It may be helpful, however, if I mention two significant developments which are of relevance not just to Cork but to the country generally in tackling drug offending.</P>
    <P>The first is the decision by the European Council that a Europol Drugs Unit should be established as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.  This unit will be of great practical benefit in combating the international <Col N="780" /> trafficking of drugs.  The second is the Minister's proposed legislation to deprive traffickers of the profits of their illegal activity.  The Minister aims to have a Bill to this effect circulated in the current session.</P>
    <P>Of course, the problem of drug offending cannot be solved by law enforcement on its own.  Drug abuse causes major problems in society and the role of parents, teachers and agencies caring for young people is as important as the Garda response.  In regard to warning young people at school of the dangers of substance abuse, I should stress that this issue is being dealt with by the Garda schools programme which, I am glad to say, is being extended to Cork later this year.</P>
    <P>The need for a national drug strategy to tackle the drug problem on every front has been recognised by the Government and my colleague, the Minister for Health, last year launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse. This strategy sets realistic and achieveable objectives for reduction both in the supply of and the demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan can be assured that the Garda and the Government are determined that the problem of drug abuse in Cork and in this country generally will be tackled through resolute and persistent action.</P>

      <P>Some relatively short time ago forests in my part of the country were confined to the mountains, the kind of thing one viewed through binoculars on a clear evening.  That is not the case anymore.  The planting of trees is the one definite growth area in the north-west, in Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Donegal and north Roscommon.  That is a positive thing, within limitations.  Much of the land being planted is good for little else and it is very good for forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties are showing up.  With Coillte and private forestry companies and individual landowners all in the business, people are finding trees planted literally on their doorsteps.  There are very few limitations on what can be done.  If a person wants to add a porch to his <Col N="781" /> house to keep out the north wind he must get planning permission but it is possible to plant 100 acres of the surrounding countryside without a by-your-leave. This is creating difficulties.  Many people do not want massive forests running close to their homes, farm buildings or front avenues.  They object for very understandable safety and security reasons and they do not regard the present limitations as sufficient.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of plantations blocking off scenic views.  There was even a plan to plant the only vantage point of the Lake Isle of Inishfree from the shores of Lough Gill.  In fairness to the Minister, he took very decisive action in that instance and if Yeats were alive he might pen a bit of a poem in his honour.</P>
    <P>Then there is the much bigger policy issue as to whether very scarce, good agricultural land in parts of the west should go under forestry at all when there are local farmers eager to acquire and work it and in the process become viable in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>I believe that with the runaway development now taking place in planting in the west the time has come for the Minister to take a look at the whole issue of controls which he could operate by way of grant limitations or by way of introducing planning permission regulations.  This is the time to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am concerned that residences and farm buildings should not be overwhelmed by forestry development, and grant-aid is not now available for planting within 30 metres of an occupied dwelling or associated buildings.  In addition to this general provision, each case is considered on its merits and a greater distance may be applied in specific instances.</P>
      <P>It is certainly not my intention that rural communities should be isolated or replaced by forestry, and indeed the stimulation of rural development and enhancement of the rural environment are important elements of both the forestry operational programme and the associated forestry measures of the rural development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a general condition of grant-aid <Col N="782" /> under the forestry programme that projects are compatible with the protection of the environment.  Landscape and amenity aspects are among those taken into account in assessing projects, and local authorities are consulted in relation to such areas listed either in the Inventory of Outstanding Landscapes by An Foras Forbartha in 1977 or in the county development plan.</P>
    <P>The afforestation of more than 200 hectares with conifers also requires an environmental impact assessment and planning permission because of its possible effects on the environment, including the landscape.</P>
    <P>As a further measure, my Department are currently preparing guidelines on forestry and the landscape to advise developers on various aspects of forest design. Compliance with the guidelines will be a condition of grant aid.</P>
    <P>I believe that forestry development can make a positive contribution to the environment and that the measures I have outlined enable this to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

      <P>The Minister for Energy created some confusion some weeks ago by announcing that he intended terminating the right of the ESB to use their billing system for payments on the purchase of electrical goods in their shops.  The Minister was acting as a result of representations made to him by the &ldquo;stop electric campaign&rdquo;, indeed by Members on all sides of this House.</P>
      <P>The Minister reversed his original decision today.  I am seeking this opportunity to ask him to clarify the present status of the ESB billing system since their consumers and the electrical trade generally are very confused about its present status.  In view of the fact that the Minister changed his mind on the matter on a number of occasions recently, it is now time he fully clarified the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, in view of the fact that the board of directors of the ESB meet today to consider the options open to them and because of the agreement reached today by the Minister and the financial director of the company, I want to know whether the Minister met the ESB at all before taking a formal decision to change the billing system.  Would he <Col N="783" /> indicate whether he agrees with the Stokes, Kennedy, Crowley report announced by the ESB in respect of job and financial losses that might be incurred by the company as a result of the proposed change in the billing system.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister clearly indicate to the House what attitude he will be adopting to the provision of equal facilities for people involved in the private electrical trade in respect of credit facilities, indicating whether he intends meeting the &ldquo;stop electric campaign&rdquo; committee with a view to alleviating their concerns about this important matter, because following today's decision we are once again presented with the <i>status quo</i> as representing Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to express my welcome for the agreement reached with the ESB on the question of bills for customers incorporating instalment repayments for goods bought in ESB shops.</P>
      <P>The ESB will be issuing a new style invoice for these customers which will incorporate totally separate bills for electricity charges and instalment payments. These new invoices will be first issued for the September/October billing period later this year after the ESB have made the necessary modifications to their computer programmes.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the ESB have responded to my concern for this transparency so that their customers can distinguish clearly what is due for electricity and what is due for instalment payment for electrical appliances.  This is being done in a way which does not jeopardise desirable efficiencies within their existing billing system.</P>
      <P>I repeat &mdash; and I thought I had made this clear on many occasions &mdash; that it was never my wish to see ESB shops closed or hire purchase facilities taken away from the underprivileged as was suggested by some groups, leading to the confusion to which the Deputy referred. I note with satisfaction the ESB's reassurance, in press release today, that electrical appliances will continue to be sold in the normal way in their shops throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> This is a satisfactory conclusion in regard to the direction I gave the ESB to achieve a certain objective, now reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say is very similar to the points raised by Deputy Nealon.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need for the establishment of a land use authority here which would involve not merely the Department of Energy and Coillte Teo but also the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Wildlife Service, Bord Fáilte, and, as a corollary, the Department of Tourism.</P>
      <P>There are no guidelines delineating which lands should be used for agriculture and which for forestry.  While it may appear somewhat of a contradiction, present forestry grants are so generous they are leading to the planting of trees on land which should properly be used for agriculture, a very haphazard arrangement.  I should like to see the Minister use his good offices to establish a land use authority whose mandate would be to decide which land should be used for which purpose, not merely forestry.  It would entail also the setting aside of sanctuaries for game birds, of which there is a distinct lack here at present and which could be a major tourist attraction.  We eliminated game birds to an extraordinary extent some years ago thereby limiting a potential tourism attraction, particularly during the months when shooting is allowed.  I should add that these types of game birds were quite prolific here a 100 or even 50 years ago, but they have been eliminated by modern farming techniques.</P>
      <P>We should endeavour to strike a balance between agriculture, afforestation and tourism, in respect of which we appear to have no plan whatsoever.  I am asking the Minister to instigate the formation of a land use authority so that each sector can be satisfactorily catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Deasy I should say that no guidelines have been prepared by Government in relation to land use for forestry and/or agriculture.  I do not believe there is a conflict between these <Col N="785" /> uses which would warrant the preparation of such guidelines at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is a general aim that only land suitable for forestry will be afforested and a guiding principle is that farmers and landowners should have a choice of how to use their land, subject to adhering to codes of practice for forestry and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the substantial improvements in the package of incentives for forestry I announced recently. These will give a major boost to the national forestry programme and contribute to the improvement of our environment.  I would like to assure the Deputy that there is no possibility that these measures will squeeze out agriculture.</P>
      <P>The new grant structures anticipate measures being proposed by the European Commission under the Common Agricultural Policy reform package. They are essential to counter the reduction in planned planting by the private sector, especially on the part of farmers, which arose from the expectation that the Commission proposals would lead to higher grants.  I could not allow the uncertainty engendered by this perception to continue.</P>
      <P>More and more farmers are turning to forestry to supplement their incomes and to generate wealth.  In 1991 full-time and part-time farmers planted over 70 per cent of the total forest area established by the private sector compared to a corresponding figure of less than 50 per cent in 1990.  In my view this increase in farmer participation is very much to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Teamwork, a scheme administered by FÁS, in the year 1991 provided places for 1,200 young people and was allocated some £4,800,000.  Their budget was cut back this year by £1.8 million, which will result in loss of employment as 750 places only will be available for participation in the scheme this year.  Teamwork is a scheme under which voluntary organisations such as youth groups can provide one year's training and employment for those unemployed between the ages of 17 and 24, who are paid £63 per week.  This scheme, <Col N="786" /> which does not afford permanent and/or pensionable employment, gives young people the experience so vital if they are to be even considered for a job.  The funding available for this purpose will be drastically reduced this year.</P>
      <P>Youth organisations, such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, reckon that a £1.8 million cut will deprive approximately 450 people of a chance to work and contribute to their localities. As if that were not bad enough, the amount that may be paid to young people participating in Teamwork schemes has not been increased since July 1990, such young people at present being only paid £63 per week.  At the very minimum this should be raised immediately by the inflationary rate of 5 per cent to £66. The reduction in the Teamwork budget is regrettable and should be reversed.  It signifies a very negative attitude to young people and their future.  Unemployment is now running at 28.5 per cent in the under 25 age group.  The decision to reduce the level of funding for Teamwork is a further blow for our young people and will exacerbate the unemployment crisis for this age group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan's contribution does not take into account the much improved post leaving certificate schemes which are now run by the Department of Education.  In relation to the reduction in the allocation to Teamwork this year, I would point out that the reduction is not £1.8 million but rather £1.048 million.</P>
      <P>Teamwork is a community managed scheme designed to provide temporary community based employment for young people through voluntary organisations for the mutual benefit of the young people and their communities.  The scheme is operated by FÁS and is now targeted at young people on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme funding is given to enable community based groups provide young unemployed people with work on local projects of a finite nature.  Teamwork aims to help both the young unemployed people and the community <Col N="787" /> through having worthwhile projects carried out which would not otherwise be undertaken.</P>
    <P>A grant of £63 per week is available towards the employment costs of each young person taken on under the scheme. In the case of projects involving five to ten people a grant of £105 per week is available towards the employment costs of an approved supervisor.  The duration of Teamwork projects can vary from a minimum of 26 weeks to a maximum of 52 weeks.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 Teamwork has not been eligible for assistance from the European Social Fund &mdash; that is something that will have to be taken into account &mdash; and as a result is exclusively Exchequer funded. An allocation of £4 million was originally proposed for the scheme in 1992, but it is expected that activity under the scheme will be lower than originally projected as a result of the introduction of the new employment subsidy and job training schemes.  As such a revised allocation of £3 million has been provided for Teamwork in 1992.  It is expected that this allocation will provide some 760 man-years activity under the scheme and that up to 2,000 young people will be involved in the scheme during the current year.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that local sponsors might consider the possibility of using the social employment scheme, which is ESF funded, for their projects and thereby give the older long term unemployed in their communities who may still be under 25 an opportunity to regain a foothold in the labour market while maintaining their individual locally based initiatives.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that Teamwork is <Col N="788" /> designed to help young people in their search for secure permanent employment.  The new job training scheme which I announced last week is also aimed at helping people improve their prospects of obtaining permanent employment.  It will provide opportunities for all persons on the live register for more than two months to obtain work based training on employers premises.  The scheme, which is EC funded, is a new approach linking the world of work and training in a practical manner and will provide full time training for between six and 12 months depending on the training requirement in each case.  Trainees will be paid the appropriate FÁS training allowance while they are being trained.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme is a departure from the more traditional manner of training provision through training centres and I would expect it to become a permanent feature of the Irish training system.  I am very hopeful that with employer co-operation the scheme will be successful and that the target of 10,000 participants will be achieved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would draw attention to the many opportunities available for young persons in both the education and training schemes, and particularly the post leaving certificate opportunities within the educational field.  The school leavers surveys carried out by my Department continuously emphasise the importance of educational qualifications in determining employment prospects and the fact that early and unqualified school leavers face the greatest difficulties in trying to find a job.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> In May 1991 following full consideration of all the proposals, leases were offered in respect of four of the sites, but in so far as the marina application was concerned, it was made clear that, while the Minister would agree, in principle, to the issue of such a lease, this would be subject to satisfactory completion of a public consultation process.</P>
    <P>While major progress has been made in the meantime with finalising the technical and legal aspects of the four leases offered, the legal formalities have not yet been completed.  The public consultation process in relation to the marina proper, which was linked to the completion of the four leases offered, has not yet been initiated.  Contacts are continuing with the promoters of the project with a view to progressing the proposals as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 15 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin let me state categorically that I have no plans to transfer the ferry port of Dún Laoghaire to Dublin Port.  The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Development Plan is being finalised at present by the Interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board. <Col N="628" /> This will be of assistance to me in considering the alternatives available in Dublin Bay for the development of berthage and terminal facilities in the future.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that Dublin Port has an indicative proposal to develop a unified passenger ferry terminal in the latest update of its current five year development plan.  No particular proposal for such a development has, however, been submitted to my Department and Dublin Port has no immediate plans to undertake such a development.</P>
    <P>Any proposals for the development of passenger terminal facilities in Dublin Bay would, given their likely start-up dates, most probably fall to be considered for EC funding in the context of a future Operational Programme on Peripherality covering the years 1994 to 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government have not considered any proposals in relation to the privatisation of facilities at Dún Laoghaire harbour and have no plans to do so. When the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Development Plan has been finalised its proposals for Dún Laoghaire harbour will be considered in detail by my Department and in due course by the Government.  I have not yet a final cost for the interim board's development proposals and I do not wish at this time to anticipate the likely total cost of their plans.</P>
    <P>Any proposals for the privatisation of facilities at Dublin Port would in the first instance be a matter for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port's capital development programme covering the period 1989 to 1993 lists projects with a total cost of over £27 million.  At present projects with an estimated cost of over £14 million are being assisted through the current Operational Programme on Peripherality covering the period 1989 to 1993.  Should the port wish to develop any additional facilities, its proposals will be considered for funding under the current operational programme, subject to availability of funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the downturn in the international market for mackerel. This trend had become evident over the latter part of last year.</P>
      <P>A major factor in the decline of the market has been the scaling down of klondyking operations by Eastern European countries arising out of political and economic changes in those countries. This has brought about a situation where the reduced number of klondykers still operating, in an effort to acquire hard currencies, are selling significant tonnage in the Danish and German markets at very low prices, thus affecting Irish sales in these important markets.  Further marketing difficulties are being experienced in Nigeria, where sales have been hampered by the depreciation of the US dollar and a shortage of foreign currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background the processing sector has been experiencing difficulties in disposing of frozen product in <Col N="630" /> traditional European and African markets.  This in turn has meant that processors, who have limited cold-storage capacity, have not been in a position to take as much of the mackerel catch as heretofore.</P>
    <P>In an effort to address the marketing problems that have developed, my Department, in consultation with the industry, have licensed a number of klondykers to make over-the-side purchases of mackerel in our waters.  In addition, BIM are actively assisting processors and exporters in seeking out possible new outlets on world markets.</P>
    <P>I am also pursuing with the European Commission the possibilities of adopting special measures, including inclusion of mackerel supplies in food aid programmes.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that this matter will be kept under close review and that the efforts of my Department and of BIM will continue to be directed towards finding solutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 20 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I will deal first with the planning permission aspects which the Deputies have raised.</P>
      <P>My predecessor, when he announced his approval in principle to the granting of a foreshore lease in this case, indicated, in accordance with normal practice, that the granting of the lease would be subject to planning permission being obtained for the onshore aspects of the proposed development and the fulfilling of a number of other conditions.</P>
      <P>The stipulation regarding planning permission only applies in so far as such planning permission may be required by the planning authority and may technically be obtained in advance of the grant of the lease.  The requirements for planning permission are the responsibility of the relevant local authority, in this case Kerry County Council.  I understand that the question of the local authority's requirements in the matter of planning permission is being pursued with the county council and the promoters.</P>
      <P>As regards the matter of withdrawing the approval granted in this case, the question of such withdrawal does not arise.</P>
      <P>I understand that all aspects of the matter including the various concerns expressed were taken into account by my predecessor when, following a major public inquiry, he decided, on the basis of the recommendations of that inquiry, to grant a lease.  That decision represents a formal commitment which, subject to the terms and conditions attached thereto, must be respected.</P>

      <P>Following the Ballycotton tragedy the central and regional fisheries boards were directed by my predecessor, the Tánaiste, to undertake a review of their operations to ensure the highest safety levels. The review covered all areas of the boards activities, including patrols of rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the findings of the safety review and the recommendations of the Ballycotton report measures have been taken by the fisheries boards to improve the safety of their staff.  Specifically, in relation to staff on river and lake work, both protection and development, the following improvements have been made: (1) making standard the wearing <Col N="633" /> of dry suits and life jackets and the purchase and supply of this equipment to all staff; (2) modifications to the boats used on lake and river work to provide positive buoyancy; (3) the operating procedures for boat work on lakes and rivers now require that the staff must maintain radio contact with shore and the necessary communications equipment has been purchased and provided for the staff and (4) the training of staff in such areas as sea survival, first aid and radio communications and the provision of training courses is ongoing as necessary.</P>
    <P>These measures, together with others taken in regard to sea patrols have been implemented at a cost of £450,000 to the boards.  Additional moneys have been provided in the 1992 allocation for the boards for the purchase of extra semirigid inflatable boats to enable these boats to be operated on the lines recommended by the Ballycotton report which found this type of vessel to be suitable for the task in hand.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures have ensured that fisheries boards' staff have the necessary facilities to enable them to attend to their duties as effectively as possible having due regard to their personal safety.</P>
    <P>The recommendation in the Ballycotton report that fisheries officers should have the same protection under the law as gardaí and that the same penalties should apply to anyone assaulting them is under consideration by my Department in consultation with the central board. The Deputy will appreciate that such a change would entail significant changes in the law and the issues involved must be clearly assessed.</P>
    <P>There is a greater appreciation in our community now of the role of fisheries boards' staff and the hazardous nature of their duties, as a result of the Ballycotton report.  I am pleased to note that a member of the District Court recently reflected the serious view taken by the court in relation to assaults on fisheries officers when dealing with such a case in County Cork.</P>

      <P>I have received the latest report of the Sea Trout Action Group which is one of three recent reports on the issue of the sea trout collapse currently before me, the other two being the report of the Irish Salmon Growers' Association on Sea Trout Problems and Research, and the report of the Sea Trout Working Group on the results of the 1991 research programme.</P>
      <P>There are differing perceptions as to the cause of the sea trout problem and the last two years have seen a concerted research effort to test the various hypotheses which have been advanced to explain the decline in numbers.  The results of the 1991 research effort, which my Department had a key role in funding and organising, were evaluated by a working group set up under the aegis of the Department on which all the scientists involved in the research programme participated.  The working group concluded, on the basis of the scientific evidence to date, that it has not been possible to demonstrate a significant correlation between the production of lice from salmon farms and subsequent infestation of sea trout in specific bays.</P>
      <P>The Sea Trout Action Group report goes further than this in stating that Sea Trout Action Group now believe that the weight of available evidence indicates that the increase in the number of lice emanating from salmon farms was a major contributory factor in the sea trout collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Salmon Growers' Association for their part have stated in their review document that the available scientific <Col N="635" /> information does not support the STAG finding and points to the need for further research on environmental and other factors.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for more to be done on this complex problem and it is equally clear that the practical recommendations of all the groups concerned can be examined and taken forward without necessarily accepting any hypothesis as definitive.  And this is precisely the approach I am going to take.</P>
    <P>The working group have made a number of recommendations on the scope and direction of the 1992 research programme.  These proposals are being assessed by my Department.</P>
    <P>Together with determining the research priorities for this year, my Department are examining the recommendations of the Sea Trout Action Group with a view to advising me of the management steps which might now be necessary to enhance the measures put in place in 1991.</P>
    <P>In this regard, my Department, having met with representatives of STAG, will be continuing the current round of discussions with the Irish Salmon Growers Association who have made a series of constructive management proposals, and other interested parties with a view to adopting an effective balanced framework for the conservation and rehabilitation of sea trout populations.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by stressing the need for the work on this complex problem to go forward in a continued spirit of co-operation.  It is in the interest of all concerned that the cause of this problem is identified and tackled.  Differing perceptions as to the cause of the problem should not stand in the way of concerted action to eliminate it.</P>

      <P>The Tralee Oyster Fisheries Society Limited has, as grantee of the 1981 Oyster Fisheries Order, played a significant part in rehabilitating and developing the Tralee oyster fishery, which had become seriously depleted in the late seventies. The society have succeeded, through careful management, in raising average annual production over the last few seasons to 100 tonnes, and there are good signs for further development.  Without the society's continued efforts to control the catch and to protect the juvenile stock, this resource would not progress towards reaching its full potential.</P>
      <P>I understand that a reseach and development programme, which is focussed on the assessment of more intensive oyster farming techniques, is being undertaken by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the co-operation of Tralee Oyster Fisheries Society in outer Tralee Bay, along the eastern part of the Maharees Peninsula.

      <P>Assistance in rescues in the Irish search and rescue region was provided by the UK services on five occasions in 1991.  I wish to refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 47 of 5 June 1991, columns 855 and 856, which gives the information for the previous five years.  The updated statistical information is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Since the Department of the Marine's helicopter came into operation on 15 July 1991 we have assisted the UK on three occasions in their area of responsibility. My Department have an observer on the United Kingdom Search and Rescue Committee.  This brings together representatives of all the main British search and rescue agencies, including the RAF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My representative has taken the opportunity at the half-yearly meetings of the UK Search and Rescue Committee to express to the RAF officers present my appreciation of the assistance the <Col N="640" /> crews of the RAF helicopters have given to persons in distress in Irish waters.  It is also standard practice for the co-ordinator of a rescue response, whose base is the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon, to extend thanks to all agencies who have participated in any way during the rescue mission.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to say in this forum that I deeply appreciate the dedication to duty and sheer professionalism of all those involved in rescues off our coast.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the very serious concern which has been expressed about the level of game fish stocks in Loughs Mask, Corrib and Conn and about the long term implications for these stocks of increases in the pike and roach populations in these lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary responsibility for these matters rests with the Western Regional Fisheries Board.  It is first and foremost a matter for the Western Fisheries Board to decide the priority it should give to addressing the concerns felt about the fisheries problems of the western lakes <Col N="641" /> having regard to other demands and the resources available.  The board have this year been allocated from central funds a total of £785,000.  I understand that the board propose to commence work in the near future to tackle the problem on some of the affected area.  However, the western lakes and their game fisheries are seen by many as a unique national asset. In this context, any major threat to their long term sustainability is of national concern.  It would be unacceptable to me that, due either to a lack of resources or to any lack of co-operation between the various statutory agencies involved, the rehabilitation of these lakes should not be accorded sufficient attention.</P>
    <P>I have accordingly directed my Department to discuss over the coming months with all the bodies involved, including tourist and angling organisations, the best means of pinpointing the scale and nature of the problems, the costs and benefits of addressing them and the options for meeting any additional resource requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two questions for answer here and I will deal with them separately.</P>
      <P>1.  Salvage Operation &mdash; The contract for wreck removal was agree and signed by B &amp; I Line and the German salvage company, Bugsier, on 20 December 1991. The contract allowed for the wreck to be cut into three parts and each part to be removed from the sea bed and disposed of ashore.  It was hoped, at the time of signing, to mobilise all the equipment in seven days and to complete the wreck removal operation in 21 working days.</P>
      <P>The salvage equipment, tugs, cranes and barges, began arriving in Dublin from Germany on 3 January 1992 having encountered bad weather en route.  The wreck removal operation was continuous from that date except when the on-site weather was so bad that the whole operation had to return to port.</P>
      <P>The bow part and the middle part of the wreck are ashore at the North Wall and are being disposed of.  The after part, that is the accommodation and engine room, will now be removed.  The after part weighs an estimated 700 tonnes.  It was intended to restore some of its buoyancy and float/lift it onto the removal barge but that plan is under review in the light of recent difficulties with the middle part.</P>
      <P>2.  The body of the missing seaman, Mr. Desmond Hayes &mdash; The wreck was searched by the Dún Laoghaire lifeboat crew, the Garda sub-aqua team, the fire brigade and the B &amp; I staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sea surface search was carried out by the <i>mv Leinster</i> as commander surface search, the Dún Laoghaire and Howth lifeboats, two tugs, a pilot cutter, the motor vessels <i>Inisheer, Speculity, Crispin, Yana,</i> one RAF Sea King helicopter, one Irish Marine Emergency Service S6IN Sikorsky helicopter, the fishing vessel <i>Iris,</i> the <i>mv Leinster</i> rescue boat, the <i>mv Hasselwerder's</i> lifeboat, the Irish Lights tender, <i>Granuaile,</i> the Irish Air Corps helicipters and fixed wing aircraft, the <i>LE Aoife</i> who relieved the <i>Leinster</i> and <Col N="643" /> assumed the role as on scene commander.</P>
    <P>The local and adjacent beaches were searched daily by the Skerries and Dún Laoghaire coast and cliff rescue service and later by the Civil Defence and local authorities.  Two bodies were recovered from the wreck.  The body of Mr. Desmond Hayes is still missing.</P>
    <P>Inquiries following the incident indicated Mr. Hayes might have been injured.  He was positively seen at the ship's port side rails and one of his shipmates thought he saw him in the water. It is possible that the missing remains may be under the after part of the vessel trapped against the ship port side accommodation.  I can assure this House that at all meetings between the principals and in all exchanged letters between the Irish Marine Emergency Service and the B &amp; I the subject of the missing seaman was raised.  As recently as 24 January my predecessor was assured by letter from the B &amp; I that from day one, no debris recovered from the wreck has escaped their attention nor would it in the future. The wreck site is visited at least three times a week by a member of the Irish Marine Emergency Service.</P>
    <P>I know that all members of Dáil Éireann join with me in expressing our concern and sympathy with the Hayes family at this time and with the other two families who have been bereaved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is carrying out a major programme of research and exploratory fishing to assist diversification into new species and new fisheries and the opening up of new grounds.</P>
      <P>To this end, the fisheries research centre of my Department are carrying out a programme of research into all the key food species, such as herring, mackerel, cod, haddock, whiting, hake, sole, plaice and nephrops with a view to maintaining and expanding our data base so that accurate assessments of the realities of the stock situation can be made.  In addition, specific investigations are carried out into a wide range of non-quota species like blue whiting, argentine, horse mackerel, spurdog, ray and tuna, often in collaboration with BIM.</P>
      <P>Complementing the primary research of Roinn na Mara's fisheries research centre, Ireland's exploratory fishing programme is directed by BIM and avails fully of the grants available for this purpose from the Community's Structural Funds.  Eight projects have already been carried out successfully, providing important information on non-quota pelagic and demersal species such as blue whiting, argentine, ling and tusk, as well as some more exotic species, at least in an Irish context, such as tuna and swordfish.</P>
      <P>A submission has also been made very recently to the European Commission for an investigation into the extent of deepwater non-quota whitefish species on the edge of the Continental Shelf. Other voyages envisaged for the near future include further research into the species of ling and tusk, roundnose grenadier, black scabbard, rays bream and spotted dogfish, all non-quota species combining marketability with availability.</P>
      <P>A part of the fleet already has the capability and equipment to fish various non-quota species.  This is evidenced by the increasing catches of some of these species, such as horse mackerel, in recent years.  A key objective of the research and exploratory programmes is to identify the boats and types of gear most suited to these fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly conscious of the need for a greater emphasis on value-added products in the context of the overall development of the Irish fishing industry. Indeed, given the constraints imposed by EC quotas regimes, it is absolutely essential that every effort is made to maximise the value of as high a proportion as possible of the national catch.</P>
      <P>With this objective in mind a strategy for the development of the fish processing industry has been agreed with the EC Commission and is set out in a Community Support Framework (CSF) for fish processing in Ireland.  This CSF covers the period 1991 to 1993, inclusive, and has earmarked EC aid of 10 MECUS for Ireland over the period.  It also sets out the principal priority objectives to be attained in assessing and processing applications for grant aid.  These relate to the better utilisation of available raw materials, increasing the added value of pelagic catches and upgrading and modernising of existing processing facilities.</P>
      <P>EC aid is allocated to individual applicants through operational programmes (OPs) which are prepared by my Department and submitted to the EC Commission for approval.  Successful applicants receive EC aid of 45 per cent of eligible costs and at least 5 per cent national aid.</P>
      <P>The first OP was prepared and approved in 1991.  It involved a total investment of £6.8 million by Irish processing companies for which EC aid of £3 million approximately was approved in respect of nine projects.  Employment creation of 148 jobs is envisaged as the new projects come on stream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second OP is in course of preparation at present and is expected to attract £3 million in EC aid.  A third OP <Col N="656" /> will be prepared later this year and should attract a further £2 million in Community aid.  I am confident that these programmes will result in a significant improvement in the overall production of value-added products and make a positive contribution towards increasing the value of Irish fish exports.</P>

      <P>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is a framework for the conservation and management of fish resources.  The policy sets down conditions under which vessels may engage legally in fishing activities.</P>
      <P>Within the context of the CFP, individual member states, who have a common interest in the conservation of fish resources, have responsibility for the enforcement of the conditions of the CFP within their own jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>My objective in the review of the CFP will be to ensure that every effort is made in, and support given to, the detection of illegal fishing by all the countries involved.  Among the initiatives mooted, which Ireland supports, is the introduction of satellite monitoring systems, and more prohibitive penalties for illegal fishing.</P>
