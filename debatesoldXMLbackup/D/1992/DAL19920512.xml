      <P>As I have already said in the House, the Government will campaign vigorously for a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 18 June as being, unquestionably, in the best interests of the people of this State.  Like the campaigns of 1972 on <Col N="914" /> entry to the Community and of 1987 on the Single European Act, this campaign will employ all appropriate elements such as ministerial meetings and speeches, participation in broadcast programmes and other public debates and media advertising and will focus on our recently published White Paper and explanatory booklet.</P>

      <P>A review as provided for in the revised Programme for Government of last autumn is currently in progress. <Col N="917" /> Its purpose is simply to monitor implementation of the programme on a quarterly basis, and to report to the party leaders so that any necessary action may be taken.  Announcements in relation to progress on particular items contained in the revised programme will be made by the Government from time to time.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that it would be useful to make available the results of such a review to the Members of the House so that they may judge the degree to which the objectives are being achieved?  I also ask the Taoiseach whether the decision not to proceed with elections to sub-county structures or even the establishment of such sub-county structures arose from the review to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already said that the reviews will continue and that as decisions are reached &mdash; the progress of which will be monitored, I have no doubt, by Opposition Deputies &mdash; announcements will be made from time to time by the Government.  In relation to the holding of elections for other bodies, which is what I think the Deputy was questioning, no decision has been made in that regard to date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Would the Taoiseach not agree that such simple matters <Col N="919" /> should immediately be devolved to local authorities?</P>

      <P>I addressed the IMI Conference in Killarney on 25 April 1992 on the theme &ldquo;Competitiveness &mdash; Ireland's Challenge in the Global Market&rdquo;.  In my address I focused on the place of consensus in fostering a competitive economic environment, the importance of tax reform in underpinning our competitiveness, the need for business restructuring, the restructuring of key sectors of the economy in our new national development plan, now being prepared, and the importance of the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.

      <P>I inform the Taoiseach that the Deputy does not so wish.  It is apparent that when the Taoiseach was talking to the news media in Killarney he mentioned that the Government have plans or have in fact commenced to develop the Shannon estuary as a top port.  The Taoiseach said that in addition to the natural amenities in the Shannon region the infrastructure was already in place.  When making those statements, did the Minister know that reports commissioned in the past number of years indicate that expenditure of at least £20 million on infrastructural development in the area is required before the Shannon estuarial area could be sold for the development of an international port?</P>

Those questions were passed on to the Minister for the Marine, who did not make statements in Killarney.  I thought that it would be more appropriate for the Taoiseach to have an opportunity to inform the House of the plans for development which neither Members of his Government nor anyone else in this House heard before the Taoiseach spoke, quite frankly, off the cuff in Killarney.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 83 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1991, provide a clear legal framework for the allocation of registration numbers, including year numerals, where vehicles are being registered for the first time.  The application of the regulations is a matter for the licensing authorities. Circular MT 900 contains guidelines to assist the authorities in performing this function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a circular, MT 900, which forbids the registering in a later year of cars purchased and used during a particular year. I seek the leniency of the Ceann Comhairle to raise this issue at Question Time. Did the Minister see this photograph &mdash; which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 11 November &mdash; of the Taoiseach driving a Jaguar car, which car was subsequently registered in January 1992?</P>

      <P>I have already explained to the Deputy that the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1991, provides a clear legal framework for the allocation of registration numbers.  This is a matter entirely for local authorities. Local authorities have to be absolutely satisfied that they are adhering to the guidelines.  While I do not wish to make a precedent, because it is not normal to deal with a specific instance at Question Time, the matter referred to by the Deputy has been the subject of public debate, much of which was entirely unwarranted.  The local authority concerned were completely satisfied about <Col N="922" /> the position when the licence was granted.  The car had one test drive in November, which was perfectly legitimate, it was then garaged until early in January and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, the photograph does help to illustrate my point that the car was used for very effective publicity on 11 November last.  It was used and apparently purchased on that day, according to newspaper reports, but it was not registered until January, when it was again seen on television, this time with a &ldquo;92 D&rdquo; registration.  That matter has been the subject of great scandal throughout the country and the subject of many letters to Members of the Fine Gael Party and, I am sure, to other Deputies.</P>

      <P>The Planning Acts are relevant to accommodating people with mental handicap in the community only in so far as this might involve development within the meaning of those Acts, whether by way of new construction or by virtue of a material change of use. While planning law does not appear to have given rise to problems for the policy of integration up to now, I will review the situation in the light of recent cases to see what changes, if any, may be desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his promise to review housing for mentally handicapped people.  In the social housing programme set out in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, <Col N="925" /> there is not any reference to this category of people and how they can be assisted by a local authority.  While this Bill is going through the House will the Minister make an appropriate change to allow the mentally handicapped to be accommodated in their health board areas without being obstructed by people who are obviously less concerned for them than the Minister and I?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There may not be a need to make any changes in the Bill to implement the plan for social housing. As the Deputy knows it covers many areas, including the voluntary sector.  I would be concerned if obstacles continued to be put in the way of accommodating the mentally handicapped. General policy is to try to have these people accommodated within the community. It was a new development that any such accommodation would be challenged under the planning laws.  I would be more concerned to ensure that developments like that do not relieve local health authorities and the local community of the obligation to find adequate accommodation for mentally handicapped people within their communities. Any action I think necessary in the Bill or elsewhere will be taken to ensure they get a fair deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have no hesitation, in general terms, about making my views known to the local authorities.  The Deputy will appreciate that when it comes to planning applications no matter how much I might disagree, people have a constitutional right to object.  I would like greater consideration to be given to how we should approach these problems. There should be less consideration for matters that seem to revolve around selfishness as distinct from our social and natural obligations in this area.</P>

There is substantial evidence that there are clear inroads to be made which would benefit both communities. The Government will be anxious to facilitate such progress.  As I have outlined, the present plans are proceeding apace. Substantial funds are being provided in the context of the present operational programme.  As regards stretching the possibilities in the next operational programme it would appear that what will be involved will be figures well in excess of £100 million being spent on that route. There are the questions of CPOs, discussions with local community groups and so on, but I take the point generally. We will proceed and advance as quickly as possible having regard to resources and development of the necessary routes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 17, 19, 21, 24, 30, 33, 47, 48, 49, 52, 66, 81, 84, 88, 191 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The Advisory Expert Committee on Local Government Reorganisation and Reform failed to agree on the question of the most appropriate local government structures at the sub-county level.  The Local Government Act, 1991, postponed local elections at this level to allow for a comprehensive review of the various issues.  The ministerial group established by the former Government to consider this matter had not completed their work when the present Government took office.  The group comprised of the Ministers for the Environment, Education, Energy, Foreign Affairs, Health, Industry and Commerce, Justice and Minister of State, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>Of course the matter is a complex one involving, as it does, the related questions of the devolution of functions and cost considerations, obviously it will take some time to bring these considerations to a conclusion.  In these circumstances, it is not proposed to hold local elections this year at sub-county level.  The provisions of the Local Government Act, 1991, postponing such elections continue to apply.  Neither would it be appropriate to establish a boundary advisory committee pending the formulation of definitive proposals as to structures and publication of the necessary detailed 1991 census data.</P>
      <P>A new ministerial committee was established last March to consider sub-county local government structures and devolution of functions to local authorities. This committee will complete their work as soon as possible and report to the Government who will decide what legislative proposals should be brought forward.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister clarify his view of sub-county structures? For example, is he completely committed to the abolition of urban district councils, town commissions and borough councils? Is he also committed to their substitution <Col N="934" /> by district councils?  What are his views on these issues?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made it absolutely clear on a number of occasions that I am concerned to ensure that there would continue to be locally elected members to serve the various towns and townlands nationwide.  Clearly there is the established county system.  Then the question of sub-county structures has to be developed in the light of changing circumstances, population, extending town boundaries and the number of towns and other areas nationwide that do not have available to them local councils.  All these matters are being considered by the ministerial subcommittee.  We will be reporting to Government with definite proposals as soon as possible.  We envisage being in a position to make a final report towards the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response sounded like a very definite maybe or maybe not.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prejudge decisions the Government will take in this area.  Clearly, the question of sub-county structures and that of devolution are strung together.  In turn, the Barrington Committee envisages some difficulties, even delay, in deciding on the question of devolution.  It is very important not only to decide on local structures but also to have a very clear view of their ultimate functions.  Therefore both issues need to be considered together.  We will not be rushed into taking any decisions with regard to these matters until we have finalised comprehensive views as to how these local authorities can be energised and serve their local areas in a new, different and more comprehensive manner.  However, I have no difficulty in saying that I believe fundamentally in <Col N="935" /> that type of devolution and in local democracy.</P>

      <P>May I draw the Minister back to the commitment given in the Programme for Government which promised that this legislation would be in place by March of this year?  Would he say how it is that, within a matter of months of having agreed this date, the Minister now finds the matters are so complex it will be at least the end of this year before a report is produced?  Surely it is only fair to those serving on town commissions and urban district councils that they would know whether they would be standing for election to those bodies next year and, indeed, whether those bodies will then exist?  Surely a decision in principle should be taken at this point without awaiting the details?</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the background of the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Programme for Government &mdash; clearly that was a statement made at the time with a view to implementation &mdash; but, in fairness to all sides, I should say there were a number of changes in my Department alone which would have militated against the production of a final report on the lines anticipated earlier last year. As far as an indication to people at present serving on local authorities are concerned, clearly they have been given a good opportunity to serve their respective local constituencies.  They do not seem to be complaining to me about any necessity to indicate formally to them what the position will be a year hence.</P>

      <P>Will this review committee also examine overall funding of local authorities?  In relation to Dublin, can the Minister say when the three new county councils will be formally established on a statutory basis in view of the fact that the local elections were fought on the basis of there being three new local authorities in Dublin?  In view of the fact that the new county councils are due to be established on a statutory basis, would the Minister not agree it would be <Col N="936" /> proper that the development plan currently under discussion in County Dublin be postponed and rather dealt with by the three new county councils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That would appear to be a separate question.  However, the question of the establishment of three local authorities in Dublin is moving ahead. As the Deputy will know, the managers have been appointed, the various committees serving and reporting.  I cannot give a specific deadline, in that certain difficulties have emerged that must be ironed out, but it is our intention to ensure that the planning and finalisation of these matters be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of local authorities, part of that consideration was included in the earlier committee's activities in that the Barrington Committee requested fiscal studies of the equalisation aspect of the rates support grant.  However, the wider financial considerations did not form part of the remit of the earlier committee, though it does appear to me that the closer one examines both the structures and functions the more one comes to the view that the tertiary question of finance also ultimately must enter into that equation.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister put it on the record that these committees are confined to elected representatives.  However, I will not go into that debate now.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be better government for him to admit now that there is no intention of going ahead with new sub-structures because of opposition, virtually across the political spectrum, from elected representatives who fear the abolition of urban district councils and town commissioners.  It would make more sense at this stage for the boundaries of urban district councils to be regularised to include urban areas which are currently outside them, so that the administrative problems which many people have as a result of being outside urban areas, although living in an urban area, can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if one had reached that conclusion, I do not think this is the appropriate time to deal with it I have met representatives of the municipal authorities and councils, and there are differing views on this issue.  My responsibility is to ensure that the changes which are necessary in the framework for local administration are developmental and <Col N="938" /> will enable local authorities to carry new and much more onerous functions. Undoubtedly there is at present within Government systems an obligation to make decisions on matters which would better reside with local elected representatives. All of these matters will have to be teased out so as to ensure that the changes are workable, effective and efficient and will enhance development in all of the local areas.  So far as I am concerned, that will be the primary consideration. I am afraid that in some cases local representatives want to keep their present functions, without consideration of the changes which are taking place and the necessity for changes.  I will take the overall situation into account and make the system workable and effective as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>These are all very fine words from the Minister, but he is the third Minister during the past year to repeat them.  Would the Minister not accept that what he has said flies in the face of the daily experience of all members of local authorities?  Would he not further accept that many of the things councils have resolved to do require, even for minor matters, the permission of the Minister?  When a proposal is sent to the Minister in the Custom House it gets clogged up.  I will give some examples.  First, there is the £5 million fund from parking fees in the name of Dublin Corporation.  We have a long list of traffic control measures which we want to implement.  These have been approved by the Garda Commissioner for the past three years but we cannot get approval from the Minister to spend a penny of this money.  I believe the money should be released and councils allowed to make the decisions.  Second, problems also arise in relation to minor issues.  If we want to build two houses in Smithfield we have to wait for months for the Minister's permission for an infill site.  Does the Minister not agree that local authorities should be allowed to make these decisions themselves?</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure <Col N="939" /> that workable changes are put in place as soon as possible.  As I have said on numerous occasions, I believe that the decision-making process should be devolved to local regions while at the same time having regard to national demands on financial resources, etc.  The Deputy said that he had to deal with three Ministers over the past year but I should point out that when his party were in Government the only function given to local authorities was the issuing of dog licences.</P>

      <P>The preparation by local authorities of waste plans and of special waste plans arises at present under the European Communities (Waste) Regulations, 1979, and the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982, respectively.  Plans are in operation in most local authority areas.</P>
      <P>My Department is separately preparing comprehensive legislation to modernise and consolidate the law on waste and to provide an improved framework for waste planning, management and regulation.  Work on a new waste Bill is at an advanced stage in the Department but I cannot indicate definitely when the Bill will be published.  The intention is to make a submission to the Government in relation to this Bill in the autumn of this year.  The priority up to now was to progress the legislation for the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, which was recently enacted and which contains a number of provisions relevant to waste.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that a well known environmentalist has said that there are three issues which are of importance to the environment, that is, waste, waste and waste?  Does she not accept that she made previous commitments to circulate a waste Bill before the summer and that there now seems to be some delay in this regard?  I wish to draw her attention to the fact that there are no sites available in Dublin city and county for waste disposal. The problem has now reached crisis stage and sites have been sought in neighbouring counties.  This proposal has met with very fierce local resistance. Would the Minister not agree that this is a very urgent matter and that she should revert to her earlier promise to bring a Bill before the House during this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give an undertaking that the Bill would come before the House before the summer recess.  I said it was my intention to circulate details of the Bill to interested parties and to hold a series of workshops with them before the Bill was sent to the Cabinet for approval; in other words, to have widespread discussions with people interested in this area.  This is the same process followed in relation to the Environmental Protection Agency legislation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which exist in relation to waste disposal but they can be resolved by local authorities and do not require new waste legislation. Local authorities have to place greater emphasis on recycling and take more waste out of the waste stream so that it does not have to go to land fill sites.  As the Deputy knows, the new Environmental Protection Agency Act makes provision for the setting by the agency of criteria for land fill sites.  Hopefully the agency will be in place later this summer so that they will be able to set down the criteria before any new land fill sites are developed.  They will be the body with whom this matter is discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other than the directives brought in under European Community Regulations we have not had waste legislation <Col N="941" /> since 1878.  This is a high priority; it is major legislation.  It is the one gap in our environmental protection law.  We have good water and air pollution legislation. We need to resolve this matter and it is my intention to do so within the next months.</P>

      <P>What consolation can the Minister give to industries, hospitals and research institutions which are dependent on Britain and other European countries to dispose of their waste?  What plans does the Minister propose to put in place to deal with the major problem of toxic and chemical waste, together with domestic waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, we are a small producer of dangerous and toxic waste.  According to the latest figures, we produce about 52,000 tons of this waste per year.  It will always be necessary to export waste.  It would be impossible for a country the size of Ireland and at our stage of development to provide all of the facilities for dealing with very specialised waste.  As the Deputy knows, it was the Government's intention to provide a national waste incinerator.  That decision was postponed because of the development at Du Pont in Derry.  Now that Du Pont are going it alone the Government are re-examining the provision of a national waste incinerator.  This examination will be concluded shortly.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, markets are available abroad for the disposal of all dangerous waste, and I am not aware of any difficulties that have arisen.  That will remain the case even if we go ahead with the provision of a national waste incinerator.  The new waste Bill will obviously deal specifically with waste that is dangerous and hazardous.  It is the Government's intention to place a very heavy reliance on this legislation in the matter of waste minimisation and waste prevention.  As Deputy Mitchell has said, it is in the generation and disposal of waste that pollution occurs, and industry generally in the country will have to put in place cleaner technologies in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the major controversy with regard to the Kill site proposal in which three local authorities are effectively involved, each of them having different interests to serve.  May I ask the Minister whether there is a proposal to provide some co-ordination between Dublin city and county local authorities and the local authorities of neighbouring counties to try to find a rational and reasonable solution to the problem of waste arising from the greater Dublin area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Co-ordination of the waste problem in Dublin is under way. As the Deputy is probably aware, an environmental impact study was commissioned recently in relation to the Kill site proposal.  Officials of my Department had discussions recently with representatives of Dublin County Council in relation to that proposal at which certain matters were raised.  We want to be sure that before a planning application is made all the matters are fully considerd in the environmental impact study.  As the Deputy is aware, the site at Kill was the site of an unauthorised waste development which was closed down by the court in 1983.  It is my intention to ensure, in so far as I have any authority in the matter, that new landfill sites are situated in the most appropriate area, that they are properly engineered and screened and properly run and managed. In the light of developments here and in the European Community the Dublin local authorities have to consider the fact that in future greater emphasis will, be on recycling with less dependence on landfill, although landfill will obviously be necessary.  I know that there is co-ordination between the local authorities with a view to considering the most practical way of solving Dublin's waste problem for the future.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if, in her consideration of the disposal of domestic waste, incineration has been considered for that purpose in conjunction with district heating systems as is the case in many large urban areas in Britain and on the Continent, and whether this could be applied to Dublin and larger towns in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the disposal of waste everything has to be considered.  A survey carried out in the past by the ESB showed that incineration for subsequent use for district heating would be uneconomic and would not be viable in an Irish context.  Certainly there are enormous difficulties with incinerators worldwide, even those merely used for municipal waste.  As many Deputies may know, even the thought of an incinerator frightens many communities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is still obviously actively considering the provision of a national waste incinerator.  Would the Minister not agree that if we had a thorough programme of reduction of dangerous waste at source we would not need a national toxic waste incinerator?  Second, would the Minister agree that we could learn from Denmark which is making much greater efforts than we are to phase out PVC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy.  To my knowledge, despite the idealism about the total abolition of dangerous and toxic waste, no society is free of these substances.  Even hospitals and health activities generate dangerous and toxic waste.  From an environmental point of view, what we must do is provide the best way of dealing with the waste that is generated.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to place greater emphasis <Col N="944" /> on the reduction of dangerous waste at source and perhaps on the phase out of certain waste.  That is why in the Environmental Protection Agency legislation we made provision for the establishment here of a toxic release inventory which will give us basic information about the composition and production of certain dangerous waste.  That is a forerunner to any phase out programme.</P>
      <P>I would clarify that on the question of providing a national waste incinerator a decision will have to be made by the Government in due course.  Obviously the Government will have to consider the economics of the provision of such a facility, particularly in the light of the decision by Du Pont, and when they arrive at a decision it will be made public as soon as possible.  We cannot shirk our responsibility in providing the most practical way of dealing with dangerous waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While we all agree that priority should be given to the prevention and pre-emption of waste, as Deputy Garland has said, would the Minister agree that at the end of the day we will end up with a certain amount of toxic and hazardous waste and that it would be folly for any environmentalist to ignore that fact?  We have to face up to the issue of how to dispose of hazardous waste.  I would ask the Minister to clarify a statement in an earlier reply in relation to exporting our waste, which surprised me. Is it not a fact that the scope for exporting waste across our national boundaries will be severely limited in future years by new EC developing rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Basle directive which will come into effect shortly and the Community's policy generally is on self-sufficiency.  However, the Community recognises that, even though self-sufficiency has to be the aim, no small country could be totally self-sufficient and in those circumstances countries can agree on a bilateral basis to take each other's waste, and that will remain the position.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that even in ideal circumstances, such as <Col N="945" /> those that prevail in Denmark and other countries mentioned by Deputy Garland, provision still has to be made for the disposal of dangerous and toxic waste. For example, asbestos which is generated from many old buildings and so on will remain a dangerous waste that has to be disposed of in a very specialised way no matter how we phase out existing waste streams.  We have to be realistic in that regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 79 together.  I received last week the final report of the committee which carried out a review of the law applying to the operation of small public service vehicles.  The report is a detailed one, containing recommendations on a wide range of issues, and it will take some time to give full consideration to all of these and to reach conclusions on them. I hope, however, to make early decisions on a number of priority issues and I will be arranging also to have the report printed and published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a chaotic situation at present in terms of the number of taxis in certain areas and the lack of them in others, review of which depends on this report being completed?  Could the Minister give more detail of an early version of the report, with the main findings being announced in the full report at a later date?  There is great urgency in this area in that in some cases applications for plates have been in for months, perhaps more than a year, and no progress can be <Col N="946" /> made because the Minister has stopped consideration of applications in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the situation is chaotic but there are problems which have to be faced up to.  I hope not only to publish the report but to make interim decisions very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to what he said in reply to a question about devolving power to local authorities.  In this case the Minister took away from the local authority their role in deciding on taxi services.  May I ask the Minister if it is his intention to consult the local authorities in the Dublin area before final decisions are made on the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be my intention to have the widest possible consultations not only with local authorities but with other interested groups before final decisions are taken on the implementation of the main body of the report. However, that will not prevent me from taking some immediate and more urgent decisions which could not allow for lengthy consideration and negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the aspects of the service relates to the quality of the cars.  Would the Minister consider a system of exempting public service vehicles from the duty to which cars are subject, as a means of enabling the provision of newer types of vehicles of a particular standard and size?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly room for continuing to improve the quality and range of the service.  I should very much like to reach the kind of situation to which Deputy De Rossa refers, but the question of any reduction or elimination of customs impositions or taxes is a matter for the Department of Finance.  With regard to helping the mentally handicapped or <Col N="947" /> the physically disabled, I would be extremely anxious that some consideration of that kind might be included in the provision of facilities.  I am anxious to explore that possibility but I cannot give a final commitment.  It is not a matter for which I have full responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I received this report a week ago and I am in the process of considering the major issues.  They revolve around the regulations for the taxi and hackney service and how these are interlinked in terms of future developments in many of our cities. There are other questions regarding the quality of the service and wider considerations, such as an expectation of an increase in fares.  Primarily we must make sure that some of the major problems affecting the service, such as a moratorium, are dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give special consideration to the rural service known as the hackney service which is a temporary rather than a full-time operation? The cost of plates, etc., would be far too high if considered on the same basis as the Dublin taxi service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the distinctive features in this area is the wide range of differences throughout the country as a whole.  For that reason it will take some time to work out the final details as to how the service should develop for the future.  I will take account of the considerations the Deputy has expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A standard specification for intruder alarm systems, which among other things specifies a minimum and maximum duration for audible alarms, has been formulated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, acting with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and was issued in 1987.</P>
      <P>Strengthened provisions for controlling noise emissions and sources have been provided for in the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Under section 106 of that Act, the Minister for the Environment may, following consultation with other Ministers concerned and the agency, make regulations for the purpose of preventing or limiting any noise which, <i>inter alia</i>, may give rise to a nuisance or disamenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no immediate proposals for extending these regulations to alarms generally, in view of the existing standard specification referred to.  There are general rights of complaint to the District Court under section 108 of the Environmental <Col N="956" /> Protection Agency Act, 1992. These may be availed of, as necessary, by complainants in particular circumstances of noise nuisance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it really is not the answer to say that one should go to court when a bell is ringing all night in a large housing estate keeping everybody awake?  Surely something can be done when these bells go off in unattended houses, usually because of a fault in the system.  They are becoming a nuisance rather than serving the purpose for which they were installed, to prevent break-ins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern. Much of the problem arises from faulty products in the first instance.  As I said, standard 199 drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland in 1987 sets standards for alarms.  I have to acknowledge they are not being enforced as rigorously as one would wish. I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently asked the National Standards Authority to review again the standards which were late.  I hope, if we can improve the product in the first instance, the noise pollution which occurs &mdash; such as that referred to by the Deputy of having alarms ring all night &mdash; will be eliminated.  I cannot think of any speedier method other than for the agency, the local authority or the complainant to seek a District Court order.  I do not think it would be possible to deal with it in any other way because we must have a balance between something which is causing pollution and disturbance and something which might go off accidentally.  For that reason the court is the appropriate body to deal with this.  However, the Minister does have power, under section 106 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to make regulations to control noise.  I assume, when the agency is in place, the Minister will discuss this matter with them and the other Ministers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether companies selling alarms are <Col N="957" /> required to be registered and, if not, if her Department have in their possession a list of alarm companies?  Will she agree that one way of helping ease the problem would be for her to write to the alarm companies urging them to contact the people to whom they supplied alarms and come to some arrangement to eliminate or reduce these very irritating occurrences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware whether companies have to register.  That would be more a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce because it is a product standards issue rather than an environmental issue.  However, if the Deputy feels it would be of help I will be delighted to contact alarm companies with a view to drawing their attention to the problems but I am sure they are well aware of them.  Over many years the Garda have made them aware of the problems.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has asked the National Standards Authority to look again at the standards which apply to alarms and, hopefully, these standards can be improved along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State absolutely sure the only problem is one of standards?  If there is a break-in over a weekend while the family is away and the bells ring, as they are designed to do, that is not a fault; that is the alarm system functioning properly.  These are the cases that give rise to this type of irritation.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this question and, if possible, make the contact I suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the standards, and as part of the standards process, details should be left with a neighbour or some responsible person. The gardaí should be notified if somebody is leaving a house or premises where there is an alarm system.  As Deputy Mitchell said, the problem is not just one of a faulty alarm.  Sometimes people go away without leaving details as to who has their key with the result that nothing <Col N="958" /> can be done until the person returns. Many of the better quality alarms automatically switch off and it is desirable that all alarms would automatically go off after a certain period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the final point raised is the nub of the issue.  Would the Minister agree that applying such a standard not only to alarms to be fitted in the future but to alarms already in place would help to resolve this problem? It is not the answer to simply say neighbours should go to court about their neighbour as that can lead only to further difficulties rather than a resolution of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not necessarily saying neighbours should go to court but that the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, gives neighbours, or those affected, the right to go to court. A local authority, the agency and several other people can go to court.  The Deputy is correct in saying the product should be of a certain standard and that appropriate conditions should apply to the product so that if the alarm goes off it will automatically switch off after a specific period.  I will pursue, in so far as it is within my remit to do so, the matters raised by the Deputies with a view to improving the situation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When I last had the opportunity to speak on this Bill I spoke about the shared ownership scheme and voluntary and co-operative housing.  I said all these schemes were necessary in the broad spectrum of housing.  However this Bill makes no provision for those on the margins of society.  We now have an unemployment rate of approximately 300,000 and most of those people are not in a position to purchase their own homes not even when they can avail of a shared ownership scheme.  Those on the housing list have very little hope of being rehoused, because of the Government's disgraceful record.  The Government have made no effort, good bad or indifferent <Col N="1048" /> to build or provide homes for those who need them and this Government's record is the worst since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill is a flam job to try to cover up the cracks.  It is full of woolly and wishful thinking.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, the largest local authority in the country, have received 435 applications for participation in the shared ownership scheme since the beginning of the year.  They have given 60 approvals, but only 19 of those 60 have paid deposits.  If that is the extent of the progress we have made into the middle of May, God help those who are in a hurry.  The length of time it is taking to process the application and make inspections has been brought to my notice. People have found that somebody who was able to get a building society or bank loan was able to purchase the house they liked before they had even got half way through the process of getting a loan under the shared ownership scheme.  It is not very encouraging that only 19 people availing of the shared ownership scheme have put deposits on their houses.  I hope this is not an indication of the energy being put into this scheme.</P>
      <P>If the local authorities are dragging their feet on the shared ownership scheme the Department should tell them they expect immediate action.  I would like to see the local authorities acting more swiftly when it is indicated to them which house a couple availing of a loan under the shared ownership scheme wish to purchase.</P>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the question of somebody applying for a house because their own is either inadequate or in bad repair.  The local authority can build extensions or carry out necessary repairs This is a good idea because it preserves the existing housing stock, but it comes ill from a Government that abolished housing grants particularly for old houses.  I have always argued that it is cost effective to maintain old housing stock in as good repair as possible, but that was cast to one side.  Now the Government come in with this idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience when people already <Col N="1049" /> in a house applied to the local authority to be rehoused the local authority would not entertain the application because they had a house, unless there was an order that the house was unfit for human habitation in which case something would be done.  That brings me to the question of bathrooms.  A bathroom is not a luxury today but a necessity, and the performance of local authorities in this area has been poor.  They have been taking some action but it is slow.  Section 5 refers to carrying out repairs and building extensions, but God help those who have to wait.  I am in favour of it if it can be done quickly so that if an unmarried mother, for example, requires to stay at home additional accommodation could be provided quickly.  If this cannot be done quickly, the unmarried mother may, because of tensions in the home, have to find alternative accommodation. The idea is good in that it helps people in bad housing but it does not help those with no housing.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to existing local authority flats.  Not enough resources are being provided for the refurbishing programme. Some of the work that is being done is very good and should be speeded up.  There are people in local authority areas in Dublin living in a very substandard accommodation particularly in local authority apartments.  In addition the general environment in which these apartments are located is very poor.  The necessity to plant trees and provide a softer environment is not taken into account.  One larger block in my constituency just has one entrance and there are nearly 400 apartments in it.  We all know what that sort of thing breeds.  It is simply wrong.  When refurbishing we should, if we are serious about it, try to break these blocks up and provide various entrances, change the names and give them a whole new look, because many of the problems in the inner city start in these large apartment blocks.</P>
    <P>In regard to one particular block of flats I asked the Corporation, when I was in the Department, if they would not take it out of the system because there were <Col N="1050" /> too many blocks in the one area and people were not being given a chance. In such circumstances they are totally ghettoised; they are all of the same socio-economic group and can see no way out. This policy has ruined good housing stock in the area I speak of.  Many years ago if one lived in that area one was pretty well off but now one could not give those houses away because of poor housing planning.</P>
    <P>In refrubishing houses and flats we must think of the whole environment. When I speak of taking apartments out of the system I do not mean knocking good housing stock down but selling it into private ownership.  I have seen this done in London where run-down housing was sold off to the private sector, a policy that resulted in a better social mix in the area.  The whole tenor of this Bill is to try to bring about a similar situation here so that I do not argue with that.  I would advocate this type of mixed housing and a getting away from the greenfield ideas.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about new investment or new development, and that worries me.  For those who need housing the idea of shared ownership is not necessarily the panacea.  They will require more assistance than that.  What is required is a programme.  It is time we looked at the question of involving private investment in this area of housing.  I refer to the financial institutions.  The alteration of the DIRT threshold to £100,000 for a married couple will bring a flood of money to these financial institutions.  It is about time some of these financial institutions took their public duty seriously. Why should building societies not get involved in the development of housing with the local authorities?  It need not necessarily be a financial partnership. The local authority could be involved by providing sites and whatever help was necessary and the housing allocated to people in need of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Subject to an income limit, a subsidy could be paid by the local authority to ensure that a project is viable but, in the first instance, the money should be put up by the building societies to develop the scheme and lend on.  If we want to <Col N="1051" /> get away from large public housing schemes on big green field sites, there could be development in a more controlled way in smaller areas with the building societies having a vested interest.  As they are in the business of lending why should they not be, for the first time, in the business of providing? This would give the building industry a much needed boost.</P>
    <P>I have often heard the cry, &ldquo;when you fellows get into Government the building industry collapses&rdquo;.  However, that industry has never been in a worse state; it has literally been closed down during the term of office of its great advocates, and this Bill does not provide it with any incentives.  I accept that where local authorities and the State step in and provide a large sum of money there have to be some controls and restrictions to ensure that the State does not have to pay out constantly.  However, the financial institutions, in particular the building societies and the banks, have been well treated by successive Governments &mdash; I hope they will not invest in schemes other than housing &mdash; and it is time they lived up to their obligations and gave something back.  They must realise that there has to be some give and take.  I would therefore like to see local authorities, the Department and the financial institutions work out a scheme which I hope will come to fruition.  I have no doubt this could be done.</P>
    <P>We introduced the £5,000 grant which I thought was a good idea but it was derided.  It was claimed that we were denuding local authority housing estates. This grant was payable to those who wished to vacate their local authority house and buy their own home.  It was a worthwhile scheme.  Indeed, many of those who condemned it were off the mark.  We should consider reintroducing it.  If people want to buy a house, depending on their income and the cost of the house, why not give them a £5,000 grant? After all, we are paying rent subsidies. We should consider all aspects of the housing programme.  I am not saying &ldquo;the local authority must do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;someone <Col N="1052" /> else must do that&rdquo; but we should consider all aspects and use as many of the financial institutions as possible.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership system and co-operative housing are good ideas and we should introduce an income ceiling to ensure we do not hand out £5,000 grants willy nilly but only to those who want to buy their own homes.  That is what I am advocating.  I want to see more people own their own homes and have a stake in society and this works well in Ireland. In any local authority housing estate one can pick out the houses that have been bought.  All of a sudden the owners have a sense of pride and since it is their own they make sure it is protected and well looked after.  We should encourage people to have some spirit.</P>
    <P>With regard to private investment it is time we talked to the building societies, the banks and other financial institutions and asked them to come up with proposals. Why not put the gun to their heads, so to speak, and say to them that they are getting enough, that we are making it easy for them to raise money and that they should give something in return.  All of us have our obligations and they are making plenty of money.</P>
    <P>Reference is made in the Bill to the management of local authority housing estates.  Indeed, local authorities are being given 12 months to come up with ideas to involve tenants in the management of these estates.  That is a good idea and it has been in operation in some areas.  Local authorities, in particular the authority in my area, are the worst landlords one could come across. They are a disgrace.  Sometimes a guy who is moved into a local authority housing estate can cause havoc but he is left there while decent people are run out of it.  The problem started the day caretakers were taken out, in particular from the large flat complexes in Dublin.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows what I am talking about as he served on the same local authority.  While Dublin Corporation have many good points, like other local authorities, they refuse to move such people arguing that they would have to house them somewhere <Col N="1053" /> else.  If someone wants to wreck a house and cause havoc I would let somebody else worry about him because he is not too worried about other people.</P>
    <P>We should consider privatising the management of local authority housing estates.  Private apartments, in vogue in recent years, are managed by private companies who arrange to have the grass cut and the property maintained.  We should consider putting this service out to tender.  If that was done right our complexes would be far batter managed at a lower cost.</P>
    <P>With regard to minor repairs, people will have to realise that they will have to pay for them.  If a tap washer goes they ring up to get someone to replace it. People have to accept responsibility for minor repairs and only call someone out to carry out major repairs.  My colleagues of the Left would disagree with me but this does not worry me unduly.  The estates were well managed when there were caretakers.  If anybody stepped out of line they were reported and dealt with but within a short time the position went from bad to worse.  We reached the stage where nobody wanted to live in those estates.  That matter has to be looked at. However, asking the local authorities to come up with ideas is not the answer. They might leave the plans as they are or decrease the numbers.  A special group should examine the matter to decide the most feasible project.  After all, it is tax-payers' money and it must be used wisely.</P>
    <P>While families are smaller, the same family may now be divided between two houses or apartments because of marriage breakdown.  Ironically, when people had families of ten to 12 children we were building two-bedroomed houses but we are now building three and four bedroomed houses for families of two or three children.  Single parent families must also be accommodated.  Because of our social welfare system young people who remain at home and who are unemployed receive very little as the means of parents will be taken into consideration. If the young person moves into an apartment he or she will receive social welfare payments and will probably also receive <Col N="1054" /> a rent subsidy.  This did not happen 15 or 20 years ago and I do not know whether the Bill will solve many of these problems. Social housing is very important and we must keep it constantly under review.  At least the Bill contains some new ideas, although it does not offer hope to all.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to shared ownership. In that case, stamp duty is not levied but if someone buys a house independently of shared ownership they have to pay stamp duty, which is unfair.  We must look at the question of stamp duty in relation to older houses; stamp duty is not levied on a new house but that does not apply to an old house.  I am referring particularly to first time buyers, not to those who are buying bigger houses.  At the lower end of the market no one should have to pay stamp duty and we must make it as easy as possible for people to purchase a house.  I indicated that a grant of £5,000 &mdash; or a figure to be determined &mdash; should be introduced for low income families because they cannot raise the necessary capital to enable them to buy a house.  When people were eligible for the £5,000 grant it enabled them to pay the solicitor's bill and stamp duty which gave them a good start.  This is important.  If we do not allocate a grant of this kind we will have to help them by other means.</P>
    <P>We must ask whether we are getting value for money.  A grant of this kind might be better than shared ownership because one of the difficulties in that regard is that you take a 50 per cent equity and the local authority take the other 50 per cent.  A rent subsidy is paid, depending on the person's income.  There is a period within which the person must take up the option of buying the other half of the ownership.  The House could have cost £24,000 which means that the person's share was a payment of £12,000. The price of the house is probably index-linked and at any rate will appreciate, which means that the person might have to pay £24,000 for the other half of the house.  Perhaps I have the wrong end of the stick but that is my understanding. As I said, a grant in the initial stages of <Col N="1055" /> buying a house might be a better option for many people.</P>
    <P>I accept that the question of stamp duty is not really a matter for this Bill and I know that the Department of Finance have the last say.  We all want the same thing although we may be coming at the problem from different directions. We must examine all the ideas put forward.</P>
    <P>Section 10 refers to halting sites and states that if caravans are parked within two miles of one they will be moved.  I am not opposed to that but we have fallen down in relation to halting sites, particularly in the Dublin area.  When I was in the Department we had prepared a plan which was just about up and running and the county council decided to make radical changes.  They dispersed halting sites all over Dublin which caused many people to be up in arms; nobody wanted a site to be built in their area.  We had got agreement in this regard before the plan was changed and we must pursue a policy of developing halting sites, particularly in the city, because some travelling people want to settle.  They are part of our community and must be provided for.</P>
    <P>Of course, we must also recognise that most travellers do not wish to settle; that is their culture and their right.  We must provide high quality halting sites, and I compliment the Department on doing just that although they were very expensive. I have the impression &mdash; maybe I am wrong &mdash; that sites are not now being provided, especially in the Dublin area. I know sometimes problems can be caused by the provision of halting sites but we have an obligation to house these people.</P>
    <P>Section 16 refers to notices to quit and the private housing sector.  We should always try to ensure that equity, fair play and decent standards are maintained in the private housing sector.  Private rented accommodation can be scarce and there is an argument that if landlords or potential landlords face too many impedients they will not want to invest in the rental sector.  That should not be a reason for <Col N="1056" /> not making sure that there are reasonable standards.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it will make any great difference to provide that a notice to quit should be issued a month before it is to take effect rather than a week before taking effect, but the provision of a month's notice does appear to be an improvement.  This measure will also be of benefit for landlords in that it is not unknown for tenants to pack their bags and depart overnight.</P>
    <P>When landlords take in tenants and charge high rents they must accept certain responsibilities.  After all, no matter what business you are in, if you do not look after your customer you are finished &mdash; and rightly so.  In this area because of supply and demand, there seems to be an indifference towards the customer &mdash; in this case the tenant.  Having rent books is a good idea because it gives tenants the feeling that they have a stake in their dwelling, which is important.</P>
    <P>The concept of registration and inspections of rented dwellings is also a good one, but we have to lay down minimum standards.  I am not pushing for luxurious conditions but I consider setting down minimum standards to be vital.  It is important that rented dwellings be safe. They should not be fire hazards and there must be proper sanitation, adequate water pressure and so on.  To be sure that the fabric of the roof and the materials used in construction of the dwelling itself do not allow dampness is basic.  When people are paying high rents they are entitled to those safeguards.</P>
    <P>We all know that married couples with children looking for rented accommodation will have to pay a fairly high price, and that often they do not even get that opportunity because once a child appears, easy access to rented accommodation disappears.  Often couples with a child are told that a flat or a house has been taken or is not vacant.  I am pleased that something is being done in this area but I hope it will be followed up.</P>
    <P>Several years ago registrations had to be lodged with local authorities.  I do not know whether that ever meant anything; it seems that people do not register.  It is <Col N="1057" /> fine for the House to pass legislation but unless it is enforced there is not much point in it.  I hope that the Bill will encourage higher standards in the private rental market.</P>
    <P>Section 26 concerns the disposal of houses, tenant purchasing and so on.  In the local authority about which I have knowledge when a corporation dwelling becomes vacant or is &ldquo;detenanted&rdquo; it goes back into the housing stock for reletting. It is important to retain as much housing stock as possible.  I am in favour of sales to tenants but there is a need to retain a level of rented housing stock. Perhaps I am reading this provision wrong, although I do not think so, but it appears that authorities will now be able to sell houses to anybody.  It is my contention that when a house in the rented sector becomes vacant it should go back into the rental market.  There are people on waiting lists for a house in a particular area; perhaps a family living in Tallaght want to move to Drimnagh.  Section 26 would rule out that possibility for many people on the housing lists, if my interpretation of this section is right; that is not a good move and should be reconsidered. It is possible that local authorities could use the provision as a way to get in extra money and that someone who has waited for years for a house in a particular area could be denied it.  I ask the Minister to examine this section again.</P>
    <P>While there are certain welcome measures in the Bill, the legislation will not improve the position of those on the margins unless there is an increase in the number of houses in the private rental market.</P>
    <P>We should move from the green field developments of the past because we were creating ghettoes.  The finishing of many of those schemes was atrocious, with no attention given to landscaping. Some of those developments were cold and soulless.  If they had been dealt with properly from day one, perhaps they would have had a better tenancy rate and would not have suffered such disregard by tenants.  That is why I am in favour of any future developments, whether carried <Col N="1058" /> out by local authorities, a combination of local authorities and private owners or the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is very little talk of the National Building Agency.  The agency, with some of the local authority housing and construction departments, must be redundant. The staff must spend all day looking at each other, because there does not seem to be very much building going on.  They must find it a rather boring occupation to sit around recalling the great days when a particular number of houses was built each year.</P>
    <P>With all of the expertise available, and with the building societies and all the other financial agencies gathering money, there must be some way we can come up with fresh ideas.  A new approach should be taken so that prospective tenants will not feel they are part of a big local authority ghetto but that they have their own private housing area or they are buying their own homes with help from the local authority.  Such a move would change the landscape of our outer city areas where mistakes were made in the past.</P>
    <P>I accept that in the past we were in a hurry to get things done and to have houses built, but in our rush we made the wrong moves; we did not think out the developments properly.  Now that we have had time to think about housing development, let us not run away from building.  The building industry is on the floor and we should try to give it hope. Everybody should encourage the people in this industry because an increase in construction would be a change for the better.</P>
    <P>We should also look at estates on the outskirts of our cities; we should employ planners and landscape gardeners to see if we can make those estates more attractive. We will always have social problems and we should work on them, but we should at least build homes in which people can take some degree of pride, not homes in soulless streets which do not provide any hope for people, streets where there is high unemployment and all the things that make places into undesirable areas.  Local authorities <Col N="1059" /> should live up to their responsibilities in this respect.  They have not done so properly in the past.  I enjoyed my time as a local authority member and one thing that always annoyed me was the way in which they managed their housing stock.</P>
    <P>This Bill covers things that were promised by the social partnership, so I am surprised that the social partners have bought this package.  There are a few ideas in the Bill, but it is only tinkering with the real problem.  The figure I was given was that there are 5,000 people on the Dublin Corporation list.  That was some time ago, so there are probably more now.  The same sort of thing applies in other local authorities.  We should not go back to the stage we were at, 15 or 20 years ago, where we could offer people no hope unless they had a gang of children and they were living in atrocious conditions.  I do not say that the Bill will bring us back to that but we must look seriously at the building programme. This Bill does not do that.  I appeal to the Minister to come up with some proposals for a realistic ongoing building programme if we are to avoid chaos.</P>
    <P>Rising unemployment is creating major problems.  We must face those problems and give people some hope.  We should include everyone in this debate in order to get the will, the finance and the ideas to provide a new system whereby people can afford to buy their own homes.  This would eliminate maintenance problems and be a better way of dealing with this problem.</P>

      <P>The Bill is highly commendable. It aims to make sure that every family and individual has a place <Col N="1060" /> to live, in keeping with their needs.  It further aims to ensure that housing will be located in an acceptable environment and that the price of rent is affordable.  Its objective is to promote owner occupation as the form of accommodation which most Irish people prefer and aspire to.  It aims to develop policy in the context of housing needs in modern society and to take into consideration the necessity to reduce or eliminate segregation, thereby ensuring a more healthy and acceptable social mix in the community.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note in the Minister's speech that measures incorporated in the plan are intended to supplement rather than replace the traditional local authority house building programme.  This theory is an excellent one and I can readily agree with it.  It is easy to agree that huge local authority estates have brought about major social difficulties.  It is easy to agree with the principle of discontinuing that policy.  Deputy O'Brien described such estates as ghettoes. I agree with him.  I presume he was referring to cities such as Dublin.  The same thing applies on a smaller scale to the building of large housing estates in rural villages, with disastrous effects.  Villages in my constituency have been destroyed.  The character of a village is changed because of the concentration of building.  Large estates are unsuited to the original size of many village communities. I welcome the departure from that method of providing housing.</P>

    <P>The alternative measures proposed must be expedited and must be on a scale to be able to substitute for the old system. Housing must be provided on an ongoing basis for the people who need it.  So far, these measures have failed to do that. The rate of house building has slowed down considerably.  It is not good enough to have a major reduction in house building without providing something in its place to ensure that accommodation is available for the people who need it. There is a serious housing shortage at present.  Every necessary step must be taken to address that problem.  Local authorities have built over one-third of all houses in this country, their waiting <Col N="1061" /> lists having come within manageable proportions. That overall position declined substantially right up to the end of 1988 so that, from 1989 onwards, unfortunately, those lists reflected the seriousness of the overall housing shortage.  We must face up to the fact that it has now reached near crisis proportion.  For example there is need for over 800 local authority houses in my constituency, the waiting list being of such magnitude.  I am not sure what is the position in Deputy Durkan's constituency of east Kildare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <P>We could fill 800 local authority houses in Wicklow tomorrow morning, whereas this year Wicklow County Council will build only 14 local authority houses putting the problem in proper perspective. There is no point in any of us pretending that those circumstances do not prevail.  Rather they must be recognised, tackled and corrected.  In certain parts of County Wicklow there are what could be described as housing black spots.  One such black spot is to be found in the town of Arklow, once one of our most thriving towns nationwide.  Unfortunately that town suffered enormous economic trauma with the collapse of traditional industries, leading to high levels of unemployment in the town itself and throughout its south Wicklow hinterland. If one adds to those difficulties of high unemployment the chronic housing shortage, one sees immediately a recipe for human misery.  I appeal to the Minister to monitor the position very closely to ensure that these potentially excellent measures incorporated in the plan will fill the vacuum created by the dramatic reduction in the construction of local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am indeed grateful for the substantial expenditure on refurbishment of local authority housing in County Wicklow in recent years.  The Minister provided the requisite funding for the creation of much needed employment and the upgrading of formerly uninhabitable dwellings converting them into lovely homes.  This <Col N="1062" /> work was undertaken by teams of tradesmen and workers employed on a direct labour basis by Wicklow County Council over a number of years, and whose workmanship was exemplary, the result being highly beneficial for all concerned. Indeed such refurbishment was cheaper than building new local authority houses, having as good if not a greater positive effect.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions of this Bill and housing plan are meritorious and positive in content.  I should like to address some of these proposals briefly.  Voluntary and co-operative housing is something we should implement in a positive fashion, as is the intention, with grants being made available to voluntary housing organisations, in turn, enabling them to provide communal facilities in both new and existing housing schemes.  There is a particularly good example of this to be found in Carnew in County Wicklow where a group of excellent people got together over a number of years and raised funds locally, supplemented by grants, not of any great substance, to provide a housing estate geared to the needs of the elderly, with built-in services such as the provision of a day care centre, laundry services and so on.  It was an excellent community endeavour, the pride and joy of the area, on which the local people responsible must be congratulated. Anybody is welcome to come and see that development, indeed to use it as a model for other areas.  This type of communal effort should be copied all over County Wicklow if not nationwide.</P>
    <P>Another welcome innovation is that of shared ownership.  However, it must be said that people have not greeted this proposal with the enthusiasm it deserves. Indeed its importance has not been sold or sufficiently marketed, for which, in a general way I contend that local authority officialdom must be blamed.  I understand that some local authorities have taken the matter seriously; others less so.  We all have a part to play at local authority level.  This is a new concept which should be promoted because it is an excellent means of providing housing for the less well off in our society.  Indeed <Col N="1063" /> I would appeal to the Minister to lean on all concerned, particularly on local authorities who have been backward in coming forward in this respect.  This shared ownership scheme is an excellent one but we must remember that it will be as good only as it is marketed, projected and implemented.  I know that many of my colleagues know of people locally who would be ideally suited to implementing this scheme.  I advocate that all Members participate in this scheme, endeavouring to project its positive aspects at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Then there are the proposed improvement works to be implemented in lieu of building local authority houses, a matter which was raised by Deputy O'Brien with whose comments I agree.  This is an excellent idea, to improve houses, adding on an additional room or two, perhaps in some cases a granny flat, to cater for an expanded family.  We should remember that older people do not like to move from their customary place of residence.</P>
    <P>We all know people who are living in unacceptable low grade accommodation with, for example, bad roofing and no bathrooms, who are looking for alternative housing.  However, many of them are loath to leave their present accommodation for various reasons.  While many of them move into housing estates they would prefer to remain in their present homes if they could be made habitable.  However, they do not have the resources to do this work themselves. This Bill will enable assistance to be given to improve and upgrade their houses and I wholeheartedly welcome those provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the plight of the homeless.  Obviously every citizen is entitled to a roof over his or her head. The Housing Act, 1988, empowers local authorities to provide accommodation for homeless people.  Local authorities were asked to include all homeless people in their assessment of housing needs which was carried out in March 1991. Some extraordinary figures emerged.  I welcome the further emphasis being <Col N="1064" /> placed in this Bill on the need to provide housing for homeless people.  The onus will be on local authorities to house homeless people in temporary accommodation, such as hotels or guesthouses, until such time as suitable permanent accommodation can be provided for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the proposed mortgage allowance which will provide an incentive to local authority tenants to buy their own houses.  This scheme is much better than the previous scheme introduced some years ago.  As Deputy O'Brien said, that scheme led to the creation of ghettoes.  Under that scheme people were paid £5,000 to move out of the local authority estate and buy houses elsewhere.  Under the proposed scheme, money will not be paid directly to the tenants.  As its title implies, this mortgage allowance will be used to pay off a person's mortgage over a number of years on a decreasing scale &mdash; a sum of £1,000 will be paid in the first year, £800 in the second year, £600 in the third year, £500 in the fourth year and £400 in the fifth year &mdash; directly to the lending agency concerned.  This is a much better way of providing an incentive to local authority tenants to buy their own houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to local authority house purchase loans.  We do not provide local authority loans to the same extent as we did in the past.  For example, in 1987 local authorities lent £151 million for house purchases but in 1990 the figure was £20 million.  While the housing staff in Wicklow County Council have always been very co-operative, I have always reminded them that their job is to issue loans and advise people on the pros and cons, difficulties, traps and advantages of the loans available.  I am glad to see that it is proposed to increase the amount provided by local authorities by way of loans.  Irish people like to own their own homes, regardless of what rung of the social ladder they are on and they should be given every assistance to do this.  Local <Col N="1065" /> authority house loans assist many people to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the sale of sites by local authorities at low or nominal costs to people who wish to build their own houses.  This is a very welcome provision. I welcome the stitching into this scheme of certain criteria which have to be met to ensure that undeserving people are not given a cheap site.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Joint venture housing schemes have worked extremely well throughout the country, particularly in my constituency. Under this scheme local authorities and private builders get together to build housing estates.  In this way houses are provided at affordable prices.  However, I know of some ludicrous cases.  For example, in a joint venture scheme in my constituency a builder, in conjunction with the local authority, set about providing houses on local authority land but the local authority laid down such conditions in terms of planning permission that the builder was forced to expend £8,500 per site.  Other conditions were laid down, such as building walls around the estate, which were unnecessary, and the installation of smokeless fuel fireplaces. This is ridiculous and I would like to think it is just a once off event.  I know from experience that joint ventures can be very positive.  In many cases local authority land is lying idle and the authorities should welcome joint ventures.  As well as providing employment they would provide houses at a reasonable cost for people who need them.  Any encouragement from the Minister in this regard would be welcome.</P>
    <P>The provision of rural cottages by local authorities is an excellent way of providing houses.  Rural cottages have been built in County Wicklow, County Kerry and throughout the country.  It is an excellent way of keeping people in their own areas.  Lip service is paid to rural development but the rural areas cannot be developed unless people live there and people cannot remain in the rural areas if they do not have a roof over their heads.  The tendency for a number of <Col N="1066" /> years has been to avoid building in rural areas and to refuse planning permission. I am in favour of protecting the environment and I agree we should be very stringent in regard to the type of buildings allowed, but there should be no restriction on the offspring of small landowners who wish to build in their own areas.  We should also allow people to build who are not landowners but who want to stay in the areas their families have lived for generations.  The local authority rural cottage was the ideal mechanism for these people rather than herding them into villages, towns, cities and ghettoes. Over a number of years we have been able to build a limited number of rural cottages in County Wicklow.  Last year two rural cotages were built but I do not know how many will be built this year &mdash; it will be a negligible number.  Building rural cottages should be part of the overall housing plan.</P>
    <P>The measure relating to the provision of bathroom and toilet facilities is an excellent one.  It is extraordinary that in 1992 many families and elderly people, some of whom live alone, do not have indoor toilet facilities, a basic human requirement.  People are living in atrocious conditions.  We have been talking about this matter since February 1991 but it is a very slow process and I would ask that it be expedited.  Hopefully by the time we reach the 21st century these facilities will be provided in all houses so that old people do not have to use outdoor facilities, perhaps at the end of their garden.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenants may purchase local authority houses, which is acceptable and commendable, but what concerns me is the onward sale of these houses.  In latter years there has been a tendency to sell them to speculators. Local authority houses are bought by builders, renovated and sold to well heeled customers.  There is something wrong with that practice.  I do not know if we or the local authority can lay down conditions and say to whom the house must be sold.</P>
    <P>This practice of selling local authority dwellings to speculators will continue, <Col N="1067" /> particularly in a county such as Wicklow, where it is not easy for people to find holiday homes or hideaways.  The people could afford to buy a rural cottage way above the market price.  They make the purchaser an offer he cannot refuse and then spend an amount of money developing the house into a very nice pad.  There is something inately wrong with that practice. I am not sure what can be done about it but I would ask the Minister to consider it.  I can quote instances of builder-speculators buying houses, renovating them and selling them at a profit. If these dwellings were disposed of to a person in the category we are talking about there would be no great difficulty. I am worried about the speculative aspect and about the wealthy individual who could take advantage of the situation. That should be looked at with a view to preventing the development of something which, in retrospect, would be regarded as quite scandalous.  We have had enough scandals.</P>
    <P>The purchase of existing houses by local authority tenants is a welcome process. Unfortunately there is not a purchase scheme in existence.  The last scheme was an excellent one and the then Minister fondly referred to it as the sale of the century.  People got very good value for money.  We should give the tenant the opportunity to buy out a house after the required number of years of tenancy.  I would ask the Minister to introduce a scheme as soon as possible to enable more people to buy out their houses.  This is advantageous to the local authorities in that the substantial cost of maintenance is reduced.  I can see no reason for not having such a scheme on an on-going basis.  There may be administrative reasons for introducing a scheme, cutting it off and then deeming it appropriate to introduce further schemes.  However, I believe people should be allowed to approach their local authority at any time with the intention of buying out their house.</P>
    <P>I welcome the excellent concept of allowing local authorities to purchase existing houses instead of building new <Col N="1068" /> ones, but I do not know how feasible it would be or where the local authorities would get the money to do it.  The social problems involved in housing have been mentioned during this debate.  The purchase of existing houses would facilitate the integrating of communities and the creation of the social mix we aspire to. This new scheme would involve the local authority buying properties in a town or village as the houses come on the market. These dwellings would then be made available as rented accommodation to people who fulfil the appropriate criteria. It is a meritorious concept which the local authorities should take on board.  I wonder, however, if sufficient funding is being transferred to the local authorities by the Minister to allow them to get on with this innovation.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to make these points.  I repeat my request to the Minister to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme as promptly as possible.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could welcome the Bill, whose entry to this House has been much heralded if belated.  Like much legislation it is appearing long after it has become necessary.  It could be said of this legislation that nothing I can recall has been promised for so long with so little final impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is a problem which has beset public representatives over the past four years, particularly the housing needs of the category who do not qualify for building society or other finance agency loans. In February 1991 the Minister proudly announced the initiation of the social housing plan.  A huge brochure on the subject was produced which probably cost the price of at least half a dozen houses.  We who are members of local authorities know too well how long we have languished waiting to see real benefits manifest to the people.  Permission was given to the local authorities about a year ago to grant a certain number of loans.  There is a restriction on the number of loans which may be granted <Col N="1069" /> and on the manner in which they may be granted.</P>
    <P>I have the impression that this was originally a very good and useful Bill but that it has been got at by somebody and successfully trimmed and chipped to such an extent that it will be virtually impossible for it to be of any assistance to the people for whom it is intended.  I have had countless arguments at local authority level and with officials as to how it might be improved and liberalised enough to assist people.</P>
    <P>The last speaker made a number of important points.  During the past four years the Government and their predecessors have demonstrated a spectacular negligence of housing needs.  We can use nice phrases and talk about social housing needs, but the bottom line is that no money has been provided for housing in the past four years.  There has been no intention of providing such money.  There has been a spectacular dereliction of duty on the part of the Government in their failure to meet housing needs.  They have abdicated their responsibilities to the people they profess to serve.  I see no evidence, nor have I seen any evidence over the past number of years, which is likely to make me change my mind on the Government's intentions in that area. The reason is simple &mdash; there are obviously no votes in housing.  People who have houses are not concerned about those who have not, and those who have not a house are so distressed by their problems they do not have the time, energy or inclination to create an effective lobby group.  That is why the inadequate provision of housing is not being addressed at present.  It is an absolute disgrace that local authorities have built scarcely a house and provided so few housing loans over the past four years compared with the previous four years.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, was introduced with much pomp and ceremony.  Following the enactment of legislation to deal with homeless persons, we enacted a housing Bill in 1988.  If we badly needed to make provision to house the homeless in 1988, I wonder what needs to be done for the <Col N="1070" /> homeless?  I can assure the Minister sitting opposite and members of both parties in Government that one cannot compare the problem at present with that which existed in 1988.</P>
    <P>Any member of a local authority, and particularly those local authorities adjacent to Dublin, where the growing population has had an impact will tell you that the number of people who have availed of a local authority loan has decreased dramatically.  I can give the classic example of County Kildare.  In the period between 1982-87, the local authority allocated loans to 1,400 families who were able to house themselves under HFA or similar-type schemes.  The corresponding figure for the following four years is 95. From 1982 to 1987 the local authorities in County Kildare allocated between 600 and 800 houses to local authority tenants, but the figure for the past four years is 120.  I can decribe this only as an absolute disgrace.  If anyone asks what has happened, have fewer people applied for loans, let me tell them that the people are on the housing list while they live in cramped and unsatisfactory housing conditions, in unsafe mobile homes all over the country.  It is shameful that the Government are making no attempt to improve the conditions in which such people must live.</P>
    <P>The only option available to my local authority is to send those in need of emergency housing to the various hostels in this city or to another hostel which is not intended to deal with this category of person.  I am just one member of the local authority, but every member of my local authority has had the same problem brought to his attention.  It is all very fine for Ministers to say the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions,) Bill, will solve the problem &mdash; but no resources are being provided for that purpose, and I believe there is no intention to do so and as a result the problem will not be solved.  The unfortunate tragedy of our society which one day may be visited on the Government opposite is that many young people do not have a job, neither do they have a house and they have little prospect of either.  The only option the Government <Col N="1071" /> put forward is emigration; as a matter of fact another Government Department propose to set up FÁS offices throughout Europe to cater for the number emigrating.</P>
    <P>I wonder how young people view the workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Do they think legislation will be effective in meeting their needs?  From my experience, if the Government's track record on housing over the past four years is anything to go by, they will be very disappointed.</P>
    <P>I was amazed, though delighted, to hear Deputy Jacob refer to many of the points I have just made, but the place to resolve them is at Cabinet.  The matter can be resolved when we vote on this Bill or on Committee Stage.  This gives the Members opposite a great opportunity to put forward their suggestions and proposals. Most of the backbenchers opposite are members of a local authority and there is nothing about housing or loans that they do not know.  I cannot understand why their wealth of experience cannot percolate down into the Cabinet where decisions are made.</P>
    <P>The SDA, or annuity loan as it is called, the income-related scheme which is known as the convertible loan scheme, has been revamped.  Where I live in County Kildare a local authority loan under one of these schemes is absolutely useless because it goes nowhere near meeting the cost of a house except in isolated rural areas.  The Minister should increase the maximum available to a realistic level in order that people who do not have a high income or a huge amount of money saved with a bank or building society can house themselves within a reasonable period of time.  This could be done if the loan was linked to their income, in much the same way as under the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  If I might digress, I know there were those who said the HFA scheme was a farce; indeed Members on the benches opposite spent a great deal of time in the eighties telling people it was a farce, but a great many people were housed who would not otherwise be housed.  While it <Col N="1072" /> is true that people might have paid over the odds, particularly if they had been unable to maintain their payments, there were safeguards.  Critics will say that a number of those houses were repossessed but in the same period houses were repossessed when people had availed of bank or building society loans.  That argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to look at the HFA scheme whereby a person got a loan of three times his income.  The scheme needed to be fine-tuned to ensure that it worked.  However, I would like to draw attention to a flaw in the scheme &mdash; and I raised this matter on the Adjournment &mdash; particularly in cases of marital breakdown. Whether we like it or not the incidence of marital breakdown has increased &mdash; in times of financial distress it increases because of the pressures in households. In a number of cases of marital breakdown the husband has left and does not maintain the wife and family.  By some mysterious means the HFA decided that the mortgage repayments should be based on the theoretical income which is supposed to come from the husband, even though the husband is not supporting the family or may not have darkened the door for four or five years.  The Housing Finance Agency now revamped in this Bill &mdash; have determined the wife will have to repay a loan based on her husband's income which she does not know about and which she does not receive.  The reason is the agency discovered too late there were a number of deserted wives and separated households affected in this way.  They decided, rather than carry the financial responsibility for it, it would be better that the local authorities would put the boot in, so to speak, and repossess the houses.  A large number of those houses have been repossessed. It is unfair to women that there should be such an application of the rule. People will say not every local authority behaves in this fashion but the housing finance agency have been pressurising local authorities to behave in that way. They have succeeded in repossessing houses because of the low income of the remaining mortgage holder, the wife.  In <Col N="1073" /> other words, a wife who is receiving between £50 and £80 per week and who has a mortgage of £25,000 to £27,000 can pay only about £10 or £15 per week.  In those cases local authorities determine she should make normal repayments based on economic factors so that the agency can redeem the interest in the mortgage within a reasonable period. That cannot be done and it is morally wrong that that should take place.  I raised that issue on the Adjournment two years ago but I was not impressed by the response I received.  I suggest the Minister examine that aspect in an effort to alleviate the hardship caused to such people.</P>
    <P>The convertible loan system is probably the next best scheme, after the old housing finance agency scheme, for people in my constituency where house prices range from £30,000 to £50,000.  If a large family want a four-bedroom house they will have to pay £50,000 and those seeking a three-bedroom house will be lucky to get a local authority house for £30,000.  If they want a house in a private estate, which they will have to aim for if no local authority house is available, that will cost between £40,000 and £44,000. We should think about extending the convertible loan scheme, bring the maximum loan permissible under it to a realistic level and extend the loan repayment period beyond the 25 or 30 years for another ten years if necessary.  The downside is that people will say: &ldquo;I will be dead before I own my own house,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I will be 80 years of age before I own my own house.&rdquo;  That is not all that relevant because those eventualities can be catered for by way of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>People should not be expected to live in unfit housing conditions until such time as they have a worthwhile deposit and they should not be forced to live a life of misery by virtue of the size of their mortgage repayments.  It would be better to extend the mortgage repayment period by another ten years if necessary.  I am aware of all the arguments that can be made about increased costs and so on but I dismiss them.  It would be better to give people a good standard of housing at <Col N="1074" /> reasonable repayments than to penalise them by asking them to repay their mortgage in too short a time or doing without a house altogether.  Those options should be examined.  I know from my discussions with members of all parties on the local authority in my area that that is the general opinion and I ask the Minister to take it on board.  I am being constructive now but I will be critical later in relation to other matters.</P>
    <P>The income related loan scheme, also referred to in this Bill, is another area where there is some scope for improvement. Some people are not regarded as a good risk so far as lending agencies are concerned and they are the people local authorities must look after because of an arrangement by the Minister for the Environment in 1987.  He stated that in future the banks and the building societies would look after this category; that those with an income of £12,000 or more would be catered for by a different group without account being taken of the size of the family.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why a person with four, five or six children and earning £20,000 per year should not qualify for a loan under the heading referred to in the Bill.  The simple reason is that the disposable income is so much less compared to that of a household on an income of £12,000 &mdash; which is the limit at present &mdash; and one or two children.  The possibility of the person on an income of £20,000 with five children repaying is about equal to the person with one or two children on £12,000.  I can never understand why that has never been taken into consideration.  There is nothing in the Bill &mdash; and I have heard nothing in the debate &mdash; which would improve that.  That should be taken into account as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a moment at the proposals in the shared ownership scheme. Two people earning £6,000 each and one person earning £12,000 can qualify for virtually the maximum loan by most standards. A household with one income of £13,000 does not qualify.  I cannot understand the logic of that.  Let us assume that a husband and wife or boyfriend and <Col N="1075" /> girlfriend starting off to buy a house are both working.  There is no guarantee they will both be working in two or three years time.  If there are two or three children in the household the possibility is that only one person will be working thereby reducing the income of that household by 50 per cent.  They were assessed on the basis of two incomes, of £12,000 or thereabouts, and their ability to repay was judged on that basis.  Irrespective of the way one looks at the loan repayment scheme, even if the person received a rent subsidy and so on, it does not work. It defies logic.  That rule of thumb is applied to the two people who at one stage happened to have an income equal to the maximum qualifying limit, £12,000, and there is a good chance that one of those incomes will go in five years and that one person will be left to carry full responsibility on one income.  We are judging those people on the same basis as a couple where one income is £12,000. If that income was £13,000 it would be regarded as too high to qualify for the maximum loan.  We are expecting the person who is on too low an income to carry the same loan.  That is not just my opinion, it is the opinion of all members of every local authority to whom I have spoken on the matter.  I ask the Minister to have regard to those aspects of the scheme either on Committee Stage or when making the regulations.  It would be better if, on Committee Stage we went into more detail on this and help the people I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The next matter I should like to refer to briefly is the jargon we get when we talk about lending to people in this income category at local authority level. Local authorities maintain that they have a dual function, the first of which is under the housing Acts to provide houses by various means, either by building houses or by providing loans for people to enable them buy their houses.</P>
    <P>The present situation flies in the face of the Government's responsibilities under the various Acts because they have not lived up to any of them.  If the Government are not going to allocate money to <Col N="1076" /> the local authorities to build houses, will they consider revamping the loans system to allow people to buy their houses?</P>
    <P>I know that provision is now being made for the refurbishment of local authority houses, and I welcome it, but the number of housing units likely to benefit is nil because there is no money.  It is just a policy on paper to improve local authority houses because there is no money to do it.  In County Kildare we will take on five or six houses under that heading this year if we are lucky.  The maximum we decided on last year was ten but we have not yet dealt with all of them; we should refurbish at least 40 of these houses each year for the next five years.  However, we have no chance of doing that because there is no money. Everything in this Bill comes down to money and whether it is the old fashioned green pound or the round coin, the lack of money is the one thing that is spectacular about it.</P>
    <P>I see no reason that a loan could not be made to a family in a local authority house that needs refurbishing or extending to enable them to improve their house, and the repayments of such loan could be added to their existing rent or repayments.  It would cost £40,000 or more to provide a new house but accommodation could be extended or refurbished for much less than that and that would be a reasonable way to do it.  There is provision in the Bill but I am not sure that it goes as far as I would like.</P>

      <P>I am acknowledging something, and I had to root very carefully through the Bill to find something that I could acknowledge.  The proposal is there but it does not go as far as I would like.  Let me give an example from a few years ago of a household which was badly over-crowded.  The incoming Government had abolished all grants so there was nothing the people concerned could do except find the means to raise a loan. The local authority had no money to give them, was not in a position to build <Col N="1077" /> another house for them or to extend the existing house because it came under a tenant purchase scheme.  After a lot of soul searching we managed to get a secured loan which required a guarantor, and this was added to the existing tenant purchase scheme loan.  It worked out very well but it should not have been necessary for that person to get a guarantor at all because the local authority was already in possession of the title to the property. I give that example to keep the Minister and everyone else aware of how the local authorities operate the system.  There are few facets of lending through the local authority system that we are not aware of; there are very few angles we have not thought of and very few problems will arise in the future that have not arisen in the past.  Colleagues on all sides will recognise our common interest in trying to do something about this.  That is one area I would like the Minister to look at and to make more liberal provisions than are in the Bill.  It should not raise any problems.</P>
      <P>There is a vast number of unserviced houses, some in rural areas and some in urban areas.  In some the services have become deficient and need renewal and in others no bathroom or toilet was ever provided.  Often the people in such houses are unemployed or elderly.  The local authority should be able to do something about these houses and add the cost to the rent.  The Minister may say that that is covered in the Bill, that I did not read the Bill.  I did read the Bill but I cannot find what I am looking for.  I see a watered down version of what I am looking for because again the magic words &ldquo;subject to the availability of moneys&rdquo; appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Kildare we tried to implement what we thought was a reasonable element in a forthcoming scheme, and again we ran into trouble because there is a limit to the number of schemes we can initiate in any one year; the limit in County Kildare in the current year will be about ten or 11.  I see no reason for postponing such work for three or four years or scaling it out over a period of years.  Would it not be far <Col N="1078" /> better and much more inexpensive to do the work in one year and not prolong people's misery?  All that is happening is that we wait for three or four years but the waiting is only to facilitate the availability of money and nothing else.  There are about 30,000 of those houses throughout the country and it would be far better to tackle them all in the next year or year and a half and then we would have solved our problem.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to use his influence with the Minister for Finance to get him to recognise the problem and resolve it.  All we are doing is prolonging it, dragging it out for a few more years when it will probably cost 25 or 30 per cent more than it would now.  There is no gain there for anybody, and certainly no gain for the Government.</P>
    <P>There are so many things one can say about housing that one does not know where to start.  There are others who are ready and anxious to speak, so this is probably not the time to go through them.  I and my colleagues have no other way to give voice to our frustration in this area other than under this system of debate on a Bill.  I hope all the Ministers in Cabinet will have due regard to the anxiety, frustration and dismay that we have suffered over the last couple of years.  Whatever else the people on that side of the House want to complain about, talk about, boast about, let nobody over there ever again tell me about housing in this country.  As far as they are concerned, there is no necessity for housing; they have forgotten all about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jacob referred to the sale of the century.  I agree that it was a great idea.  While I agree it was a great idea, the same purpose could have been achieved and more money could have been made by the Department, which could have been put to good use by providing housing for those who need it, if more thought had been put into it.  Let us take as an example a £22,000 house which was sold for £10,000.  What happened to most of these houses?  In 1988 house prices began to rise and a number <Col N="1079" /> of these houses were sold at profits of between £8,000 and £10,000 within six to ten months of buying them from the local authorities.  The people concerned would have been fools not to take advantage of this because a benign Government very conveniently and charitably introduced a Bill which enabled them to make a considerable profit.  As a result they sold their houses and bought others.</P>
    <P>It can be stated in a roundabout way that they generated a need for housing in other areas and that the construction industry benefited as a result, but the fact remains that a considerable number of people sold their houses, within the law, at a huge profit.  Therefore, it did not amount to the sale of the century after all.  All that happened is that those who had houses improved their position while no regard was had to those in need of housing.  That is where the problem lies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jacob said that 800 houses are needed in County Wicklow but we could do with 1,000 houses in County Kildare. Fifteen houses are due to be allocated in Newbridge during the next few weeks for which there are 300 applicants.  I am aware that politicians are supposed to have unusual powers when it comes to allocating housing, but they will need great powers of persuasion when they inform those people that their applications have been unsuccessful.  This problem arose in every scheme in recent years and as a result at least 1,000 families in the county urgently need to be rehoused.  It saddens me that there is very little I can say to them when I meet them at my clinics.  There was a time when I could say that if they put their names down for a house they may get something within the next six to 18 months but during the past four years only 25 houses have been provided each year.  What chance has the 1,000th person on the list got?  The answer is none.  Therefore this is proof that there was no &ldquo;sale of the century&rdquo;.  While it may have carried a sales buzz for some, it did not carry it for those who had no houses, and they are the people about whom we should be concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> I have already mentioned houses which are not serviced, and I hope the financial limits imposed on the local authorities with regard to the refurbishment of existing houses will be lifted.  The theory in Departments is that if one spends £10 million this year, one will pay the same amount next year.  While one may spend the same amount next year, it will not be spent on the same houses, therefore the money would not be wasted as we would be improving the quality of life for a different group of people.  As I said, it appears that there are no votes to be gained in this area at present.</P>
    <P>Isolated cottages, or rural cottages as they are known, are almost as scarce as snow in July.  I recall a time when it was relatively easy to build an isolated or rural cottage but it is now almost impossible. According to Deputy Jacob, only two were built in County Wicklow last year.  We did slightly better in County Kildare; we built three and we may even manage to build two this year.  This will not make a big impression on the 1,000 familes on the housing list.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Deputy Jacob had to say and I agree with him, the only people who want to crush people into local authority housing estates and multistorey blocks are the economists, those who control money and Government Departments, but the psychologists and sociologists want people to have space and room to breathe.  However, they are not involved in the planning process and do not count; they only count when the social problems arise as a result of bad planning and people have to live in boxes.</P>
    <P>The planners have influence in this area.  According to them there should be no houses in rural areas; everybody should live in what they call settlements. There are ample examples in many other countries with beautiful housing which enhance the countryside, but for some unknown reason, our planners are in a whirl and no one can live in anything except what they call &ldquo;settlements&rdquo;. Someone told them when they were going to school that this was a good idea and that it was uneconomic to provide services in other circumstances but no <Col N="1081" /> one in rural areas has asked anyone to provide such services as footpaths or public lighting.</P>
    <P>The theory, which is embedded in the planning system, is that one cannot live in a rural area unless one gets a special dispensation.</P>

      <P>One needs to be gifted if one is to build in a rural area.  If the son or daughter of a person living in an isolated cottage want to build a cottage and continue to live in the area they will have a problem.  They will be told they have to live in an estate of 150 to 160 houses in the nearest town despite the fact that they have lived all their lives in a rural area.  They do not want to live in an urban settlement nor do they want facilities such as footpaths, public lighting and buses passing their door every five minutes.  All they want is to live quietly but sadly we will not let them do this. Perhaps the Minister will use his influence in both the housing and planning areas.  This would be much appreciated by many people who find themselves in this position.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned already that money seems to be the problem.  I say this because in recent times the Minister emphasised that there are other ways open to us to house people, for example, voluntary housing.  To my mind, this amounts to an attempt on the part of the Government and the Minister to achieve housing targets on the cheap and to devolve responsibility to some other group.  He is saying that under this Bill authority may be devolved to them to provide housing and that they may become a housing authority, but the only people with responsibility are the Government and the Minister.  The Minister should not try to get away from his responsibilities in this area, but for some unknow reason, he is slinking away quietly out the side door and attempting to hive off this responsibility to unfortunate agencies which are willing to take it on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are unfortunate in the sense that they are expected to resolve the housing problems to which I have referred.  The Government have failed to do this and the unfortunate agencies are being given responsibilities they were never intended to have and which the Government should have taken on board, but have failed to do so.</P>
      <P>Let me give another example.  I believe the voluntary agencies have a major and useful role to play which complements the role played by the local authorities and the Department of the Environment. In this case they are being given the central role and told to provide housing because the Government have failed to do so.  The Government are also telling them that they can avail of certain funds from the EC and other sources and grants from central government if they set up as a housing agency or authority.  Why not give those funds to the local authorities who were given responsibility for providing housing?  Members of local authorities will tell you that, over the last couple of years, the only reason they go to meetings concerning housing is to complain about the lack of it.  It is a sad indictment of our housing policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make a brief reference to custom built houses.  We have all had experience recently of having to house people who, for one reason or another, do not have a home.  This could be as a result of a family quarrel, marital breakdown, damage to their home or the fact that they were in a rented house which they had to leave.  Many factors govern homelessness.  We have very little to offer them in that situation, we cannot even rent a house for them; the health board and the local authority are supposed to be able to provide bed and breakfast for these people.  However, a circular has been sent from the Minister for the Environment saying that bed and breakfast should not be provided for more than one or two nights; if it goes beyond one or two nights special factors must be taken into consideration.  The problem <Col N="1083" /> then arises as to whether the health board will pick up the tab.  In certain situations the health board are empowered to do so, but the system is so badly administered at present that, by the time the unfortunate person who is good enough to rent a house or to provide bed and breakfast is paid, they vow they will never provide the same facility again.  If the Minister does not believe me, he should check the facts.</P>
    <P>There should be a small number of flats in each settlement, town or village, not a big conglomerate, but a small number so that homeless people of one category or another could be housed for a short time. Of course, the problem with that is you need a housing plan afterwards because it is not enough to merely house them in an emergency.  There is no plan to deal with them thereafter.  I suppose what I am saying is irrelevant in the sense that if you do not have a long term plan, a short term plan is not much use.  It would be beneficial to have emergency accommodation built by the local authority and available in various places so that we do not have to send people to hostels.  I know hostels do a good job but people, particularly from rural areas, who have never been in that situation find it is a huge shock to their system and leaves them very disillusioned, particularly if they have been on the homeless circuit for a while.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with cases in my constituency where people had been sleeping rough for part of the time and who had been in hostels but who had never been housed, although they have families. They had great difficulty in getting bed and breakfast and greater difficulty in getting a private rented dwelling.  Incidentally, we have to depend on the goodwill of landlords to provide rented accommodation to people in that category because the landlord never knows how long the house will be retained or whether it will be possible to get vacant possession.  Generally speaking, people do not want to provide rented accommodation, even when the health board are prepared to pay the rent.  It is much <Col N="1084" /> easier to rent the house to a person who has a reasonably good job.</P>
    <P>Rent books are a good idea although they do not apply to my constituency because we do not have a problem of substandard housing.  Rented accommodation available to us is high quality, new housing, which is available at a premium price.  However, as I said, it is virtually impossible to acquire a house for renting to a person who is homeless. The Minister should examine this question to see if any improvements can be made.  Deputy Jacob said that local authorities are bound by law to house people; they are not and they do not.  They cannot provide housing because they do not have any money and that is why they have to send people to a series of hostels or provide one or two nights' bed and breakfast. They are chased from pillar to post for weeks, which is incredible.  I have seen pregnant wives, perhaps with two small children, being forced on that circuit on more than one occasion; it is a sad indictment of the present administration.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for going on so long but it reflects the frustration which I and others have felt in regard to this problem.  Every time I see a letter the word &ldquo;money&rdquo; is written on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>For some unknown reason, money raises its ugly head again and again.  Of course no money has been provided and the Members of this House who are also members of the local authorities know that.  The provision of housing has been neglected for the last four years; the Government parties may quibble about that but it is a fact.  If the present policy continues for another two years I do not know what will happen. Indeed, I hate to think of what will happen because the serious situation which already exists will be further exacerbated.  Somebody, sometime, somewhere, will have to provide houses for the people who do not have them. These people will not disappear, they cannot emigrate.  We can set up as many <Col N="1085" /> FÁS schemes as we like in Germany, Holland or France but the people will still not go away.  It is very irritating for members of local authorities to receive a circular signed by the Minister &mdash; or by someone on his behalf, but certainly approved by him &mdash; to the effect that there is a limit to the number of loans that may be approved this year and to the number of houses and reconstruction cases.  This policy hampers members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>A short time ago the Minister for the Environment referred to local authorities as development corporations.  Developing what?  They are unable to perform their function of developing housing and improving the environment, simply because they do not have the wherewithal that word &ldquo;money&rdquo; raises its head yet again.</P>
      <P>Knowing that there are other Members who wish to speak, I shall not go through several other items I had taken note of. The Minister sitting opposite may feel that I was haranguing the Government and if I were sitting in his place I might feel that the Government were being harangued. But after the Government's performance in the past four years in the area of housing, I think they are being criticised justifiably. As a public representative, I would not be doing my duty if I did not bring to the Minister's attention all of the items I have raised in the past few minutes.  I hope that the Minister, his colleagues in Government and his departmental officials take on board at least some of the points I have raised.  If any Government member wants advice from this side of the House I am sure that we would all be willing to give it to them. There must be a force of people from the benches on my right hand side and from the Government back benches who have ample experience of all of the items I have talked about and who are more than willing to give the Government advice.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make is that one does not solve a housing problem by neglecting or avoiding it.  The problem will not go away.  One either tackles a housing problem head on or one prolongs it, which costs a lot more.</P>

      <P>Three major housing decisions were taken during the term in Government of Deputy Durkan's party. The Deputy referred to and accepted that the HFA loan system was not ideal.  It is to be hoped that this new legislation will be a major step towards making loan finance more equitable and more easily repaid by people in the category that benefited and took advantage of the HFA loan scheme.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;cheapie&rdquo; scheme introduced by the former Government which provided a £5,000 cheque towards the cost of building a new house had the effect &mdash; in my own constituency more than most &mdash; of turning large areas into ghettoes.  That scheme creamed off all of the community leaders in satellite towns and had a negative result.  In theory, this scheme of Deputy Garret FitzGerald, the former Taoiseach, was novel.  The economically simplistic scheme provided that for a cheque of £5,000 a local authority house could be repossessed and allocated to another family on the housing list.  In practice, the scheme was not very desirable.</P>
      <P>The final housing scheme, which left the former Minister's successor with a hefty bill, was the house repair grant scheme.  I recall that the scheme cost over £100 million and took a long time to repay.  It created an amazing muddle and mess.  People took on and carried out unnecessary work.  Limited resources were not directed at the right quarter. Those three policies are there for constructive criticism in hindsight.</P>
      <P>The Bill is most desirable and progressive and has a lot of potential. Because of the constituency I represent, I have probably seen more local authority houses constructed in my time in the House than have many other Deputies put together.  When I rattle off the figure of 6,500 to 8,000 local authority houses constructed in my constituency in the past ten to 15 years, people have some idea of the magnitude for my area of the issue of housing, and particularly local authority housing; the future housing policy; the mistakes made in the past; and the potential for improvement in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> The Bill sets out, with that background and with the wealth of knowledge in the Department of the Environment, through information provided by local authorities, to make a major policy shift in the direction of competitively costed housing, the social housing programme referred to by the policy itself.</P>
    <P>The overall strategy aims at &ldquo;mitigating as far as possible the extent and effect of social segregation in housing&rdquo;&mdash; a most worthy and noble objective.  I wonder how that concept can be made to work in my constituency.  There is at present quite an imbalance, so the intention is praiseworthy.  In north Clondalkin, for instance, there are 5,000 local authority houses in one great cluster, making up three parishes.  That development is predominantly local authority owned and it slides down the slippery slope of unfinished dwellings, badly maintained houses and many other difficulties.</P>
    <P>I genuinely feel that much of the intent of the Bill will have to be given body and there will have to be real hands-on management from the Department of the Environment to local authorities which have within their boundaries some of the large urban areas.  I have already said that I represent some of those areas; the Minister of State, who is from the Cork North-Central constituency, probably represents an area with a substantial cluster of local authority housing; as would you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in your own constituency.  Deputy Allen and Deputy Ferris could well place a different emphasis on housing policy.  Whether housing problems relate to tens, twenties or thousands of dwellings, it is probably the same specific difficulties that need attention.</P>
    <P>During the Minister's speech he talked about participation by local authority tenants in the running of their estates. That is a welcome move.  I hope effect can be given to that objective because there is a real possibility for achievement in that direction.  I should like the Minister and his officials to use their good offices to try to have major problems that <Col N="1088" /> come into that category tackled and dealt with throughout County Dublin.  The areas of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown have very substantial Dublin Corporation housing schemes within the county.  At the last count, based on dragging information from management at City Hall a couple of years ago, it was found that the grand total of £6 million of outstanding works in Dublin County Council area was directly attributable to a sister local authority, Dublin Corporation.  That £6 million workload was never completed by the biggest house building operation in this country, Dublin Corporation.  Dublin Corporation say that they constructed the houses &mdash; correctly so &mdash; out of the housing capital programme of the Department of the Environment.  Having completed the housing estates, the corporation abandoned their responsibilities and have left the estates of my constituents in a sorry and unacceptable state.  Some of those estates are ten, 12 or 15 years old but have not yet been taken in charge because of bureaucratic red-tape wrangling between officialdom in City Hall and county halls throughout Dublin.  The participation of local authority tenants in running their own estates would be a laudable aim if houses were actually completed and handed over in a community spirit to local tenants so that they, in co-operation with local authorities, could make sure that their estates were looked after.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill there is the possibility of resolving this situation.  A resolution is long overdue.  Action should be taken before the Bill is enacted on some of those areas where the Minister is specifying that local authority housing is the responsibility of the local authority. The duplication of responsibility between the city and the county in County Dublin is ridiculous and it costs a lot of money. Some official in the Department and management at local authority level are responsible for taking action on this matter.  It should have been resolved long ago.  I cannot understand the continual bleating about large bills for repairs when those responsible at managerial level <Col N="1089" /> have done so little over the years to resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>Did anyone in the Department ever conclude that there are many local authority rent paying tenants who do not use the system at all for repairs and that there are others who never stop looking for repairs?  Would it not be ingenious to give tenants who look after local authority housing stock some recognition for their efforts perhaps by way of rent remission for a month after a five yearly inspection, and to penalise those who are always looking for repairs with an enhanced rent?  There is a substantial bill involved here.  Many people are not contributing to it and some are contributing far too much.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that local authority housing stock consisted of 96,000 homes, that it was a valuble asset with a replacement value well over £3 billion. The Minister also talked about securitization giving the impression that there is an intention to dispose of some of the local authority rent roll to some of the financial institutions, to building societies and so on, so that it might release a large amount of capital.  That might go some of the way towards addressing the lengthy contribution to the House this afternoon by Deputy Durkan.  Obviously there is a capital bill to be paid based on the fact that the £3 billion of housing stock has a running outstanding debt.  If substantial moneys can be raised, in this way under the new legislation, the debt will have to be repaid and we hope surplus funds will be available. There is a suggestion, apparently, in the explanatory memorandum, which I do not have, as to how that money could be used.  However it is a welcome potential aspect of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>With regard to social segregation in housing it is hard to know how this will work in County Dublin.  The Dublin local authorities have something in the region of 20 thousand housing sites.  They are a major capital asset but nothing is being done with them.  How one can tackle the Dublin housing list and get the combination of social integration hoped for, <Col N="1090" /> is difficult to envisage.  I do not know how one can get that mix in any large number of housing units provided by the local authority.  It is a major anomaly that under the legislation the private sector cannot benefit from construction.  The Minister might consider on Committee Stage, allowing for private sector, credible, medium priced housing contractors under the auspices of the CIF to be brought into negotiations with the Dublin housing authorities with a view to providing them, for instance, with 100 sites provided they give back to the local authority the keys of 20 units.  A ratio could be worked out depending on the value of the site, the value of the house to be constructed, the selling price and the potential profit.  Arising from the profit made by the contractor fairly competitively priced houses could be sold.  In selling houses, market forces take over and dictate strongly against the social mix we would like to see.  In my own constituency, for instance, there is need for walls between estates but the problem is that there is no co-ordination between local authority housing and private housing. This arises because of a small but vocal segment of the community who create problems.  I do not know how we will create a social mix unless at the outset we accept that out of 100 units, 80 will be on the market and 20 will be available to the housing authority.</P>
    <P>There are major sites, involving millions of pounds by way of investment in drainage, roads and public lighting and all these other facilities, on the perimeter of Dublin; there are parks in my own constituency, on the outskirts of Lucan and Clondalkin, and vast spreads of local authority sites which are covered in weeds while young couples are on the housing list.  This land asset needs to be considered to see how it can be best utilised but I find it difficult to see how it can be utilised properly, particularly in County Dublin, under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The new county council structure in County Dublin should be given total responsibility within their boundaries for the existing local authority housing and for rent collecting.  City Hall do not want <Col N="1091" /> to give up these new housing units in the county because they require the least cost in terms of maintenance and are an excellent revenue gatherer.  City Hall gets a good deal of revenue from Tallaght, Clondalkin and west Blanchardstown. They do not want to transfer that housing stock out to Dublin South County Council. They want to hold on to the sites and sell them off in the normal market orientated way and get the maximum resources into their coffers.  I could not criticise the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who held the distinguished office of Lord Mayor, for wanting to maximise the resources to the local authority he had the honour of representing and having whatever resources arose from the county used for some of the excellent work that has been done throughout the city.</P>
    <P>The county pressures and problems have become so great that there is need for a hands on solution to the extent that north Clondalkin, the area to which I refer, has become the focal point of the study of the first task force on urban areas because of the difficulties that have arisen there.  For example, there is the breakdown in law and order in respect of which the Minister for Justice established a task force to deal with large urban areas, on which group the Minister and his Department are represented.  I look forward to their report.  It would be my hope that that report would clearly identify the isolation which the vast bulk of the population out there feel, having been historically city dwellers, rehoused in the county and then left to their own devices. There are the inadequate road networks to Ballyfermot and Clondalkin, no lighting on the Fonthill Road and so on; all these inadequacies are symptomatic of the lack of completion of a major local authority housing programme.  If these matters are not properly tackled by Dublin Corporation, the new county councils and the Department of the Environment, then 5,000 or 6,000 housing units &mdash; making up that £3 billion worth of assets &mdash; will rapidly deteriorate in value.  There is need for a major shift <Col N="1092" /> in housing strategy <i>vis-à-vis</i> local authorities, driven by the Department of the Environment, to tidy up these loose ends.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the need for local authority housing in County Dublin, there is need also for the introduction of a new tenant purchase scheme.  I do not know why the Minister had this to say in the course of his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>While I have no immediate plans to introduce a new tenant purchase scheme, I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why I must tell my constituents &mdash; and a number of them have inquired &mdash; they cannot purchase their own homes but must continue to pay rent.  Since there is no scheme under which they can do so.  This begs the question: why is there not, an on-going tenant purchase scheme?  Why have a sale of the century and then drop it?  Is it because of the volume of paper work involved in administering the scheme? What is the reason for not selling people their local authority homes when they wish to purchase them, rather than continue to draw on their relevant authorities for repairs and maintenance?  I thought the Government wanted to get rid of those costs.  If so, why not sell these people their homes and thereafter allow them maintain them?</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan reverted continuously to the need for money, money and more money.  In that respect he is correct; in the end it is all to do with money.  Unfortunately, he did not say whether he was in favour of higher taxation, increased borrowing or cutbacks in other areas to provide such housing.  We could all solve the problem if there were a bottomless pit of funding available, which is not the case.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions in this Bill there is the possibility of other forms of finance being raised from the existing local authority housing stock that would go a long way towards tackling some of the ever increasing housing waiting lists.  I hope there will be a major attempt made to tidy up these loose ends in addition to <Col N="1093" /> ensuring that this new scheme be properly implemented.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin there has been a less then dynamic approach on the part of officialdom, managerial staff, to implement this programme.  I know that the former Minister, Deputy Flynn, met senior local authority officials in his Department in an endeavour to crack the whip and get some action.  I contend they are handling the overall scheme as if it were a commercial, profit-related, increasing asset rather than a public asset which should be used to maximum advantage by way of Government policy for those who stand to benefit most.  We have had many examples in County Dublin where local authorities have sold off sites at premium prices with a view to yielding the maximum for their coffers, of providing housing at say £50,000 and £60,000, sold in the private sector, as has happened in my constituency.  That does not help the people who cannot afford that type of house.  All over that area there are millions of pounds being invested in such sites lying idle.</P>
    <P>I hope some dynamic action will be taken from departmental level downwards in those local authority areas.  With a little ingenuity some intelligent disposal, and hands on management, in co-operation with the private sector, there could be constructed competitively priced private housing units at, say, £40,000 to £45,000, in addition to a percentage of local authority units.  Rather than any such action, what I have witnessed in my constituency is the disposal of a local authority land bank &mdash; I do not know where the proceeds go; there are very handsome profits made that are not reinvested in the immediate area or local authority housing &mdash; into some type of capital repayment fund.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the overall thrust of this Bill.  It would be my hope that on Committee Stage we will tease out some of the anomalies uniquely applicable to my constituency, occasioned by the pressures, numbers and vastness of the problems obtaining there. These problems are quite different from those of other Members' experiences <i>vis-à-vis</i><Col N="1094" /> rural cottages compared with those encountered in large urban areas and their rapidly increasing numbers on the housing waiting lists.</P>
    <P>There are now a number of categories of people appearing on housing waiting lists.  One such group are single parents and the question arises whether they should be allocated a two or three bedroom unit.  This causes other problems. There is also the question of accommodation for old folk.  Could such accommodation not be provided in combination with the disposal of the enormous asset to be found within the private sector?  I would urge speedy implementation of the aspects of the Bill that will ensure that local authorities will be responsible for everything within their respective jurisdictions. That may well mean that in the future Dublin Corporation will have to have access to housing units in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>I contend there should be a computerised, central Dublin housing list. There is enormous potential within the boundaries of Dublin city for extra housing units, but nothing like the numbers that will be required over the next decade.  That is why there are approximately 8,000 Dublin Corporation houses in County Dublin, the city being unable to accommodate that volume of housing. The same is the case in Tallaght where there are between, say, 5,000 and 10,000 local authority housing units.  There is need for co-ordination of the overall Dublin housing scene, rendering Dublin south, Dublin Fingal and Dún Laoghaire Corporation autonomous local authorities. If there is some overlap of the housing lists' allocation it should be appropriately streamlined.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House, its provisions are excellent, and I hope some of the points I have raised will be answered by the Minister when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been heralded by the Government, Government representatives, Members of the Oireachtas and councillors since first mooted by the then Minister for the Environment in February 1991; this continued right <Col N="1095" /> through to the publication of the document &ldquo;Housing Choice&rdquo; which itemised several new options under what was termed by the Department of the Environment as the plan for social housing.  All of us looked forward to the publication of the Bill itself so that we could, where necessary, criticise its provisions and be complimentary where it was deserved. Some of its sections are innovative and will be commended by many of us who are members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>For example, there are sections dealing with such basic requirements as minimum notice to quit, the provision of rent books, the standards required of rented houses in the private sector, the prohibition on distress for rent of dwelling, registration of rented houses, to name but a few.  Many of us, some of my colleagues in the Labour Party but particularly Councillor Eithne FitzGerald, lobbied Ministers of successive Governments for these basic minimum requirements in the private sector to match the demand obtaining for local authority housing not being addressed by the Minister or the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the publication of the document on housing options, we hoped this Bill would contain provisions to deal with the housing problem.  Members of local authorities &mdash; I am a member of two local authorities &mdash; have responsibility for rehousing people in need who have met all the basic criteria.  Unfortunately, I see very little in this Bill which addresses that problem.  If additional funding is not provided to local authorities there is no way they can address what is becoming a housing crisis.  I do not think anyone would want to revert to the days of previous housing crisis.  It cost successive Governments of different hues large amounts of money to deal with housing crises.  People may have needed houses but Governments did not respond adequately.  Every Deputy who has contributed to the debate &mdash; Fianna Fáil backbenchers, Fine Gael front benchers and backbenchers and the Labour spokesperson who represent both city <Col N="1096" /> and urban areas &mdash; have outlined the position in their constituencies.  They have been given the true picture in regard to the housing crisis by local authority housing officers who have to answer to public representatives as to why so many people are on housing lists.  We are doing very little to help those people.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the reason for this problem.  Towards the end of last year I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister seeking information on the number of local authority houses built in the previous three years and asking him to make a statement on the matter.  The Minister replied that the number of units of accommodation added to the local authority housing stock in the previous three years was: 1,450 houses in 1988; 768 houses in 1989 and 1,003 houses in 1990.  He went on to say that the number of houses expected to be built last year was 1,300.  Members of this House and the Seanad, of local authorities, corporations, urban councils and county councils only have to look at the record of the previous Coalition Government, of which the Labour Party were a member, when 7,000 houses were built to realise just how bad the record of this Government and the previous Fianna Fáil minority Government is in this area.</P>
    <P>Under a previous Fianna Fáil Government local authorities were subjected to building low cost houses.  The then Minister responsible, Deputy Molloy, foisted the building of low cost houses on local authorities.  It has cost successive Governments, including this Government, millions of pounds to refurbish these low cost houses to make them fit for people to live in.  We are thankful that the Minister has given money to local authorities to carry out this very necessary work.  Unfortunately, thousands of low cost houses were built throughout the country.  I do not see anything in the legislation which will address this problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan did not want to refer to the need for money to rectify this problem.  However, money is needed to ensure that low cost houses are properly refurbished.  My local authority are very <Col N="1097" /> proud that they managed to refurbish many of those houses with Government assistance.  It is a shame that these houses were built; it would have been a disgrace if it had been decided to continue to build them as accommodation for families. Those houses had no fireplaces and the other basic necessities.  My local authority pressurised and embarrassed the Government into providing funds to refurbish low cost housing in Carronreddy, Woodview in Cahir, Castle-quarter in Killenaule and other areas. That Fianna Fáil Government were so concerned about the cost of housing people in need that they thought any type of house would do.  Thank God we have moved on from that.  We will never again allow any Government to foist houses of that description on any local authority.  I am glad the Government have given a commitment that this will not happen again.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless this does not solve the problems in Kilkenny, Dublin and other areas.  While these houses are being refurbished the occupants have to be housed elsewhere.  This means that housing applicants are held on waiting lists pending the refurbishment of these houses and this has resulted in long waiting lists in all local authority areas.  Two weeks ago the local authority in my area confirmed that there are approximately 270 applicants on the housing waiting list. Under the allocation given to them the county council will be able to build 25 houses only, less than 10 per cent of the requirement.  This means that 90 per cent of people in need of houses will not get them.  Unless the Government give a commitment, it will take another ten years before we can provide houses for those people on the waiting list.  This is scandalous.  No Minister, regardless of what constituency he represents, should be allowed to introduce a Bill which purports to address the housing crisis but which does not do so.</P>
    <P>When there is a housing crisis, action groups are set up to ask members of local authorities to address the problem.  When they are unable to do so other people take control of the groups and use them <Col N="1098" /> to create trouble.  They send deputations to local authorities and Deputies' and Minister's houses and clinics.  We are creating a climate which will enable these people, between now and the next general election, to harp on about the failure of the Government to provide funding for housing.  In this regard, I wish to thank the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, for visiting Tipperary to talk to the representatives of Tipperary South Riding County Council, Tipperary Urban District Council and Clonmel Corporation, all of whom have long housing waiting lists.  The Minister had to admit he could only offer funding for 25 houses.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I will deal with the inadequacies of this legislation, its inability to deal with the housing crisis and the way it will embarrass local authorities who are unable to meet the demands made on them.  People are not elected to local authorities to make excuses and renege on their responsibilities, including their responsibility to provide housing.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the parliamentary Labour Party I commend the Bill to the House. In the final analysis, the debate on it is about trust.  To be specific, it is about whether we should trust the Coalition Government to ensure that the rights of pregnant women and girls to travel abroad and obtain any and all information they need about their pregnancy will be fully protected once the Treaty on European Union is accepted, if it is, in the referendum on 18 June.  A great many people, many of whom are still considering <Col N="1099" /> the issues and have yet to make up their minds, want to know the answer to that simple question before they decide how to cast their vote in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Those people are asking themselves the following questions.  Can the people of Ireland trust a Government that sent a senior counsel into the Supreme Court to tell that court that if an English citizen came to Ireland and found herself pregnant and if it became known to the Irish Attorney General that she intended to go home to England for an abortion he would have no choice but to seek to prevent her doing so?  Can they trust a Government who promised to deal with the issue of travel and information by amending the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and, when they failed to secure an agreement on that, refused to consider ways and means of either deleting or unilaterally renouncing that Protocol? Can they trust a Government who held up a so-called solemn declaration as having all the force of European law &mdash; I was on a radio programme one morning when the Minister for Foreign Affairs made the utterance that the solemn declaration had all the force of European law?  Only this week the European Commission's legal services explicitly stated in the course of a dispute with the British Government that, &ldquo;a Declaration can never deprive an Article in the Treaty of its practical effectiveness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the question to which people need an answer, one that has not been forthcoming, is, why was the Protocol inserted in the first place, who was it meant to appease and what was it meant to protect?  All we know is that the Protocol was inserted in stealth at a meeting of Foreign Ministers towards the end of November last year.  We were never told in this House or elsewhere that it was to be inserted or what is was meant to do. All efforts, since it came to light, to elucidate on that question have come to nought.  For example, in the X case in the Supreme Court counsel for the family repeatedly asked that all documentation <Col N="1100" /> relating to the Protocol be produced.  On the third day of the hearing counsel for the State disclosed that there had been no written representations to any other state in relation to the Protocol and, as far he was aware, no oral representations were made either.</P>
    <P>How did the Protocol come about? Where did it come from?  What magic wand was waved to produce this Protocol which has caused so much damage?  The only clue we can find is an annotation in the Common Market Law Report of 7 January of this year.  This annotation, which does not have the force of law, was prepared and inserted a month before the X case even arose.  It makes it clear that it was the intention of the Irish Government, and the understanding of other member states, that the Protocol was intended &ldquo;to ensure that no further challenges should be brought to the European Court of Justice against the anti-abortion provision in Article 40.3.3º of the Irish Constitution&rdquo;.  The significance of this lies in the fact that the European Court of Justice, in the so-called Grogan case, left open the possibility that a ban on information could be overturned in a future case.  In other words, the Protocol was intended to at least copperfasten the ban on information.</P>
    <P>At the time the Protocol was designed and negotiated nobody anticipated that the circumstances which gave rise to the X case would result in an injunction being sought.  However, there is no reason to believe that the Government would have been deterred from proceeding with the insertion of the Protocol even if it had occurred to them that it would subsequently be interpreted to deprive Irish women of their explicit European right to travel freely between sovereign states in the European Community, and to deprive them of that right without recourse to appeal to the European courts.  That Protocol was designed and added to the Treaty because it was politically expedient for the previous Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs to enter into a secret understanding with <Col N="1101" /> some powerful elements in the so-called pro-life movement.</P>
    <P>It has been said again and again by the Government, and others, that the Maastricht Treaty and the Protocol involve no risk to rights of travel and information.  That is the contention they have repeated on the national airwaves since this controversy arose, but that is demonstrably and patently untrue. Unless the Government act to copperfasten these rights, if they believe them to be important, the Protocol will present a serious risk to them, and there is no denying that basic fact.  At this stage the only clear and safe way to copperfasten those basic rights is to write them into Irish constitutional law.  We should be under no misunderstanding about this. This is not something that Europe has inflicted upon us.  Neither is it something that arises from any potential obligations we may have as a member of the soon-to-be European union.  The effect of the Protocol may well be to prevent the European institutions protecting the rights of Irish women.  The Protocol deprives the European Court of jurisdiction in any dispute about these basic rights.  In that sense, the Protocol is profoundly anti-Europe.</P>
    <P>No Government who are willing to stand over that Protocol and refuse to take the options available to them in the course of the debate on this constitutional amendment can describe themselves as a Government who are committed to the notion of European citizenship.  There is an element of total hypocrisy in a Government seeking to affirm the benefits of the new integrated Europe or the establishment of European citizenship and at the same time seeking to obscure the fact that a large section of Irish citizens will enter Europe as second-class citizens and will remain so until these basic rights have been re-established.</P>
    <P>Most politicians and most members of the general public who watched the Progressive Democrats' annual conference in Waterford will have been impressed by the speech of the Leader of that party when he pledged himself and his party, in ringing tones and with great solemnity, <Col N="1102" /> to protecting the full rights of Irish citizens in Europe.  It is a pity that he and members of his party are not here to listen, if not to contribute, to this debate. At its conclusion the Progressive Democrats will be given the opportunity to stand up for those rights.  To use this Leader's famous phrase, they will be given the opportunity to stand by the Republic.  If they fail to do so they can never again argue that their first priority is the equality of every citizen.</P>
    <P>Before going into the details of this Bill it is necessary to set out in some detail an analysis of the general situation which has arisen subsequent to the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  Although we are dealing tonight with only some of the implications &mdash; the issues of travel and information &mdash; it is necessary not to forget the substantive issue to be dealt with.  I intend to address also the substantive issue of abortion.  We have made the most careful analysis we can as a political party of each of the individual judgments issued by the members of the Supreme Court.  Arising from that analysis we are clear that the Supreme Court has found the following:</P>
    <P>1.  Within the terms of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution abortions are lawful in certain circumstances, specifically in any situation where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>2.  Under the terms of our Constitution, in certain circumstances the right of a pregnant women to travel abroad can be curtailed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the first point, the permissibility of abortion, the key judgment is contained in the following quotations, the first of which is from the judgment of Mr. Justice Finlay.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, conclude that the proper test to be aplied is that if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of the pregnancy, that such termination is permissible, <Col N="1103" /> having regard to the true interpretation of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The second quotation is from the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty:</P>
    <P>Until legislation is enacted to provide otherwise, I believe that the law in this State is that surgical intervention which has the effect of terminating pregnancy bona fide undertaken to save the life of the mother where she is in danger of death is permissible under the Constitution and the law. The danger has to represent a substantial risk to her life though this does not necessarily have to be an imminent danger of instant death.</P>
    <P>The third quotation is from the judgment of Mr. Justice Egan:</P>
    <P>In my opinion the true test should be that a pregnancy may be terminated if its continuance as a matter of probability involves a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  The risk must be to her life...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fourth quotation is from the judgment of Mr. Justice McCarthy:</P>
    <P>. . . when there is real and substantial risk attached to her survival not merely at the time of application but in contemplation at least throughout the pregnancy, then it may not be practicable to vindicate the right to life of the unborn... This conclusion leads inevitably to the recognition that the wording of the Amendment contemplates abortion lawfully taking place within this State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second point, the right to travel, I want to put on the record the key passages from each of the Supreme Court judgments.  Mr. Justice Finlay stated:</P>
    <P>I would be forced to conclude that if there were a stark conflict between the right of a mother with an unborn child to travel and the right to life of the unborn child, the right to life would <Col N="1104" /> necessarily have to take precedence over the right to travel.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Egan stated:</P>
    <P>The right to travel can only effectively arise in reference to an intention to procure an unlawful abortion and must surely rank lower than the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Hederman stated:</P>
    <P>If that involves restraint upon the removal of the protected life from the jurisdiction it necessarily involves the restraint of the movement of the pregnant woman.  A restraint upon leaving the territory of the jurisdiction of the Courts would in the ordinary way be a restraint upon the exercise of the constitutional right to travel but the competing right is the preservation of life and of the two the preservation of life must be deemed to be paramount and to be sufficient to suspend for at least the period of gestation of the unborn life the right to travel.</P>
    <P>I wanted to put all those specific judgments on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The implications of the court's judgment in this matter are profound.  It can be argued that technically abortion is available in Ireland on an unregulated basis, subject to there being a genuine and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  If that position were to be maintained for any length of time, the theoretical risk to health and indeed the lives of women would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>At the same time, despite the provisions of the Constitution, it can be argued that in the absence of any regulation, there is no effective protection for the life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>In addition, the judgment clearly has profound implications for what has been seen up to now as a basic right, the right of free travel.  It can be argued that we now live in a State where the only pregnant woman who would be free to travel abroad in a completely unfettered way is one who is in imminent and visible danger to her life.  In the light of the judgments, and, of course, of the Protocol, the restoration of this right cannot be <Col N="1105" /> achieved merely by legislation.  Both of these implications can and must be addressed.  The Labour Party's view is that failure to do so would be an abject failure by the Legislature and the Executive.</P>
    <P>The Bill we have asked the House to consider deals only with the issues of travel and information, not because they are more important than the substantive issue of abortion itself &mdash; clearly, that is a crucially important issue as well &mdash; but only because the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty has made the issues of travel and information extremely urgent.</P>
    <P>We must, I believe, take a lead from what Mr. Justice McCarthy said in the Supreme Court in his judgment which was as follows:</P>
    <P>In the context of the eight years that have passed since the Amendment was adopted. . . the failure by the legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate; it is inexcusable.  What are pregnant women to do?  What are the parents of a pregnant girl under age to do?  What are the medical profession to do?  They have no guidelines save what may be gleaned from the judgments in this case.</P>
    <P>When we eventually come to consider the substantive issue of abortion, we will have to remember that the only guideline to be found in the court's judgments is the guideline of, &ldquo;a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother&rdquo;.  Nowhere in the judgments can we find any guideline as to who ought to assess this risk on an ongoing basis, as to any limits that ought to be placed on where operations might be carried out and in what conditions, or as to the maximum term of pregnancy within which a termination may be permitted.  These are issues which, if other options are ruled out, must be addressed by the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Among the options to be considered now, as we prepare to deal with the substantive issue of abortion, is that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution be deleted by referendum.  However, it is entirely probable that the deletion of <Col N="1106" /> the Eighth Amendment, in and of itself, would make not the slightest difference.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would point out the first sentence in the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty when he said, &ldquo;the enactment of Article 40.3.3º in 1983 did not I believe bring about any fundamental change in our law.&rdquo;  It is quite clear that the courts have taken the view, notwithstanding anything specific in the Constitution, that the right to life of the unborn must be protected not-withstanding anything that was done or purported to have been done in 1983.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, it would be possible to seek to replace Article 40.3.3º with an article which prohibited abortion in all circumstances in Ireland.  Such an amendment would be asserting that the mother's right to life was subordinate to that of her unborn child.  Even if it were acceptable to insert such an article in our Constitution &mdash; and I and a great many others would argue that it is entirely unacceptable &mdash; the reality is that such an amendment would be unlikely to change the view of the court expressed in this case, that a mother at serious risk to her life must be protected.  It would be in obvious and total conflict with the personal rights contained in Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In any event, as I said, any such proposal would be bitterly, and rightly, fought on the grounds that a complete ban on termination in every case would immediately give rise to extreme danger for women at medical risk through, for example, uterine cancer or ectopic pregnancy. It would be widely seen as an intensely hypocritical approach to a complex and painful problem.</P>
    <P>A third option would be to seek to amend the Constitution to set out therein a range of possible grounds on which terminations might be permitted. However, it would be clearly immensely difficult &mdash; in my view impossible &mdash; to list such grounds in so inclusive or comprehensive a way as not to leave any further room for doubt or ambiguity. Although a number of additional permutations and combinations are possible to imagine, I find it almost inconceivable <Col N="1107" /> that a formula can be developed, to be enshrined in the Constitution through a referendum, which would not be the subject of an intensely divisive campaign.</P>
    <P>I also believe, having carefully considered the judgments of the Supreme Court, that it would be virtually impossible to devise a formula for a new insertion in the Constitution which would pass the test that the court has devised &mdash; the probability of real and substantial risk to the life of the mother &mdash; any better than the existing formulation.  In those circumstances, it seems clear that we must sooner or later address the legislative changes that are necessary and constitutionally possible to give effect to the court's judgment.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has decided that there are certain circumstances in which abortions are permissible under our Constitution. For all the reasons outlined above, we must start from the point that there is no going back from that judgment.  We have in our Constitution, as a result of the Supreme Court decision an equality of rights between the unborn and the mother, except where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, where the mother's life must take precedence.  That is a position that will be supported by most reasonable people.</P>
    <P>We need new legislation to give clear guidelines on this matter.  Such legislation must, in addition to taking careful account of the judgments of the court, also deal with a number of factors, including independent psychological and medical procedures for assessing risk in any mother seeking the termination of a pregnancy; qualifications of the persons authorised to carry out the medical procedures involved in terminations; the maximum term within which terminations may be permitted and the degree to which information and counselling in respect of terminations will be made available.</P>
    <P>In addition, action now must take account of the views expressed by Mr. Justice McCarthy in his judgment.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative, in prohibiting absolutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests: positive by requiring positive action.  The State may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the need to establish a whole new, and adequately resourced, counselling agency to deal with all of the implications of this situation.</P>
    <P>To return to the main issue before us tonight, I want to refer for a moment to the position that would arise if the Maastricht Protocol was deleted.  While clearly, its deletion would be preferable to the present situation, it should not be forgotten that the Supreme Court did not issue any judgment on the European law aspects of the issue of travel in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case.  Therefore, it is entirely arguable that if the Protocol was simply to cease to exist, the paramount legal view on this issue would then be that of Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court.  He is the only judge who has examined this issue as a matter of European law, as opposed to Irish constitutional law alone.  He has already found that under existing European law, it is permissible for the Irish State to restrict the right of travel to protect the right to life of the unborn. His judgment in the matter is not capable in the present circumstances of being appealed to Europe, since it has been overturned, on an interpretation of Irish law by the Supreme Court, although the Supreme Court took no account of European law aspects of the case.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, therefore, and for all the reasons I have argued, I believe that the only safe thing to do, in order to restore a fundamental right of travel which is now threatened in the case of every pregnant woman, is to amend our Constitution, and to do it now.  The Bill we have published and which is before the House tonight would have the effect of achieving that and would enable the citizen's rights involved to be extracted <Col N="1109" /> from the Maastricht Referendum and the Maastricht debate.  Our Bill is the only way that can be comprehensively achieved.  The effect of our Bill is to provide for the holding of a referendum to insert into the Constitution the rights to travel and information that have been put in doubt by the combination of the recent Supreme Court decision and the Maastricht Protocol.  If our amendment were adopted by the people the full test of Article 40.3.3º and a new Article 40.3.4º would read as follows:</P>
    <P>40.3.3º The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>4º Sub-section 3 of this section shall not be invoked to prohibit or interfere with the exercise of the right&mdash;</P>
    <P>i.to travel to and from the State for the purpose of receiving services lawfully available in other jurisdictions, or</P>
    <P>ii.  to obtain, within the State, information and counselling relating to such services.</P>
    <P>The provision of such information and counselling may be regulated by law.</P>
    <P>The wording is clear and self-explanatory. We believe there ought to be no provision in the Constitution which could be used to prevent pregnant women and girls from travelling abroad to receive services which are lawful in other jurisdictions, or to obtain in Ireland information, including counselling, in relation to such services. Our proposed amendment achieves those objectives.  It also provides for the dissemination of such information and arrangements for counselling to be regulated by law, enacted in this Oireachtas, in order to ensure that all <Col N="1110" /> such information and counselling is of a proper quality and conducted in an appropriate setting.</P>
    <P>In addition, the words chosen ought to be non-controversial.  No group has argued against the right to travel and none has argued against the right of women to be informed.  For that reason, we can see no reason this or very similar wording should not be accepted and enjoy widespread support across the political divide and among every party in this House.</P>
    <P>It has been our intention since this Bill was published to seek cross-party consensus.  We sent the text to the Leaders of each political party in this House and asked if they wished to co-sponsor the Bill.  In that way we wished to approach this issue in a non-political, non-partisan way.</P>
    <P>It is worthwhile mentioning that we did, in fact, receive a courteous reply to that approach from the Taoiseach in which he indicated an unwillingness to depart from the timescale he had previously set out.  He indicated clearly he had no problem with the general thrust of the Bill.  He also said in his letter, on behalf of the Government, that no action would be taken to offend against the spirit of the consensus that exists on the issues of travel and information.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that this Bill demonstrates that the issue can be addressed properly and in good time. A failure by the political system, and especially of the Government, to address the rights to travel and information in the context of Maastricht, could be a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>I should like to sum up the situation. First, the referendum on Maastricht is inextricably linked with the issue of travel and information as it affects women.  To say otherwise is to deny a basic reality. Unless that linkage is broken, it will be impossible for many citizens, particularly women, to vote in conscience for a Maastricht Treaty that otherwise they would be prepared to support.  Second, the Government have argued that the issues of travel and information are too complex to deal with in the context of the referendum <Col N="1111" /> on Maastricht.  That argument is erroneous.  The issues of travel and information are not complex.  However, the situation that could arise if they are not dealt with prior to the Maastricht Referendum is shrouded in complexity and danger.</P>
    <P>There are some things we can be certain of; once the Maastricht Referendum is passed &mdash; if it is passed &mdash; so is the Maastricht Protocol; once the Maastricht Treaty has been adopted unchanged it will remain in force, incapable of being changed, at least until there is a full meeting of the new inter-governmental council, any changes agreed at that level may well not have any legal force since they will not be properly ratified.  Therefore, in the absence of any other change, the Maastricht Protocol could defeat one of the main purposes of the Treaty itself &mdash; the notion of a common and equal citizenship with a broad range of rights, including the basic right to travel between the component parts of the new European Union.  The concept of citizenship is fundamental to the Union Treaty and it is being compromised by the position adopted by the former Taoiseach and the position currently adopted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the Maastricht Protocol copperfastens judgments like those I quoted earlier and removes the possibility in future cases of an appeal to the European courts.  We have argued in the past, and we still believe, if it were possible to delete the Protocol now it would mean that the primary source of law in the area would be the decision of Justice Costello in the High Court, since he was the only one to pronounce on the issue as a matter of European law, and the European law issue was not examined by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons it is of fundamental importance that the right to travel and information be dealt with now. The Taoiseach and others have suggested that that right could be left to one side until the autumn, and that they can be trusted at that stage to deal with the issues.  That means the Government are <Col N="1112" /> asking women and girls to agree, at best, to an interregnum period during which they will have rights that are less than those of every other European citizen, at worst, they are asking women and girls to believe that the issue will not be lost sight of because of some other crisis or instability or because they have capitulated to a pressure group.  We live in volatile and difficult times.</P>
    <P>For any Government to ask its citizens to issue them with a blank cheque in respect of a basic right such as this is unacceptable and it becomes completely intolerable when they refuse to take the necessary steps.  In 1983 the people of Ireland voted overwhelmingly to insert a provision into the Constitution to protect the life of the unborn, subject only to the equal right to life of the mother.  Despite the claims used by many people, there is no reason to believe the great majority of the people of Ireland want to see that balance of rights between the mother and the unborn child disturbed.  Neither is there any reason to believe the majority want to see the right to travel and information, which is available to every other citizen in Europe, denied to any citizen of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court interpretation of the balance of rights has given rise to the need for a complex and detailed examination of all the legislative options.  We fully recognise that and it is not our intention to interfere with the process of examination and analysis that the Government have undertaken.  As I have already said, the issues of travel and information do not require the same complexity of analysis and should be acted upon immediately.  Now is the time to address these issues.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party Bill before the House is the vehicle for the Government to show their good faith and bona fides in this regard.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The position of the Government on the issues of travel and information has been dealt with in the House on a number of occasions.  In reply to parliamentary questions on 28 April 1992 the Taoiseach informed the House that a referendum on the right to travel and information and other issues which it may be necessary to deal with as a result of the Supreme Court decision in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case will be held in November next.  He has frequently pointed out in the House and elsewhere that the complexity of the issues arising out of the court's decision are such that the Government have decided to deal with all aspects together.</P>
      <P>Deputies may recall that last week, in the course of debate in the House on the Government Bill to amend the Constitution to enable the State to ratify the Treaty on European Union, the Government rejected a motion from Deputy O'Keeffe to the effect that the Government should amend that Bill to provide for the travel and information issues or, alternatively, support the Private Members' Bill now before the House.</P>
      <P>It should come as no surprise, therefore, that while I commend Deputy Howlin for the work he has put into preparing this Bill and wish to say that I appreciate the arguments he has made for it, I must oppose the Bill.  The Government's opposition to the Bill is not, obviously, based on any objection in principle to what it seeks to achieve.  The approach of the Government, however, is to address fully all the issues raised by the court's decision in the most comprehensive way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the issues arising from the Supreme Court judgment which require legislation and/or a referendum are being considered by a sub-committee of the Cabinet. The issues include the wording of the referendum on travel and information, the conditions which should govern the giving and obtaining of information on abortion, the legal and medical implications of the court's ruling on Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and what action &mdash; a referendum and/or legislation <Col N="1114" />&mdash; should be taken on that Article. There is a link between all these elements.  They are, essentially, tied into Article 40.3.3º and it might not be possible for the Government to finalise the wording of their proposed referendum on travel and information in advance of any decisions on Article 40.3.3º.  That is one reason the Government are unable to support the Private Members' Bill at this stage.</P>
    <P>Considerable preliminary work has already been initiated by the Government sub-committee to enable the committee to consider carefully all the options.  The committee are taking whatever time and effort is necessary to deal with the various issues.  As soon as the committee have completed their work on any of the issues and the Government have completed their deliberations, the decisions made will be announced to the House.  The Government will not be deflected from dealing comprehensively, as necessary, with all the issues.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the two elements of the right to travel and information which are covered in this Bill.  It has been asserted that the Bill, if approved by the people, would copperfasten the rights which are alleged to be threatened by the Protocol to the Treaty on European Union.  The Government's view consistently has been that the Protocol does not have the effects which have been suggested and, moreover, the Government's view has been that there would be no advantage in holding a referendum on travel and information before the referendum on the Treaty.  I was glad to hear that Deputy Spring recognised that latter point when, on 5 May 1992, in the debate on the Government's Referendum Bill on the Treaty on European Union he said his party would not press for completion of his party's Bill until the referendum was over.  This, I think, was an acknowledgment of the reality of the position on the Protocol and I commend the Deputy for having made his party's position clear in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are good and valid reasons why the Government do not regard the Protocol as threatening the rights of travel <Col N="1115" /> within the Community but, in any event, the Government have been prepared to avoid any uncertainty about the matter by seeking and obtaining the agreement of our EC partners in a solemn declaration that the Protocol as it stands protects the right to travel between EC states.  Perhaps I should elaborate on the Government's reasoning if only to emphasise what has been said before on the matter in the House and by way of public statements.</P>
    <P>Since the signing of the Treaty on European Union by the member states of 7 February 1992, three of the Supreme Court judges in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case decided that the constitutional right to life of the unborn takes precedence over the constitutional right to travel of the mother, so that an injunction can be granted by virtue of Article 40.3.3º against women going abroad for an unlawful abortion as interpreted by the Supreme Court, that is, one in which there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  The argument raised has been that the Protocol, if passed, would copperfasten the effect of the judgment and would nullify rights of free movement conferred by the EC and Maastricht Treaties.  Whether this is correct or not depends on the proper interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º&rdquo; in the Protocol.</P>
    <P>The Government's view, shared by legal services in Brussels, is that the phrase is intended to refer to effects in Ireland only and cannot restrict movement or actions outside Ireland.  It has, on the other hand, been argued that the issue of an injunction in Ireland against a woman within the jurisdiction to protect an unborn life within the jurisdiction is an application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º.  The Solemn Declaration, however, on which the Government have got agreement among all other EC states affirms, in effect, that the Protocol as it stands protects the right to travel between EC states.  Under generally recognised rules of interpretation of international treaties &mdash; I am referring in <Col N="1116" /> particular to the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties &mdash; the declaration would have to be taken into account by any court in interpreting the Protocol.</P>
    <P>The declaration deals with travel among EC states.  Freedom of movement of persons is one of the freedoms guaranteed by the EC Treaty.  It is part of the Community's legal order that people are free to move to any place in the Community either to establish themselves or to work or to render or receive services. This freedom, as is clear in particular from provisions in the Treaty on European Union, is the fundamental principle of the Community and will be of growing value in the years to come.  The declaration affirms that right but the referendum proposal on travel that is promised by the Government would enshrine in our Constitution the freedom to travel to all states where abortion services are lawful, not just to other member states of the European Community.</P>
    <P>It may transpire that the wording in the Private Members' Bill in so far as travel is concerned may not be markedly different from the wording that the Government will eventually propose and to that extent the Bill may well offer a basis for eventual consensus on the matter.  The Government sub-committee have not, however, made their recommendations on the appropriate wording and would only be doing so in the context of recommendations on all the issues.</P>
    <P>What I have said about travel being dealt with by the Government and the sub-committee in the context of a package of proposals applies equally to the questions of the freedom of persons to obtain in the State information and counselling concerning facilities in another state.  Again, the wording that the Government decide on eventually may come close to what is in the Private Members' Bill but that is a matter for decision by the Government in due course on the basis of the recommendations to be made by the Government sub-committee.</P>
    <P>The issue of freedom to provide and receive information and counselling did not, of course, come before the Supreme <Col N="1117" /> Court in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case. However, the Supreme Court did decide in cases in 1988 the Well Woman Centre case, and 1989 the Grogan case, that the dissemination of information on abortion is unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º.  Following the decision in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case, that prohibition is presumed to extend only to information not covered by the decision, that is abortion in cases where there is not a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  In the Well Woman Centre case which is before the European Court of Human Rights on allegation of breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights the State has conceded as much.  Since the case is still pending before the Court of Human Rights it would not be appropriate for me to comment any further on it.  However, the information issue was, of course, raised before the EC Court of Justice on a reference to it by our High Court in the Grogan case and the EC court's deliberations in that case are of particular interest and relevant to the current debate on information.</P>
    <P>The effect of the European Court's decision is that while lawful abortion in a state constitutes a service within the meaning of Article 59 of the EC Treaty, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state in which abortion is forbidden to prohibit the distribution of information about abortion services available in another member state where there is no economic link between the abortion service and the distribution of the information that is provided.  The court did not specifically decide, but it may be that the court could be taken as implying that, if there was such a link, the distribution of the information would be permissible under Community law. The matter is not straightforward and it is recognised that member states have a margin of discretion within which to decide what should be permissible under their national laws.</P>
    <P>The European Court has consistently held that Article 59 of the EC Treaty requires the abolition of any restriction which has the aim or effect of treating <Col N="1118" /> a provider of services established in a member state other than the member state where the service is provided less favourably on account of his nationality or his place of establishment other than a provider of services who is established in that member state.  Article 59 also requires the abolition of any restrictions which the recipient of services might encounter on account of his nationality or of the fact that he is established in a member state other than that to which he goes in order to receive the services.</P>
    <P>It follows from the case law of the European Court of Justice that not only providers of services who do so by way of trade or profession derive rights from the Treaty provisions on freedom to provide services but also Community citizens who wish to receive services derive rights therefrom.  There is the question, of course, whether that right of Community citizens to receive services in another member state encompasses the right to receive, unimpeded, information in one's own member state about providers of services in the other member state.</P>
    <P>The position, generally, appears to be that a prohibition on the distribution to persons resident in a member state of specific information designed to promote activities which are contrary to the legitimate public policy of that state, if performed there, may be applied even where the information invites persons to make use of those activities in another member state where the likely or intended result of the provision of such information is to undermine that public policy.</P>
    <P>The prohibition at issue in the Grogan case, it was argued, by the State, was necessary in order to prevent the constitutional safeguard of the right to life of the unborn from being undermined.  The courts, as part of the machinery of the State, it was said, had a duty to restrain activity which they consider to be unlawful and representing an attack on that right guaranteed by the Constitution. The prohibition in question, therefore, was necessary in order to effectively defend and vindicate the right to life which would otherwise be set at nought and circumvented.  On that basis the <Col N="1119" /> State's view was that prohibition was justified under Community law.</P>
    <P>The EC Commission's view in the case was that Irish law was compatible with Articles 59 and 60.  The case, it said, concerned a total prohibition of abortion on Irish territory which extends to any acts done on its territory which may adversely affect the right to life of a foetus, even if that damage can take place only outside Ireland.  It was clear in its view that the aim pursued &mdash; that of a ban on information on abortion &mdash; is in the domain of morality and not of economics and that the measure in question has no protectionist effect since a doctor established in another member state will meet no greater obstacle than a doctor established in Ireland and no Irish hospital can benefit from the obstacles placed in the path of women wishing to seek an abortion abroad.  The Irish law is, therefore, compatible with Articles 59 and 60.  Whatever its merits, the Commission said, the objective of preventing abortions belongs to the moral sphere, in relation to which member states remain free to pursue their own policies so long as these do not entail discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Commission pointed out that in so far as the public policy exception provided for by the combined provisions of Article 56 and 66 of the Treaty was concerned, the policy pursued by Ireland with regard to abortion falls within that concept and furthermore, in a society which places an absolute value on life of a foetus, giving it the rank of human life, any conduct which threatens that life may be considered to affect the fundamental interest of society and justifies recourse to the concept of public policy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on the basis of what we know from the Grogan case, as dealt with by the European Court of Justice, there is no absolute right to information &mdash; the right, indeed, may be subject to appropriate conditions laid down in national law.  It is apparent also that there is scope in the EC for the development of principles concerning the freedom to give or obtain information and that in the meantime member states may have a <Col N="1120" /> reasonable margin of discretion to decide what should or should not be permissible in their national laws.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration deals, in effect, with the argument that is made that the Protocol might nullify rights to information conferred by EC law.  The declaration affirms that the Protocol protects freedom to obtain or make available in Ireland information relating to services lawfully available in member states but it provides, in addition, that the information may be subject to conditions which may be laid down in Irish legislation in conformity with Community law.  As I have indicated, there is nothing unusual in the proposal that the giving and receiving of information should be regulated by law.  Such laws already exist in other EC states.  The Government's referendum proposal on information will enshrine in our Constitution the right to information, notwithstanding Article 40.3.3º and allow for legislation to regulate the matter.</P>
    <P>There appears to be general agreement in the House and among public groups that the right to travel should not be restricted.  The position about the right to information and counselling may be different and it will be important, therefore, to get a wide consensus on what should be permissible in that area.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Commission on the Status of Women have made a submission to the Government with particular reference to the ban on counselling and information deriving from the decisions of the Supreme Court having regard to Article 40.3.3º.  The basic premise of the commission's statement to the Government is that women should have the right to avail of counselling and information as well as the right to travel.  Since the commission made their submission the Government have been able to achieve the agreed interpretation among our EC partners that the Protocol to the Treaty on European Union protects the right of pregnant women not only to travel between EC states but to receive information in the State about services lawfully available in EC states.  In addition, the Government <Col N="1121" /> have announced their intention to bring forward legislation to enable a referendum to be held on travel and information.</P>
    <P>It would seem that not a great deal in the debate in the past few weeks has been said about our counselling services and their ability to cope with any new situation in the future.  The fact, however, is that within the constraints which exist at present a great deal is being done by our counselling services and I should like to briefly comment on that aspect if only to emphasise that counselling services and the people who serve them are, on a daily basis, dealing with the special problems of people in crises.</P>
    <P>The duration of a pregnancy is a difficult time for the woman concerned and we must do all that is possible to deal with the health and welfare of that person.  Our health boards provide teams of doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, community and social workers to deal with the many problems associated with pregnancy.  In the event of changes being made in our laws on counselling and information, it is those doctors, and social workers we will be looking to to operate the new laws.  In addition, we must not forget that there are voluntary agencies, many of them State aided, which provide counselling and information to pregnant women.  I commend the dedication and professionalism of all these agencies and I have no doubt that their position and their views will be valued and taken into account in the framing of new laws on counselling and information.</P>
    <P>The Government sub-committee is, as I have said, proceeding with their examination of all the issues with expedition so as to provide the Government with well considered recommendations which can then form the basis for appropriate decisions and action.  That, in the Government's view, is the best way to proceed.  I think most people would agree that the Government are acting responsibly in the matter and that they have a duty to consider carefully all the implications before committing the country <Col N="1122" /> to a referendum on amendments to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Since the outcome of the Supreme Court's judgment, the Government have sought to maintain cross party consensus on the issues.  The Government are still convinced that the way to foster that is to wait until they are in a position to consult all parties on proposals that will deal comprehensively with the issues.</P>
    <P>The Government would have wished, therefore, to see discussion on this Bill deferred until the Government proposals are made known.  As I understand it, it is open to the Deputy to withdraw the motion on his Bill without prejudice to his right to move it at a later time.  That is an option he might consider.  The Government, as I said in my opening remarks, are unable to support the Bill at this time.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be significantly less complex than the last <Col N="1123" /> two contributions, which were very thoughtful.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Howlin's contribution.  I compliment him on bringing forward the Bill because we should discuss exactly where we stand as a result of the extraordinary judgment by the Supreme Court in the case of X.  The judgment shows the merits of caution, waiting until we have a clear view of where precisely we intend to go and how we will deal with the complex set of issues before us as a result of that judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of the point made by Deputy Howlin.  If I understood him correctly we agree that there should not be any controversy on the question of travel.  However, the area of information is more complex and that complexity was dealt with, to a degree, by the Tánaiste. I will deal with it briefly now.  When Article 40.3.3º was inserted in the Constitution I felt that there was a degree of clarity as to what precisely the people had decided at that time.  In the nine years between the referendum and the delivery of the Supreme Court judgment, few would have guessed at the Supreme Court reaction to the presentation of the tragic facts in the X case.  How many people in this House &mdash; or elsewhere &mdash; would have suggested that a judgment allowing a termination, albeit in a specific case, without any reference to a time consideration &mdash; a point dealt with by Deputy Howlin &mdash; would have arisen in a Supreme Court judgment?  This aspect of the judgment &mdash; like other aspects &mdash; and failure to deal with the issue of time, struck me as extraordinary because nobody that I know would argue that there should be freedom of choice without some reference to time; it is a complex issue.  However, whatever feelings we may have about the judgment, there is no point in wringing our hands.  The judgment is now the law and we must deal comprehensively with it.  The minimum we owe ourselves as a nation &mdash; the minimum we owe Irishwomen, the people who will have to bear the consequences of what will happen here now and in the months ahead &mdash; is to <Col N="1124" /> come forward with a comprehensive, thoughtful and workable response.</P>
    <P>The judgment touched on or raised questions in three main areas &mdash; travel, information and, what is now coyly called in much of the debate, the substantive issue.  I compliment Deputy Howlin on not using coy language.  He dealt with the issues and the complexities which arise from the substantive issue in an honest way.  As the Tánaiste said, there should be freedom to travel.  What happens to a citizen of our State abroad is clearly beyond our legislative capacity and whatever feelings one might have about actions taken by a citizen while in another jurisdiction, it is not practical to attempt to legislate against such action.  I am not just talking about actions in this case; a whole range of actions is involved.  It is one of the more extraordinary situations which has come out of this series of events, that the issue of travel should be in question at all.  The plain fact is that any resident on leaving the jurisdiction could involve more injunctions, even supervision of the person or detention of one kind or another.  None of that would be acceptable to any right thinking person.</P>
    <P>I am glad, therefore, that the Taoiseach indicated from a very early date, since the decision of the Supreme Court, that the Government do not wish to see the law being exercised in any way which prohibits the freedom to travel.  I am pleased too that the Government have ensured, by way of agreement among EC partners under a Solemn Declaration, that rights of travel among member states are not affected by the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  Having said that, I accept the points which people make about the legal situation which flows from a solemn declaration and its legal infirmities or weaknesses.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated that there will be a referendum on travel &mdash; I welcome this &mdash; and that they appreciate the need to combine examination of that element with other elements of information, counselling and the substantive issue of abortion raised in Article 40.3.3º. Because of the seriousness and complexity <Col N="1125" /> of these issues, I share the Taoiseach's view that the Government must insist on being allowed to carry out a proper examination of all the elements before they can decide on the wording of amendments of the Constitution or the details of legislation.  I do not believe that Deputy Howlin wishes the Government to be forced into precipitous action and, therefore, that we could find ourselves in ten years' time &mdash; as we now find ourselves &mdash; in the same situation, because, after all, 18 months or two years' consideration were given to the last wording. There was controversy, even at the last moment, as to the precise meaning and ten years later we have another, and entirely unexpected, situation flowing from it.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill could, clearly, not be accepted by the Government at this stage because such acceptance would pre-empt the work of the Government sub-committee which have been given the task of making comprehensive recommendations to the Government on the various issues.  It would also pre-empt the Government's own deliberations on the basis of those recommendations and the deliberations which would be forced on this House later in the year.</P>
    <P>The Government have also indicated that they propose to bring forward legislation to enable a referendum to be held on the freedom to give and obtain information, subject to conditions which may be laid down in legislation.  The situation here is, if anything, more complex than the travel issue and potentially more divisive. The present law regarding information on abortion is based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution in the two cases which the Tánaiste outlined, one in 1988, the Well Woman Centre case and the Grogan case in 1989.  In the Well Woman Centre case, the Supreme Court held that there was no constitutional right to information about the availability of a service of abortion outside the State which, if availed of, would have the direct consequence of destroying the guaranteed right of life of the <Col N="1126" /> unborn in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The case is now under appeal before the European Court of Human Rights and the Government have conceded that information in cases covered by the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X is permissible.  In the Grogan case, which was referred to by the High Court to the European Court of Justice, the European Court held that, while lawful abortion in a State constitutes a service within the meaning of the Treaty of Rome, it is not contrary to Community law for a member state in which abortion is forbidden &mdash; in this case Ireland &mdash; to prohibit student associations from distributing information about abortion services in another member state where the services in question have no involvement in the distribution of the information.</P>
    <P>On appeal to the Supreme Court from the High Court decision in that case to refuse an injunction prohibiting the distribution of the information, the Supreme Court held that the distribution of the information was unconstitutional, having regard to Article 40.3.3º.  The effect of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X case is that abortion is lawful if, as a matter of probability, there is a real and substantial risk to the life &mdash; although not to the health &mdash; of the mother.  In the view of the Supreme Court, an intention to commit suicide could amount to such a risk.  The right in those circumstances to an abortion seems to imply a corresponding right to information.  In cases not covered by the Supreme Court test the law would seem to be that there is no unqualified right to information.  The constitutional prohibition on information under the decision of the Supreme Court in the Well Woman Centre and Grogan cases would apply in those cases.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that any change in the law on information would have to be by way of amendment to the Constitution; there is no doubt about that. What information can and should be made available under legislation which would follow from an amendment to the Constitution is another issue.  I have no <Col N="1127" /> doubt that this will be the basis of considerable thought, debate and controversy in the coming months.</P>
    <P>While many would agree with the views expressed by one Government Member that a person travelling must at a minimum know where she is going, many would be less happy with the thought of blatantly promotional literature beig circulated without any limitation or control.  It is one thing to make information available about a service that is lawful in another country but it is quite another matter to promote that service in a way that is alien to the values of the people of this country or in a way that runs contrary to the general ethos of the people as a whole.  I do not suggest for one moment that that is what Deputy Howlin means.</P>
    <P>My time has now run out.  What I have tried to do is illustrate the complexity of the second layer of the issue, the information issue.  Other than in Deputy Howlin's fine contribution, we have not even touched on the abortion issue itself.</P>
    <P>There are three complex and interrelated issues arising from the Supreme Court decision in the case of the Attorney General <i>v.</i> X.  I think that we owe it to ourselves to get it right on this occasion because it is clear that we did not get it right on the previous occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start off where Deputy Roche finished.  He talked about what happened ten years ago and said that none of us anticipated recent events. <Col N="1128" /> While I do not wish to depart from the spirit of consensus, I have a certain irritation at the level of hypocrisy that falls across the floor of the House on occasion. As we address this issue in all seriousness, I do not think we should avoid making the point that the Fianna Fáil Party in the House on what was a difficult issue in 1982 and 1983 played an appalling game of cynical politics, and they knew they were playing it.  It is not correct to say that no one anticipated that the consequences of the 1983 amendment could be what has come to pass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members of this House anticipated several consequences of what was an ill-judged and an ill-considered amendment to the Constitution. Some of us predicted that it would lay the foundation within our Constitution for legalising abortion.  I was one of those who predicted that.  Some of us predicted at an early part of 1983 that there would be a referendum that would be appallingly religiously divisive.  That referendum was held.  We were told by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the words ultimately included in our Constitution were written on tablets of stone that guaranteed that the life of the unborn would be protected.  The Fianna Fáil Party, and their former spokesman on Justice, Deputy Woods, tried to steer clear from talking about the rights of women.  Nevertheless, there was a gesture in the direction of women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There was always a possibility that that amendment could end up <Col N="1129" /> with the interpretation put on it by the High Court, the possibility being that women's rights would be entirely overridden in favour of a theoretical right to life of the unborn.  I have always found it difficult to understand the way in which the overriding of the rights of a pregnant woman can simultaneously protect the life of the unborn child, whose very existence is dependent, in most cases, on the continued life of the pregnant woman. There was a possibility that the High Court decision arrived at could come about.  In the end, the second possibility was the Supreme Court decision.</P>
      <P>If we are going to talk about the substantive issue &mdash; which I am not going to address at great length this evening because it is not part of the Bill &mdash; those people outside the House who are running campaigns on that issue and those people within the House, within the Fianna Fáil Party, who talk obliquely, using the phrase &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo;, need be warned that on this side of the House we will not sacrifice the lives of women.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court judgment seemed to try to address the difficulty of having an equity of rights in circumstances in which the protection of life is not consistent with the preservation of another life.  In laying down the real and substantial connection, the real and substantial danger or the real and substantial risk test, in my view the Supreme Court has struck the only logical balance that can be struck in dealing with a situation in which a mother's life is at risk.  When I hear the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and other Members of the Fianna Fáil Party talking about &ldquo;addressing all the issues&rdquo; my concern is not just that we will have presented in the House in the autumn a constitutional amendment dealing with travel and information but that we will have an unacceptable constitutional package that envisages not merely dealing with travel and information but also makes a presentation of a new form of wording that will ultimately have the effect of depriving women of protection when there is a real and substantial risk to their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> I do not believe that there is a legal framework that can be produced that would be acceptable, that would protect the lives of women while ensuring that pregnancies can be terminated in this country only in extremely limited circumstances. I do not believe that there is an alternative.  I say to the Fianna Fáil Party: do not try to do again the kind of political job you did in 1983 in this House. Do not produce a package that is designed on one side to appease the so-called liberals, and I include myself within that category, to use the caricatures with which we are pinned &mdash; those who favour travel and information, and that is also designed to satisfy people who regard women as basically the carriers of babies, with no rights and no function beyond that.  There is no such package that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have a deep suspicion that the Fianna Fáil game plan is to get the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty through the House and, having got it through, to yet again run the pro-life issue in an election campaign. Of course, we are all pro-life.  I am pro-life &mdash; I am &ldquo;pro&rdquo; the life of women, men, children, babies and the unborn when it can be protected.  But I do recognise that there are grey areas in which choices have to be made on occasion.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party should not be allowed to produce a package in which they suggest that all of the Opposition parties &mdash; and the Progressive Democrats as well &mdash; are rabid abortionists and that Fianna Fáil are the only party interested in protecting the life of the unborn.  I say to members of the Fianna Fáil Party that they should not rush out of this House and hold a false general election on that issue and try to label other parties and Members of the House as not being pro-life or not wanting to protect the unborn and as being advocates of abortion.  The Fianna Fáil Party played that game in 1983.  I do not believe that the electorate would again be fooled if that game were played.  I am deeply concerned when I hear members of the Fianna Fáil Party talking about &ldquo;packages&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the right to travel and the right to information, those issues <Col N="1131" /> are very simple &mdash; they are not complex. The position where we stand today is the result of the inclusion in our Constitution of a provision that has been interpreted by our courts in a specific way.  The solution is very simple.  The reason I am worried is that the Government have been offered a variety of solutions. Unlike the events of 1983, when a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government found themselves ambushed by Fianna Fáil Deputies hiding in the long grass on this issue, being not really interested in the issue, but seeking a cynical party political advantage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to offer constructive solutions to the Government to achieve resolution of their problems. Immediately following the Supreme Court judgment Deputy John Bruton, leader of the Fine Gael Party, at a meeting with the Taoiseach expressed to him the view that the way to resolve the travel and information difficulty was to hold a constitutional referendum on that issue and that such a referendum should take place fairly speedily.  At that stage the Taoiseach continued to use his favourite phrase that all options were open, a phrase which has now descended into a sort of mantra that we hear on a regular basis.  The Labour Party at that stage seemed confused as to where the issue was heading.  I recall Deputy Spring on television saying that the last thing we wanted was a referendum.  The Labour Party came around to the view, and I accept their sincerity in this, that a referendum is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then offered the Government help. We suggested a form of wording to <Col N="1132" /> amend the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  The Government did not do their homework and could not get the European Community partners to agree to amend it.  We raised with the Government the possibility of deleting the Protocol. We had a variety of responses.  The Taoiseach said we could not delete it as that was the same as amending it, while at the same time Deputy Kitt was telling a group from the Council for the Status of Women that they had not seriously sought to secure agreement to deletion of the Protocol.  We sought in the last week's debate by way of a Fine Gael motion on Second Stage to get agreement from this Government to address the travel and information issue in advance of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Government voted against that.  Fine Gael do not have any difficulty in supporting the Labour Party Bill before the House.  The wording in that Bill reflects the type of wording we suggested to the Government in relation to the amendment to the Protocol. The wording adequately and properly deals with the travel and information issue.  The wording in the Labour Party Bill would certainly allow for the constitutional difficulties arising from travel and information and the intertwining of the issues with Maastricht to be resolved. It is incomprehensible that the Government cannot support this measure.  Their constant evasion of the issue raises very deep suspicions as to where at least the Fianna Fáil wing of Government are heading.  I will not be quite as charitable to the Progressive Democrat wing of the Government as some people may wish to be.</P>

There is a level of public relations hypocrisy hanging round the neck of the Progressive Democrats.  They have not yet been sussed by the general public but the chickens will eventually come home to roost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the substantive issue, we have had a great deal of legal debate.  In recent weeks I engaged in much of that.  I suspect that at this stage many people go deaf, as it were, when they hear the legal debate on this issue. Deputy Howlin set out the legal background very well this evening.  For some time the Government have been extremely confused about the legal background to this issue.  I find it difficult to understand the level of Government confusion.  That confusion has been such that at one stage we were told by the Taoiseach that the Protocol did not have to be amended.  At a meeting with all the women Members of this House he said that the Protocol did not need to be amended but within a week he was saying the opposite.  Then we had two weeks of deliberations as to the form of amendment and following that Deputy Andrews, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, came back from Europe and said he could not secure agreement for an amendment to the Protocol and that he has been offered a solemn declaration. During an RTE interview he said that a solemn declaration was of no legal value. Ten days later a solemn declaration was the new legal Utopia to solve the problem. We have heard more tonight about this Solemn Declaration.  I put my views on the record of this House on this issue last Thursday so I do not propose to repeat my speech.  Suffice it to say that whereas a solemn declaration can be looked at by the European Court in interpreting a treaty, a solemn declaration cannot distort the actual words contained in a treaty or Protocol.  It is quite clear that if we vote for the Maastricht Treaty, which I am urging people to do, and we adopt the Protocol, the Maastricht <Col N="1134" /> Treaty will not become part of our law until January next and if by next January we have not addressed the travel and information issues within our Constitution, the Treaty will copperfasten the ban on travel and information.  That is the reality as has been said before.</P>
      <P>I took note of the promise made tonight by the Tánaiste when he said that it is common case, a basic premise of Government, that the right to travel and to have access to information and counselling should be made available.  That is a solemn commitment by this Government to this House tonight and they must not try to step aside from that commitment no matter what the exigencies of political life in this State may be.  The Government must bring into this House the legislation required next October to allow the necessary referendum to take place.</P>
      <P>At the time of the 1983 amendment we were told that acceptance of the amendment would have the effect of preventing abortion and saving the lives of the unborn.  I want to broaden the debate slightly because it has become somewhat legally sterile.  That has been necessary to try to get the point home, but we are not talking about the problem, we are talking about legal forms and constitutions. We were told in 1983 that this was the way to save the lives of the unborn.  In that year approximately 3,000 Irish women were going to the UK to have abortions.  In 1992, ten years later over 4,000 Irish women a year go to England to have abortions.  In what way has the amendment helped?  What we need to do is to broaden this debate and move away from sterile discussions of legal forms and constitutional amendments. We cannot solve social problems by constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an extraordinary hang up here with legislation and legal forms.  We pass an Act or put something in our Constitution and, by virtue of that, say the problem is resolved.  Of course, the social reality is the exact opposite of what the legislation says or what the Constitution exhorts people to do.  Many of us for some years have avoided getting back <Col N="1135" /> into this debate in the detail which is required.  I suppose many Members of this House, including myself, are the walking wounded of 1983.  Many of us still bear the scars of that debate.</P>
    <P>I would say to Mr. William Binchy and to Senator Hanafin that they have done enough damage.  I would expect that they would at this stage have stayed out of this debate, that they would have had the decency to recognise their mistakes and stay off the public stage on this issue.  I hope they will stay off it, or get off it now.  I find it extraordinary that those gentlemen who are so hung up on legal forms and constitutional amendments rarely talk about the social problems.  We want to tackle the problem of unwanted pregnancies.  We want to tackle the problem of abortion but what we need to start looking at is our education system, at how we are educating children for life, at the question of what we are doing in the schools.</P>
    <P>When, for instance, will we deal with the family planning legislation?  This Government have been kicking to touch on that for 12 months now.  They will not deal with it.  When will we take the action necessary to provide better social supports and understanding for women with unwanted pregnancies so that they do not feel they have to leave this country to terminate those pregnancies?  When will we do that instead of talking about legal forms and constitutional amendments? When will we recognise that for every women who has an unwanted pregnancy, there is a man who bears the responsibility for that pregnancy?  This is not just a woman's issue.  It is about men and women.  It is about men facing up to their responsibility as well as being about women being provided with the understanding and support they require when an unwanted pregnancy occurs.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that, at about this time last year, I was being attacked by some social workers because I was endeavouring to provide, by legislation, for the recognition of Romanian adoptions in Ireland, when Irish couples were going off to Romania to try to save children <Col N="1136" /> many of whom would not have lived through last winter had they not been adopted by Irish couples.  Now I am being attacked &mdash; having been involved last year in what I think was a very worthwhile legislative proposal that has benefited many children &mdash; by some of the more fundamentalist groups for wanting to murder babies.  Political life is very confusing.</P>
    <P>What I want to do is recognise the social reality of our problems.  If the Government are talking about addressing the totality of the issue they should not just address it in legal form, in constitutional form, or by way of new legislation. They should bring into this House a social action programme backed by the necessary finance and by an education programme so as to ensure that those at risk do not have unwanted pregnancies or, whenever unwanted pregnancies happen, the social supports should be available so as to at least encourage Irish women not to go abroad to terminate their pregnancies.  When we do that we will truly be pro-life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share my time with my colleague, Deputy McGahon on the other side of the House because the closure of a ward in Louth County Hospital is an issue about which we feel very strongly.  It involves 28 beds and five cots in the male surgical ward in that hospital.</P>
      <P>Circumstances arose recently in which members of the North-Eastern Health Board were not informed &mdash; I want to protest about that fact here in the only forum available to me &mdash; as to what was proposed.  That was not right and we should have been informed at the first available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it the saving being made by a ward closure, according to figures given to me some time ago, in one <Col N="1137" /> month is £20,000.  I find it ludicrous that a ward should be closed with the consequent trauma created in the minds of the public, particularly in the minds of people who feel that in some way the hospital is being downgraded.  If the saving involved amounts to £20,000 only then it should be ascertained whether there is a better way of saving such money rather than taking this drastic step.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon and I have been approached by people in recent weeks who are concerned about what is happening in the hospital.  For example, over the past weekend a woman came to me whose husband had been rushed to Louth County Hospital.  Her husband's life had been saved in that he had been in a life-threatening condition.  That woman remarked that it would be awful if the hospital was closed, the perception being that, because the ward is being closed, albeit for a number of months, ultimately the hospital will be closed.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to listen to what Deputy McGahon and I have to say.  A number of people are extremely worried and the case I instanced is just one example.  I have heard of another case, perhaps the most ludicrous of all, of a VHI patient who was willing to pay &mdash; she was due to have an urgent hysterectomy &mdash; having to go across the Border where that operation was performed today in Newry.  That patient could not obtain a bed in Louth County Hospital.  She was quite willing to pay for a bed, she could not get one which meant the VHI money went outside this State to Newry.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this matter carefully.  I know he is aware of the position and will come to Louth in the near future to discuss it.  On previous occasions the Minister admitted that the North-Eastern Health Board incur the lowest <i>per capita</i> spending on health nationwide.  We should like to know why. I am told there is a historical reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Dermot Ahern sharing his time with me, which is a measure of the concern we feel <Col N="1138" /> about the shadow hanging over Louth County Hospital.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Dermot Ahern and I are at cross-purposes to some extent in that he referred to the male surgical ward which has been closed whereas my concern is at the postponement of hysterectomy operations in that hospital.  I do not have to tell the Minister that many hysterectomy cases carry the inherent threat of cancer.  There are now waiting lists of three months duration which, in the case of some people, maybe too late.</P>
      <P>I have great hopes in the present Minister because of his radical approach to circumstances prevailing in the medical services generally.  I appeal to him to re-examine the circumstances prevailing in the poorest town in Ireland which has double the national average unemployment with many thousands of poor medical card holders whose hospital is overshadowed by the glamorous hospital in Drogheda and has suffered as a result. It is my belief that Louth County Hospital is in the process of being closed by stealth. The position is that gynaecological patients have had to wait for three months which is totally unacceptable. Indeed, in the days when the British ruled this country, people had less to live on but were at least assured of a hospital bed.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to examine the overall position in Louth County Hospital and upgrade that hospital.  If the day comes about when I will be a member of a party in Government I will vote against that party if they do not give an assurance that Louth County Hospital will be saved and, indeed, upgraded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies Dermot Ahern and McGahon for raising this matter and affording me an opportunity of clarifying the position.  Of course, the Deputies will be aware that the provision of services at Louth County Hospital, in the first instance, is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The board receives an annual allocation from my Department for the provision of health services for their catchment population.  This year the board received an overall revenue allocation of £72.472 million, representing an increase of £8.6 million or 13.5 per cent over the 1991 original allocation or £63.9 million.</P>
    <P>The allocation of resources between individual programmes within the total provision made available by my Department is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the board's budget for their general hospital programme for this year is £25.6 million compared to a 1991 budget of £22.9 million, representing a very significant increase of 11.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>In relation to Louth County Hospital, which is funded as part of the board's general hospital programme, the budget for 1992 is £5.6 million as against an original budget for 1991 of £4.9 million, the increase being 14.7 per cent.  It will be apparent from these figures that the allocation made available for services at Louth County Hospital for 1992 compares favourably with the resources allocated for the board's general hospital programme generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ward closures at the Louth County Hospital, I wish to say that there is nothing new in these arrangements. Seasonal closures are a normal occurrence for almost all acute hospitals. Last year, for example &mdash; as I am sure Deputies are aware &mdash; 34 beds were closed at the Louth County Hospital during the summer period, that is from the beginning of June to the beginning of August.  This did not have an adverse effect on the service provided at the hospital.  In fact, despite the seasonal bed closures last year, the number of admissions increased by 3 per cent over the previous year from 6,101 admissions in 1990 to 6,283 admissions in 1991.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current year, I understand the North-Eastern Health Board agreed that the timing and arrangements for seasonal closures <Col N="1140" /> should be left to the local management of the individual hospitals concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Louth County Hospital, the decision has been made at local level to close 28 surgical beds from 3 May for a two month period, to be extended for a further two week period, if appropriate, depending on service needs. The timing of the closures has been chosen to coincide with staff holidays and also to have the least possible effect on the service needs of patients.  I understand that the hospital will be providing day surgery for three days per week, including one day for gynaecological work during the period of the seasonal closure of the beds.  This will help to lessen the impact of the closures.  The situation will be constantly monitored by the board to ensure that no undue hardship is caused as a result of the seasonal closures.  However, I should stress that, as in the past, all emergencies will continue to be received and treated by the hospital during the period of these seasonal closures.</P>
    <P>In the context of the seasonal closures &mdash; this is the information available to me &mdash; it is important to point out that there are no waiting lists at the Louth County Hospital at present and there were none during the period of the bed closures last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The urgent necessity for the Minister to authorise Phase II of the Castlebar General Hospital has been raised on a number of occasions in this Chamber and I hope this will be the last time any Deputy has to raise this issue.  In wishing the Minister well in this onerous task, I should like to remind him that his three predecessors failed to authorise this work.  It may well be that this is the last chance the people of Castlebar and County Mayo in general will have to see this work commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note and welcome the Minister's public announcement today of his commitment to funding for the Tallaght Hospital.  Obviously this is a priority which must be welcomed.  The commencement of work on Phase II of Castlebar General Hospital cannot and will not be commenced unless certain action is taken.  The existing hospital is like a bird with one wing or a doctor's surgery without any implements.  The hospital cannot operate effectively because the planning and design proposals dictated by the civil servants in the Minister's Department have not yet been implemented.  The planning and design proposals for Phase II were drawn up to dovetail with the work on Phase I. Patients who are being treated in the older section of the hospital at present face the consequent risk of cross-infection. Indeed, sections of the older building could constitute a fire hazard. This creates practical difficulties for the nurses, doctors, staff, patients and their relatives.  I wish to outline the action <Col N="1142" /> which needs to be taken to redress this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he intends to visit Louth County Hospital.  I extend to him a formal invitation to visit Castlebar General Hospital.  When he was Minister for Health, the former Deputy Barry Desmond, visited Castlebar General Hospital. Having seen at first hand the conditions in the old hospital, he allocated the necessary funds and authorised work on Phase 1 to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to have a health service outside Dublin.  I should like the Minister to authorise the planning and development work on the remaining section of phase I to proceed.  This will take at least six months to complete, at no great cost to the Department.  The people of Castlebar and the Western Health Board will more than readily accept the phasing in of work on Phase II over a two or three year period.  I ask the Minister not to leave us in limbo for a further ten years. If the Department carry out cost analysis I believe they will find that the cost of Phase II against rationalising the existing structures in order to provide a decent service for the people of County Mayo, are more or less the same.</P>
    <P>The promises and commitments given by the Minister's three predecessors received local and national coverage.  The case for this work has already been made and accepted by the Department, and has never been denied.  Indeed, the higher civil servants in the Department state regularly that the hospital cannot operate effectively or practically at present.  I again issue a formal invitation to the Minister to visit Castlebar General Hospital.  I ask him either on that occasion or beforehand, to please authorise the completion of the planning and development work on Phase I.  We can then discuss allocating resources from the 1993, 1994 and 1995 capital programmes for Phase II.  This development is much needed and I am sure the Minister will give it his urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to the issue raised <Col N="1143" /> by Deputy Kenny.  As the Deputy may be aware, the total development of Castlebar General Hospital was planned in accordance with the requirements of the development brief for construction under a single building contract.  Tender documentation was prepared on that basis for the construction of four large hospital blocks, a core service area, major adaptations of the existing hospital block, an extension and upgrading of the existing maternity unit, a new morturary and a nurses home.</P>
      <P>In the event, it was not possible to provide the necessary capital funds to proceed with the total development. However, the accommodation in the old hospital was very sub-standard and it was accepted that much of it had to be replaced.  Accordingly, in 1983 the original plans were revised to allow phasing and to provide for a reduced scheme which would remedy the most serious defects of the hospital.  I accept that conditions in the hospital must have been very bad when it was decided to move fast on this scheme.</P>
      <P>It was decided to build two of the four blocks provided for in the plans together with the core service areas.  Because the original development had been designed for construction under a single building contract, some areas had to be revised to allow acceptable operation of the reduced scheme.  This phase of the development was commissioned in 1989-90 at a total cost, including building fees and equipment, of more than £11 million.</P>
      <P>The accommodation provided in Phase 1 includes an outpatients department, kitchen, staff dining, stores, a radiology department, an operating department &mdash; four theatres &mdash; an intensive care unit and ward accommodation.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the completion of Phase 1 of this major development has resulted in a big improvement in hospital services for the people of Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept the need for the Phase 2 development.  The intention is to proceed with it as soon as resources permit.  This phase will involve building and connecting <Col N="1144" /> up to the new Phase 1 buildings two further blocks &mdash; ward accommodation, a new entrance, an administration department and an accident and emergency department, converting the existing hospital to provide a central sterile supply department, a physical medicine department, administration facilities, nurse changing-hostel accommodation, on-call staff accommodation and oratory; extending the obstetric unit and up-grading the existing unit; the provision of a new mortuary and the provision of a new nurses' home to replace the one demolished to allow Phase 1 to proceed.</P>
    <P>As part of the Phase 2 development some modification will be necessary to areas of Phase 1 &mdash; making it much more expensive &mdash; so that the overall development can function as planned.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am anxious to proceed with this necessary work to complete the provision of an efficient and effective hospital facility at Castlebar.  However, the total estimated cost of Phase 2 is in the region of £15 million and it will not be possible to accommodate a project of this size in the 1992 capital programme. The capital allocation available to me this year is severely limited and it will not be possible to provide other than for contractual obligations and other priority commitments.  The scope for starting major new building projects will be extremely limited.  Accordingly, the provision can only be made for the continuation of a number of major hospital projects currently under construction, a limited number of hospital improvement schemes at different locations, the purchase of urgent replacement equipment in a number of hospitals, a number of urgently required fire precaution and maintenance schemes, which amount to a considerable sum, and essential community developments in services for psychiatric patients, handicapped persons, the elderly and children.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgent need to limit the national borrowing requirement, it will not be possible in 1992 to allocate capital resources to a number of major acute hospital developments, including Tallaght, as mentioned by Deputy Kenny, <Col N="1145" /> and the Phase 2 development at Castlebar. I would like to reiterate that the need for this major project is not in dispute, but the commencement of building work must be deferred until the public finances can support it.  The Government are committed to ensuring that projects such as Phase 2 of Castlebar General Hospital should be commenced as soon as pressures ease on the national finances.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure that the infrastructure of the existing hospital service is strengthened so that services can continue to be delivered in an effective and efficient manner and at a reasonable revenue cost.  The Phase 2 development at Castlebar will contribute to the achievement of this objective and I can assure the Deputy that the needs of Castlebar will be taken fully into account in the formulation of my Department's capital programme for 1993 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>I promise Deputy Kenny that I will visit the hospital in the very near future because it is very difficult to know what the position is without seeing it first hand.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Third Level Education Grants.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter which is of great importance to parents and students in the lower income brackets.  As of now, education grants are paid at the maximum level to students in families of at least two children with a gross income of up to £10,700 and in families with three children, with a gross income of up to £11,595.  Taking into account tax deductions, PRSI and so on, these are relatively low incomes.  The maximum grant is £1,409 which does not represent 50 per cent of the cost of keeping a student in third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 1 June, 74,000 students will go on holidays for a minimum of 12 weeks &mdash; in the case of universities, for approximately 16 weeks.  Up to 12,000 students will seek holiday work in the USA and on the Continent and it is uncertain how <Col N="1146" /> many can hope to secure employment in Ireland.  However, it is certain that a substantial number will apply for unemployment assistance.  It is most unjust to assess a student's grant as income in relation to such an application.</P>
    <P>A large number of parents whose only income is social welfare are severely handicapped by this regulation as they are not capable of providing money to their children during the holiday period. It must be recognised that these people make a tremendous sacrifice to keep their children in third level education.  To avoid hardship in 1992 it is absolutely necessary that the Minister make regulations or amend existing regulations to exempt school grants from assessment so that students who are unable to emigrate or to get employment at home are treated on the same basis as other unemployed people.</P>
    <P>To apply, as a basis of income, the maximum grant would reduce the unemployment assistance of any such applicants by approximately £25 per week. Having regard to the inadequacy even of the maximum allowance of £50 per week, it is unacceptable that £25 a week will be taken from the allowance, taking into account also that in the overwhelming majority of cases these students will be resident with their parents in respect of which a further reduction will be made. I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter.  Parents have approached me who have been seeking, for a number of months, employment opportunities for their children in third level education but without success.  They are extremely concerned that should their children not succeed in finding a job, which in a certain number of cases will be the position, any social assistance they will get will be dramatically reduced.  This is an injustice to the student and the parent.  As I outlined earlier, it is only parents in very low income brackets, including many on social welfare, to whom education grants are paid as a small contribution at least to ensuring some element of equality in education.  I urgently appeal to the Minister, before the start of the 1992 school <Col N="1147" /> holiday season, to implement regulations to give justifiable rights to these students.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My good friend, Deputy Michael Moynihan, has made a very passionate and strong case but I am not able to bring him any good news tonight about this matter.</P>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that, in assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes account will be taken of: (i) all cash income which an applicant can expect to receive during the succeeding year; and (ii) the value of any benefit or privilege such as free board and lodgings.  There are no exceptions to this requirement for any category of claimant and accordingly any income received in cash by students falls to be included in the assessment.</P>
      <P>It is a basic condition for receipt of an unemployment payment that a claimant must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  Full-time attendance by day at a course of education is not regarded as being consistent with the notion of being available for employment as it normally involves a degree of commitment inconsistent with availability during the academic year.</P>
      <P>The unemployment provisions of the social welfare code are intended to protect workers against the contingency of loss of employment.  Students engaged in full-time studies have generally been accepted as having become part of the labour force on completion of the academic year in May or June.  At that stage they are eligible to be considered for unemployment assistance until such time as they succeed in getting a job or resume their studies, provided they meet the statutory requirements and satisfy a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides that all cash income apart from certain exemptions such as social welfare payments which a claimant may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year is assessable as means.  The legislation therefore obliges deciding and appeals <Col N="1148" /> officers to take note of the amount of means which applicants are likely to receive in the 12 months from the date of their application.  The manner in which such income is taken into account is to take the yearly income and divide by 52.</P>
    <P>In assessing the weekly means of students, the maintenance portion only of the education grant they received is assessed and allocated equally over the 52 weeks of the year.  To assess students with nil means over the summer months would, in the opinion of my Department, be an incorrect and unacceptable interpretation of the legislation which, as I have indicated earlier, is designed to provide for persons on the labour market who are involuntarily unemployed.</P>
    <P>The maintenance portion of the grant is not assessable where an applicant is not returning to third level studies, either on completion of a course or where they decide not to pursue a course further. Confirmation would normally be sought from the college authorities that a student had indicated their intention not to resume studies.</P>
    <P>Students are also assessed with the benefit and privilege of free board and lodgings if they are resident at the time the claim is made in their parents' home or that of a close relative.  Where students live elsewhere during the academic year this is reflected in the level of the board and lodging assessment.</P>
    <P>For means assessment purposes, students are treated no differently from a number of other categories of claimants such as smallholders or the self-employed whose income is allocated equally over the 52 weeks of the year, although in practice it may vary considerably over the course of a year.</P>
    <P>I do not think generally it is a good idea that students should get into the habit of signing on during the course of their academic studies because it creates a &ldquo;signing on&rdquo; ethos.  Perhaps it is a matter for another Minister such as the Minister for Education.  I cannot change the rules.  To do so for students would open up the floodgates to lots of other categories and would change the whole <Col N="1149" /> basis of assessing means for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>For that and other reasons I am of the opinion that the method of assessment is fair and reasonable and I have no plans to change it.</P>

      <P>At this stage the House would hear a two minute statement from Deputy Finucane, were it not for the fact that the Deputy is detained at a meeting of the Select Committee dealing with the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.

      <P>The fact that the board of the Adelaide Hospital felt compelled to go public about the manner in which the Department of Health has reneged on their commitment not to put the hospital under financial pressure pending its future being decided, finally exposes a scandal which the Government would prefer to keep under wraps.  Despite explicit assurances by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, that the requirements of this unique hospital would be met in the short term, successive Ministers for Health have reneged on these assurances.  The Adelaide Hospital required an additional £800,000 to operate merely at the same level as last year.  This was refused.  This decision followed on a similar refusal the previous <Col N="1150" /> year.  It is death by a thousand cuts.  The Adelaide Hospital is being systematically undermined.  A small hospital can only take so many cuts before patient care is put at risk.</P>
      <P>From the viewpoint of my constituents in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Walkinstown and Rathcoole this controversy highlights the confusion at the heart of Government concerning the Regional Hospital at Tallaght.  On 26 March 1992 the Minister for Health told me in the Dáil:</P>
      <P>I did suggest to the Adelaide Hospital &mdash; and I am not laying down laws &mdash; that they might consider remaining where they were providing a vital service in the inner city</P>
      <P>Today the Minister says the Adelaide is going to Tallaght.  Does the Minister know what is going on?  Did David Kennedy report on alternative methods of funding by the end of April as the Minister has promised?  If so what are those proposals?  When will construction at Tallaght commence?  Will the valuable ethos and experience of the Adelaide be lost to the new regional hospital?  Will the Minister make a clear statement assuring the future of the Adelaide Hospital?</P>

      <P>First of all, I should state that I can appreciate the concerns of the Adelaide Hospital as expressed by their chairman, Dr. David McConnell.  However, I would like to reassure the House that the Government remain fully committed to the Tallaght Hospital Project.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House last month during the debate on the Private Members' motion on the matter, I had requested the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group to expedite their examination of the project.  I understand that the group, which is chaired by Professor David Kennedy, is completing its work and will be submitting its report to me in the near future.  Following receipt of the report I will be bringing the matter urgently to Government for decision.  I have said that on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the role of the Adelaide Hospital in the management of the <Col N="1151" /> Tallaght Hospital I would like to put on record again in the House the Government's commitment to ensure that the position of the Adelaide Hospital, as a focus for Protestant participation in the health services and their particular denominational ethos, will be continued in the new hospital.  What I said was only in case they did not want to move.  We would please them.  That was my reason.</P>

      <P>As regards the <Col N="1152" /> hospital's present financial position, I accept that in common with all health agencies they have and are continuing to experience difficulties in living within their approved allocations.  I accept also that because of their special teaching role it would be desirable to fund the Adelaide so that they could use all their available beds.  However, because of the overall restrictions on resources for the health services this has not proved possible. I regret that the hospital should take the view that their funding difficulties arise for any reason other than the general restrictions on resources available to the health services.  My Department in recent discussions and correspondence with the hospital have already made a number of suggestions to help ease their difficulties during the current year.  While the hospital have not yet responded to these suggestions, I agreed on radio this morning, in company with Dr. David McConnell, to preside over a meeting between his board and my Department to explore ways and means of coping with their present difficulties. I have made this clear already and I do so again.  I would ask Deputy Rabbitte to be more positive in his contributions in this House.</P>

      <P>The provision in the 1992 Public Capital Programme for the housing construction programme provides for the financing of work during the year on the 1,330 houses in progress at 31 December 1991 and 1,500 authorised &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, including those carried forward from 1991.  I am satisfied that this level of activity, supplemented by casual vacancies which arise in the normal course and the various measures in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i> will cater for the housing needs of some 7,000 households in 1992 compared to about 5,100 last year.  This represents a reasonable response to current housing needs.</P>
      <P>Details of the allocations to individual authorities for their 1992 housing construction programme were given in the reply to Questions Nos. 127 and 128 of 5 March 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the replies to Questions No. 336 of 18 February, 1992 and to Questions Nos. 29, 122, 143, 145 and 148 of 25 March, 1992.</P>
      <P>Within the EC, controls arising from the Montreal Protocol on the production and use of CFCs and other ozone depleting substances are operated on a community-wide basis.  This regional approach is rational and effective; overall Community sales of the main CFCs have been reduced by more than 40 per cent between 1986 and 1990.</P>
      <P>CFCs and related substances are not produced in Ireland and our overall use of them is small.  The latest figures available to my Department show annual national usage of the main CFCs at approximately 2,500 tonnes; this represents a decrease broadly in line with the pattern in the Community as a whole. My Department has had good co-operation with the CII, FICI and the principal users in encouraging the earliest possible phase out here of ozone depleting substances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the agreement <Col N="962" /> reached at the Environment Council on 23 March 1992, the EC Commission has submitted a draft regulation providing for the elimination of production and use of the main ozone depleting substances by 31 December 1995.  Ireland has fully supported this timetable.</P>
    <P>Studies are continuing worldwide on the implications of ozone layer depletion for human health.  The Department of Health, with whom my office is in contact, is monitoring this aspect closely.</P>

      <P>The figures mentioned in the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil on 5 May 1992 refer to the EC aid being provided under the various operational programmes-actions comprehended by the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989-1993 (CSF).</P>
      <P>One of the major innovations in the reform of the Structural Funds adopted in 1988 involved the switch from a project-based to a programme-based approach. Previously the Commission decided on EC assistance on the basis of individual projects submitted by member states. The switch to the programme-approach has led to the reduction of bureaucratic delays, has streamlined administrative procedures and has speeded up the flow of payments to member states.  Information on the implementation of the Community Support Framework and operational programmes is therefore provided on a programme rather than on a project basis.</P>
      <P>As regards the location of programme expenditure, a comprehensive breakdown of structural spending in the seven sub-regions set up under the CSF was placed in the Dáil Library on 26 February 1992.</P>

    <P>The question of water quality is, primarily, one for the Department of the Environment and the local authorities but the Commissioners have made certain provisions in the by-Laws recently introduced pursuant to the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, in relation to the discharge or deposition of substances into the navigation and on other matters relative <Col N="982" /> to the navigation and the construction of vessels using it.  These regulations should reduce pollution due to boats and vessels using the Navigation.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Commissioners to enforce these by-laws to the fullest possible extent.  A by-laws requiring vessels to be fitted with holding tanks for sewerage will be made as soon as adequate pump-out facilities are provided by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>It is a fact of life that gas reserves are developed only when long term take-or-pay contracts are available to the producers. Such an arrangement exists between Bord Gáis Éireann and the Marathon Company for the exploitation of the gas in the Kinsale Head and Ballycotton fields.  A feature of such contracts is an agreed profile of offtakes for each year in the contract period, and if the gas is not used it must be paid for anyway.</P>

      <P>The price of gas to the ESB and NET, and the contract quantities involved, are the subject of commercial contracts with BGE, and the Deputy will understand that the details of those contracts are confidential.  No additional quantities of gas have been contracted by ESB in respect of the proposed plant, which would, I understand, burn either oil or gas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the price of gas to the domestic customer I would refer the Deputy to the tariffs laid out in the annual report of Bord Gáis Éireann which is laid before the Oireachtas each year.  BGE operates a standard tariff for Industrial/Commercial customers (copy herewith) which, I understand, will shortly be revised.  Bulk users of gas, i.e. with loads in excess of .25 m therms per annum, would generally contract with BGE for a supply of gas on conditions suitable to their requirements.  Such contracts are, again, confidential.</P>
      <P>As to the projected totals for each market sector, should the ESB proposal come to fruition, it is impossible to speculate in advance of a decision to proceed on the volumes that might be required in a dual-fired plant of that nature.

      <P>I met members of the Greenhills Residents Association on 29 April, 1992 and we discussed problems in relation to crime in the area.  In particular, the residents expressed concern at the problems caused by gangs of youths loitering in the area and the acts of vandalism carried out by such youths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with the <Col N="987" /> Garda authorities who have informed me that they are aware of the problems referred to.  They have also informed me that a number of youths have been convicted or dealt with under the Juvenile Liaison Officer scheme while a number of other youths are currently before the Courts in relation to crimes committed in Greenhills.  The area receives regular attention from foot and mobile patrols as well as from specialist units.  A community Garda is also allocated to the area and eight Neighbourhood Watch schemes, which liaise closely with the gardaí, are active in Greenhills.  The Garda authorities have assured me that they will continue to keep the situation in Greenhills under review.</P>
    <P>I am of course very much aware of the problems which can be caused by intimidatory behaviour on the part of gangs of youths, and I have already outlined to the House proposals which I am considering to update the law in relation to certain public order offences.  These proposals include the creation of offences relating to: (a) persons being found drunk (or under the influence of drugs) in such circumstances that they are a danger to themselves or others; (b) the use of threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour in a public place; and (c) disorderly conduct as, for instance, shouting, singing or boisterous conduct between the hours of 10.00 p.m. and 7.00 a.m. in circumstances which cause annoyance to other persons in the neighbourhood.  These new offences would carry the power of arrest and liability to substantial fines and, if drink is involved, the gardaí would have the power to confiscate it on the spot.</P>
    <P>I might add, for the information of the Deputy, that I am at present giving priority to the preparation of a new Juvenile Justice Bill which will update and replace existing legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these legislative reforms will considerably strengthen the hands of the gardaí in dealing with juvenile crime in this country.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the situation in relation to Randon Gas.  Since this question came to notice some years ago, my Department has been in continuous consultation with the Radiological.  Protection Institute of Ireland, formerly the Nuclear Energy Board.  The Institute has completed an investigation into all national schools in Counties Galway and Mayo including detailed technical surveys at the bulk of these schools.  A very small number of schools required further measurement of the gas level.  My Department is prepared to grant-aid any works necessary to deal with the problem in collaboration with the school authorities and having the fullest regard to the technical advices available.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific school referred to by the Deputy, certain remediation works were carried out in conjunction with an extension to the school.  It is being brought to my Department's attention that these measures have not proven as effective as was expected.  Officers from my Department, the Department of Energy and RPII visited the school last week and a side meeting has been arranged for tomorrow with an expert contractor with a view to implementing further measures urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in response to a question from the Deputy on 3 March last, the Government have initiated a wide ranging package of developments with a view <Col N="999" /> to effecting substantial improvements in the availability of services and accommodation for the young homeless.  The aim of this programme is to ensure that no young person should have to sleep rough on the streets of our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that considerable progress is being made. Over 40 additional places for the young homeless are being provided in Dublin; 12 of these are already available and I expect the balance to be in place shortly. New services are also being developed in Cork, Athlone, Limerick, Galway and Sligo which will provide about 30 extra places.</P>
    <P>Amongst the important new developments in the Eastern Health Board area are: a new emergency hostel providing 10 places for homeless girls is now in place at Sherrard House, Dublin 1; a new therapeutic unit for 8 difficult adolescents (boys and girls) operated by the Eastern Health Board near Naas Co. Kildare will open shortly; a new residential unit for 10 boys to be operated by the Los Angeles Society is due to open in Dalkey in June 1992; the hostel for homeless boys run by the Catholic Social Service Conference has been re-located from Percy Place to newly refurbished accommodation at Eccles Street resulting in an increase from 10 to 12 in the number of places; a new after-care service for up to 4 boys leaving that hostel has been established at Lennox Street.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board are taking a number of other initiatives, including: the establishment of an &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; social work service to deal exclusively with the young homeless; a &ldquo;Carers for Young People Scheme&rdquo; to provide family care for adolescents who have had difficulty adapting to other settings; and developing other short term accommodation such as digs, sheltered flats and semi-independent living accommodation.</P>
    <P>While the problem of youth homelessness arises mainly in the Dublin area, it is not, of course, confined to that area. Discussions have been held with the <Col N="1000" /> Chief Executive Officers of the other health boards concerning appropriate measures to assist the young homeless in their areas.  The aim is to ensure, as far as possible, that each health board is self-sufficient in residential places.  This is fully in keeping with the Child Care Act and the new obligations it imposes on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children.  Progress is being made on a number of fronts: a new hostel for homeless youth is being established in Athlone by a voluntary group in association with the Midland Health Board; a new residential service for 8-10 adolescent boys is being developed near Limerick by the Mid-Western Health Board; additional places have been provided at Stranorlar, Co. Donegal for children and adolescents with behavioural problems; a new hostel for homeless youngsters is being developed in Sligo by a voluntary body with support from the North-Western Health Board; the building of a new residential unit for teenage boys in Cork city is now completed and will open shortly.  A specialised foster care programme for difficult children is also being developed by the Southern Health Board; and a new hostel for homeless girls is being developed in Galway by the Western Health Board in association with a local voluntary group.</P>
    <P>When all of these developments are fully in place, they will represent a substantial addition to the range of facilities and services currently available to assist the young homeless.  As the Deputy can see from the developments which I have outlined, the problem of youth homelessness is being targeted by the Government for particular attention.  I might add that the need for further facilities to deal with this problem is being urgently examined by the health boards in consultation with the relevant voluntary agencies in the context of the additional £2 million for child care set aside in the budget.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the After-Hours Social Worker Service for the young homeless, which operates as part of the child care services provided by the Eastern Health Board.  The need for such a service was identified late last year in discussions which my colleague Chris Flood T.D., Minister of State had with both the Eastern Health Board and representatives of the various voluntary agencies working with the young homeless in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service was introduced by the Board, on a trial basis, with effect from 19 March.  A rostered social worker is <Col N="1002" /> on duty each night and at weekends. While there have been some initial teething problems, the service has been warmly welcomed by those agencies, both statutory and voluntary, who have come in contact with it.</P>
    <P>The operation of the service, will be comprehensively reviewed at the end of the initial three month period and at that point all aspects of the service, including staffing, will be evaluated.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1008" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides for a new system of subvention for nursing home care.  The drafting of regulations to implement the new system of subvention is at an advanced stage.  It is hoped to begin discussions shortly with nursing home interests, including the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association on the subvention regulations.  It is my intention to commence the Nursing Homes Act as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The question of capital allowances for private nursing homes is a matter for the Minister for Finance and I understand that the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association are in the course of making representations on the issue.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department to encourage a relationship of partnership and co-operation between health boards and the nursing home sector.  The new nursing home legislation, when implemented, will encourage a closer working arrangement between the boards and the nursing homes.</P>
      <P>While all health boards pay grants towards the cost of care of eligible patients in nursing homes, not all the grants which may be made to nursing homes under existing arrangements are paid by each health board.  The new system of subvention under the Nursing Homes Act will encourage greater standardisation of payments to nursing homes in all health boards.</P>
      <P>There are no statistics available on the number of people who leave nursing homes to return home because of inability to pay the fees, as this is a matter between the residents and the management of the nursing home.  However, if dependent elderly people decide to return home, community services are in operation in each health board area to support such persons in the home.  The carers allowance is one of the many supports and services which are designed to assist dependent people who live in the community.</P>

      <P>I am very aware of the excellent work being carried out by Aoibhneas in assisting victims of family violence.  Financial assistance is provided by the Eastern <Col N="1012" /> Health Board for the Aoibhneas Refuge. The allocation from the board in respect of the current year is £50,000 which represents an increase of 17.5 per cent over 1991.  The allocation for 1992 was agreed by the board with Aoibhneas based on their financial circumstances and expected expenditure during 1992.</P>
      <P>I understand that no indication has been given to the Eastern Health Board by Aoibhneas of any change in their financial circumstances since their discussions with the Board regarding their 1992 allocation.  The Eastern Health Board have indicated to me that they would be available to discuss with Aoibhneas any unforeseen difficulties which may have arisen since their last meeting.</P>

      <P>My Department is having discussions with the hospitals concerned on the question of equipment necessary for liver transplantation.  In 1992, my department allocated substantial funding for liver transplantation as follows: £300,000 to St. Vincent's Hospital and £100,000 to Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.</P>
      <P>It is intended that liver transplantation will recommence on a phased basis in Ireland from September of this year but it is not possible at this stage to say how many transplants will be carried out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991, 18 patients received liver transplants abroad.  Two of these patients required re-transplants.  In addition 14 patients were referred abroad for assessment and 6 of these are awaiting transplants.  <Col N="1013" /> This cost to the health boards was approximately £860,000.  (The final statement of accounts has not been received for all of these patients, thus the figures are provisional at this stage).</P>

      <P>The Agreements signed in Paris last October by all the Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge, provide for the holding of free and fair elections supervised by the UN.  The aim is to ensure that all the people of Cambodia will be able to vote democratically on the choice of a future Government for their country.  The United Nations has established the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to ensure that suitable conditions are created in the transitional period so that elections may be held not later than May 1993.  Through UNTAC, the UN will have a key role in safeguarding human rights, organising the election process, policing the ceasefire, demobilising the factions and ensuring the safe repatriation of refugees to the country from neighbouring Thailand. The military component of UNTAC, numbering some 15,000 personnel, will regroup the various forces in designated areas and supervise their demobilisation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement, supervised by the UN under the full authority of the Security Council, will guarantee to all the people of Cambodia a free and democratic choice and a future free from the horrors which characterised the despotic rule of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the number of hares killed at the coursing meeting in Clounanna in February 1992.</P>
      <P>I have obtained a report from the Irish Coursing Club on this particular meeting which indicated that the unusually high number of hares killed on the second day of the meeting could only be attributed to the unseasonable weather conditions which prevailed at the time.</P>
      <P>The surviving hares from the National Coursing Finals in Clonmel were, in accordance with now well established practice, released back to the wild at the conclusion of the meeting.  In accordance with common practice at premier meetings the hares were dosed for worms and coccidiosis before being released.  The result of the post-mortem examination which identified the disease in the hares referred to in the question was not available until a few days later.  None of the surviving hares were used at other coursing meetings.</P>

      <P>My Department is not satisfied that the person named held the number of ewes applied for under the 1989 and 1990 ewe premium schemes for the required 100 day retention period as only 140 ewes out of the 2,146 applied on under both those schemes in 1990 were found at a retention check on 8 June 1990.  Payment of premium cannot be made in this case, therefore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 to 223, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The minimum base area acceptable for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas appeal process is a townland.</P>
      <P>Any townland or DED in a non-disadvantaged area must first be admitted by the EC to the Community list of Less Favoured Areas and given disadvantaged areas status before re-classification from less to more severely handicapped status can be considered.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to rectify anomalies where individual farms are divided between townlands that are inside and outside the disadvantaged categories. The problem of farms which straddle the boundaries has existed since the start of the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme in 1975 and the Department has since then operated a system whereby farmers with split holdings are paid headage on an apportioned basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the complexity of the task involved in the analysis being carried out by the Panel and by the EC Commission it is not possible to set out a time-table for decisions pertaining to the extension of the disadvantaged areas.  However, I can confirm that the processing on computer of all the survey data is expected to be completed in the Autumn and at that stage the Appeals Panel will commence its examination of the survey results and make recommendations to <Col N="1033" /> the Department as to the areas to be included in a formal submission to the EC Commission.  In this regard, it is a matter for the Panel to decide whether further consultations with local farming groups are required before the recommendations to the Department are finalised. It will be appreciated that, in accordance with Protocol and established practice the contents of a formal submission to the EC by the Government of Ireland must remain confidential and information therein on detailed survey results cannot be released until a decision on new areas to be proposed for lessfavoured or disadvantaged status is made by the Commission.</P>

      <P>As already announced, 16 Irish groups have been approved for funding under the LEADER programme, which is the EC's own initiative on rural development.  Some £35 million is being provided for the groups &mdash; £21 million EC and £14 million Irish &mdash; between now and the end of 1993.  The groups will be expected to raise a similar amount in <Col N="1036" /> matching funds, making a total invest ment of £70 million over the life of the programme.</P>
      <P>The essence of LEADER is that while the group are being provided with global grants, the decisions on the investments to be undertaken rest entirely with the groups themselves.  Investment in the following activities may be funded: technical support for rural development such as surveys and assessments; vocational training and assistance for recruitment; rural tourism; small firms, crafts and local services; development and marketing of local agricultural, forestry and fishery products and other activities which contribute to the development of the groups' areas.</P>
      <P>The selected groups and their approved financial allocations are as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991 a qualified employee who is dismissed by reason of redundancy is entitled to receive a redundancy lump sum payment from his/her employer calculated in accordance with the Acts as follows: (a) a half week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable between the ages of 16 years and 41 years; (b) a week's pay for each year of employment continuous and reckonable over the age of 41 years; and (c) one week's pay.  The pay used for this calculation is the employee's gross weekly pay at the time he/she is given notice of redundancy, but subject to the statutory ceiling applying at the time.</P>
      <P>Records in my Department indicate that the person concerned was paid his statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement in full by his former employer on 11 July, 1990.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the calculation detailed above, taking into account the age of the person concerned, his 46 years of service and his gross weekly pay (which was below the ceiling applicable at the time), the amount paid in respect of his statutory redundancy entitlement was the equivalent of 35 weeks' pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employer is not legally obliged to pay an employee more than the statutory redundancy entitlement provided for in the Redundancy Payments Acts.  Redundancy compensation over and above the statutory entitlement is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the employer and the employee (or a trade union acting on his/her behalf).  If agreement cannot be reached through direct negotiations the matter can be referred <Col N="1040" /> to the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court or the Rights Commissioner Service for adjudication.</P>
    <P>I should add that in July, 1990 a Rights Commissioner recommended that the person concerned should be paid &ldquo;a redundancy lump sum in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Redundancy Payments Acts&rdquo; by his former employer.</P>

      <P>No prosecutions in relation to overtime working have been taken under these Acts during the past ten years.  In that regard, I should explain that my Department acts on the basis of complaints received under the relevant provisions of the Acts.  While queries in relation to those provisions have been received from time to time, no substantive complaints have arisen since 1988, the earliest year for which records are now available.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to mention that, in the context of a commitment made by the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, my Department is currently reviewing the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 and 1944 with a view to the enactment of up-to-date legislation reflecting modern conditions and which will also take account of the provisions of the proposed EC Directive on the Organisation of Working Time.  It is my intention that this review will be completed before the end of the currency of the Programme.</P>

      <P>My Department has no specific plans to provide crechè facilities directly for women who wish to return to the workforce.  As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the role of the Government in the provision of child care services for working parents is to stimulate the development of child care services by employers, individually and collectively, including the promotion of child care partnerships between public authorities and employers.  In discharge of that role, the Government is taking a range of measures designed to improve child care facilities for working parents. These measures were set out in my reply to Priority Question No. 2 by Deputy Theresa Ahearn on 30 April last.</P>
      <P>In relation to the State's own position as an employer, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the introduction of child care facilities on a progressive basis in the public service with the State providing the physical facilities and the staff paying the running costs.  The first civil service crechè has recently opened.  Concerning the provision of crechè facilities by FÁS to promote female participation in training and occupational mobility, the setting up of crechè facilities in the vicinity of FÁS training centres and the possibility of providing such facilities in partnership with local industry and local community interests is being pursued on a pilot basis under the NOW Programme.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that FÁS maintains records of participants on the Social Employment Schemes.  Details of such records are a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Social Employment Scheme is to give as many long term unemployed as possible opportunities to become involved in a work related situation on a part-time basis for 52 weeks. Normally participants are not re-engaged within 12 months.  However in exceptional circumstances the re-engagement of persons who have completed projects has been allowed.  I am on record as saying that I think it is desirable to keep the number of extensions to a minimum in view of the numbers of long term unemployed awaiting opportunities to participate in the scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline (1) the average length of time taken to pay out statutory redundancy payments, (2) when it is hoped to pay out the statutory redundancy payments to the 220 workers who lost their jobs on 6 April 1992 when a company (details supplied) was put into liquidation.</Quest>

      <P>Statutory lump sums under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, are normally payable by the employers concerned at the time of dismissal.  In cases where employers refuse or fail to pay statutory redundancy lump sums the employees can apply to my Department for payment from the Social Insurance Fund.  In such cases, the lump sums are paid from the Fund on average within 4 to 6 weeks of the date of receipt of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the particular case referred to in the Question, my Department received <Col N="1043" /> applications for payment of statutory redundancy lump sums from the Social Insurance Fund on 27 April 1992 in respect of 205 former employees of the company concerned.  Of these, 200 will be paid their statutory redundancy entitlement from the Fund within the next two weeks, well within the average time-frame for such payments.</P>
    <P>In the remaining five cases, it is necessary for my Department to clarify certain details of their claims with the Liquidator. As soon as the further information is received the lump sum payments due to the employees concerned will be paid without delay.</P>
