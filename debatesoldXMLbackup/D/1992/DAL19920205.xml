      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I had referred to the cut in the promised sum of £12 million under the <i>Programme for Econmomic and Social Progress</i>, which sum has now been reduced to £2 million in 1992, the remaining £10 million being deferred until 1993 and 1994.  Obviously this is a total reneging on the promise given the farming organisations in the summer and autumn of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also made reference to the fact that headage payments subsidies and premia nowadays form the bulk of the basic <Col N="1001" /> income for many farmers, not only small but medium to large farmers and that there is a necessity to have an ordered system of payment where those headage payments, subsidies and premia are concerned. The hit and miss system which has been operating for some time past is not good enough.  People are depending on these payments, just like social welfare recipient would depend on his payment at the labour exchange or his cheque in the post.  There must be some ordered manner in which this money is paid.  For instance, headage which was promised to farmers three or four months ago has not yet been paid.  These people have bills to pay and commitments to meet and some of them are virtually destitute. It is not good enough to have a system where payments are withheld to bolster Exchequer funds and the state of the economy.  There should be something much more rational.</P>
    <P>The beef premium scheme &mdash; an EC scheme &mdash; has been handled in a disgraceful manner in this country.  We should be able to help farmers to get the maximum from that type of scheme. Instead, up to 20 per cent of applicants are being disqualified because of technicalities. It is incredible that people who are depending on this payment for their livelihood should be disqualified on such grounds.  As the forms are quite difficult to fill in, assistance should be given to those people rather than have them totally disqualified not just for the current year, but, if the form is filled in incorrectly, from payments for the succeeding year also.  It is a crazy system.  I ask the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; whether she is to continue as a Member of the Cabinet or as an ordinary backbencher we do not know yet &mdash; to convey to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance our disquiet over this very unfair method of administering an EC scheme.  I am sure she has come across it in her constituency clinics.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the method in which they are being disqualified.  The departmental officials should be there to help people rather than put a pen through their applications and disqualify them.</P>
      <P>I want to refer specifically to an item in the budget with which I agree wholeheartedly, that is, the levy of £2 million on the banks to partly pay for the protection services being provided by the Garda and the Army for the movement of money between banks and within banks.  I asked a number of questions prior to last Wednesday's budget on this subject and they were answered yesterday. Some of the answers are illuminating. I note that in 1991 the cost of providing Army personnel to safeguard the moneys being transferred between banks was £1.6 million approximately. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice was unable to give me an exact figure. He said the last time a calculation had been done on the cost to the Garda of providing these escorts was 1986 &mdash; six years ago &mdash; was £1 million approximately. We do not know whether that is £2 million or £3 million today, but definitely it is considerably greater than the £1 million estimated in 1986.</P>
      <P>In one of my questions I asked that all the expense incurred by the Garda and the Army would be paid for by the Associated Banks.  That part of the question was deleted because it anticipated the debate on the budget which is currently before the Dáil.  That part of the question was ruled out and a letter to that effect was signed by your good self, a Cheann Comhairle, and that is understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there has been a spate of robberies recently amounting in losses to the victims of from thousands to millions of pounds.  It is a matter of grave concern to me, and I am sure to other <Col N="1003" /> Members, that apparently huge sums of money can be stolen quite easily.  It is time for a major review of the security services available in this country where banks and other financial institutions are concerned.  The thought of £2.75 million falling into the hands of subversives &mdash; as is most likely the case in the recent big bank robbery &mdash; is frightening.  How many lives are likely to be lost when those who got their hands on that money start using it?  Will it be dozens or hundreds? How many tonnes of semtex, how many submachine guns, rifles and revolvers could that money buy?</P>
    <P>This robbery happened because of inadequate security arrangements.  I do not think anybody was even faintly aware of the insecure nature of the building in Lisduggan, Waterford, from which the £2.75 million was stolen.  We should bear in mind that sometimes that building holds as much as £10 million and a local building contractor said that access to the building could have been gained by merely using a hammer and chisel.  Three individuals were seen on the roof of the building two days prior to the robbery; it was not guarded 24 hours a day, although it could contain up to £10 million.  Access was obviously relatively easy and the alarm system must have been inferior or obsolete as it did not provide a deterrent. The whole thing is frightening.  Is it any wonder that people make the glib remark that banks in Ireland might be called cash and carries rather than banks?  The simplicity with which the money was removed is unacceptable.  This item in the budget is very much in order and I feel the banks should pay the full amount involved.</P>
    <P>I want to express my disgust at the banks' statement following the budget that they would pass this £2 million on to their customers in the form of charges.  I think they have a confounded cheek and should be told so.  These banks make huge profits every year, though some have actually made investments particularly in the United States and in Britain where they have incurred huge losses, but overall they make huge profits.  If <Col N="1004" /> the four associated banks cannot pay £2 million annually to assist in the security of those establishments, then they should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a Government at the time of the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland whose liabilities could have been into billions of pounds. The Government were forced to underwrite the AIB and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to the extent of £400 million or £500 million to prevent a run on the bank and a possible collapse of our banking system.  We had to intervene and underwrite the losses to the extent of £400 million to £500 million.  Those involved are the same individuals who lecture us, whether we be in Government or in Opposition but in particular when we are in Government about fiscal rectitude. Those people put the whole banking system of this State in jeopardy by their own incompetence.</P>
    <P>As I said before in this House, the board of AIB were lucky they did not go to prison.  We are too soft when it comes to dealing with people who have made major mistakes and put the security of the country, in particular the well-being of financial institutions, at stake.  Nobody was penalised as a result.  The only person who stood to be penalised was the Irish taxpayer.  The Government were berated at the time because they had to provide £400 million to £500 million to stop a possible collapse of the banking system although it was totally outside their control.</P>
    <P>The day has come when the present &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; attitude in regard to security in banks will have to change.  The banks should be asked to provide their own security within the banks.  If it has to be armed security so be it, but the day should be over when people can walk in with a sawn-off shot gun, a revolver or an imitation gun to steal thousands or tens of thousands of pounds.  The day should be over when well organised criminals, be they subversives or the hard core of the criminal element, can go to holding centres to steal millions of pounds.  The day should be gone when these people can walk up to unarmed <Col N="1005" /> gardaí, put a gun to their heads and threaten their lives.  People must fight back.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating that the gardaí should be armed but the day has come when the special task forces which existed some years ago should be resurrected or reformed.  We should let hardened criminals know they are likely to meet armed gardaí inside or outside banks or other financial institutions when they go to rob them.  They should not be left go unchallenged and the sooner we face up to reality the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity today to speak on the budget and, in particular, about my own Department, the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The 1992 provision for the health services, as reflected in the Abridged Estimates, is clear evidence of the Government's level of commitment to the health services.  The net 1992 Estimate is over £1,500 million pounds.  This figure represents an increase of £180.3 million or 13.4 per cent over the original net Estimate for 1991.  This represents over one-fifth of all Government expenditure on supply services for 1992.  The allocation of such a significant sum for the provision of health services in a time of fiscal restraint cannot but emphasise the position which the health services occupy within this Government's overall priorities.  This provision will make it possible to maintain services at approved 1991 levels and also provides for a number of important developments in acute hospitals; services for people with AIDS; services for the mentally handicapped, including the development of a medical genetics service; the continuation of a number of capital projects, including those at Ardkeen, Sligo and the Rotunda, and the commencement of a number of new projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget presented to the House last Wednesday contains further evidence of the commitment towards the development of the health services in a manner consistent with the objectives agreed between the social partners and given <Col N="1006" /> expression in the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  Under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the social partners agreed upon a comprehensive and fundamental plan of action for the development of the health services, with the overall strategic objective of providing a comprehensive, equitable and efficient health care system, with a strong commitment to a patient-centred service. The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> places particular emphasis on the development of community based primary care services.  I am happy to be able to report to the House that this budget builds on the start made last year in the implementation of the Goverment's commitment to the development of community services.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Health three months ago I was very concerned at the waiting list for services in mental handicap and I made the immediate improvement of these services one of my main priorities.  The Government are determined to improve services for people with mental handicap and I have repeatedly stressed this point.  In particular I provided outline details of my intentions in my statement to the Dáil on 11 December and in the statement I issued following the announcement of the Estimates.</P>
    <P>With the additional allocation of £3 million announced in the budget, and the additional funding which I have provided from within the Estimates, there will be an additional injection of £10 million in services for persons with a mental handicap this year.  This will enable significant improvements in services to be put in place this year.  Much of the ground work has already been done in planning and the additional services will be coming on stream very quickly.</P>
    <P>I should like to outline how we propose to use this extra allocation this year. Additional residential and day places will be provided.  The total number of places involved will be about 400 and they will be allocated according to need and in accordance with the plans for the development of services for persons with <Col N="1007" /> a mental handicap which have been prepared by the health boards in co-operation with the co-ordinating committees. Further respite facilities will also be developed.  This will mean that about 550 additional families will be able to have a break of one month in the year.  This is a significant provision and was recommended to me by the various deputations I met in regard to the provision of resources for mental handicap services.  I am only too well aware of the value families and carers put on this type of service. The additional places will be spread over the entire country in accordance with the plans submitted to me and the Department.</P>
    <P>At present many families suffer considerable hardship and make an enormous sacrifice in caring at home for a son or daughter with a mental handicap who may be advancing in years.  I am initiating a home care or outreach programme to meet the needs of those families.  The concept envisages the provision of varying degrees of help and support to the person with mental handicap and to their family.  It is my intention that the scheme will work in a very flexible way and could, for example, involve a more adaptable and out of hours use of day care facilities. The scheme in turn should provide a service for between 600 to 700 families.</P>
    <P>Crisis intervention and services for disturbed persons will also be developed while services for children will be expanded by the provision of extra early intervention teams and centres for child education and development.</P>
    <P>While it is of course necessary to address the needs of those who have a handicap we must also improve our efforts in the preventive area.  It is important to reduce the prevalence of genetic disorders by means of the provision of a specialist genetic counselling service to people for whom there is a risk of handicap which is genetically determined in themselves or their families.  I am pleased to be in a position to initiate this service at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1992 have already <Col N="1008" /> been issued to the health boards and the voluntary hospitals and I will be issuing them to the mental handicap agencies next week.  I am glad that these allocations will be adequate to meet their ongoing needs.  When account is taken of the 1992 allocations to the health boards and agencies who provide services for the mentally handicapped and the additional £10 million being provided this year for services development the estimated 1992 expenditure on a range of services to people with mental handicap will be close to £200 million.</P>
    <P>The additional funds allocated this year represent the single largest annual investment ever in mental handicap services and I am glad I have been able to do this.  Services will now be maintained at these increased levels of provision and improved on.  I am fully aware that more needs to be done but we feel we have made a good start.  This substantial increase shows that we have a real commitment to that area.  In the debate on the Opposition's Private Members' motion on mental handicap services, on the Estimates and on the budget, in answers to Dáil Questions and when I met various groups, I stressed my commitment to improving such services which was evident in the Government talks on the allocation of resources in the budget and the Estimates.  I am glad to record that a firm commitment was given to provide those moneys.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to all who work in the area of mental handicap. Since Christmas I have met nearly 20 groups from around the country who deal in one way or another with services for mentally handicapped people; the groups comprise voluntary and statutory agencies.  I am heartened by the way they approach their task in such a caring, dedicated way, the very obvious care and commitment to the people in their care and their zeal in making submissions and putting forward their case.  For me it was an endorsement of what I have always felt about this area and I am pledging anew my commitment to it.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, represents <Col N="1009" /> the most comprehensive reform of the law in relation to the care and protection of children since the foundation of the State.  It is among the most enlightened social legislation ever to have been enacted by the Oireachtas and, indeed, received a great measure of cross-party support in the various deliberations by committees in relation to the Bill.  It is one of the finest examples of what can be done when there is a strong commitment to certain legislation.</P>
    <P>It provides a secure legal framework for the future development of our child care services.  It envisages a fundamental change in orientation from a system rooted in charity and crisis management to one in which the emphasis is on prevention, participation and welfare rights. The principles embodied in the new legislation will shape public policy in this area into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Act contains a wealth of new and improved provisions designed to promote the welfare of children.  These range from granting health boards new powers to provide child care and family support services, the introduction of new legal procedures to enable the health boards and the Garda to intervene where children are being neglected or abused to new legal controls on pre-school services and children's residential centres. Among the many other detailed provisions are legal representation for children involved in care proceedings; new powers to enable the courts to appoint guardians <i>ad litem</i>; a new approach to the question of parental access to children in care; controls on the sale of solvents to children and a requirement on health boards to provide support and assistance to children leaving care.</P>
    <P>Given the scale and complexity of the new legislative provisions, it has always been recognised by all sides of the House and by the various interest groups that the Act would have to be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years. It is clear that the implementation of the Act will require a sustained programme of investment to provide additional staff in the community, to develop new and improved residential and community <Col N="1010" /> facilities and to evolve locally based responses.  The Government are committed to providing the additional resources needed to bring the Act fully into operation as soon as possible.  As a first step, a sum of £1 million was set aside in last year's budget to fund essential developments preparatory to the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Among the important new developments approved during 1991 were: 30 additional social workers; a new therapeutic unit for difficult adolescents to be operated by the Eastern Health Board; a new emergency hostel for homeless girls in Dublin; new hostels for homeless youth in Galway, Sligo and Athlone; new residential services for adolescent boys in Dublin, Cork and Limerick; new child psychiatric services in the North-Eastern, South-Eastern and Mid-Western Health, Board areas.  The full year cost of the developments approved during 1991 is estimated at almost £3 million and full provision for this expenditure has been included in the 1992 Health Estimate and in the allocations notified to health boards.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to build on the considerable progress made during 1991 so that we can bring substantial elements of the Child Care Act into operation during the current year.  As the House will be aware, the Minister for Finance announced in the budget that a special allocation of £2 million will be made available for this purpose in 1992.  This is in addition to the £3 million already in the system and brings our investment in the Act this year to almost £5 million. The additional moneys will be used to give effect to a number of important provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to bring most of Part II of the Act into operation during the first half of this year.  The provisions involved include: section 3 which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and empowers them to provide a comprehensive range of child care and family support services; section 5 which imposes <Col N="1011" /> a statutory duty on health boards to provide accommodation for homeless children; section 6 which requires health boards to provide or ensure the provision of an adoption service in their area; section 7 which requires each health board to establish a child care advisory committee to advise and assist them in the performance of their functions under the new legislation and sections 9 and 10 which will enable health boards to make arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide services on their behalf and to grant-aid them for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, who is with me this morning. The implementation and monitoring of the child care Act is under his aegis and he has made an enormous input to our deliberations on the matter.  He works constantly with the people who operate in the middle of all the work which needs to be done.  He has an extraordinarily sensitive feeling for the area and by working with him and building on what he has already done we can achieve much through the Act.  We are both fully committed to it and the Department of Health are lucky to have the expertise of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of IMPACT about three weeks ago and again yesterday &mdash; the union represents people working in the child care area &mdash; and we had a very thorough discussion.  Very fine ideas were advanced as to how we would move as a result of the implementation of these sections of the Act.</P>
    <P>The additional moneys will enable health boards, in association with the voluntary sector to begin to develop a comprehensive range of child care and family support services, to recruit additional social workers, child care workers, child psychologists and child psychiatrists and to develop family resources centres and other special initiatives for families facing particular difficulties.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Sherlock asked about services for the elderly and I am sure his colleague will relate what I intend to say.</P>

      <P>Because of technology, the Deputy may not have to.  I am very pleased to be able to initiate very necessary improvements in services for the elderly from the additional funds made available in the budget and in the Estimates.  I have been able to convey approval to both the Mater and Meath hospitals in Dublin to the setting up in each location of a specialist unit for the elderly comprising assessment and rehabilitation facilities.  This will entail the employment of a consultant geriatrician on each site plus the recruitment of complementary nursing and paramedical staff.  Also, I have authorised the Eastern Health Board to provide as a matter of urgency 26 additional extended care places.  I will be announcing the provision of additional long stay places later in the context of the implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. I intend to bring this Act into force later in the year and I am confident it will contribute in a major way to the care of the elderly in our community.  The regulations to give effect to the Act are being prepared at present.</P>
      <P>Time does not allow me to go into detail on the improvements which are being made in many other areas of the health services.  These include improved services for AIDS sufferers, the opening of additional new hospital facilities at Dublin, Waterford and Wexford.  I have concentrated here today specifically on service improvements related to the budget given that it is the budget we are debating and that we had an opportunity the week before Christmas to debate the Health Estimates.</P>
      <P>While I am glad of the improvements I have been able to put in place I am also conscious that more needs to be done in certain areas, such as mental handicap. However, I would like to emphasise that the improvements which have been put in place will be maintained in future years and provide an excellent basis on which to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have set themselves <Col N="1013" /> the task of putting the nation's finances on a sound footing and I am happy to say that in this they are being most successful. At the same time, the Government have set themselves the task of reforming the taxation system and of ensuring that the social needs of our society are given a high priority.  It will also be very clear from what I have said about the improvements in the health services as a result of this budget that the Government have a sympathetic and responsive approach to social issues.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to all those who work in the health service.  Since Christmas I have set myself a schedule for visiting hospitals, community groups, institutions and organisations, and, in cases where it is not possible for me to visit these institutions, for their representatives to visit me.  This has been an extraordinary learning process for me. As I said earlier in regard to people who work with the mentally handicapped, all the people who work in the health service take their jobs very seriously and are very committed to them.  I want to put it on the record that this gives the lie to those who constantly complain about our health services.  Of course, we could all do with more money; indeed every service-providing Government Department could say the same thing.  However, for commentators to constantly bemoan what is happening in our health services does a disservice to those in our health services who work so diligently.  I want to pay tribute to the men and women of extraordinary calibre who work in our health service, and who are devoted to their jobs.  I am very appreciative of the work being done by the people in our health services.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

      <P>The kindest thing that can be said about the budget is that it is a major non-event which fails to take any significant steps to tackle the major social and economic problems facing the country. It will have about as much lasting impact as its author's bungled bid for the Fianna Fáil leadership &mdash; no matter how he tries the numbers will not add up. <Col N="1014" /> Since the budget debate gives us an opportunity of championing the case of the underdog, I want to take this opportunity to wish the Minister for Health every success in her efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>If one believes that unemployment at a level approaching 300,000 is satisfactory, that our tax system is fair and just and that people on social welfare are well enough off, then this could clearly be regarded as a good budget.  However, if like The Workers' Party one believes that our unemployment level is a national scandal, that our tax system is grossly unfair to the PAYE sector, who continue to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, and that social welfare rates must be substantially increased, then this</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conference of the Major Religious Superiors of Ireland have accurately described this as a budget of omissions.  It would be hard to improve on the summary of their response to the budget where they point out that there was no redistribution to ensure that everyone has sufficient income for a minimally adequate standard of living; a complete failure to close the gap between the poor and the better off &mdash; in fact, the gap has been widened; little attempt to tackle widespread rural poverty; a totally inadequate programme to tackle unemployment; no significant action to tackle child poverty; no significant changes which would make it easier for unemployed people to work when jobs do not exist, that is, working towards developing themselves, their communities or the wider society; no serious attempts to tackle poverty traps; no evidence that the emerging housing crisis is to be tackled; no evidence to suggest that the Government recognise the need for a comprehensive integrated approach to tackle poverty and social division; and no indication that the Government recognise that social welfare alone will not eliminate the serious deprivation being endured by large numbers of Irish people.  This is not the verdict of an Opposition political party with an axe to grind or a group of academics with no experience of the real world but the considered response of a group of <Col N="1015" /> people who on a daily basis deal with the social problems created by successive Governments and successive budgets of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much in his speech of the fact that the level of social welfare increases, at 4 per cent, was expected to be slightly above the rate of inflation.  We do not, of course, know what the actual inflation rate will be and many commentators have suggested that it may increase because of the increase in the standard rate of VAT.  However, even if the increases are in line with inflation, they are not good enough.  The practice of increasing social welfare rates in line with inflation would only be acceptable if the basic rates were satisfactory.  This is clearly not the case.  Most rates are still way below the levels, increased for inflation, recommended in 1985 by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Even with the extra increase for those on the lowest level, many people will still be expected to exist on just £53 per week. How many people in this House could exist on just £53 per week?  It is a derisory sum.  Many of the stockbrokers and Right wing economists who regularly lecture the public about the need to reduce Government expenditure would spend as much on a bottle of champagne in a Leeson Street night club.</P>
    <P>People on incomes as high as the Taoiseach's and people on equivalent incomes in the private sector will get as much benefit from this year's budget alone as a result of the reductions in the tax rates &mdash; which may be of the order of £2,500 &mdash; as the entire annual income of somebody on social welfare.</P>
    <P>In addition, while the social welfare rates will not be increased until late July, VAT increases will come into operation on 1 March.  Therefore, people will face an increase in the cost of adult clothing and footwear within a matter of weeks but will have to wait for almost six months before they get their extra few bob in social welfare.  Why is it possible for Governments to always implement measures which bring them in extra money within a matter of weeks, but <Col N="1016" /> defer for months measures which might put some badly needed extra money into the pockets and purses of those on social welfare?  Up to the early eighties social welfare increases were paid at the beginning of April.  Since then they have been gradually pushed back and back.  The Government should now revert to paying them in April.</P>
    <P>One of the matters of most concern must be the systematic reduction in the proportion of gross national product spent on social welfare, despite the huge increase in unemployment and the irrefutable evidence of growing poverty.  In 1986 expenditure on all social services, such as education, health care, social welfare, housing and subsidies, amounted to 29.2 per cent of GNP.  This year it is likely to be less than 27 per cent.  In 1986 expenditure on social welfare represented 14.9 per cent of GNP.  This year it is likely to be around 13.8 per cent. This does not reflect the actions of a Government with any sense of social responsibility.  How can the Minister justify the systematic reduction in the share of national wealth which they allocate to those on social welfare when poverty and unemployment are increasing?</P>
    <P>One of the most disappointing aspects of the budget is its total failure to increase child benefit.  There is a very substantial body of research which shows that people who are at greatest risk of poverty are children, especially when they have been born into large, low income families. Again all the relevant research has pointed to the importance of child benefit as the most direct way of reducing the risk. Yet the Government have for several years frozen the level of child benefit.  If we are to make any progress in this area, child benefit must be increased substantially. Ideally there should be a graduated rate which would take account of the fact that it costs a lot more to feed and clothe a teenager than a two year old child.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, what the budget shows is that the Progressive Democrats have won the argument in the Cabinet hands down.  Not only do they dictate who can be in the Cabinet, and even who <Col N="1017" /> can be leader of Fianna Fáil, but they also dictate Government policy on taxation. The changes in the budget reflect the total preoccupation of the Progressive Democrats with reducing tax rates to the virtual exclusion of other aspects of taxation. Lowering the tax rates is not the most progressive way to reform the tax system.  Widening the tax bands and raising the tax threshold would have been more progressive and would help much more those who are in real need but, of course, the Progressive Democrats are not interested in helping those in real need.  Their priority is to reduce the tax burden on the well off, and they have had their way.  Look at the impact of the tax changes in the budget: a married couple with two children on a gross income of £10,000 per annum will benefit to the extent of about £95 per year, or less than £2 per week; a couple with two children and a gross income of £30,000 per year will gain an additional £743, and a couple with two children and on £75,000 per year will end up with an extra £2,500, in other words, the same amount as the annual income of a person on the basic rate of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Up to 1975 the highest rate of tax was 80 per cent and now the highest rate will be 48 per cent.  While the reduction in the rate will help many people on low incomes, it is a present to those who do not need and do not deserve it.  We make no bones about this; we would like whatever tax relief is available to go to the low and middle income groups.  Many more people must be taken out of the tax net.  The increase in the general exemption limit of £100 for a single person and £200 for a couple is totally inadequate.  It may take a few thousand people out of the tax net temporarily, but as soon as they get the increases due under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> they will be back in the tax net again.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that people who are officially considered by, say, the Combat Poverty Agency to be living below the poverty line are paying tax.  It is ludicrous that between 11 per cent and 18 per cent of those living in poverty are paying tax <Col N="1018" /> and that in more than half these cases they pay £20 per week or more.  People on low incomes must be taken out of the tax net, and this can be done by substantially increasing the income limit. The level at which people begin to pay income tax should be raised to at least £100 a week for a single person and £200 per week for a couple.</P>
    <P>While the Minister did move to close off some areas of tax avoidance and evasion, these tended to be the small beer, but the real rip-offs where the big money is made, remain relatively unscathed.  No doubt the highly paid tax advisers and experts are already devising new schemes and new strokes to enable their clients to continue to avoid their financial obligations to society.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the budget more disappointing than in its failure to come up with any significant measure to deal with our appalling unemployment problem. The Government may approvingly quote impressive trade figures and higher than average growth rates, but the most appropriate way to gauge the success or failure of an economy is surely by the number of people in gainful, productive work.  This is the only meaningful measure.  It measures the success or failure of our economy, not in terms of figures on a balance sheet, but in human terms.  Judged by this criterion our economy is a total disaster.  There are almost 270,000 on the live register &mdash; 20 per cent of the labour force, more than twice the average rate of the EC.  When those on pre-retirement schemes are taken into account the figure is around 283,000 and when those on training schemes are added the figure is well in excess of 300,000.</P>
    <P>Against this background one would have expected that unemployment would have dominated the Minister's speech. Instead it got four and a half pages out of a speech which ran to more than 60 pages.  Most of the four and a half pages were devoted to simply announcing further details of the new employment and training scheme which had already been announced on a number of occasions. The Minister had nothing new to say, <Col N="1019" /> no hope to offer the unemployed, no comfort for mothers and fathers of school going children who despair of them ever getting a job, irrespective of their qualifications.</P>
    <P>Government's insist that they cannot make jobs, but of course the decisions Minister's take in preparing the budget can have a crucial impact on the whole job creation area.  The public capital programme has a central role to play in job creation.  Not only does it create jobs directly, but employment is also created indirectly through sub-contractors, suppliers and so on.  The public capital programme this year is just £1,879 million &mdash; almost exactly the same as it was ten years ago, in 1982, when the figure was £1,858 million.  If the 1982 figure has been simply increased in line with inflation, it would now be around £3,250 million.  In other words, the public capital programme for 1992 represents a reduction in real terms of almost a half in the past decade.  Is it any wonder that we have such a huge number of unemployed?</P>
    <P>That was brought home to me very forcibly recently by an architectural technician who had qualified in the last couple of years, lost his job shortly before Christmas and wrote to 156 architects' offices looking for a job &mdash; he picked the offices from the Yellow Pages that were known to him.  Not surprisingly, many of these people wrote back telling him there was no job available, and not surprisingly many of them did not reply at all, but what was surprising was the number of applications returned to him with the imprint &ldquo;Return to Sender&rdquo; marked on the envelope because the architects' firms had gone out of business due to the lack of work, particularly in the area of public works.</P>
    <P>What about the £3 billion in EC Structural Funds which we were told would make such a difference to this country in 1989-93?  Where are the major infrastructural programmes which were promised? We are now virtually at the end of the programme but unemployment is still on the increase.  The safety valve of emigration has been closed off for the <Col N="1020" /> moment.  We continue to spend huge sums of taxpayers' and EC money sub-sidising industry and agriculture, but we are not getting value for money.  We need proper reporting and accountability. Subsidies and tax breaks which are not producing jobs must be withdrawn and the money diverted to a more effective job creation strategy.</P>
    <P>A series of reports has been produced of which the report of the review group on industrial strategy is the latest, and probably the most important.  The time for the production of reports is past.  The country, and especially those without jobs, are demanding action, but unfortunately there was very little sign of action in last weeks's budget.</P>
    <P>Another particular disappointment is the total failure of the budget to address the housing crisis.  There is no recognition in the budget of the crisis which exists particularly in the area of public housing. There are now almost 30,000 applicants nationwide on local authority housing lists.  Effectively there has been no local authority house building since the Fianna Fáil Government took office in 1987, other than the completion of the works already in hand at that stage, and a token amount of building since.  It is interesting to note that more local authority houses were built in 1986 alone than have been built since Fianna Fáil were returned to office at the beginning of 1987.  The provision in the budget to increase the allocation to local authority and social housing programmes by £1.3 million to £80.3 million is derisory and fails to take account of the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago the then Minister for the Environment, who may soon be restored to a prominent position in public life, announced with a great fanfare an action plan for social housing, but that action plan was never implemented.  A housing Bill was to be introduced in conjunction with that plan, but despite prodding requests and questions on the Order of Business and at Question Time, 12 months later that Bill has not even been circulated, much less debated or enacted by the Oireachtas.  In the meantime, the schemes in the plan for social housing <Col N="1021" /> are not being implemented.  Not a single house has been purchased under the so-called shared ownership scheme.  Not one site has been provided for families wishing to set up house on their own.  At the same time the number on housing waiting lists continues to grow.  In the part of County Dublin I represent not one person has been housed from the housing waiting list in the past 12 months except people who have been declared officially to be homeless.  The number of people on the housing waiting list in south County Dublin is now about 700.  There are 500 people on the housing waiting list of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, the adjacent authority, yet the number of approvals from the Department of the Environment for house building in the area amounts to no more than 50.  That will not address the problems facing young families who are trying to set up home but cannot afford to buy a house.  They are now faced with the prospect of having to wait for years before they will be housed, the prospect that faced families in the fifties and sixties.</P>
    <P>A similar situation exists with regard to the refurbishment of houses.  Deputy Deasy in an earlier comment stated incorrectly that there were no farmers in the Dún Laoghaire area.  Many farmers reside in the Rathmichael and Kilternan areas.  Indeed that sizeable agricultural belt is under strain from the developers who would like to build houses on it. There are almost 600 local authority houses in my constituency which have no bathrooms.  That is a disgrace.  In the course of the past couple of days I met a couple who have two young children aged five and three.  One child is incontinent and the family have to wash the bedlinen in the only sink in the house which is served by a cold water tap.  They have no bathroom or other washing facilities. These are Dickensian conditions as we approach the end of the 20th century. Yet last year the allocation from the Department of the Environment provided for the installation of only 40 bathrooms in an area where 600 houses are without them.  While the specific allocations to the various local authorities for <Col N="1022" /> this year have not been made, it would appear that the amount of money allocated in this year's Estimates is the same in money terms as it was in 1991.  When inflation is taken into account, this means that the allocation is actually less than last year's.</P>
    <P>This means we will continue to have many young families on local authority housing waiting lists, and living in accommodation that is now unsuitable for their needs and from which they should be transferred.  Substantial numbers live in sub-standard accommodation which belongs more to the last century than to the end of the 20th century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his first budget which sets out to deal with the inequities in the tax system and closes the loopholes on tax dodgers. It has removed many anomalies in the system and, generally speaking, it was well received.  Measures were taken to prepare us for the Single Market in January 1993.  Despite the criticism of the 1991 budget, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, was vindicated by the outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency, which consists of two Border counties, featured a great deal in the budget of the past decade for the wrong reasons.  In the years 1983-87 the price of petrol was increased and as a result trade in Border counties suffered. I welcome the reduction of 9p in the price of a gallon of petrol from 1 May.  Many petrol filling stations on this side of the Border had to close down while on a concession road between counties Monaghan and Cavan, four large supermarkets and filling stations were built on this Golden Mile to avail of trade from the Twenty-six Counties.  We made repeated requests to Ministers that measures be put in place to level the playing field but our requests were ignored.  However, the former Minister, Commissioner MacSharry set about dealing with this problem in 1987 and it has been dealt with consistently since then. Indeed, the towns along the Border now have a belief in themselves and are enjoying a new lease of life.  The shop fronts <Col N="1023" /> were lit up at Christmas and the filling stations have re-opened now that they can compete with their counterparts across the Border.  The supermarkets that were built to cater for trade from the Twenty-six Counties have lost custom because it is no longer attractive to shop there for electrical goods and spirits which were much cheaper in the North. This has now changed and we welcome the transformation.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis in the budget is on jobs.  The Minister has provided £70 million pounds for training and employment, £60 million of which will come from the EC.  It is hoped to provide £25,000 additional training places.  There will be substantial transfers from the EC, including an additional £100 million from the Structural Funds.  While I am certainly grateful for this money, I am concerned that we may become over dependent on this type of transfer.  It may kill local initiative.  I attended a dairy conference in Cootehill on 5 December and the main speakers were the chief executive of a dairy in the north west and a member of the New Zealand Dairy Board.  I noted some of their comments on the dairy industry.  The chief executive, when discussing the need for further rationalisation in the Irish dairy industry, said:</P>
    <P>In Ireland the industry is carrying too many costs in the form of administration costs, milk assembly costs, duplication of processing and inefficiency in milk pool utilisation.  Producers are paying for these inefficiencies.  It is time action was taken with the producers playing a major role in making it happen.</P>
    <P>When talking about the marketing of Irish dairy products he pointed out that only 20 per cent of our milk is marketed at home, that the balance is exported but that only about 40 per cent of exports are sold as branded products, the remainder going in commodity form, in bulk and largely unprocessed.  He went on to say that too high a proportion, 70 per cent, <Col N="1024" /> of our milk is still going towards the production of butter, that the seasonal nature of our milk supply is a problem, that we need to shift a higher proportion of our sales to EC countries, that despite our great disadvantage we need to compete effectively in price and that our milk prices, therefore, must be kept in line with market prices in Europe.  He said that we need to maintain stable prices to our customers for periods of between six and 12 months and that we must be able to give a guarantee of continuity of supply.  Those comments have come a long time after our entry to the EC, after we received much support by way of grants for processing, storage facilities and intervention.  They are a sad reflection on Ireland's dairy industry in 1992, as we approach the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Robertson stated that New Zealand had been shocked by the entry of the UK to the EC in 1973 and by the world oil crisis which began in that year.  He said that the New Zealand Government continued a policy of protectionism and of agricultural subsidies, with the result that taxation increased, inflation stood at 15 per cent and the Government debt grew. Robertson went on to say, and this would be very relevant to this country, that in forgetting the realities of the market-place New Zealand entered fairyland, lived off borrowed money which went to support and push the economy into something it could never be.  He proceeded to talk about the developments that had taken place there with the change of Government in 1984 and said that the present National Government, elected in 1990, would continue the fiscal and economic policy of the previous Labour Government.  He said that inflation rates had reduced considerably, that the maximum personal tax rate had reduced from 66 per cent to 33 per cent, that the total tax take had increased and that the debt position had been controlled. He stated that the New Zealand dairy industry received little help from the Government and focused on the customer all the time, that the industry had rationalised plant, brought in new technology and developed new products and <Col N="1025" /> it had a worldwide network in more than 100 different countries.</P>
    <P>That illustration demonstrates a marked comparison between the way in which the position was handled by two different countries &mdash; to live off subsidies or to go out independently and use initiative. I think Ireland should focus on a point somewhere between those two stands.</P>
    <P>Much of our beef is going into intervention stocks and our cold storage facilities are full.  The Minister stated in the House that there was demand for our beef while early in the year the newspapers reported that although the German food fairs had showed up a market for Irish beef the market could not compete with intervention prices paid here for beef, with the result that our exports to Germany which amounted to 40,000 tonnes per annum in the eighties had dropped to 12,500 tonnes by 1990. We must utilise our products to better advantage and go out to the market-place and sell them.  Further processing of our produce would secure much-needed downstream jobs.</P>
    <P>Development agencies such as the IDA must re-examine their policy in many respects.  I mentioned before that the IDA must re-examine their policy of grant aid to the poultry industry, for instance.  It came to my notice recently that at present the IDA will not grant aid any enterprise set up for processing timber.  My own region has substantial acreages of timber that has reached maturity and is now being felled.  All of that timber, in long form, is moved out of the area and into the Six Counties to be processed there.  The IDA must change their policy of providing no grant aid for small sawmills or mills involved in debarking timber, drying it and so on.  In the fifties substantial funding was made available to plant those forests and we all anticipated the provision of a substantial number of jobs in the region but that has not been the case.  We must make the greatest use possible of all our resources. Down the years all that our region has had from the forests has been pot-holed roads, resulting from six and seven large <Col N="1026" /> truckloads of felled timber being taken out from those areas each day.</P>
    <P>I visited a small industry in the region that is processing the forest waste &mdash; branches and tops of the trees, etc. left behind when the logs are taken out.  That industry is purchasing the forest waste from Coillte and is debarking the timber for use as fence posts and sawing a proportion of the timber to produce light timber for garden sheds and fences.  They have drying equipment and equipment which with a pressurising facility can inject a preservative into the timber.  It is just not right to think that a small industry of that kind has no grant aid available to it.</P>
    <P>Mention was made in the budget of the removal of the tax exemption from co-ops. In all probability the Minister's thinking was that removal of the exemption was justified on the grounds that several of the large co-ops are now plcs and are rated as industries.  However, there are also many small co-ops &mdash; several of them not processing at all now but being used only as collection depots &mdash; which provide very good service for farmers in respect of supplies and so on.  I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the withdrawal of that exemption from small co-ops and to provide for it under the Finance Bill.  It is to be hoped that under programmes such as Leader those co-ops would divert funds into rural development in disadvantaged areas, as they have done in the past.  I hope they will continue to give the good service that has been given in the past.  Before I came into the Dáil I spent all my working life in a co-op and I know of the services they provide.  I would be very concerned if these services would be impinged upon in any way by the withdrawal of that exemption.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, we receive a good deal by way of funding.  There is the International Fund for Ireland, the Leader Programme and Intereg.  When Ray MacSharry was leaving to go to the EC he gave a commitment here in the House that he would do his best to secure more money for rural areas and for more integrated rural development.  He has <Col N="1027" /> now made the money available.  There are committees and working parties involved in all of this.  There is the Intereg Committee, which has representatives from seven Government Departments and there are county development teams and so on.  However, I am not satisfied that there is the right input on those committees.  Do we have the proper knowhow and the necessary expertise in so far as these various bodies are concerned? I hope that the Minister for Finance will consider the restructuring of the county development teams, the management of which is now made up of the county manager, the chief executive officer of Teagasc, the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee and the IDA.  It is time to bring in others.  It is time, for instance, that we brought in successful businessmen from those regions.  Many of these enterpreneurs would be willing to contribute their know-how and knowledge.  Until we do that we will not make the best possible use of those funds.  Funding is substantial and much research has been done into suitable projects.  The potential is there and a Leader programme for my constituency has been approved.  If this programme is funded and implemented it will provide 780 jobs.  We should not be impeded by administrative procedures with regard to those projects.  We were told that the ideas would come from the bottom, but it is also important to have someone involved who can keep his hand on the tiller and know what is happening.</P>
    <P>People in the VHI and labouring under substantial mortgages must have given a sigh of relief when they heard that those reliefs were not to be reduced, because the general belief was that those reliefs could be interfered with.  I am glad that there has not been any increase in VAT relative to the construction industry and tourism.  The Minister has also given concessions to the motor and road haulage industies.</P>
    <P>For my four county health board regions we got a health budget of £102 million.  In 1988 we got £88 million.  The most effective way to answer the critics <Col N="1028" /> of the health services is to point to the increase from £88 million in 1988 to £102 million this year.  The health board was set up in 1970 and in 1972 the budget was a mere £7 million.  With regard to services for the mentally handicapped particularly, Ministers for Health over the last number of years deserve credit for the compassion they showed in the money which they provided in that area. Throughout the years health boards have heard announcements about moneys from the national lottery and from the social fund, for the elderly, the disabled and the mentally handicapped.  No other EC country is honouring its commitments in that area more than we are.  Additional moneys have also been provided for residential and respite care for children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also provided for an increase in back-to-school payments and has enabled adoptive mothers to have ten weeks' leave, equivalent to maternity leave.  That is to be welcomed.  There has been a further increase in the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>Many representations have been made with regard to the latest medical equipment for hospitals.  Over the last number of years, I am pleased to note the amount of money raised from private and voluntary sources for up-to-date medical equipment.  I am glad that the medical equipment will now be vat-free.</P>

      <P>The 1992 budget indicates gross irresponsibility and indifference towards the 269,000 people who are unemployed.  It also shows neglect of those living in poverty and isolation, an uncaring attitude towards the homeless and the destitute, and a total lack of interest in the agricultural and rural community. The irresponsibility displayed in the 1991 budget has been continued and expanded in this year's effort.  This is not good enough and it must not be allowed to continue.  At the recent CCI annual dinner the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outstanding objective for the future must be to maximise the number of sustainable jobs in Ireland.  All of us must give top priority at all times to <Col N="1029" /> the business of generating more viable work.</P>
    <P>On budget day the Minister, Deputy Ahern said:</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the single greatest social problem we have to contend with.  The Government are keenly aware of the needs posed by the continuing growth in the labour force.</P>
    <P>Is it not amazing and unbelievable that in spite of all this rhetoric about unemployment, the Minister on budget day did nothing about it?  Nothing was done to promote employment, to create an environment conducive to job creation, to encourage people back to work, to entice employers to provide jobs or reward those who already do so.  The budget is nothing short of disastrous for the thousands of people out of work who perhaps depended on the Minister for Finance to do something for them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made a miserable attempt to reduce the numbers on the employment register by announcing two new FÁS schemes.  This attempt could be classed as laughable if the situation were not so serious.  The employment subsidy scheme is merely a substitute for the employment incentive scheme already in operation, and the in-company training scheme is merely a replacement for the training courses already run by FÁS.  The difference is that the cost will be borne by the company rather than by the State.  I would remind the Minister that changing titles will not fool those without jobs.  Their needs are so great and urgent that they will not be codded by these tricks.</P>
    <P>Action was not proposed to combat the enormous unemployment problem facing us in 1992.  I suppose people have to be realistic and, in the absence of a worthwhile effort to solve unemployment, be satisfied with even those two unsatisfactory attempts.  The employment subsidy scheme has two welcome changes: an employee must now be on the unemployment register for only two months, and the scheme is open to a broader range of employers.  Nevertheless certain <Col N="1030" /> questions must be asked.  Who will benefit from the scheme?  Will it be those on long term unemployment who are our greatest concern?  Will this scheme result in the creation of suitable jobs?  Can we expect that when the subsidy ends employees will once more find themselves in the labour queue?  Such schemes do not have a good record here but I hope that, despite my pessimism, the scheme will live up to the Minister's prediction of 15,000 additional jobs.</P>
    <P>I must admit that I am very sceptical. The major blunder in this scheme is the exclusion of married women working in the home.  It is totally unacceptable that they, not being on the unemployment register, will be excluded from being beneficiaries of the scheme. It is totally unjust and unfair and I will be asking the Minister to make immediate provisions to eliminate this injustice in the interests of fairness and equity.</P>
    <P>The in-company job training scheme envisages that up to 10,000 people will be provided with training, at no cost to the Exchequer.  The fact that it will not be a burden on the Exchequer is its only asset.  We are reassured that these schemes will have a big public launch, full of fanfare, but unfortunately the substance will remain the same.  Several questions must be asked about this scheme.  Who will monitor it?  Who will ensure that the scheme consists in training people rather than work?  Will the training be certified?  Where are the companies who will be prepared to employ people to provide training?  Do we believe that the subsidy is sufficient to entice companies into this type of scheme?  I pose serious questions about the future of the scheme and question whether it will do anything to reduce numbers on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>The sum total of the Minister's concern and strategy to deal with unemployment consists of those two schemes.  As a result of the budget, the future of the unemployed is still a future without hopes and dreams.  For how long more can we expect the patience of the 269,000 people who are workless to last?  How long can <Col N="1031" /> they cope with the utter despair and desperation that unemployment brings? How much longer will they control their anger and frustration at the continuous neglect and ignoring of their plight?  How long more will this Government remain convinced of the inevitability of unemployment? Their inaction to date verifies this tendency.  Surely they cannot allow themselves to believe that the unemployment problem, so severe and protracted, can be seen as a national phenomenon.  We cannot believe that unemployment is something that will sort itself out if other things can be achieved first.</P>
    <P>The budget should have addressed the unemployment problem ruthlessly, but sadly it ignored it ruthlessly.  The verdict on this budget can only be given when the unemployment figures are examined in the months ahead.  The most appropriate measure of our economic success is the number of people gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>As we enter 1992, severe and widespread poverty remains an urgent challenge to us all.  Yes, poverty should have been a priority in the budget, but was it?</P>
    <P>The aspirations of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were towards fundamental structural reforms and a commitment to develop greater social rights with our health, education, social welfare and housing services.  Were all these aspirations set aside in the chilling Estimates and budget targets for the coming year?  We all realise that the Minister for Finance faced very difficult choices in framing the budget.  However, there is still no justification in failing to take any significant steps towards tackling the underlying causes of poverty.</P>
    <P>Poverty is a denial of basic social and human rights and no delay in measures to tackle it can be justified.  We cannot afford to wait for a rising economic tide before we start the process of reform. The harsh reality is known, yet this Government continue to ignore the alarming housing crisis, the deplorable living conditions of so many.  The budget did <Col N="1032" /> not even mention the importance of housing.</P>
    <P>The children of the poor were ignored yet again, with no proposals to increase the children's allowance or to turn the balance in favour of the less well off with children.  That any Minister for Finance could ignore such screaming and urgent needs is unbelieveable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Paltry increases in social welfare payments will never liberate those trapped in the poverty net, nor will loans for those in need substitute for the lack of a basic income to provide for the family.  The poor among us are still left to depend on charity for survival.  Is this fair?  Does the Minister realise that while unemployment continues, the battle against poverty can never be won?</P>
    <P>While the basic provisions in relation to housing, health and education are inadequate, the battle against poverty can never be won.  Some effort must be made.  The budget is guilty of downright neglect in its lack of care and concern for those in need.</P>
    <P>The budget failed dismally to tackle the enormous problem of capital acquisition tax.  In fact, to the dismay and astonishment of the farming community, the capital acquisition tax did not even merit a mention in the 1992 budget.  This surely and sadly demonstrates the ignorance, and worse still, the lack of interest of this Government in the survival of family farms, threatened so often by the dreaded penalty.  The concern and frustration among farmers over the implications of capital taxation cannot be overstated.  Despite repeated calls for major reforms in the taxation system as it applies to farmers, the Fianna Fáil-PD Government gave the deaf ear to all who attempted to make a reasonable case.</P>
    <P>The inequities of capital acquisition tax and stamp duty, which discriminate against family farming, are a major disincentive to young farmers embarking on a farming career.  In fact, they are causing severe financial hardship to a vast number of farmers, often resulting in the sale of the family farm to meet a tax bill.</P>
    <P>In spite of all this, the budget has dismissed this problem as unimportant.  The <Col N="1033" /> crisis with the capital acquisitions tax is the unrealistic valuation of land for capital taxation purposes.  A major change is called for urgently.  Land for capital acquisitions tax should be taxed on its earning capacity rather than at present. Land is currently valued based on recent land sales.  This too often results in a very inflated valuation, in particular where small parcels of land reach a very high and unrealistic figure at auction.</P>
    <P>How can any taxation be judged as fair and equitable, when it is governed by an unreliable and unrealistic monitor &mdash; market prices?  This is a taxation that is not based on capacity to pay.  It is scandalous that the Minister for Finance chose, yet again, to ignore this problem.  It is unfair and unwise that no changes were proposed in this budget to ease the financial hardship which the capital acquisition tax imposes on many families, many of whom are forced to borrow heavily in order to retain their farms on inheritance.</P>
    <P>The Minister received a pre-budget submission on behalf of farmers seeking relief on stamp duty to encourage lifetime transfers to qualified farmers; this submission also sought adjustment of thresholds to take account of inflation in the period 1975-90.  However, as this budget has proved, the Minister and Government decided to ignore such requests from a sector of our economy faced with daunting challenges in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>While referring to farming I might add that I too am very concerned at the lack of finance made available to Teagasc, our agricultural advisory body.  For example, £1 million have been allocated to them whereas they need an extra £3.5 million even to continue what I might now describe as a decimated service, one which is no longer realistic and cannot cope with farmers' needs or render the quality of service eminently desirable. For example, in my constituency, the Teagasc office in Tipperary town has been pinpointed for closure, this in the wake of a Teagasc office already having been closed in Cahir.  This latest proposal must be totally opposed particularly since Tipperary is a rural town located in the <Col N="1034" /> heart of the agricultural hinterland.  The Teagasc office there is located adjacent to the livestock and veterinary offices. The agricultural community of the surrounding areas not only deserve but need such agricultural advisory services.  If they are not continued, I fear for farmers' futures in the area and for the development and prosperity of agriculture generally in my constituency.  Unfortunately these budgetary provisions did not bring us any hope.  We realise that sufficient resources have not been made available to Teagasc to enable them provide an adequate service, resulting in offices such as the one in Tipperary town now being faced with closure.</P>
    <P>The hands of the Progressive Democrats are very much in evidence in this budget.  Their claim to honour is the introduction of two income tax bands.  I welcome, as I am sure do most Members, the reduction in the income tax rates. Any measure which puts more money in workers' pockets is to be welcomed. However, on closer examination, it will be ascertained that this measure is socially misdirected since henceforth millionaires will find themselves in the same income tax bracket as the average industrial worker.  The emphasis should have been on widening the tax bands which would have relieved many workers from paying tax at a higher rate.  It may give the Progressive Democrats more satisfaction to put more money in the pockets of high earners than to relieve lower paid workers of their income tax burden. Resulting from their philosophy 30 per cent of the population will remain in the top tax bracket.  Surely it is regressive and repressive to demand lower paid workers to pay the cost of relief for the better-off?  I contend it would have been more equitable and just to have relieved the average wage earner from paying income tax at the higher rate, leaving those who can and are well able to pay income tax to shoulder the heaviest burden.</P>
    <P>Of course the architects of this budget would like to convince us that such income tax measures are a means of encouraging job creation.  They want us <Col N="1035" /> to believe the gospel: tax cuts create jobs, whereas all the evidence would lead one to the opposite conclusion.  In spite of consistent reductions in the income tax rates over the past three years there has been a massive surge in unemployment figures.  While voicing my support of and desire to see lower tax rates I believe in individuals having greater choice in the disposal of their incomes.  In the face of the real facts I cannot accept the theory of tax cuts leading to job creation.  The reality is that there is simply no evidence that the type of tax changes announced in this budget will lead to increased employment.</P>
    <P>This budget puts many problems in abeyance to the year 1993 &mdash; the new escape route for this Government &mdash; put off the problem until tomorrow in the hope that it may even disappear.  The problems being stored up for 1993 are serious.  For example, the public sector pay bill will increase by 8 per cent in 1993, thanks to the rescheduling of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; our VAT levels <i>vis-à-vis</i> those obtaining in the United Kingdom remain above the comfortable level necessary to prevent substantial erosion in 1993 when cross-Border constraints will be eliminated, with no action taken with regard to the deposit interest retention tax despite the abolition of exchange controls in 1993 and their effect on revenue.  I contend that all the pre-budget warnings of 1992 must be repeated in 1993 since severe, deep cuts in public spending will be required again to meet the enormous burden now being transferred to next year's budget.</P>
    <P>As one might expect, the Minister in his Budget Statement, paid lip service to the creation of employment whereas the budgetary provisions encourage the exact opposite.  I recognise the Minister, in finalising his budgetary provisions, had his attention diverted to the creation of jobs in some areas detracting his attention from what should have been his obvious priority, overall job creation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this budget achieves nothing.  For example, it fails dismally to <Col N="1036" /> address the most serious problems of the nineties, that is, unemployment and poverty. It is my fear that these budgetary provisions will send the country into terminal decline and our people into eternal depression.  It is a failed budget in that it gives no hope at all of improving the living standards of so many of our people. There will remain thousands queuing for social welfare weekly.  Children will leave home each morning leaving parents with no work to go to, or having any useful purpose in life.  We will continue to see the sick and elderly wait, hopefully living, until hospital beds become vacant for them.</P>
    <P>What a pity that once again the opportunity to do something positive about job creation has been missed.  In this budget, as in all of the Government's actions, unemployment continues to be the forgotten priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. V. Brady)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with considerable interest to the Opposition reaction to this budget.  For instance, Deputy Therese Ahearn has just indulged in a litany of sorrow and feigned concern, useless, mournful commentary, without one constructive suggestion or proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, she has not told the House from where the additional millions of pounds expenditure she advocates will emanate.  In her 20 minutes contribution she purported to spend something in the region of £50 million to £60 million without having informed the House from where that will come.  Does she propose the introduction of higher income tax, additional indirect taxation or some new forms of tax of which we are not aware?  One should be constructive rather than destructive in commenting on budgetary proposals. The Deputy's comments were destructive, as was the case generally on the part of Fine Gael since the Budget was introduced &mdash; destructive suggestions advocating the expenditure of millions of <Col N="1037" /> pounds, advanced irresponsibly, without one single suggestion as to where such money should emanate from.</P>
      <P>It could all be summed up in one sentence. The Minister did not have a magic wand.  Such criticism might be justified were it not for one problem.  When one moves from the never-never land of Opposition to the real world of Government &mdash; from which the Opposition are a long way off &mdash; and difficult decisions must be taken by reference to the facts, there are no magic wands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleagues have discovered that fact already.</P>
      <P>Indeed the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in their 1985 budget introduced new tax rates, when the low rate was 35 per cent, the medium rate was 48 per cent and the high rate 60 per cent.  With regard to the income tax bands, the then 35 per cent band obtained on income ranging from £4,500 and £9,000 whereas today the 27 per cent band is applicable to incomes ranging from £7,475 and £14,950 &mdash; and these figures speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>In attempting to assess the performance of any Minister for Finance when drafting his budget, regard must be had to the immovable constraints on him. For example, it must be appreciated that, in an open economy, such constraints derive as much from the outside world as from the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Last year, 1991, was a difficult year for the international economy.  The world in which this country must sell two-thirds of its output is in one of the longest periods of economic recession for many decades. While the collapse of communism is a welcome step forward bringing freedom and the hope of a better tommorow for countless millions, it is a hard fact that in the short term, it is a factor in creating uncertainty in the international economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the domestic economy, all Government decision-making is still <Col N="1038" /> overshadowed by the massive carryover of debt from the mid-eighties.  Although the situation has been improving since 1987, with the ratio of debt to GNP on a reducing track to our eventual target of 100 per cent by 1993, £2.4 billion &mdash; one quarter of the Government's total revenue &mdash; is pre-empted by the legacy of the time when the present Opposition were in a position to practice what they preach today.  Without this burden, current revenue receipts would comfortably exceed current expenditure.  In other words, the Minister for Finance must not only find the resources to pay for the day to day spending of Government during 1992, he must also fund a heavy repayment schedule on the national mortgage.</P>
    <P>For the coming year, the international situation remains less than satisfactory, with the consensus view among commentators that the recovery in 1992 is likely to be sluggish and uneven.  It is against this background that the Minister for Finance has had to frame a budget. In doing so he has had to reconcile many conflicting demands and it is against this background that his remarkable achievement in reconciling the many conflicting pressures upon him must be judged.</P>
    <P>The total cost of supply services, that is the range of indispenable services provided by Government on which all citizens depend to some extent, will approach £7 billion in 1992.  When all Government expenditure, including debt repayments, are added up, the Minister for Finance has to find more than £9.6 billion.  The search for efficiency is being pursued throughout the public service, including the Defence Forces, my area of responsibility.  However, the scope for reducing the level of public spending in the short term through efficiency measures is very limited when compared with the overall scale of Government spending.  Accordingly, any attempt to criticise the budget as if the Minister has total freedom of action and the ability to dispose of large amounts of money as he pleases is based on a completely erroneous assumption.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation, it has long been recognised that there is a need to reform. <Col N="1039" /> First, it is essential that the tax burden must be spread evenly across all sectors based on the principle of ability to pay. Second, the rates at which income tax is levied must be structured to avoid causing a disincentive to those at work.  To achieve these two aims, it is necessary to reform the administration of the tax collection system and to change the rates of tax.  We started that procedure in 1987 with former Deputy MacSharry's budget in which he indicated that we were commencing a reform of the tax system which would be continued on a yearly basis. That has been happening since.</P>
    <P>As the PAYE sector has long borne the lion's share of the burden of income tax, there is a particular need to ensure that the scope for tax avoidance in other sectors is eliminated.  Anti-evasion measures have been substantially improved in recent years.  As part of the 1992 Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance will be introducing measures which will close a range of loopholes in legislation which either permit individuals and companies to avoid tax by using legal technicalities of facilitate the illegal practice of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>As regards the rates of tax, five years ago, the idea of a 25 per cent standard rate would have seemed impossible.  The changes announced in the budget &mdash; a standard rate of 27 per cent and a higher rate of 48 per cent &mdash; represent a major step towards the Government's goal of a 25 per cent standard rate with a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>Reducing unemployment is accepted by the Government as the number one priority on their agenda.  With continuing growth in the workforce, it is not enough to preserve the present level of employment in the Irish economy.  In fact, over recent years the numbers of people at work in the Irish economy have remained fairly stable.  The Irish economy has actually performed fairly well by international standards in preserving the overall number of people at work. However, with a growing workforce, this achievement is not enough.  A substantial increase in the levels of people at work <Col N="1040" /> is required and the budget represents significant progress towards this goal.</P>
    <P>The most important consideration in encouraging job formation is the maintenance of a stable economic environment which in turn will encourage investment.  The economic policies pursued by the Government and continued by the 1992 budget have seen a steady rise in the level of industrial exports, a balance of trade surplus, low inflation and levels of economic growth which compare well with our trading partners in the EC and OECD.  While the burden of debt carried by the Exchequer remains crippling by international standards, the corner has been turned and the public finances are firmly on the path to good health.  All in all, we have succeeded in creating and maintaining as favourable a climate for investment as possible in the present international environment.</P>
    <P>However, unemployment will not be solved by macro-economic initiatives alone.  Specific measures are required and the budget includes a number of important practical initiatives in this vital area. Among the measures are a new employment subsidy scheme, a new in-company training scheme and area partnerships to combat long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Jobs cannot be created overnight out of fresh air.  In particular, Governments cannot create jobs by decree.  However, there are many specific measures which can lead to the formation of jobs in the economy and the Government will leave no stone unturned in the search for ways to reduce the number out of work.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult conflicts between objectives to be reconciled in the budgetary arithmetic is the competition between the need to balance the needs of the less well off who depend on the payments and services provided by Government against the overriding need to contain spending.  This conflict is made all the more difficult as the consequences of Government overspending in the recent past have been shown to bear most heavily on the weakest sections of our community.</P>
    <P>However, Fianna Fáil in Government have always regarded the protection of <Col N="1041" /> the less well off as a prime responsibility. Long-term initiatives to combat unemployment will take time to have effect. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance has made specific provision for a number of increases in the levels of social welfare payments which will cost £85 million in the current year.  The costs of social welfare have placed a considerable burden on the Exchequer.  However this is a burden which has to be met and it remains a commitment of this Government to defend and increase the value of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Amid the welter of debate about the budget and economic policy generally, it is important to retain a realistic perspective about our recent economic performance. While this requires an honest appraisal of the difficulties which we face, it should not blind us to the solid achievements of the past five years.  Since 1987, the economy has grown at an annual average of 4.5 per cent.  The ratio of debt to GNP has been reduced from 127 per cent to 107 per cent.  In particular, Irish exports have grown at an unprecedented rate.  In many areas, our economic performance has been well above that of the average for our trading partners.</P>
    <P>These solid achievements are no grounds for complacency.  They represent sufficient evidence to rebut the extremes of pessimism emanating from some quarters.  Having addressed many of our economic problems successfully, we should have the confidence to address our remaining difficulties in a positive way.</P>
    <P>Within my area of responsibility, the drive for administrative reform has been underway for some time.  While the major focus of all such reforms is to improve efficiency, organisational reviews also provide an opportunity to reconsider other policy issues.  In my area, I have directed that the role of women in the Defence Forces be included as part of the review process to ensure that the principle of equal opportunity is adhered to as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I have asked the military authorities to reconsider the range of appointments which are presently reserved for men <Col N="1042" /> with a view to increasing the number of women in uniform.  As a first step, I have decided that women may in future serve as pilots in the Air Corps.  It is my intention that other restrictions on the role of women will be critically examined in the coming year.</P>
    <P>No budget contains all the answers to our economic and social problems.  It is unreasonable to expect that it should. The budget is an element of a broader programme of Government action.  The package of measures announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day will ensure that the public finances will remain under firm control; that the standard of living of social welfare dependents will be protected; that the taxation burden will be more equitably spread and that the economy will be ready to participate in the international recovery which should begin in the coming year. This budget will help to build a more prosperous and secure future for all.</P>

      <P>One could say that the budget was an anticlimax.  As far back as last September various Government commentators had been warning the country that tough decisions would have to be taken.  Indeed, the Taoiseach himself warned us that the budget would be the toughest in living memory.  Between September and Christmas the media, no doubt through well-informed leaks, published various articles about the drastic spending cuts that Ministers and Departments would be forced to make.  Hopes for a cut in tax rates were dampended on several occasions and almost ruled out by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in a number of public statements.  However, the budget when it was eventually announced was rather neutral.  It contained no radical proposals and gave no indication that there would be a clear shift in policy.  It could not be described as a reforming or tough budget; rather it was geared towards maintaining the popularity of the present Coalition Government and postponing the inevitable until 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In not facing up to some of the crucial <Col N="1043" /> issues the Minister has stored up a considerable number of problems for 1993 when it is likely that public sector pay will increase by over 8 per cent.  The Minister has also failed to take into consideration some of the inevitable tax revenue losses which will follow the introduction of the single market from January next.  The standard VAT rate will have to be reduced.  Indeed, VAT on imports will have to be abolished while DIRT will at least have to be reduced. The Minister has taken no account of any of these factors.  On my calculations, the Government could be faced with an opening 1993 Exchequer borrowing requirement of over £800 million.  The Government, whoever they may be, will face major problems in framing a budget for next year because the problems have not been faced up to in this budget.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the reduction in the top tax band to 48p and the lower band to 27p &mdash; this is a move in the right direction and one which we in this House have all been seeking &mdash; we must look at the way in which the changes will be funded.  On the one hand, people will gain but, on the other, they will suffer.  Indeed the people who will gain most from the concessions granted in the budget are those on salaries of £20,000 and upwards, not the low paid worker about whom we are all concerned.  Essentially, the income tax reductions will be financed by way of VAT and excise duty increases. While the standard rate tax band has been extended, personal allowances remain unchanged.  Hence, single taxpayers will continue to hit high marginal rates at below average income levels.  As I have mentioned, those in the lower and middle income groups will be hit hardest by this proposal and the amount gained will be minimal when the costs imposed by way of increases in indirect taxation are taken into account.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to a number of issues.  The first is the 20 per cent increase in road tax to which I referred in the debate on the Financial Resolution on the evening of the budget. This is a cruel imposition especially on <Col N="1044" /> motorists living in rural Ireland to whom we refer so often in this House.  This might be acceptable if this money was to be used to improve the roads in rural Ireland but these unfortunate motorists will have to pay extra tax on their cars while having to travel on roads which have deteriorated to the extent that they are increasingly becoming impassable. This is most unfair.</P>
    <P>It is rather ironic that this cruel burden is being imposed by the very Government who wiped out motor tax in 1977 but now they see nothing wrong with introducing a major hike in motor tax.  When one considers the increase in motor tax, in the context of the cost of motoring in general, this budget is definitely anti-motorist. This increase in road tax together with the increase in VAT on car maintenance from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent, will mean that the cost of motoring will be a major factor especially for young people who would have to travel a distance to work, when they come to decide on whether to take up a low paid job. For example, due to labour costs the charge for servicing a car has gone up by nearly 50 per cent during the past two years.  Indeed it is now almost impossible to have a car serviced or repaired more than twice a year.  When the full implications of this budget are realised by motorists I am afraid they will not be very happy.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT, from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent, on services such as AI and on footwear and clothing will result in an increase in the expenses incurred by rural communities, in particular by farmers.  They will be very dissatisfied with it.  In a sense they are being given a handout in that I understand £2 million is to be made available to increase headage grant payments.  However we were told last year than £12 million would be made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase those payments.  I cannot see another £10 million being provided in next year's budget.  There is very little therefore in this budget that either motorists in rural Ireland, who have to travel on some of the worst roads in <Col N="1045" /> Europe, or the farming community in general, can enthuse about.</P>
    <P>Another cruel imposition in the budget is the taxation of disability and unemployment benefit.  In effect, we are putting a tax on the sick and on the unemployed.  This is being done without due consideration being given to the trauma felt by those people.  The previous speaker, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Brady, said that because Fianna Fáil have a social conscience they have increased benefits in the budget. However, the 4 per cent general increase across the board will hardly keep recipients ahead of inflation this year.  Given the increase in VAT rates, prices will increase and these will hit the unemployed and the sick.  In imposing these taxes on the sick and on the unemployed they conveniently forgot about their social conscience which they proudly speak of and which they no doubt had in the past.</P>
    <P>Instead of being negative about it I should like to welcome the special allocation of £250,000 for the Irish Olympic Council.  However, it was allocated a year too late, it should have been allocated last year because the previous year is always the vital year in preparing athletes. Nevertheless, I am sure it is warmly welcomed by the Irish Olympic Council. Nonetheless it shows the lack of knowledge and understanding of the preparation which athletes must undertake because most of the preparation has already been done by them for the Olympics. Most of the hard work by way of preparation by athletes or by team managers was done in 1991.  Although the Irish Olympic Council pleaded for an allocation last year they were ignored. When we have international victories members of the Government and politicians like to be on the platform when the athletes return home but they are very slow in allocating money.  No doubt it was the intense pressure put on the Government by people like Pat Hickey and others from the Irish Olympic Council which forced the Government to allocate money, even though, unfortunately, it is a year too late in many instances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> I should like to refer specifically to unemployment.  As we know, Ireland has the highest youth unemployment rate in Europe, running at about 28 per cent. Only Spain has a higher level of unemployment. Despite the improvements in our economy and the very positive trends regarding foreign borrowing, our Exchequer borrowing and so on, it is not impacting clearly on our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The two provisions in the budget, the employment subsidy scheme and the in-company training scheme are welcome.  I hope they will have the desired effect to help the unemployed but I expect they will have a very marginal impact.  I can see the unemployment subsidy scheme being abused by employers because they will use it to take on workers for a short period and probably postpone taking on workers on a permanent basis.  I have not seen details of this scheme but it seems it is not conditional on an employer who takes on temporary workers giving them a full-time job later.  They also have to recruit workers from the live register which will militate against those who are not on it.  The scheme is funded mostly by Europe and employers, I hope it will work but it is fraught with risks and was not thought out.  It was a knee-jerk reaction to union pressure, it was to keep them happy and to keep the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> together.</P>
    <P>I welcome the in-company training scheme.  It is about time we emphasised the importance of training and retraining. Too many of our workers who lose jobs are not being prepared to take up other jobs because their skills base is so narrow. I am totally in agreement with the concept of in-company training schemes, not just for the workers but for the management in factories.  There should be a continuing process and emphasis on company training from the factory floor up to senior management.  If we are to compete in a new Europe without any commercial boundaries we will have to continuously update our training methods and increase and improve our skills base.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> There are not any real radical proposals in the budget which will meet the problem of the highest unemployment rate we have ever had, which is now over 270,000 people.  Last year, in the corresponding debate, I proposed setting up a jobs forum and this concept was later taken up by the trade unions and &mdash; I was glad to notice &mdash; by my Leader.  I said the unions, all the political parties and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors should be called in to analyse the problems in relation to unemployment and to propose solutions.  We have had one year to think about solutions but all the Government have come up with are an employment subsidy scheme and in-company training.  There is nothing in the budget which will remove the obstacles to the creation of jobs or bring our unemployment figures close to 250,000 this year.  Indeed, by the end of the year, I forecast &mdash; I do not want to exaggerate &mdash; that the figure will be close to 300,000.  The Government will say that the macro-economy is fine and that the indicators are good, but that unemployment is inevitable.  It is a sorry admission by the Government that they can do nothing about the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that by next year all parties and interested groups will have come together and put forward a positive response and solutions to our unemployment problem; otherwise we will be faced with an even worse problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a contribution in relation to the budget debate.  Indeed I compliment the Minister on introducing what has been described by many people, inside and outside the House, as an imaginative budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget was introduced a week ago much has been said and written about it.  It has been analysed by economists, journalists and ordinary men and women.  Outside the House the reaction, by and large, has been favourable.  There was, of course, predictable opposition <Col N="1048" /> within the House; even the most favourable and reforming aspects were criticised. However, such criticism is justified only when those who indulge in it can put forward a more acceptable alternative. This morning Opposition Members referred to the need to increase the overall programme for expenditure without any reference to where the funding would come from.</P>
    <P>This reminded me of the position which obtained a few short years ago when those parties were in Government and how they allowed the national debt to double.  This was a major contributory factor to the problems the previous Fianna Fáil minority Government and the present Coalition Government had to resolve.</P>
    <P>We should have reached the stage where people who have been elected to public office are prepared to face up to their responsibilities and behave in a rational manner.  I do not think Members who come into the House demanding higher expenditure for various Government programmes, without identifying where the money will come from, are fooling anyone.  As I said, such performances may have been justified in the old days but given the number of intelligent people in the community who are capable of analysing the position for themselves, such performances are no longer credible.  Such performances may be acceptable to some extent from backbenchers who, like me, make the odd political comment but it is totally inexcusable for the spokespersons of the political groupings, particularly the Finance spokespersons, to try for negative reasons to make political gains from a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The contributions of some Opposition speakers &mdash; Deputy Deenihan endeavoured to be constructive and fair &mdash; raised doubts in my mind about their sincerity and their capacity not only to form constructive opposition but to form an alternative government.  Over the past few months, the Opposition parties almost daily referred to scandals or alleged scandals for the purpose of creating political <Col N="1049" /> instability, undermining public confidence in the institutions of this State and, sadly, short term political gain.  That kind of negative political opposition is of no help to the country; rather it does considerable damage to the image of our country abroad.</P>
    <P>I am not saying for one minute &mdash; indeed I would not condone this for one second &mdash; that these irregularities should not have been exposed and debated in his House.  However, I am concerned that even though procedures to deal with these issues have been put in place, certain people have continued to pursue them for political gain.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I know, from my colleagues, that these issues have not done justice to the image of Ireland abroad.  The Government have given an assurance that these matters will be fully dealt with and appropriate action taken in each case.  In what I hope is a climate of political change I appeal to Members to ensure that this House returns to normality so that we can address the more important problems facing us, for example, unemployment etc.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the public perception of politicians and political institutions is at an all time low?  I was saddened to read recently in the newspapers the findings of a public opinion poll which showed that in excess of 70 per cent of people do not have confidence in politicians or the political institutions of the State.  From my knowledge of public represenatives on all sides of this House, I have to say that politicians are dedicated and committed to furthering the interests of the country and their constituents.  Nevertheless, this is an issue which we will have to address.  If there is a need for reform of our structures or our performance in the House, then it is important that we face up to these tasks in the national interest.</P>
    <P>Despite its shortcomings, this is a reforming budget.  It tackles for the very first time the question of tax reform and lays the foundation for a continuation of this process.  The Minister has replaced in a practical way the lip service which has been given to this important issue <Col N="1050" /> over a number of years.  I believe this budget was motivated by a desire to achieve fairness and equity and to restore public confidence in the Government's commitment to the introduction of reform in areas which were perceived to be of advantage to some sections of the community.  I am referring in particular to our levels of taxation.  In fairness to him, the Minister has addressed this issue in a very courageous way.</P>
    <P>All of us must be concerned about the high level of personal taxation and corporate tax.  These act as a disincentive to the generation of wealth on which job creation depends.  For this reason, the initiative taken by the Minister in the budget to reduce the level of taxation must be continued in future budgets and taken into account in the future planning of our economy.  Our high rates of taxation have stifled progress and entrepreneurial commitment, which lead to overall economic development.  The tax reform plan announced by the Minister will not be the final answer to this problem, but it is a positive start.  We must give due recognition to the Minister for the efforts he has made in the budget to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>The budget protects the incomes of those who depend on the State for support. I would not have any difficulty subscribing to the view expressed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and many other voluntary charitable organisations, including the Combat Poverty Agency, that there should be a more generous increase for these people.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with that point of view but I also believe that, despite all our economic difficulties, the Minister in this budget made a genuine attempt to at least protect against inflation the incomes of those who are most dependent on the State for support.  It is right that the Minister for Finance should take such a course of action.  Indeed, many of us wish he were in a position to be more generous.  We are a charitable nation and in many instances voluntary contributions exceed the Government's statutory commitment.  That fact has <Col N="1051" /> been borne out by the generosity of the Irish people's response to the many appeals which have been made over the years.</P>
    <P>Without doubt unemployment remains the most serious challenge facing the Government.  Sometimes I am a little concerned that people are beginning to accept unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, as inevitable.  I reiterate the commitment of the present Government to generate the economic climate in which jobs can be created.  Anybody who accuses the Government of not being so committed should identify in a positive way what the Government should be doing in this very important area.  The present level of unemployment is totally unacceptable.  It is no consolation that part of the problem results from the recession in Great Britain or elsewhere.  We have a duty to our people and as far as we can we must continue with policies which will generate the economic climate in which jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the efforts of the Government to maximise the benefits to be derived from the EC in terms of various social programmes, particularly in relation to unemployment.  We should welcome the Minister's positive statement about the possibility of removing 25,000 people from the live register in 1992 as a direct result of EC grant aid. That money will be spent creating retraining and social programmes for the unemployed, particularly the young unemployed.  It is not the final solution to the problem but at least it is an attempt on the part of the Government to maximise the benefits of our EC membership for the purpose of creating jobs and, more importantly, for the purpose of preserving the work ethic for our young people who could very easily become disillusioned at their continuing failure to find suitable and rewarding employment. We have put in place a very comprehensive educational and training scheme, for which all sides of this House are entitled to claim credit, which has <Col N="1052" /> resulted in highly trained, highly qualified school leavers who should be in a position to take up rewarding employment at home or in the country of their choice.</P>
    <P>One could argue, and I am sure many people will make the point, that we are not investing enough money in education, that we are not doing enough in terms of training in the various skills which would enable people to get employment, and that we are not doing enough in the area of remedial teaching and in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio. However, while the present position is not as satisfactory as we would wish, nontheless progress is being made.  Those who are critical of the lack of progress should state how best the Government could provide the additional funding necessary to put alternative programmes in place.</P>
    <P>In a budget debate we talk about budgetary matters, about the provision, redistribution and reallocation of funds, and perhaps about the priority of one spending programme over another.  To be constructive in Opposition one should clearly identify where additional funding can be found or where changes can be made in terms of reallocating finance from one programme to another.  Progress is being made, albeit not as fast as we would desire, but at least it is steady and it will continue.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer in passing to the problem of poverty in Ireland.  We have the second highest level of defined poverty in the European Community &mdash; at 20 per cent it is an unacceptably high level.  It is no consolation that our nearest neighbour, Great Britain, has a poverty rate of 18 per cent.  We have to address the problem as we find it.  I would like to pay tribute as I have already done, to the generosity of the Irish people in the first instance and to the many charitable organisations who make such a valuable contribution in terms of caring for those who are not in a position to earn a living because they cannot get employment at home.  As a member of the Council of Europe we have commissioned a new report in terms of European poverty.  The <Col N="1053" /> fact that there are five million people in the European Community on the poverty line indicates the extent of the problem facing Europe as a whole, and most importantly, individual Governments within the European Community.  We have a duty to address this problem and to ensure that within the limited resources available to us we do not lose sight of our social obigation to provide care for these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been heralded from the Government side as the tax reforming budget.  I intend dealing with that matter in more detail later in my contribution, but suffice it to say that since 1988 it is the highest earning 20 per cent of taxpayers who have benefited. The lowest earners have not benefited and I will produce figures to substantiate that fact.</P>
      <P>I would first like to address the social area, particularly education, the area for which I hold a brief.  The capitation grant is frozen at £28.  Despite primary education being a constitutional right, we can now expect further increases in voluntary contributions and/or crises in funding for heating and fuel in schools.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about the prevalence of voluntary contributions in schools.  Naturally these are at their highest in affluent areas, they do not exist to any great degree in less well off areas. The primary curriculum review body report recommended that a European language should not be introduced in national schools.  The Minister for Education indicated in the House that he agreed with that recommendation.  As we become more involved in the EC, I believe the job opportunities for our young people will be enhanced if they are fluent in a European language.  A number of schools in affluent areas offer tuition in a European language as an extra-curricular activity.  Because of the low capitation and the policy the Government say they will implement, young disadvantaged people are being discriminated against in terms of their long term job prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the fifth year in six, child benefit <Col N="1054" /> has not been increased.  We should look at child benefit in a particular context because that for many women is the only independent income they have.  If child benefit were to be kept in line with the 1986 figures there would be an increase of £2 to £3 per child in this budget.  Both women and children have been short changed.  The Department of Finance view is that child benefits should not be increased; the Progressive Democrats also hold this view.  When the old system of children's allowances was replaced by the child benefit scheme, this represented progress on a long cherished objective of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Against the storm of right wing rhetoric and the anti-welfare lobby which gave birth to the Progressive Democrats and the demands of the &ldquo;Smurfits&rdquo; of this world to cut public expenditure by £2 billion and social welfare by at least £200 million, the Labour Party held the line. The Taoiseach, who is departing in order to secure the continuation of the Progressive Democrats in office, confessed to making an intellectual leap when explaining to his Fianna Fáil colleagues what was happening when they decided to go into coalition with the Progressive Democrats.  If one decodes &ldquo;intellectual leap&rdquo; what it means is playing politics.</P>
    <P>As a party with a social commitment, Fianna Fáil have gone a long way in a short time to espouse the new right, the view of the Progressive Democrats.  To paraphrase the late Mr. Seán Lemass, Fianna Fáil is a slightly social party. However, when their commitment is tested by the Progressive Democrats, they struggle with their conscience but, unlike the Labour Party, their conscience never wins.</P>
    <P>I have alluded already to child benefit from which 1.2 million children benefit. Had child benefit payments kept in line with the 1986 figures, the mothers of Ireland would be getting an extra £27 million.  There is another area of social care which all sides admit is very badly catered for; the much heralded carer's allowance introduced last year has proved to be of little value.  In fact, it raised expectations but because of the <Col N="1055" /> very rigorous means test 60,000 voluntary carers who save the Government over £500 million per year have been ignored.</P>
    <P>I now come to this so-called tax reforming budget.  Since 1988 the top 20 per cent of taxpayers have benefited from successive budgets.  Looking at the benefits that accrue from this year's budget, the first thing that strikes you is that the PAYE and personal allowances have been frozen.  It would cost a further £125 million to maintain these reliefs at 1986 values.  In the context of tax reform this area which would be of particular benefit to low paid taxpayers was frozen.  A single person on an income of £60,000 will gain £2,123 whereas a married couple with an income of £60,000 will gain £1,934, but a married couple on £8,000 will gain only £54 a year and a married couple on £10,000 will gain £95 a year. So much for tax reform.  We can see who really benefits.</P>
    <P>If we consider the increase in VAT rates which will affect telephone charges, clothing and personal services, such as hairdressing, and other services which are availed of by all sections of the community, we see that a higher percentage of the income of low earners will go in this area.  The gain of £54 in the case of a married couple on £8,000 per year will be quickly obliterated by the increased VAT charges.  In essence, the much vaunted tax reform is an illusion for those on low pay.</P>
    <P>Other Government measures, which are not part of the budget <i>per se</i> impact on the low paid.  The Labour Party were particularly concerned about third level grants.  A family with an income of £10,000 will gain £95 from the budget whereas a family on £20,000 will gain £489, but the income limit for eligibility for third level grants lie between these two figures.  In the early part of last month the Minister issued a statement on third level grants where he said he was setting up a review committee to develop more equitable income assessment criteria. This committee will comprise of representatives of concerned Departments, <Col N="1056" /> including the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Education, the Environment, Finance, Health and Social Welfare and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the old ploy once again, set up a review committee on a sensitive issue that requires urgent attention so that the issue is sidelined for a considerable period.  It should be noted that the Minister's statement set down no time limit for the deliberations of the review committee or for the date for the publishing of their report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>I shall not be completely negative. Paragraph 69(m) of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in relation to education states:</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Grants Scheme will be re-examined in the context particularly of (i) increasing the income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third-level; (ii) assessing income eligibility of mature students who are not dependent on their parents, on the basis of their own and, if married, that of their spouses' incomes; (iii) regarding mature students who secure a place in a third-level institution as satisfying the academic requirements and (iv) the development of more equitable income assessment criteria for all applicants.</P>
    <P>The fourth is the most vital and it has been kicked to touch into the distant future.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will introduce amendments to the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, to give effect to changes to the first three points to which I have referred &mdash; increase eligibility for families with more than one child attending third level education; the assessing of mature students on the basis of their own and, if married, their spouse's incomes and regarding mature students who secure a place in a third level college as having satisfied the academic requirements.  The move is welcome, but the real issue and the fundamental inequity in terms of access to education relates to income limits <Col N="1057" /> across the board.  The Government have not done anything in that regard and, worse, the Minister has decided that, commencing in September 1992, ESF grants for new students will be means-tested. That, again, will be detrimental to educational access for the children of parents in the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>The income limits will be at the present completely unacceptable level of the higher education grants.  It is universally acknowledged that the present system militates greatly in equity terms against those who have parents in the PAYE sector.  Everyone accepts that the PAYE worker is a prisoner of his or her P60, whereas local authorities receive mind-boggling returns of income related to activities in the self-employed sector.  The system is so loose that, for instance, if an account is presented showing the item &ldquo;drawings&rdquo;&mdash; and the drawings against a business can be quite substantial &mdash; the local authority dealing with the grants do not have the wherewithal or the permission to query that item.  As will be noted from that example, there are transparent ways of diverting funds away from income for the self-employed sector.  The present system has gone on for too long and there are too many students unable to avail of third level education because their parents, who are on modest incomes, do not qualify.  To make matters worse, the same inadequate income levels are now being applied to ESF grants.</P>
    <P>As a first step, and before the review committee sit, the income limits should be changed and should apply to net rather than gross income.  Ireland is an overtaxed country and nobody disputes that. However, with my party I dispute the contention that this is a tax reforming budget.  The point I stress again is that those on the margins in terms of eligibility for third level grants will get very little out of the budget.  I ask the Government, and the Minister for Education in particular, that under consideration of the Finance Bill &mdash; or whatever mechanism is open to him &mdash; as a very first step he should make the basic change that the income limit for third level education <Col N="1058" /> grants be based on net rather than gross income.  The Labour Party also call on the Minister to rescind as a matter of urgency the decision that ESF grants now be means-tested.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not responded to a very important query about ESF grants which concerns post-leaving cert courses at second level colleges.  Those courses provide second-chance education for many people, including the unemployed. The Government must address this quickly and effectively.  The budget should have been a jobs budget.  Unemployment is the major problem facing this country.  There are 275,000 people on the live register but the real figure is much in excess of that.  In my constituency on 31 December last, the most recent day for which we have official figures, the unemployment figure for Waterford city and county stood at 8,172.  That figure does not include the workforce of Waterford Crystal, who are on continuous short-time work.  They were on holidays that week and, therefore, they were not signing.</P>
    <P>A problem that all public representatives face every day is housing. For local authority housing and the social housing programme the budget provides £80.3 million.  Last year approximately 1,300 houses were built, which compares very unfavourably with the number built at the time of the Coalition Government of which the Labour Party were a member.  During the term of that Coalition Government the Environment ministry lay for most of the time with the Labour Party.  In 1984 7,002 houses were built.  The problem is dreadful.  We are all aware of people with a real housing need and are now housed in accommodation that is utterly unacceptable in this day and age.  It will be three, four or five years at the present rate of progress before they will be housed.</P>
    <P>The budget lacks generosity and that point comes across strongly in relation to development aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 7, 11, 16, 19, 21, 23, 32, 62, 153, 154, 157, 160, 162, 163 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures indicate that new house completions in 1991 totalled 19,600, slightly up on 1990.  There is no reason to believe that the current level of output is, in the aggregate, inadequate. It well exceeds the projected annual housing requirements contained in the NESC report &ldquo;A Review of Housing Policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, aware that there are problem areas that will continue to require attention.  These include the provision of decent accommodation for households on low incomes, the accommodation of homeless and travelling people and the elimination of substandard accommodation.  It is for these reasons that the Government published the policy document &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; last year which enunciated new policies and introduced a range of measures which are now being implemented to tackle these issues.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issue of homelessness and the report referred to, I would draw attention to pages 15 and 16 of &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; which deal with relevant policy measures.  Since the plan was published, revised guidelines have issued to housing authorities in regard to the accommodation needs of homeless persons and the authorities have been requested to utilise fully their powers to secure accommodation for any homeless persons in their area and to give effect to the measures identified in the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards local authority housing needs generally, the position is that details of the assessment of need carried out by each housing authority under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to <Col N="1063" /> reflect the position at 31 March 1991 were published last week in the housing statistics bulletin for the September quarter, 1991, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The results of the assessments will be taken into account, in conjunction with other relevant factors, in the determination of the allocations to individual local authorities for their housing construction programmes in 1992.  These allocations will be notified to the authorities as soon as possible but, until the allocations as a whole have been determined, I cannot anticipate what the allocation to any particular area may be.</P>
    <P>I am having three statements circulated in the Official Report.  The first shows the numbers of dwellings provided by the housing authorities in 1989 and 1990.  The 1991 programme projected completion of 1,300 houses but while full returns have not yet been furnished by all housing authorities, those received to date suggest that the number of completions may be somewhat below this figure.</P>
    <P>The second statement details the numbers of local authority houses returned by the authorities to my Department as being in progress at 30 September 1991, the latest date for which complete information is available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The third statement sets out the position in regard to houses under construction by the Dublin authorities, as returned by them in the December 1991 quarterly reports and the other information requested on housing in Dublin to the extent that this is not available in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 1990.  Information is not available to me in relation to particular housing areas of Dublin city and county.</P>
    <P>Information is not available in my Department on the number of applications to individual planning authorities for planning permission for new individual private houses or in relation to the processing and determination of such applications.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister forgive me for saying that he sounds like the Taoiseach in the last general election when he said he did not know about the health problems in the country?  Is the Minister seriously telling us that there is no housing crisis?  Will the Minister join with me this afternoon and come down to the homeless section of Dublin Corporation or Dublin County Council to see for himself the desperate situation there?  Would he not accept that with the changes in emigration, the NESC projections for housing needs are out of date already and that there is truly a desperate housing crisis in this city and county and in every county?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there is now a well organised campaign among Irish emigrants in the UK, the US, Australia and in other countries to secure voting rights.  They will be very interested in getting more specific information from the Minister than he has given in his initial reply.  In relation to the comprehensive paper which was promised in the revised Programme for Government, who is preparing that paper, at what stage is it, or have the Government received the paper?  Since the revised Programme for Government committed the Government to making a decision on this matter before Christmas, what is the new target date by which the Government will have made a decision in relation to voting rights for emigrants?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 12, 14 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the Government's local government reform programme was the enactment of the Local Government Act, 1991, which contains a range of reform measures.  Other elements of the reform programme will be implemented progressively and any further legislation which is necessary to give effect to them will be brought forward as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 Act provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the postponement of elections to sub-county local authorities to allow for consideration of appropriate arrangements at that level.  A ministerial group chaired by me was established to consider this question and will report to the Government as soon as possible.  When decisions on this issue have been taken by the Government, the question of when elections at the sub-county level will be held <Col N="1074" /> can be considered further, taking practical and other relevant considerations into account.</P>
    <P>In so far as the regional level is concerned, the review of the Programme for Government indicated that regional authorities would be established under the Local Government Act, 1991 not later than 31 March 1992.  The necessary preparatory work to permit this is now in hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue has not been decided by Government as yet.  There is a committee sitting, of which I am chairman.  We are looking at the issue of the sub-county structures.  We will be reporting to Government and Government will make a decision in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Government still hold to the position enunciated by the Minister's immediate predecessor in accepting the recommendations of the Barrington Commission in relation to the sub-county tier, that is, the establishment of district committees?  Is that still Government policy?  Will the necessary legislative framework be introduced in this session and will the Minister report to the House on the current position of the ministerial committee, which I understood was to finalise recommendations for Cabinet by 15 January last?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

That legislation is not yet drafted and clearly will not be before the House for some time.  Given the timescale needed to select candidates for any new district councils, will the Minister not accept that it is unrealistic to talk about elections in June?  In the interests of clarity, will he announce that there will not be elections in June?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 20, 39, 45, 56 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions in relation to the system of election to apply in Ireland for the European Parliament elections in 1994 do not arise at this stage.  Pending the entry into force of a uniform electoral procedure, elections to the Parliament are regulated by the Act annexed to the Council Decision of 20 September 1976 and by <Col N="1077" /> national law, in our case, the European Assembly Elections Acts, 1977 to 1986.</P>
    <P>The Treaties envisage that the Parliament shall draw up a proposal for a uniform electoral procedure and that the Council of Ministers, acting unanimously, shall lay down appropriate provisions which it shall recommend for adoption by member states.  While draft proposals have been prepared on a number of occasions, I understand that the Parliament has not as yet formulated a proposal.</P>
    <P>The draft Treaty on European Union, agreed at Maastricht, contains provisions which will affect elections to the Parliament. For example, it provides that all Community citizens will have the right to vote and stand as candidates at elections to the European Parliament in the member state in which they reside.  It also provides for the assent of the Parliament in relation to the provisions to be laid down by the Council relating to uniform procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would be a matter for his Department, in the first instance, to prepare such proposals?  Second, in view of the impending White Paper which was expected last month, does he anticipate it will contain any detailed information regarding our approach to our system of voting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department await the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs agreeing a procedure, following a proposal from the European Parliament when we will take whatever steps are <Col N="1078" /> necessary in advance of the elections to be held in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there must be uniformity, for instance, to cite one simple example, on the holding of elections on the same day in each member state?  Since it has been the practice to hold elections in continental countries on a Sunday will we adopt the same procedure here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>A first progress report on the Environment Action Programme was published by my Department in July 1991.  The report documents the substantial progress which has taken place in implementing the programme's main objectives, and highlights some of the key achievements in the period to June 1991.  These include: EC approval of Ireland's operational programme: water, sanitary and other local services 1989-93; the elimination of Dublin smog by the ban on bituminous coal and the establishment of the new environmental information service &mdash; ENFO.</P>

How much of that money has been spent to date and how much of it has come from European Structural Funds?  In line with that programme it <Col N="1083" /> was promised that eight pieces of legislation would either be enacted or published in 1990.  To date only three of those have seen the light of day.

If the local authorities supply the Minister with information to suggest they are understaffed will he deal with the problem positively and provide the finance required?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the task of combating crime has to be given top priority by the Garda Síochána and that so many gardaí are being diverted to the task of enforcing traffic law &mdash; although the enforcement of traffic law is wholly inadequate &mdash; is any consideration being given, for instance, to the establishment of a traffic police for Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the Minister for Justice and the Garda authorities.  While it is an operational matter for the Garda Síochána everyone in the House has to be satisfied with the way in which the Garda are ensuring that the law is maintained in regard to drink-driving. The record on the way they do their duty is before the House but as I said, it is an operational matter for the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I think every Member will accept that the Garda Síochána are doing a wonderful job in enforcing the legislation.  Despite the fact that large numbers of the Garda have been enforcing this legislation during the Christmas period, there was as the Minister is aware, an appalling number of fatal accidents during that period.  Indeed, the number of people killed was far higher <Col N="1092" /> than the figures for previous years.  In conjunction with the legislation proposed would the Minister give an undertaking to carry out a study to ascertain if there are other ways by which we can reduce the number of fatal accidents and serious injuries and encompass these measures in the legislation?  One package is not enough.  We need to carry out an in-depth study to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>The environmental action programme stated the Government's proposal to ensure the provision of a central hazardous waste incinerator.  Proposals for such a facility were invited by my Department and their assessment was at an advanced stage when, in 1990, a proposal was independently advanced by Du Pont (UK) Limited to locate an incinerator, with capacity to serve all of Ireland, at their Maydown works, County Derry. In view of the changed commercial and strategic conditions created by the Du Pont proposal, my predecessor decided to allow the situation to clarify before supporting any particular proposal.  In December 1991, Du Pont announced their decision not to proceed with the proposed all-Ireland facility but instead to improve the treatment and disposal of their own hazardous wastes.  This changed situation makes it necessary to review the planning of an Irish central hazardous waste incinerator, and I have already indicated that my Department are addressing this urgently.</P>
      <P>A number of important changes have occurred since my Department commissioned proposals in 1989.  The following are among these: higher technical standards than those earlier specified are now embodied in new German legislation and in a draft EC directive on hazardous waste incineration; market conditions may be affected by Du Pont's stated policy of dealing with their own wastes; possible new incineration requirements for possible waste and/or sewage sludge may also be relevant, and more up-to-date statistics on hazardous waste will shortly become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review which I have set in train is well justified by reference to these <Col N="1097" /> factors.  I will communicate its outcome as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the absence of a comprehensive waste management policy and the absence of a waste treatment plant here is a major impediment to industrial development and job creation?  Will he agree that the indecision and legislative cowardice is costing jobs because industrialists do not know what will happen in the future?  Will he agree he is depending on foreign industrialists to do our work for us?  Will he now announce the date when the national waste treatment plant will be set up?  We are sick of cop-outs.</P>

      <P>I said that the report on industrial waste highlighted the need for a hazardous waste incinerator.  However, I believe &mdash; and I am sure the House will accept &mdash; that my predecessor made a very wise decision when Du Pont announced that they were looking at the feasibility of building an incincerator which would cater for the needs of the whole of Ireland.  It was only last December that Du Pont announced they were <Col N="1098" /> not proceeding with the plan but that they intended to build an incinerator to cater for their needs and the needs in the locality where they have their factory at Maydown.  As soon as we were informed of that we resurrected the plans which were at an advanced stage but, because of events to which I referred &mdash; including European Community Directives &mdash; we decided to have a total review of the up-to-date position.  There is no question of a cop-out, a decision will be made.</P>

How can the Minister agree with his predecessor's reasoning because it showed that he was totally dependent on external forces and factors and that we did not have the situation under control?  What will happen when the European Commission insists on this country treating its own hazardous waste?</P>

      <P>It is necessary to plan on the basis of the amount of hazardous waste which must be treated and the projected amount in the future.  If someone intends to build a major plant which will cater for the needs of the whole country it seems appropriate that they would at least know what is happening there before building a plant which might be very expensive and totally out of line with what is required.  I assure the Deputy that we are treating this matter with seriousness; I believe that my predecessor was right and we are now conducting a review in the light of the new situation.</P>

Is he aware that some firms have already been told by the providers of a waste facility outside his jurisdiction, that they can no longer use the facilities in Northern Ireland or in Britain?  What interim arrangements will the Minister put in place for those firms?  Secondly, have the Department come down in favour of the argument that it is not economic to provide a waste facility just for the South? Would it be economic to provide such a facility for the whole island or for the South?  The report his Department gave the British-Irish parliamentary body said it was not economic to provide such a facility just for the South.</P>

      <P>The new regulations which were published in December 1991 will not come into effect until 1 June 1992.  This interim period will allow those persons concerned with their use to familiarise themselves with the regulations and related technical guidance documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have been active on a number of fronts in promoting awareness of the building regulations.  A range of public and private bodies &mdash; including those involved with the construction industry &mdash; have been advised of the making of the regulations and were requested to become conversant with their requirements before 1 June next. Secondly, a series of regional seminars for local authority officials has been organised in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration so that building control authorities will be ready to discharge their statutory functions and responsibilities.  These seminars will be <Col N="1106" /> held in the coming weeks.  Finally, my Department are participating fully with a number of professional bodies and educational establishments in programmes of seminars and courses, the purpose of which is to disseminate information on the various aspects of building control legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to buildings of special historic or cultural importance, I should point out that the building regulations will not normally apply to existing buildings, although extensions to such buildings must comply with the regulations.  Where certain alterations or changes of use of existing buildings occur, the regulations may have partial effect, depending on the circumstances of the individual case. However, the requirements of the new building regulations have been drafted in a simple, functional format and this should allow a measure of flexibility for designers and constructors in devising solutions to meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>The Building Control Act, 1990, allows building control authorities to dispense or relax the requirements of the building regulations if they think this is reasonable in a particular case.  However, in view of the functional nature of the regulations, I think it is unlikely that resort to this mechanism will be required in many instances.</P>
    <P>Taking everything together, I am satisfied that the new regulations will not unduly restrict the sensitive redevelopment of buildings of particular historic or cultural significance.</P>

I also welcome the review group's support for the investment strategy outlined in the operational programme on peripherality and in particular their endorsement of the strategy for national primary roads which emphasises the development of strategic routes and the remedying of capacity deficiencies.

      <P>While there is no scheme for the provision of such facilities in private houses generally, there are a number of ways in which particular categories of persons can be assisted: house improvement loans of up to £3,000 unsecured, and £10,000 secured; the new scheme whereby local authorities can have improvement works, including the installation of bathroom facilities, carried out to the existing accommodation of approved applicants for local authority housing, as an alternative to rehousing; the disabled persons construction grants scheme and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly which provides assistance to elderly persons living alone in unfit or insanitary accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the four schemes to which he referred are totally inadequate in terms of funding available to them?  Obviously the loan scheme would not be available to people who could not afford to repay the money.  The other three schemes are barely funded &mdash; for example, only <Col N="1109" /> £200,000 has been provided in the southeast for the housing scheme for the elderly. Will the Minister consider as a priority the whole question of rural elderly people living in houses with no bathroom or water facilities, with a view to improving substantially the quality of life for these people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely good budget.  It is employment oriented. It provides real benefits for the PAYE workers who can at last see a realistic effort being made to cut the contribution they make to central funds.  They are promised also further concessions in next year's budget and we are moving in the right direction in that regard.  The budget is geared also to meet the needs of those on social welfare particularly those who have slipped behind the rest of the community.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a great deal of homework was done on tax avoidance measures and other loopholes in the system that had been ignored for many years.  These were examined and dealt with.  Almost very single source of income was carefully examined and adjustments were made to cut out unfair advantages that were available to the select few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to allow full relief of VAT on medical equipment supplied by way of voluntary fund-raising. This is particularly relevant to Cork.  Several groups are involved in fund-raising for much needed medical equipment which the State does not have the resources to supply.  One group based at Cork Regional Hospital use the acronym ACT, that is, Aid Cancer Treatment. They recognised there was a need for cancer treatment in the Cork area, they did not agree with the policy of total centralisation of cancer treatment in Dublin.  This committed group of people formed ACT in the early eighties and through their magnificent efforts have been able to hand over more than £1 million worth of equipment for the treatment of cancer.  They have lobbied long and hard for the dropping of VAT charges on the equipment used.  The local media &mdash; I might mention <i>The Cork Examiner and The Evening Echo</i>&mdash; have been most supportive of their campaign and have backed them all the way.  I became particularly interested when I was nominated by the public representatives from all parties to liaise with the group and to co-odinate the case <Col N="1221" /> being made to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, for the removal of the VAT charges.  At a press conference prior to that meeting, Deputy Reynolds had given me and those present a commitment to work for the removal of VAT on such medical equipment.  At this stage, on behalf of ACT, may I place on record our thanks to both Deputy Reynolds and the present Minister, Deputy Ahern, for their recognition of the great efforts made by voluntary bodies.  This decision will give a great boost to the fund-raising efforts of those seeking funds for different aspects of medical care.  In Cork, there are several dedicated groups involved in fund raising for the purchase of different items of medical equipment.  The fact that VAT had to be paid on equipment which had been purchased through fund raising was psychologically damaging and far outweighed the benefits accruing to the State from the VAT income.  I welcome this decision.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I listened to Deputy Duke's presentation on the budget.  I found it fascinating but I believe he may have been deliberately mischievous when he boasted about putting four budgets before the Dáil.  He dwelt at some length on the VAT rates.  While there is a degree of opposition to and haggling on the budget, the Minister for Finance usually gets on with the job.  I can think of only one glaring example where the standard performance of a Minister for Finance failed to materialise &mdash; coincidentally that budget failed because of a stupid decision taken on the VAT rate.  Deputy Dukes may have been reminding us of the budget introduced by the present Leader of Fine Gael rather than referring to last year's or this year's budget.  The Deputy's budgets failed effectively to make any real change particularly to the lot of the PAYE workers.  It is probably worth comparing the past four budgets with the budgets he introduced particularly in the context of income tax reductions.  I say that because Deputy Dukes concentrated on the mess that had been made of tax particularly the area of tax reform.  He claims that the changes <Col N="1222" /> announced this year will make no difference at all to the PAYE sector.  He reiterated the argument for widening the tax bands rather than cutting the rates of tax.</P>
    <P>If one analyses the financial implications, it is true to say that the widening of tax bands could be used to make the tax system more equitable. Indeed, many commentators support this argument, and what they have in common is that they understand fully the complex aspects of income tax bands and the relationship between the various tax tables.  What they do not have is the practical experience of dealing with people who have taken a psychological blow.  I am referring to people who may have worked overtime in their job on one or two weekends and then find out during the year that that has cost them an enormous amount of money when their wages clerk or someone else notifies them that they have jumped from one tax band into the next and that they will in fact be worse off after earning a small amount of money through overtime.  In the last four budgets in which Fianna Fáil were involved the tax rates have been lowered in a way that allows every person to assess his or her position at the end of the year or at any point during the year.  People are financially better off regardless of the amount of work they do.</P>
    <P>We now have two tax bands that have been lowered progressively by 7 per cent or 8 per cent and the new system is clearly understood.  The psychological difference of someone being able to assess his or her wage packet in that fashion as against the system of the mid-eighties is very hard for someone in Deputy Dukes' position or with his background to understand. I should point out that there has also been a great widening of the standard rate tax bands for both single people and married couples.  The general exemption limits have also been increased significantly.</P>
    <P>Lest someone might think I am over-emphasising the simplicity of the present system as against the previous system, it would be no harm to compare the <Col N="1223" /> position now with that of the mid-eighties. Ordinary workers then had difficulty understanding the system and were told by administrators in the middle of the year that they had jumped from one tax band to another.  I must point out, lest people have forgotten, that Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance in 1983-84, when one's first £1,000 of income was taxed at 25 per cent, the next £3,000 at 35 per cent, the next £2,000 at 45 per cent, the next £2,000 at 55 per cent, the next £2,000 at 60 per cent and, believe it or not, the balance at 65 per cent.  Unless an ordinary worker had a good commercial background and a calculator to hand it was almost impossible to figure out his or her position.  A quick comparison with the system that applies today demonstrates how much tax matters have been simplified.  As I said, the commentators and the experts are all in favour of tax bands, are <i>au fait</i> with taxation and are able to grasp a complex system.  Fiddling with tax bands was not the answer, particularly when one took into account the psychological effect on working people when they lost out having worked longer hours or tried to better themselves.  Now working people will understand that they have extra money in their pockets, they will be able to recognise that they are better off and will realise that things are being done for them for the first time.  In the time about which Deputy Dukes boasted he made absolutely no effort to do anything about taxes for those on the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate on the budget speakers have stated that Ireland is much worse off than any other country in Europe.  I was very interested in the chart compiled by Ernst and Young, international auditors that showed the difference between pre-tax income and after tax income which appeared in Monday's <i>Irish Times.</i>  It illustrated that the Irish tax rate comes within a few pounds of the rate in Germany.  Ireland is very much in line with the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and France, particularly when it comes to taxing married couples.  In regard to taxing of single <Col N="1224" /> people, Ireland lags behind the other countries to which I have referred apart from Germany &mdash; our single people are less well off after taxation.  It is worth considering illustrations such as that chart to bring a touch of reality to the discussion.</P>
    <P>The steps taken were necessary and the steps taken by the Government in the last four years were very necessary.  The measures will bear fruit for the ordinary worker.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the budget have been attacked.  Deputy Dukes yesterday criticised the level of funding for implementing equal treatment legislation.  He was extremely critical that the payment to women deemed to have been unfairly treated under the terms of the EC directive relating to equal treatment for men and women in matters relating to social security was not being made in full this year.  The Deputy complained that only £22 million will be provided this year, with the remainder to be paid in 1993 and 1994.  Deputy Dukes criticised the arrangements, which are costing the Exchequer a huge amount of money, with such polish and style that any observer would be forgiven for not realising that it was the Deputy's own blunder and mismanagement &mdash; which he boasted of when telling us about his budgets &mdash; that led to the need for the payment. Deputy Dukes was the paymaster, he was Minister for Finance.  From the deadline for the implementation of the directive, 23 December 1984, to the date of implementation, May and November 1986, Deputy Dukes, and his colleagues, were guilty of gross negligence.  They shilly-shallied and procrastinated in a deliberate attempt to deny the legal entitlements to those women about whom Deputy Dukes is now so concerned. As a result of the huge amount of money due &mdash; some commentators estimate it to be £200 million &mdash; it is obvious the Government must make the payment over a phased period.  Deputy Dukes was critical but he is the last person who should be critical.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy O'Shea boasted of the clear conscience of the Labour <Col N="1225" /> Party in relation to payments to women. He was very emphatic in saying that the Labour Party had wrestled with their conscience and the women had won out, but, if my memory serves me right, the Labour Party were a little involved in the 1984-86 arrangements in that they refused to apply the equality code for women.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea told us of Labour Party worries that some families with a greater income would gain more than other families under the Government's tax cuts. The Deputy is correct in saying that there will be a greater gain for some but I must point out that when his party were in Government no family gained from income tax reductions, regardless of their level of income, and that is well documented. The previous Coalition Government simply refused to reduce the tax rates.</P>
    <P>The budget is employment orientated and I welcome it for many reasons, particuarly the inclusion of two new employment and training schemes, which will be of particular importance.  I welcome the support of the trade union movement for the schemes.  Many cynics decry even the description &ldquo;job training&rdquo;, but that is mainly because of their complete ignorance about the industrial arena.  In that regard, a very serious topic was referred to by the Minister for Education about a fortnight ago and it is something Ireland will have to consider very seriously.  The Minister was right when he said that the values of vocational or technical training did not enjoy the same recognition or acknowledgment as did those of academic training.  People in technical training work for an equal number of years and under the same pressure as those in academic training but receive little or no recognition.  As someone of an industry-related background, I am aware of that and I believe that one of the greatest weaknesses of our country is the failure to recognise the value and the need for vocational and technical training.</P>
    <P>Vocational and technical training have always been categorised as second class and are officially recognised as such in <Col N="1226" /> many State bodies and groups and under State regulations.  A radical change is needed in that regard.  People ask why countries such as Germany and Japan have done so well in the industrial field. One of the main reasons is that those countries recognised the need for vocational and technical training at a very early stage.  They recognise the ability of those who undergo such training.  It is an attitude of society that is at issue.  We might not like to admit that but, unfortunately, in many quarters in Ireland it is felt that the manual worker &mdash; the blue collar worker or any other description one might like to give him or her &mdash; is inferior.  They are the people who work with their hands and keep this country going.  They produce the goods we export and consume at home.  They maintain the service area and everyone else in the State.  There is an unfair view that they are in some way inferior to those who are described as white collar workers. Manual workers, those who work in industry and in the productive sector, are the lifeblood of this country.  They are underestimated and treated badly.  This may be because the rules have been drawn up and are being implemented by people who have come through the academic field rather than the industrial or technical fields.</P>
    <P>I was shocked recently to learn that a brilliant person in the Defence Forces was denied advancement for training in the technical arena in which he excelled on the basis that he had not completed his leaving certificate.  I raised such a hullabaloo over this that there may be some alteration of that rule, but such a rule is indicative of the bias about which I speak.  That bias will be there until we get our act together.  I am glad that the Minister for Education has recognised this.  This country will never reach its full potential until we recognise the talents of these young people.  I have worked with trades people and technical people whom I could describe as artists in their own fields.  I have worked with young people who have represented Ireland at the highest level of international competitions and they have won out against <Col N="1227" /> the so-called advanced industrial states like Japan and Germany.  In many ways such young people are less regarded in the public eye and in some institutions than a person with the most modest academic letters after his name.  This is an imbalance that has to be dealt with and I hope the Minister will deal with it.</P>
    <P>The new training schemes will highlight the need for training.  People in every walk of life should recognise the need for training and accept it up to the day when they finish employment.  Technology and systems are changing and we need to keep up with the changes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the schemes too because for a long time large groupings of people on the live register will have to be dealt with under specific schemes if there is to be any hope of cutting down on numbers on the live register.  Our method of assembling the live register will have to be carefully examined.  We constantly compare our figures with those of other countries, particularly those of the European Community, but we are not comparing like with like.  We have a different method of putting together our live register.  Specific groupings in the live register need help and these two schemes are helping.</P>
    <P>The constituency I represent has a 37 per cent rural population.  Most of the farms in my constituency are fairly large, are efficient and are viable, but in many parts of the country there are small farms which need assistance if we are to stop the estimated drain of 12,000 people per year from the land.  Membership of one of the farming organisations is 114,000 and membership of the other is 40,000. There are a lot of people involved.  About 50,000 of the people involved in those organisations are effectively included in the unemployment figures and they are in receipt of benefits of one kind or another. Many families are on non-viable units. We need a scheme to cater for these people so that they can retain a sense of dignity.  They need to feel that they are equal to blue collar workers and at the moment they are not equal to them.  As they see it, a lot of money has been <Col N="1228" /> wasted on sending officials out to question them about social welfare and so on. These people have been the backbone of our culture.  They have produced great musicians, singers, footballers and so on. Now we are losing these people off the land.  Unless we get our act together we will be in difficulty.  We need a European scheme to cater for small farmers on non-viable units.  It appears that at the moment the European Community frowns on agricultural production.  There is no flexibility for small farmers.  A lot of regulations have been introduced to hinder them and they do not have an opportunity to get into other areas of production.  The disadvantaged areas grants do not seem to be effective and we must go beyond that.</P>

      <P>I unreservedly welcome the budget as a step in the right direction. All Deputies would have to agree with almost 90 per cent of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that rather than agreeing with 90 per cent of it I have to disagree with 90 per cent of it, although I take some of the Deputy's comments on board.  Once, the Budget Statement was seen as the key economic instrument of Government policy in relation to the direction of the economy for the forthcoming year.  It was the Government's plan of action to underpin in financial terms the Government's key social and financial objectives.  While much of the immediate and public comment would be in relation to the changes in what used to be termed &ldquo;the old reliables&rdquo;, and in relation to the taxes that would impact straightaway, such as those on drink and tobacco and so on, the budget was always seen, until relatively recently, as providing the country with the correct checks and balances and the fuel to maintain a definite social and economic flight path for the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, we had budgets which were stringent, budgets which were holding <Col N="1229" /> operations, neutral budgets and budgets in which the bullet was bitten.  This budget has scarcely been rivalled in terms of being a colourless and indecisive budget.  This is a dithering budget which has failed to bite the bullet when it is necessary, when unemployment is rapidly heading towards 300,000.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with what Deputy Dennehy said about the compilation of the live register.  That was a ploy to try to camouflage the reality.  That was running from reality rather than facing it.  The Minister in the budget lowered the threshold for the pre-retirement scheme.  The scheme in itself is all right but it camouflages the real extent of unemployment.  Anybody from 55 years of age upwards from now on is classified as being in the pre-retirement category, is effectively out of the workforce and off the live register.  The pre-retirement scheme is a sort of sweetener before one eventually goes out on pension.  To talk about lack of co-ordination in the compilation of the live register here and in other countries is invalid.  There is an across-the-board unanimity in most countries, particularly EC and OECD countries in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>At a time when unemployment is charging relentlessly towards 300,000, people being unemployed, the Government are bemoaning the fact that there is a recession in Britain, Australia and the US, but the recession does not impact directly on this country.  It impacts indirectly in that those countries cannot now absorb our human surplus workforce. With so many small farmers literally clinging to the cliff face for existence, as they are being pushed off the land by the twin forces of GATT and Common Agricultural Policy changes, and with an average of 250 grant-aided industries closing down per annum here, what was needed was not a soft budget, a holding budget or a neutral budget, but something special.  Yet the Minister for Finance, despite all the expectations with regard to his first budget, dithered badly and produced a grey, drab budget.  Apart from the income tax changes, which I acknowledge as worthwhile and long <Col N="1230" /> overdue, the budget merely treads water. If the Minister is to operate on the same principle as Dicken's Mr. Micawber, waiting for something to turn up, then his term of office, be it long or short, will not achieve the lustre which certain sections anticipated with his arrival in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>There is a massive cloud of national depression over the country, a sense of abject hopelessness.  There is total cynicism about politics and politicians, which is dangerous in the extreme.  There is a prevailing atmosphere of inevitability and despair.  This country has the capacity, given proper leadership, to shake off the lethargy and to do something for itself, to leave aside the begging bowl and to develop a strong indigenous economy.  We must get up off our knees and leave the craven attitude aside.  This country has huge potential in terms of human power and natural resources. There are many people willing to work and there is much work to be done, yet we have failed miserably to produce the blueprint to bring the two together.</P>
    <P>While one must welcome the twin initiatives by the Minister to take 25,000 people off the live register for a year, this is a variation of the employment incentive scheme and various other schemes which operated under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  They are welcome in themselves because they afford people the dignity of work, but they are essentially short term.  They are tinkering with the economy and treating the problem at the edges rather than at the core.  The two initiativs announced by the Minister will do nothing fundamental to get to the heart of the problem.</P>
    <P>How Deputies Deenehy and Hyland can talk about this as a job-driven budget is beyond me.  How the media commentators can talk about &ldquo;Bertie's budget bonanza&rdquo; is also beyond me. There was no bonanza for the unemployed or the social welfare categories, although they were welcome increases. If ever the country needed a special budget to get the engines of the economy going again, it was at this time.  I am <Col N="1231" /> disappointed that the opportunity was missed.</P>
    <P>There are many people who have viable ideas which are capable of producing jobs in the manufacturing and commercial sectors, but these people do not get from the organs of State the necessary encouragement to put their ideas into practice.  Before Christmas I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of companies who went out of business in 1989 who had received grant aid from the IDA.  About 240 companies went out of business that year, having previously received grant aid amounting to £32 million.  In 1990 257 companies went out of business who had received £33 million in grant aid from the IDA.  That amounts to £65 million by way of grant aid to failed industrial entities.  One wonders about the degree of screening and monitoring.  What type of business plans were produced?  How thorough was the scrutiny of those companies? Many people have good ideas relating to the service and industrial sector who would gladly avail of a pittance of the grant aid given to these failed entities.  A job is a job, whether in the service or in the industrial or manufacturing sector.  I realise that the IDA have in some cases to take risks.  I also subscribe to the principle that you cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs. There are many eggs in £65 million in two years.  That has been the pattern.</P>
    <P>We have never really gone into the whole business of targeting our industrial policy in the area of export substitution. We have never systematically analysed the inventory of imports to see how we could meet the challenge from abroad. What efforts were made by the IDA, for example, when Gateaux went out of business to stave off the influx of products with a long shelf life by encouraging major bakeries to diversify and meet the challenge?  If a bakery applies for any kind of grant in relation to confectionery to keep out imports of long life products, there is not a penny available by way of grant aid.  Many bakeries are willing to take up that challenge.  We need to <Col N="1232" /> develop small indigenous industry and we have the people to do it, provided they are given the stimulus and the encouragement.  In the past we have always talked in terms of the grandiose. One thousand small lights spread far more light over a wider area than one massive spotlight.  I welcome the recommendations in the Culliton report but I despair at the predictability of the Government response &mdash; yet another task force while Rome continues to burn.</P>
    <P>One of the major success stories has been the operation of CERT.  A recent analysis shows 98 per cent job placement. What other organ of training can claim that high level of success in terms of getting jobs?  Yet the CERT budget has again been decimated.  The food industry is where the key lies.  Foreign industry has no commitment here, although they have made a welcome contribution in the past.  They are essentially torso industries &mdash; the body is here but the head and legs are elsewhere.  They go at the slightest whim without any real commitment to this country.</P>
    <P>If we accept that education is the key instrument of social policy, this budget has disappointed badly.  Even allowing for the improvements in <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in the pupil-teacher ratio, as and from next September, when the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level is to be 25:1, there will be over 600 primary school classes which will have over 40 pupils.  Imagine any teacher trying to contain a class of that size, let alone trying to educate them. There will still be 3,500 classes with between 35 and 40 pupils; 4,000 classes with between 30 and 35 pupils; and 3,800 classes with between 25 and 30 pupils. There will be 11,000 classes over the pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1.  Two-thirds of those schools will not have remedial teachers.  It is a fundamental principle of social policy that every single pupil has the constitutional right to the degree of teacher or tutor contact appropriate to his or her educational needs.  I therefore support fully the principle of weighted pupil-teacher ratios targeted into areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> Friday last was the closing date for receipt of applications for the CAO/CAS offices, forms that qualify students for third-level education.  Again under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the Government boasted about making additional money available for guidance teachers, additional vice-principals, caretakers and secretaries in schools.  Yet, when the budget was announced, we discovered that all the Minister had given was an additional £1.1 million to cover caretakers, secretaries, career guidance counsellors and additional vice-principals.  The overall lack of career guidance teaching and counselling is a scandal.  Of the 270 vocational schools in the country, 58 only have career guidance counsellors.  Of the 800 second level schools nationwide only 208 have career guidance counsellors.  Of the 65 community comprehensive schools, only 54 have career guidance counsellors.  Of the total 1,135 post-primary schools nationwide a mere 320 have ex-quota career guidance counsellors.  In my opinion that is most unfair.  Indeed it cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The position is that the careers and course choices made by students last week will, in most cases, prove to be life-long decisions.  Despite the excellent advice offered in privately produced booklets and publications, in the education supplements in papers and by education correspondents, it is virtually impossible for a 17-year-old, the majority of parents, or even those who have had third level education themselves, to unravel the labyrinth of the CAO/CAS scheme.  The fact that 800 schools do no have any access whatever to career guidance or counselling inevitably means that hundreds of students make wrong career choices.  They do not understand the system.  For example, they are accommodated in classes where they fail examinations; they drop out from college or remain stuck in careers for which they are manifestly unsuited.  Therefore, it is wrong that career guidance teachers should be allocated simply and solely on the basis of school size.</P>
    <P>At present only schools with 500-plus <Col N="1234" /> pupils are allocated a career guidance teacher.  Under the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, as from 1992 onwards, it was stipulated that schools with 350-plus students would be allocated half a career guidance teacher but those with fewer than 350 pupils &mdash; as is the case in the majority of schools &mdash; would be allocated none.  This problem must be tackled in the short term.  The way in which to do this is to have shared career guidance teachers, with small schools pooling their resources, thereby affording every student without exception adequate career guidance.  I am vehemently opposed to the recent announcement by the Minister for Education that he proposes to means-test European Social Fund grants for third level students.  It is quite clear that the Minister's policy in relation to third level education &mdash; that is if he has any at all &mdash; lacks vision and planning, that he is embarking on a scheme which will place impossible burdens on middle income families in the provision of higher education for their children.</P>
    <P>There is a very generous budget for Bord Fáilte, one of the big spenders in the semi-State sector.  There is much talk about tourism but, unfortunately, tourists are fairly thin on the ground.  It is somewhat like looking around these benches where there are huge gaps, as there are in rural areas with huge tourist potential but who never see tourists on the ground.  Instead of embarking on a major thrust at the Japanese market, welcome though that may be, as Deputy Kenny said on radio one morning, we have absolutely no tracking system whatsoever for our people.  There are 40 million people of Irish origin worldwide.  Five million people have left this country since the foundation of the State.  I honestly believe that, for an investment of a 32p stamp, a well crafted personal letter to each and every one of those emigrants would be very worth while.  I contend that would be the answer in the short term to attracting tourists, particularly to areas like the west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> We were told that if we got the essentials, the nuts and bolts of the economy &mdash; inflation, our balance of trade, borrowing requirement and so on &mdash; correct, everything else would follow.  That has now been the case.  This Government had a political amnesty from Fine Gael for long enough.  They got an amnesty from the unions, from farmers, from the electorate. The day of amnesties is over; they have failed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we examine the overall picture in a budget debate.  To date, the role of the Opposition in this debate has been solely to apportion blame and offer very few solutions. We are all somewhat agreed on the basics in the formulation of our economic policy.  First, we should endeavour to reduce exchequer borrowing, reduce the current budget deficit, reduce taxation, endeavour to maintain our social services, specifically in the education and health areas, and endeavour to increase employment and economic growth. Nonetheless it will be acknowledged that the marrying of all of those is an enormous task.  Yet we have had from the Opposition benches contradictory signals, with calls for increased expenditure over a whole range of areas and for reduced taxation in others, but very little attempt to cost their proposals or advance a reasonable, sustainable programme of policies as an alternative to present Government policies or actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Opposition were in Government, that is Fine Gael and Labour, between 1983 and 1986, the performance of our country was the worst within the league of European countries.  Contrasting that performance with the results for the period 1987 to 1991 we find that there was an average economic growth rate of 4.5 per cent in those years.  Indeed in 1990 we had a growth rate of 7.5 per cent, equivalent to the record growth we had as far back as 1968, whereas in 1991 there was a retardment of that growth, when we still managed a 1.5 per cent growth rate.  It is estimated that our growth rate this year will be in the region <Col N="1236" /> of 2 per cent.  In addition exports have been particularly buoyant in that period. There is an estimated growth of 7 per cent in manufacturing production for the year 1992.  Our inflation has been maintained at very low figures.  Along with our EMS counterparts, we have been successful in keeping it down since 1987. Our balance of payments has been in continuous surplus since 1987 and in 1991 our balance of trade figures again showed a surplus of over £2 billion.  Indeed there has been significant stability also in our exchange rate within the EMS band since March 1987.</P>
    <P>Within the context of all the economic indicators any objective analyst would have to accept that this Government have performed very well since assuming office, as was the case with their predecessors. There is one major problem from which we cannot run away, that is unemployment.  In outlining the positive factors prevailing in our economy at present, I am not endeavouring to conceal in any way our major problem which is unemployment.  I would even agree with comments from the Opposition benches that it is a problem that should be taken out of the party political arena, because no one party have all the answers to unemployment.  Perhaps there is need for the establishment of some forum like the <i>New Ireland Forum</i>, on employment creation, some forum of the same structure, with every single group and institution nationwide being entitled to make submissions on their ideas and policies in relation to the creation or protection of jobs here.</P>
    <P>I would certainly support any such proposal. Of course, even that would not solve our unemployment problem, provide solutions immediately or in the short term.  At least it would be an acknowledgment and recognition that we must all work together to tackle our huge unemployment problem, which is primarily a structural one peculiar to our population structure.  It is a problem that will remain with us for a long time, for anything up to 20 years given our demographic structure.  Therefore, any Government must produce a series of interim <Col N="1237" /> measures designed to impact on the crisis levels of unemployment obtaining and which will obtain in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the budget whereby 25,000 new places, both in manpower training and in State jobs, are being funded by the European Community, as outlined by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  Such measures are needed for the next few years to deal with the problem of unemployment which we will endure for some time to come.  There will have to be a European dimension to the resolution of the problem and a European input because harmonisation will reduce our competitiveness in certain areas and will create difficulties in certain sectors of the economy in regard to competing with our European partners.  Unless there is a balancing dimension to our participation in a Single Market we will be in difficulty. Therefore, it is not with any begging bowl mentality but with the recognition and acknowledgment of structural difficiencies in our economy, and given the particular make-up of our labour force and our population, over the next ten to 15 years, there is a clear case to be made to Brussels that we have special needs in the employment area.  There should be an obligation on our European partners to assist us in reducing our unemployment and improving the quality of life for all.  We have witnessed the first step in that direction.  A number of people have under-estimated the significance of that measure which involves the European Community taking 25,000 people off the live register in 1992.  We need more of that type of initiative in the future.</P>
    <P>I disagree strongly with the comments made by Deputy Jim Higgins in relation to foreign investment and foreign industry. We have had too much of that type of comment.  The reality is that were it not for foreign industry since the beginning of the sixties we would have an appalling unemployment situation.  I acknowledge that very often the research and development headquarters of these firms and major plants may be elsewhere but the <Col N="1238" /> reality is that they contribute enormously to employment creation in Ireland and, indeed, to the exports boom we have had over the past ten years and to the quality of life for many people.  Far be it for Deputies to make ill-judged criticisms of foreign investment and foreign industry because we are living in an open economy where borders no longer exist in economic terms.  To make comments of the type mentioned by Deputy Higgins is really burying our heads in the sand; they will not advance employment creation in any significant way.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we invest very heavily in our education system because, as I have said frequently in this House, employment creation is inseparable from educational development and from investment in our educational infrastructure. There is a strong correlation between the qualifications which young people have on leaving school and third level and their gaining employment. Those who leave educational establishments with qualifications by and large gain employment and the percentages are high in all the surveys which have been carried out.  Those who leave school early and who are unskilled, or who have no qualifications, find it extremely difficult to gain employment, tend to get into a rut and find it very difficult to re-enter the labour market.  In that area, specific measures are needed both in the educational sphere and in manpower policy training programmes.  I welcome the forthcoming White Paper on manpower policy because it is critical to that growing problem.  The difficulty is that given the increased technology in our economy, given the increased need for skills and greater training those young people will find it increasingly difficult to gain employment in future years.  Our policy both in the Department of Labour and in the Department of Education will have to target those school leavers to try to improve their capacity to enter the labour market.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the budget to honour the non-pay aspects of education in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i> the reduction <Col N="1239" /> of the pupil-teacher ratio, the provision of funds for extra caretakers and extra secretarial assistants, career guidance teachers and vice-principals.  In the context of a difficult financial and economic situation it is an outstanding achievement by the Minister not only to solve the greater <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> issue on the pay front but also to deal with the important non-pay aspects of <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which people in the educational field were concerned would not be honoured.  It is gratifying to see that that could be achieved.</P>
    <P>On the taxation front,  I welcome the fact that the Minister has left the mortgage and VHI relief intact.  Attempts have been made in some quarters to attack mortgage interest relief.  That has been a very important social instrument in this country in improving the level of home ownership.  We have a very proud record and as a country we can boast of having a very high percentage of people who own their own homes.  That is an outstanding social achievement and one which my own party can take some credit for.  One of the reasons I am a member of Fianna Fáil is because of their strong commitment in the social area.  That is best manifested by that satisfactory statistic where a large number of people own their own homes.  Long may that continue. Any effort to remove mortgage interest relief would have a detrimental impact on that situation.</P>
    <P>We have made very significant reductions in the tax rates over the last number of years.  When those reductions are taken in the context of major budgetary constraints we have reduced our taxation rates very significantly from 1987 onwards.  For example, from 1989 the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent of 27 per cent &mdash; almost by a quarter.  There has been a significant widening of the standard rate band by 12 per cent which is far in excess of inflation. The top rate of tax has been abolished and we now have two tax rates.  This is all in the context of very serious financial constraints.  That is why I come back to <Col N="1240" /> the Opposition who seem to think we can spend all around us, increase spending in every Department, reduce taxation and so on.  The arguments they have put forward are untenable.</P>
    <P>There have been significant changes in the VAT area but I welcome the fact that there has been no increase in VAT in relation to construction and tourism.  The tourist industry, which will be the growth industry for the next ten years, has the greatest capacity to create extra jobs quickly.  If we have growth rates and if we can develop and expand our tourist strategy &mdash; I agree with Deputy Higgins in relation to the potential which exists in markets that have not been tapped to date, Japan and so on &mdash; that would be welcome.  It shows the Minister's concern and acknowledgement of the important role that tourism plays in economic growth and also in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision, as mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Dennehy, to refund VAT on donated medical equipment. This is something which had been strongly fought for in Cork, particularly by ACT &mdash; Aid Cancer Treatment &mdash; who have done outstanding work in raising money for cancer treatment equipment and so on, for hospitals.  Perhaps one could argue that the Exchequer should be providing this equipment but I am a great believer in voluntary endeavour. The State would never be seen to impede voluntary endeavour.  Certainly the VAT on medical equipment was seen in that light, as an unnecessary inhibiting factor put in place by the State or the European Community.  I welcome the fact that the Minister removed that imposition on medical equipment.</P>
    <P>A number of significant improvements on the social welfare front have been introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for example, the carer's allowance and the back-to-school allowance.  This year the Minister managed to increase the latter by £10 per child.  That is a significant provision.  It will mean much to low income families dependent on social welfare payments, particularly in September <Col N="1241" /> when their children return to school, a time that can prove most difficult for parents.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the innovative decision to grant a special payment to adoptive mothers along the lines of the existing maternity benefit scheme.  This is an outstanding measure and should be welcomed. It is an indication that the Minister has adopted a very positive attitude towards womens' issues in general.</P>
    <P>The decision to extend the free travel companion pass scheme to cover certain pensioners, in particular blind pensioners, should also be welcomed.  This unnecessary anomaly was the source of some concern.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism, some people cast doubts on the decision to give a large budget to Bord Fáilte but it should be borne in mind that one of the key areas is marketing and that we have to spend a considerable sum of money in promoting this country abroad.  When one travels abroad one realises that this is just a small country in a big world and that we are not as well known as we sometimes like to think we are.  It is very important therefore that we do not reduce our marketing budgets.  If anything, we should endeavour to target the specific needs of special areas in the tourism sector.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is to continue to place emphasis on the tourism industry in relation to job creation.</P>
    <P>Let me make one further comment on social welfare.  I wish to welcome specifically the decision to make a grant available to the Centre for Education, Counselling and Psychotherapy in Cork, a voluntary group set up a number of years ago and who are providing a wonderful service for people who would not be able to afford to pay for such a service if they had to go to professionals in the ordinary way.  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance should be complimented for making a worthwhile grant available to that group.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of the budget because it continues the very effective financial management we have witnessed since Fianna Fáil came to power in 1987. They have kept the public finances on an <Col N="1242" /> even keel and have continued the process of reducing taxation rates.  In time this will have an impact on unemployment. In relation to social welfare, we have maintained payments ahead of the rate of inflation and protected families on low incomes by way of the family income supplement, back to school payments and so on.  This fits in with the very strong social philosophy which has been the hallmark of Fianna Fáil policies since the establishment of that party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Against a background of a series of unprecedented scandals this budget was framed by a Cabinet who have been unable to concentrate on the problems facing the country.  For the past 18 months no Minister has been able to direct his or her attention to their constitutional responsibilities.  They have been torn internally by power factions and outside pressures in regard to one scandal or another.  What we are witnessing today in the environs of this House is a severe dose of ministerial jitters. The only two people at present who it would appear are not unduly worried about tomorrow's decision are Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Haughey.</P>
      <P>There are so many bandwagons in the environs of Leinster House today that no Cabinet Minister nor Minister of State knows whether they will be able to implement the decisions made as they affect their Departments in this year's budget.  Thank God that whole scenario would seem to be almost at an end.  The song may well change &mdash; it may not be &ldquo;Albert, don't go&rdquo;, but &ldquo;Hold on to me, while you can&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to the implementation of the budget by those appointed to the Cabinet, internal faction fighting and power seeking, where people are crawling over each other to stay on the mast of State, does no good when it comes to dealing with the real problems facing our people.</P>
      <P>The budget is somewhat like the Minister for Finance's approach to the leadership struggle.</P>

      <P>It is incomplete, indecisive and unclear.  Certainly there are strong blips in the budget, which everybody would have to agree with, but we are not clear as to the direction it is taking, mainly because, as I said, of internal faction fighting.  That is the background against which people had to frame Estimates during the past few months.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that the reason the Progressive Democrats, who are now absent from the House, came into being will not exist for much longer.  It will be interesting to see what the reaction will be when the next set of demands are made by the minority partner in Government. It is fair to say also, depending on what Government are formed next week, that substantial changes may well be made in the Finance Bill, which will give legal effect to the budget, in the weeks and months ahead.  At this stage we do not know what opinions or ideas a new Taoiseach and Cabinet may come up with when they begin to discuss the implications of what was passed here last week.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to some of the measures announced in the budget; these have been dealt with by other speakers during the past week.  The introduction of Revenue numbers for small farmers marks a continuation of the attempts to drive them into the ground.  In vast areas we are beginning to replace people with trees.  Small farmers, with between ten and 50 acres of land, will now have to deal with accounts and revenue insurance numbers and will have to pay VAT on services rendered to them by contractors. This will place a further burden on them and lead them to the impression that the Government want to drive them out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year we receive millions of pounds from Europe in agricultural subsidies. Each Deputy in this House, particularly Deputies from rural Ireland, has been inundated with claims from farmers in regard to the payment of these grants. In 1986 it proved possible to pay and <Col N="1244" /> deliver not one but two headage cheques to farmers before Christmas.  We have now reached the position where farmers have to contact public representatives on a daily basis to point out that they have not received last year's cheques.  Claims are processed and dealt with in local offices but are then sent to Dublin for payment.  Why is it not possible, with modern technology, to pay out claims once they have been approved?  The answer, of course, is that the Department of Agricuture wish to keep those moneys in their own bank account for long enough to balance their books in a better light.  The next Minister for Agriculture should be in a position to state to the farmers &mdash; and to those eligible for all kinds of agricultural grants &mdash; that they will receive payment by a particular date. This would allow agricultural planning to take place and it would mean that people who buy agricultural goods, fertilisers or feedstuffs, will be able to pay for them. We should not have the position of thousands of farmers still waiting for the postman to arrive with the envelope containing their cheque.  It is not good enough that people are contacting TDs to complain that they are not in a position to pay their motor insurance because the agricultural grant has not arrived.  It is perfectly possible, through existing technology and computerisation, to do that swiftly and efficiently.  It should be a fundamental principle that a date should be fixed by which these payments are sent out.</P>
    <P>Much talk has been generated in regard to the taxation measures in the budget.  I want to refer briefly to one aspect, the area of VAT within the general parameters of harmonisation.  We are under instruction, through European directives, to harmonise and reduce our number of VAT levels.  In this case the Minister for Finance now has to deal with six levels of VAT: the zero rate, the 2.7 per cent rate, the 10 per cent rate, the 12.5 per cent rate, a new rate at 16 per cent and the 21 per cent rate.  It is an administrative nightmare to attempt to deal with the many aspects of VAT as it <Col N="1245" /> stands in the budget.  For instance, in the area of hotels and the tourist industry generally, there is a 10 per cent rate of VAT on accommodation, a 12.5 per cent rate on meals and a 21 per cent rate on bar facilities.  How can Revenue be in a position to distinguish between these three levels in any middle-class hotel? Will it be reduced to the level of a B and B?  How do the administration expect to be able to cater for three levels of VAT in one hotel?  Instead of expanding the levels of VAT the Minister should have had the courage to contract them and make it administratively easier for Revenue to deal with them.  Indeed, this also applies to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>In the area of catering there is a 4 per cent increase in VAT.  There is no VAT on food in express takeaways but the level of VAT will be increased on the overall turnover.  This means that the managers and those involved in the business will have to increase their costs by approximately 10 per cent in order to be in a position to pay the 4 per cent increase.  It obviously means increased costs for those who use the facilities.</P>
    <P>Some concessions have been made in regard to excise duty on new motor cars. However, the Minister did not take into account the fact that many garage owners who have been very severely pressed over the last number of years might have had quite substantial stocks on hand prior to the reduction in excise duty.  It means that many of them stand to lose between £10,000 and £20,000, as a result of which they will have to work for two or three months this year before they get back to the position in which they were prior to the budget and before the effect of the reduction in excise duty takes effect.  The Finance Bill should provide for retrospective payments to people who, quite genuinely, had very heavy stock on hand prior to the budget, to facilitate those who wished to purchase new vehicles.</P>
    <P>Every local authority now has to deal with vastly increased lists for housing claims and this matter has not been addressed in the budget.  I greatly regret that the reconstruction grant was abolished some years ago because it provided <Col N="1246" /> an opportunity for many people throughout the country to put their houses into better shape and to give them State assistance to do so.  It also meant that small contractors, tradesmen and others involved in that area had a constant stream of work available to them.  I very much regret it was not possible to introduce the reconstruction grants, even in a limited form, because local authorities and urban councils now have to deal with increased claims for housing.  In many cases there are nine to ten people living in a house and in others there are five and six people in one room.  Obviously this is a matter which would have to be treated with great sensitivity but it has not been addressed to any extent in the budget.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have fallen down in regard to their constitutional responsibilities to the people who require housing.</P>
    <P>Unemployment, according to the January report of the CII, at the end of December was 269,200, or 20.2 per cent of the labour force.  That compared with 232,800 at the end of December 1990, which was 17.8 per cent of the labour force.  Assuming that the figures are correct, where does that budget attempt to deal with a situation where thousands of young people will be coming on to the labour market every year?  There will be many more people than the Government can hope to deal with through the provision of jobs.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister for Finance in one of the Sunday newspapers expected that the leadership crisis would not have arisen for some time; he expected that the unemployment problem could have been dealt with, in part at least, by the introduction of four or five major corporations from abroad.  Does this reflect a return to the attitude of the sixties and early seventies when the IDA were instructed to buy land banks and to build advance factories in the hope that industry would be attracted to the country? What kind of thinking is there in the Department of Finance and at Government level to solve the problem of young people on the streets who are crying out for the opportunity to be able to work at <Col N="1247" /> home?  They do not want to be driven abroad; some of them, unfortunately, end up in cardboard cities in London, Boston or New York.  It is interesting that in Munich in 1986 there were around 600 Irish people, a figure which has now grown to several thousand.  These people were trained and educated here but they emigrated to Germany because work was available there.  Regardless of where our young people are working aborad, they would return to Ireland in the morning if they could get jobs here.</P>
    <P>The issue of a jobs forum which has been referred to by several parties should be addressed by the Taoiseach designate and the Government.  An end should be put to the tinkering around with the various schemes which has gone on for the past 20 years.  If the Culliton report really addresses the heart of the matter, the Government should deal with the priority areas outlined in an effort to create employment.</P>
    <P>Tourism seems to be the means chosen by the Government for reducing our employment problem.  I do not believe young people want to spend the rest of their lives making a living from carrying suitcases or serving at tables.  Obviously a great number of jobs can be created in the tourist area, but people would hardly wish to spend all of their lives working at that level.  Many speakers have referred to the budget for Bord Fáilte.  We should ensure that we have top quality facilities and products for tourists.  Instead of giving grants in respect of accommodation and other services money should be provided for decent facilities, whether they be parklands, theme houses, etc. which will attract visitors here in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In this context, the quality of our environment has to be taken into account.  For a great number of years the question of native resources has been raised by people in the west.  Recently the bishops became involved in the issue.  The matter of goldmining in the west of Ireland has raised its head and the Minister for Energy has dictated to Mayo County Council that a blanket ban should not be introduced in this regard.  I intend to raise <Col N="1248" /> this issue on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill when I shall be seeking clarification on whether a local authority have the legal right to implement a ban or direction which is against written Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget and I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on its introduction, this being his first budget.  I commend the Taoiseach on his valuable input into the social aspects of the budget, particularly those aspects which are of concern to elderly people.  Since I have been a Member of this House the Taoiseach, first as Minister for Finance and then as Taoiseach, has always ensured that increases for old age pensioners have been that bit ahead of the rate of inflation.  The lot of old age pensioners has been made considerably better as a result of the Taoiseach having passed this way, so to speak.  The elderly people I have met in my constituency have always been appreciative of the efforts he made to ensure that they were cared for.  I have every confidence that the incoming Taoiseach will implement measures which will favour the older people in our society, no matter how difficult things may be in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to commend too, the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on the budget he introduced last year.  That budget had to be prepared during a most difficult period &mdash; the Gulf War was imminent and no one knew what the full implications of that would be.  It must have been a nightmare for the then Minister to prepare a budget in such circumstances.  In any event, he produced a good budget which left us in a much better position at the end of the year than most, if not all, countries in Europe.  We should remember that due to the efforts of the Government and the former Minister for Finance we were in a better position and better able to ride out the recession which still holds sway in many other countries in Europe.  We have done very well in that regard.  We are in a much better position than for example, Italy, where efforts are <Col N="1249" /> being made to form a new Government or our nearest neighbour where the recession has given rise to the loss of thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>In spite of the recession in other countries, which has led to a decline in the number of Irish people emigrating, the number of new jobs here has continued to rise.  I want to refer to some of the figures in this respect.  From December 1982 to April 1987, when the former Coalition Government were in office, there was an approximate net loss of 50,000 jobs.  Since April 1987 there has been a net increase of 41,000 jobs, 70,000 of which have been created in areas outside agriculture and the public sector. Unemployment was reduced by 40,000 from March 1987 to May 1990.  The increase of 50,000 in the number of people unemployed over the past year and a half has been due only to the cessation in emigration.  Under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government unemployment increased continually.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came into office in 1987 they had to deal with very major problems.  We have weathered the storm very well and have shown ourselves worthy to be in Government, unlike the Labour Party &mdash; who are very fond of barracking this side of the House &mdash; who ran out of Government when tough decisions had to be made.  This Government made some very tough decisions.  I recently met someone who told me that when the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government would make a tough decision in the interest of the country a week or two later the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald would go before the Cabinet and say that as a result of embarrassment caused to Deputy Spring, the then Tánaiste, they would have to rescind the earlier decision.  This tough Labour leader, then, was not capable in Government of pulling his weight in the national interest; he was only able to do so in so far as it affected the fortunes of the Labour Party, and that, I am sure, will become evident when the Cabinet papers from his time in office are released.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned not only at the <Col N="1250" /> high unemployment rate in Dublin but also at the level of crime and vandalism. The cost of this to the community is enormous. The Oireachtas Select Committee on Crime of which I am a member, recently visited Trinity House which is run by the Department of Education. One of the problems there is that three or four of the young people detained are psychiatrically disturbed and should not be detained in that situation.  Some years ago a very fine, secure detention centre was provided in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum to cater for the criminally insane.  That is a fine building but, unfortunately, it now has to be used for purposes other than those for which it was intended.  I appeal to the Minister for Finance to provide extra money to the Minister responsible, to build a secure detention centre to deal with psychiatrically disturbed people.</P>
    <P>There are not many of these people in Trinity House but the cost of keeping them there is enormous.  So much of the time of the staff is taken up with these people that they have no time for the other people under their care whom they could help.  The psychiatrically disturbed people there are constantly rioting and have no intention of mending their ways. When they are of age they will go from there to Mountjoy or Dundrum.  Those people should not be detained with the other young people in Trinity House and I ask the Government to urgently consider this matter.  I do not think they should have to wait for the report of the Select Committee on Crime before taking action.  The matter should be dealt with urgently.</P>
    <P>We can be very proud of our economic performance <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of other countries. The Exchequer borrowing requirement was reduced from 13 per cent of GNP in 1986 to 2.4 per cent in 1992, and that is an achievement of which we can be very proud.  In addition, we have been steadily reducing our national debt.  It had increased from £21.6 billion to £25.4 billion in 1991, just less than £4 billion, as compared with an increase of £10 billion between 1983 and 1986.  Again, tremendous progress has been achieved in that <Col N="1251" /> area.  We can be pleased that we have managed to control inflation which is very important.</P>
    <P>When I compare our shops with their range of merchandise on sale to the public with the empty shelves in shops in the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, as can be seen on television, I am thankful to God. Recently, a woman complained to me about the cost of food, but while it is expensive at least all types of food are available.  Much of our fruit and other foods are imported and, fortunately, we have the money to buy them.  I am sometimes concerned that if the recession deepens in Europe generally it may affect us because we depend on exports for our livelihood.</P>
    <P>The problem of attracting tourists to our country still exists.  Since I was elected to this House in 1965 I have advocated direct flights from Dublin to the United States, an issue which is again very much to the fore.  I know that the western lobby have strong feelings about over-flying Shannon, but many of those people do not give Shannon a fair chance. Ultimately, Aer Lingus will have to be allowed fly direct from Dublin to the United States as will other airlines. About 50 per cent of passengers coming to Ireland are destined for Shannon while the other 50 per cent travel on to Dublin. I do not understand why, if there are two flights on the same night, one flight cannot fly direct to Dublin while the other stops off at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Shannon is a hub for Europe.  Plane servicing facilties are available in Shannon as are all other services.  The future of Shannon is assured and always has been under Fianna Fáil Governments, but if they are not willing to compromise in allowing direct flights from Dublin &mdash; ultimately it is the Government's decision &mdash; Shannon will be the loser in the long run because Aer Lingus cannot continue losing money.  Aer Lingus, at tremendous effort, succeeded in getting permission to fly direct to Los Angeles but cannot put the service into operation because of the stop-over at Shannon.  There is no point <Col N="1252" /> in operating that service unless they can fly directly from Dublin to Los Angeles. The sooner Shannon lobbyists come to an agreement on this matter the better it will be for this country.  Dublin is probably the only capital city in the world into which airlines flying the transatlantic route cannot fly directly, except in the case of charter planes.  We have to change that practice because we should be attracting people here rather than keeping them out.  I urge the people in the west, particularly those in the Limerick-Clare region to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to corporation tax.  Under a former Government the amount of corporation tax collected was minimal, but it more than doubled between 1987 and 1992.  There was only a very slight increase in corporation tax under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  In 1982, corporation tax realised £206 million and in 1986, under the Fine Gael-Labour Government it realised £362 million.  In 1991, under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government corporation tax realised £593 million and in 1992 the estimated yield is £678 million which is a big improvement.  The yield from capital taxes has increased from £20 million in 1982 to £77 million.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister for Finance is exempting from VAT medical equipment purchased by voluntary bodies.  I am one of the founder members of the Bone Marrow for Leukaemia Trust, and in their early years the committee raised money to buy a cell separator for St. Luke's Hospital.  It cost approximately £20,000 at the time and VAT had to be paid on that amount.  I have always believed that where people contribute money voluntarily for the purchase of expensive medical equipment, the equipment should be free of VAT.  I am delighted this has been finally recognised. I would like also to see this apply to voluntary organisations such as the Order of Malta, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, or other voluntary organisations which purchase medical supplies, bandages, stretchers, <i>et cetera.</i>  I hope these purchases will be free of VAT.  I would <Col N="1253" /> have liked also to see a measure by which ambulances could be purchased duty free, as most ambulances are operated by voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Those over the age of 66 years have the concession of free travel.  I am delighted also that the companions or spouses of people in receipt of the DPMA will be allowed to travel free when accompanying them.  I was in London recently and I was surprised to learn that the free travel concession applies only to travel within London.  People there were astonished that a person with a free travel pass in Ireland could travel anywhere in the country.  This shows how a little country like Ireland has been able to look after its elderly people.  We have done this with tremendous panache.  Fianna Fáil Governments were responsible for the introduction of the free television licence, free electricity, free telephone rental and free travel for the elderly in addition to the removal of excise duty on vehicles specially adapted for disabled persons.  We can hold our heads high when we come to discuss our social conscience. We have done very well indeed.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see that the Minister for Finance is giving the Rape Crisis Centre an extra £25,000.  As a member of the Eastern Health Board, I visited their premises last year at a time when they were almost closing down.  The Eastern Health Board fund the Rape Crisis Centre.  I was very impressed by many of the people, especially the psychologists, whom I met.  At the time I felt, and still do to a certain extent, they were not dealing with emergencies, as much as people thought they were but with those who had undergone trauma years beforehand. They seem now to have come more within the ambit of what the Eastern Health Board had hoped they would do. There is now a great sense of co-operation between their staff and that of the Eastern Health Board.  The centre should go from strength to strength and they will certainly have the backing of the health board.  I am delighted to see they have the backing of the Government, who have come to their aid on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> I was very worried when the Minister for Finance announced that grants to third level students were to be means-tested. I was worried that only the children of the very poor or the very rich would be educated and that the middle income groups would not be able to educate their children.  I felt that the income limit for eligibility for third level grants was set too low and that the child of those parents with an income of over £12,000 would not be eligible for a grant.  I was speaking to the Minister for Education about this problem.  He assured me that the free element of the grant was not means tested but that the maintenance element of it was.  Wealthy people who can well afford to pay the maintenance element should pay to keep their children at college.  I am still concerned that the means test is pitched at too low an income, and I hope the Minister will look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the man or woman in the street or in the pub ask the question: &ldquo;What do you think of the budget?&rdquo;  I need only refer to four headlines in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the day after the budget which accurately summarises in headlines what the budget was about.  The first headline read: &ldquo;High paid employees without perks will benefit most&rdquo;.  The article went on to say that the biggest winners would be the higher paid employees without perks, like a company car, who would gain substantially from the cut in the top rate of tax to 48 per cent and that better off employees paid a salary without fringe benefits would gain substantially.  The clear message is that well paid workers will see an incredible increase in their take home pay.  An executive is quoted as saying: &ldquo;It is a budget for the secretaries of Government Departments&rdquo;.  This is not a budget that will benefit the ordinary working man or woman PAYE taxpayer, In fact, it will not alter by a single percentage point the scandal that 90 per cent of all income tax is still to be paid by the PAYE sector who will continue to carry the burden of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second headline reads: &ldquo;Many on <Col N="1255" /> welfare barely protected from inflation&rdquo;. The article went on to say: &ldquo;This budget will increase the spending power of most people on social welfare from July by a quarter of a penny in every pound.&rdquo;  That is another way of saying that it will more or less protect welfare recipients against the expected rate of inflation of 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent.  I have been quoting Pádraig Ó Moráin, the well known journalist and social welfare correspondent of <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>While the Progressive Democrats have succeeded in increasing the real take home pay of the &ldquo;secretaries of Government Departments&rdquo; the Fianna Fáil partners in Government have left welfare dependants no better off.  They have been barely covered against inflation.</P>
    <P>The third headline read: &ldquo;VAT increases will reclaim part of gains from tax cut&rdquo;.  The 16 per cent rate will apply to clothing and telephone charges, etc. This writer, Colm Boland, reminds us that: &ldquo;The increase from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent on VAT covers a wide range of goods and services including adult clothing and footwear, personal services such as hairdressing and repairs and maintenance, including car repairs.  Telephone bills will also increase.  The increase also applies to services such as health studios, televison repairs, driving lessons and sales of works of art and antiques.  Whatever about the arts and antiques VAT increase, VAT on eye glasses and contact lenses will also rise to 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>By this stage the man and woman in the street are beginning to see through the deceit of the Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern but, in fairness to them, they are prepared to tolerate some sacrifices or even accept the budget as presented if they think the main issue of concern to them and to the nation as a whole is being addressed.</P>
    <P>They then ask the key question: are there any jobs in the budget?  A headline of an article written by John Bradley on the economic impact of the budget answers the question for them: &ldquo;Unemployment remains with us despite some <Col N="1256" /> other successes&rdquo;.  The article states that the most appropriate measure of Ireland's economic success is the number of people gainfully employed and their standard of living relative to other EC countries.  He explains that Ireland's real gross national product grew by some 2 per cent last year, that our inflation rate was among the lowest in the European Community, the big trading surpluses were run up and the national debt continued to fall at a fraction of gross national product, and that while that might indeed warm the hearts of economists and statisticians, nevertheless all of that good news still translated into a fall of some 2,000 in the total number employed.</P>
    <P>The sober reality is that growth of over 3 per cent per annum is needed to create net increases in employment.  Much higher growth &mdash; say, 4 or 5 per cent, allied to a parallel high labour demand in the UK would be required to cut unemployment. That message translated into layman's language reads that 300,000 people will continue to be unemployed after this budget, that the country has failed them and that they had better hope for an uplift in the economy of the UK so that they can go there to look for work.</P>
    <P>The budget starts out in part by recognising the real poverty of the poor throughout Ireland who resort, out of desperation and poverty, to the services of the illegal moneylenders who like piranhas, prey on the poor of our society. Their huge rates of interest and their exploitation have been highlighted in the past 12 months by the number of cases successfully prosecuted through the courts.  The Minister provided a welcome £260,000 for the setting up of several pilot projects aimed at building new and more comprehensive approaches to combating the problems of moneylending, and I am glad to say that Dublin was an area to be targeted.</P>
    <P>However, the stupid directive of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, in telling the ESB to stop serving their customers who want to buy electrical appliances on easy payment through their electricity bills will effectively undermine <Col N="1257" /> attempts to curb the activities of illegal moneylenders.  The Minister for Energy will have driven thousands of vulnerable people who can ill afford the lump sum payment for electrical goods right into the waiting arms of the moneylenders.  I ask the House, particularly those on the Fianna Fáil benches, where is the logic in that strategy?  What is the logic in recognising the moneylending problem on the one hand, and, on the other hand, giving stupid directives that will exacerbate an already frightening problem?</P>
    <P>I wish to put the record straight lest I be accused of Progressive Democrats bashing.  The reason that the Minister, Deputy Molloy felt he could take that outrageous step is that he has the support of, amongst others, his colleague and party leader, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who would be better employed addressing himself to the unemployment problem, for which his ministry has responsibility, instead of contributing to unemployment in ESB shop outlets and forcing the public to resort to moneylenders.  The Minister for Energy could not have taken the decision that he did take without support, and he was assisted by Fine Gael members also.  He was supported by Deputy Gerry Reynolds, Deputy John Browne from Carlow/Kilkenny, Deputy Peter Barry, all of Fine Gael, and, above all, by the man who first launched the attack on the ESB, Fine Gael Whip, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  The positions of those men can be verified by reading the Dáil Report of 12 June 1991 and 3 July 1991 on both the Committee and Report Stages of the Competition Bill. Last but not least, the Minister, Deputy Molloy, was assisted by the famous member of Fianna Fáil who led the Fianna Fáil charge from his lofty position as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, none other than Senator Seán Doherty.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy should take the first opportunity he gets to come into the House and reverse his disgraceful directive to the ESB.  Further, he should apologise to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, who have so rightly recognised <Col N="1258" /> his decision as a completely negative and regressive attack on the poor.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what is the overall political direction of the budget. The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in twisting the neck of his partners in Government, has hailed his contribution to the budget as representing the liberation of the PAYE worker.  It has done nothing of the sort.  The budget is a budget of class deception.  It aims unashamedly to improve significantly the spending power of high earners while only marginally improving the lot of the vast bulk of medium-income to low-income earners. The budget and the announced intentions for the budget of 1993 aim to unreservedly shift the burden of payment from the middle class to the working class.</P>
    <P>In this political charade let us not be drawn into an anxious debate about the removal of &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; benefits to executives. Rather, let us concentrate on the real effect, which is that while the high earners will gain 4 per cent of their income the lower earners will gain only 2 per cent.  Changes in indirect taxation, for example, the increase in VAT, are regressive because they impact more harshly on lower paid workers, who spend all of their salaries and cannot save money.</P>
    <P>If the Progressive Democrats were really anxious about tax reform, then the one thing we might hear them talk about is tax equity.  The budget will do nothing to alter the fact that PAYE workers will still pay 90 per cent of all of the income tax paid, and that is the real scandal.</P>
    <P>The budget does little to spread the tax burden to other sectors such as farmers, the self-employed or the corporate sector.  On that issue we hear nothing at all from the Progressive Democrats.  Why not?  The reason is that the view of the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is that the so-called economic environment must be improved in order to provide incentives, as if the 300,000 unemployed somehow or other lacked incentive.  This is an insult.  It is a That-cherite attempt to shift the blame for unemployment on to the unemployed. The intention to tax welfare payments <Col N="1259" /> in 1993 in addition to taxing disability benefit, introducing means-testing, curtailing pay-related benefits and so on is deliberately targeted at tackling what the FIE, the CII and the Progressive Democrats call the disincentive to work.  The aim is clearly to reduce peoples' living standards so that they will be forced to work for lower rates of pay.</P>
    <P>The worker on average pay, the low paid worker and the unemployed will have to pay the cost of unemployment and the economic and financial crisis. That did not satisfy the Progressive Democrats who saw this budget as their chance to put the knife in.  They are particularly artful at exploiting the insecurities of the majority partner in coalition, particularly the Fianna Fáil leadership problems.  They want to see the further disimprovement of public services. They even demanded more pre-budget cuts.  What are those cuts?  They are direct attacks on the basic services of education, health, libraries, parks, swimming pools, care of the elderly, community health care and so on.  They are cuts in the essentials that lift society from the level of the jungle, that give quality of life to all citizens regardless of income, gender, age or opportunity.  The weakening of the services disproportionately affects the poor, the low paid, women, the elderly and the disabled.  The Progressive Democrats pre-budget demands for more cuts in services expose the narrow class interests of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil to which their friends of Fine Gael give wholehearted approval.</P>
    <P>What about unemployment and the unemployed?  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, should be known as the godfather of unemployment.  His portfolio is Industry and Commerce, but he has managed to avoid being targeted for any responsibility for job creation.  When unemployment figures are released he is either out of the country or not available. When did we last hear the Minister respond to indepth questioning from the media on his dismal performance as Minister for Industry and Commerce?  The <Col N="1260" /> ever-spiralling increase in unemployment figures is ritualistically commented on by the Opposition party spokespersons and by the Minister for Labour but I cannot remember this saintly man, the Minister for Industry and Commerce taking any responsibility for employment creation. The Minister has never been challenged to explain his inept handling of this ministry. The Progressive Democrats, always quick with a comment, always taking the high moral ground are silent on unemployment. I hope the resolution of the crisis in Fianna Fáil will expose the naked class interests of the Progressive Democrats. They should no longer be able to hide behind their moralising veil.  They should be forced into the open.  They should be relentlessly exposed for their complete abdication of responsibility. They are in Government but they have nothing to say on unemployment.</P>
    <P>Let us look a little closer at the argument about incentives.  This argument is about increasing profitability and that is fair enough, but we should always remember that profits are private and that this is really an argument for self interest masquerading as policy.  In the eighties we found that profitability, productivity and reduced labour costs are no guarantee for increased employment. The most striking feature of economic restructuring is that there is no longer any correlation between economic growth and employment.  Sean Lemass's notion that a rising tide lifts all boats is no longer conceivable.  Instead we have had a growth in joblessness; profits without job creation.  It is a phenomenon which completely undermines the credibility of Government hopes that by favouring corporate sector reinvestment, unemployment will miraculously disappear. What concerns me most about unemployment is the Government belief that all that is needed are appropriate conditions and that if we do certain things we will be in a better position when the international economy picks up.  The rapid industrial growth of the sixties and seventies was an exceptional experience, a temporary phenomenon which passed, leaving little significantly changed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> I am forced to believe that the situation facing us is so explosive and potentially destructive that it can no longer be ignored.  The numbers at work continue to decline.  The same number of people are at work in 1991 as were at work in 1931.  In 60 years there has not been an overall increase in employment.  That is a vicious indictment particularly of Fianna Fáil's performance since this nation got its independence.</P>
    <P>The decline in manufacturing and in agricultural production is not just a temporary phenomenon.  It is part of the overall global change in the nature of western capitalist modes of production. The collapse of traditional manufacturing employment has disproportionately affected Irish males when contrasted with expanding foreign and service sector industries employing mostly females.  In the mid-eighties low skilled males could emigrate.  That was not a satisfactory solution but at least it offered them better opportunities than they could get here. Today, economic crises in the key host countries, the UK, Australia and the US, and the discovery of cheaper labour in the Third World, means that this safety valve is no longer open to us.  In addition, technology has changed the nature of employment qualifications and skills demand.  All studies of future economic trends show a need for a significant reduction of unskilled workers and for a much more highly skilled labour force. Given the Government's abdication on job creation this has major implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Emigration, in the year ending April 1991 was only 1,000 compared to 31,000 and 46,000 in the two previous years.  Not all emigration has ceased.  Figures for graduates show a continuing movement of highly skilled technical, scientific and professional labour out of this country. We should look at what is happening in medicine and in our hospitals generally. Through continuing emigration we are losing highly trained, highly skilled doctors.  The training of these people cost the taxpayer money and we are increasingly replacing them with Third World doctors and medical professionals.  In <Col N="1262" /> 1991, 18 per cent of our population was living elsewhere in the EC and over 25 per cent of Irish graduates left Ireland during the eighties.  The emigration of skilled labour is set to continue.  A German IAB prognosis study of occupational trends to the year 2010 forecasts an increase of 3.4 million jobs in highly skilled occupations and a reduction of two million in unskilled and low skill jobs.</P>
    <P>The effect of this change is already visible in the escalation of unemployment and in pressure on housing and welfare services.  The picture is clear.  This social immobility restricting educational and occupational opportunities reinforces and cements the existence of a permanent two-tier society.  For those who make it, not only are their living standards at home to be improved &mdash; courtesy of the Progressive Democrats &mdash; but their ability to leave is also guaranteed.  Either way, this class wins.  For the one-third depending on the State for support, their low skill status imprisons them not just within their poorly equipped housing estates, purposely built on the outskirts of towns and cities so that they will not be seen or heard, but also in Ireland. They have nowhere to go because nobody wants them, not even their own Government.</P>
    <P>I had intended to conclude by referring to the 25,000 Mickey Mouse jobs to be provided courtesy of EC funding which will do absolutely nothing for unemployment. Unfortunately, my time has expired.  I will seek the opportunity to address some of the other points in greater detail on another occasion.</P>

      <P>The Opposition have no policy but to criticise the Government of the day, who are doing a good job under severe financial constraints.  I should like to think the Opposition would give the Government the recognition they deserve for doing their best to keep living standards as high as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986-87 there was nothing but depression and lack of confidence among the people and there was little or no investment.  Business people had not the incentive to invest at home because they were afraid they would be unable to recover their money.  Emigration was at a high level and there had been massive borrowing in preceding years.  That was the position in 1987 when Fianna Fáil took over the running of the country with a minority Government.  These are matters the Opposition parties do not want to be told about.  They had their chance in Government and this was the result of their years in office.  Between 1983 and 1986 the growth rate in GNP was zero, while the growth rate from 1987-91, on a five year average, was 4.5 per cent.  In 1990 it was 7.5 per cent, equal to the record in 1968.  I admit that national growth relaxed in 1991 when growth reached 1.5 per cent.  It is estimated that GNP will increase this year by 2 per cent. We acknowledge that we cannot keep improving GNP without massive investment. World trade is on a downward trend and most countries are finding it very difficult to maintain growth. However, the figures I have given show the comparison between the two Governments who have held office during the <Col N="1264" /> past two years.  The facts cannot be contradicted and the people are well aware of them.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1986 was £2,145 million, or 13 per cent of GNP.  In 1991 the EBR was £501 million or 2.1 per cent of GNP.  We estimate that in 1992 the EBR will be £592 million, or 2.4 per cent of GNP.  Let us reflect on the difference between the EBR of £2,145 million in 1986 and £501 million in 1991.  The current budget deficit in 1986 was £1,395 million, a record 8.75 per cent.  In 1991 it was £300 million or 1.3 per cent.  This year it is estimated to be £339 million or 1.4 per cent.  I can assure the House that this Government have been more efficient between 1987 and 1991 than their predecessors.  Yet an enormous amount of money was expended by the previous Coalition Government on running the affairs of the country, during which time they created a massive debt.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  These are the realities we should be speaking of and putting to our people.  For example, in 1986 the Exchequer borrowing requirement was £2,145 million whereas in 1991 it was £501 million.  The current budget deficit in 1986 stood at £1,395 million whereas in 1991 it amounted to only £300 million.  Any fair-minded individual drawing such comparisons would readily conclude which was the winning team.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should not make smart comments.  I hope the Deputy will clarify that point when he contributes to the debate.  Indeed, I hope he will clarify his party's political policy on that matter.  It is obvious that the Deputy is not fully aware of what the Fianna Fáil-led Government are doing. In addition, the &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; payments have been increased by £10 per child and the family income supplement has also been increased.  Workers in larger families will be subsidised to a greater extent so that they will not have less than those drawing social welfare, unemployment or other benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much criticism about taxing people.  It should be well noted that the standard rate of income tax in this budget will be reduced from 29 per cent to 27 per cent.  It should also be remembered that in 1986 the standard rate stood at 35 per cent when the Fine Gael-Labour Government were in office. The then highest rate of tax stood at 58 per cent, at a time when they were borrowing enormous amounts of money to keep the country going.  The higher income tax rate henceforth will be reduced from 52 per cent to 48 per cent. There will be two tax rates henceforth, whereas there were three, of 27 per cent and 48 per cent.  In addition, the relevant bands will be widened from £13,400 to £14,950 for a married couple, affording those people more disposable income. <Col N="1266" /> The relevant band for single persons has been increased from £6,700 to £7,450 with the general exemption limits being increased by £100 to £3,500 for a single person and by £200 to £7,000 for a married couple.  I very much appreciate those exemption limits being increased.  It will eliminate many old age pensioners from liability to tax, people who, if they had two pensions heretofore, would discover that part of the second was liable to tax. This is an attempt on the part of this Government to assure such people in receipt of two pensions that their tax liability is removed.</P>
    <P>The lowering of the income tax rates and the widening of the income tax bands will offer relief to many taxpayers. Indeed, it has been greeted by employers as a pro-jobs tax reform, rendering it easier for them to hire, remunerate and motivate employees.  Henceforth people can decide for themselves how best to spend their increased disposable incomes brought about by the income tax reforms proposed in this budget.</P>
    <P>Our greatest national problem is the repayment of our national debt, coupled with unemployment and the provision of the requisite finance to meet the ever-increasing social welfare budget brought about by the enormous number of unemployed persons.  It is unacceptable that those political parties responsible for doubling the national debt to £23 billion in the mid-eighties should criticise this Government because of the unemployment position.  Today, £2 billion, or 80 per cent of total tax revenue, must be provided to pay our national debt. Listening to the comments of Opposition parties one would get the impression that this Government were doing nothing, or were incapable of doing anything, to reduce unemployment.  It is time the media informed the public whether Opposition parties have any policy to reduce unemployment.</P>

Unfortunately, the number of new jobs being created is fewer than those lost, which is the problem of Government.  It is easy to crow on the far side of the House but the reality is that our older established industries will experience greater difficulty in the future in maintaining the employment they have been giving over the years because of the massive changes that have taken place in trade and commerce. Nonetheless we are creating new <Col N="1268" /> jobs but not sufficient to balance those lost.  Indeed, I predict we will experience greater difficulty in eliminating that imbalance in the years ahead.  However, we will continue to do our best as we have in the past.  There are now people willing to invest in this country, people who have some confidence in doing so, not as was the case in 1986 when the ship had almost sunk.</P>

      <P>The Government have identified our food export market and tourism as major outlets for investment to increase employment.  Both Departments are working hard in these two areas.  There have been vast improvements in the food industry in Ireland over the last decade.  The pace of change is remarkable.  Technology, innovation and better management have achieved these excellent results.  This is the way forward in helping to provide extra jobs.  If we are to continue our success in food exports in future years we must keep ourselves fully briefed on market trends and demands and supply quality food at attractive prices.  The key to benefiting from new technology and new processing lies in having the best information as early as possible.  We must strive to keep ahead of our competitors at all times, otherwise we will lose export trade. Using advanced technology and the best materials the Irish food industry has lifted itself from a position of being a primary commodity producer to its present status as a major processor of high quality value-added products and creating much needed employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have always encouraged this line of development.  Food exports to Europe, and especially to the UK &mdash; our nearest market &mdash; will play a major role in maintaining and creating new employment in future years.  We are facing into a period of intense international competition.  Let us give up the cribbing and grousing and identify the marketing opportunities and in the future work together to increase our agricultural <Col N="1269" /> output and decide on a new Irish food marketing programme.  We have young people with degrees in international marketing and languages &mdash; many will qualify in the future &mdash; and we should get those people to the UK and other European markets to work in the interests of the Irish economy.</P>

Most of the criticism of Government Ministers, and their policies, came from within their own ranks recently when the Fianna Fáil Party treated the country and its people as their own personal chattels and social and economic problems were sidelined.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget at this stage is academic because it deals only with 1 per cent of public expenditure.  Most of the major decisions regading public expenditure are made with the publication of the Estimates, the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement and the Programme for Government, some of which were agreed outside this House. Despite all the publicity given to the budget it does not have much impact in relation to public expenditure or social policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget did very little for job creation and the unemployed who have been abandoned and forgotten.  Commentators are correct in saying that unemployment will reach 300,000 in the not too distant future and will continue to rise because there is no economic policy in Government budgeting.  The poor have been abandoned and been asked to be satisfied with more handouts. <Col N="1271" /> The view is that social welfare payments will placate the poor with the Minister giving a certain amount next July.  While the Minister has announced increases with effect from July he has taken from them between £1.50 and £4 through increases in local authority rents in recent weeks.  That is a classical case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.</P>
    <P>I was in the House today for questions to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon.  He said effectively, there is no housing crisis here.  That was a smug, complacent attitude from a Minister who does not understand.  He did not understand the health services, he did not understand the needs of people and, obviously, does not understand the problems of urban areas.  The Minister said there is no problem, no crisis, at a time when there are 30,000 people on the waiting lists for local authority housing.  The figures prove it.  In 1984 the Government of the day spent £206 million on social housing, building 7,000 houses.  Today the allocation is approximately £80 million which may build between 1,000 and 1,200 houses.  That is how the Government are dealing with the social issues of this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to special housing for the disabled and the needy the Minister was ashamed to answer a question from me on 3 December 1991 and he gave me the figures in a letter one month later.  In the larger boroughs the number of units of accommodation provided by housing authorities in 1986 was 871 and in 1990 was 209.  In urban districts in 1986 the number of houses provided was 185; in 1990 the number was 45.  In Dublin city 143 units of special housing were built in 1986 but there was none built in 1990.  In my city of Cork 59 were built in 1986; one was built in 1989 and one in 1990.  That is the record of a Government with a so-called social conscience. As I said, they have abandoned the homeless and those with special needs.  This has led to the exploitation of the poor and the weak by the powerful and those in a position to exploit them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> As I have said already, we are heading towards an unemployment figure of 300,000.  I regret to say the scandals, the nods and winks and the faction fighting between the warlords in Fianna Fáil have led to bitterness.  Our people are of the view that their needs are being forgotten &mdash; the unemployed and the homeless certainly think they have been forgotten. There is plenty of evidence that this bitterness is being translated into violence.</P>
    <P>The simple response to the problem of urban crime is &ldquo;lock them up&rdquo;.  Crime is on the increase and the Garda feel helpless because they do not have the resources or the manpower to deal with the spiralling crime rate.  The knee-jerk response from some Members on the Government side of the House is to lock them up and provide bigger detention centres.  I attended a meeting in Tralee on Monday where the Fianna Fáil members argued that we need bigger detention centres in an effort to deal with the problem of crime.  What people need is a commitment that attention will be paid to their social needs &mdash; housing, education and health.  If they get that commitment the crime rate will reduce and evaporate.</P>
    <P>I was both amazed and amused by the contributions of two of my colleagues from Cork today who fell over themselves in praising the Minister, Deputy Ahern and the previous Minister, Deputy Reynolds, but I believe that they have their eyes on bigger things.  Coming as I do from Cork city where so many people have to put up with bad housing and poor health facilities, it was sickening to hear them offer fulsome praise for both members of the &ldquo;dream team&rdquo;&mdash; Deputy Reynolds and the Minister, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>I had to visit the out-patients department of the Cork Regional Hospital on Monday and I was very disturbed by the number of people seeking attention in the public waiting room &mdash; some of them had been waiting for many hours.  I noted the pressure that the medical and nursing staff had to endure, not just on the day I was there but every day because of the enormous cutback in recent years.  Even <Col N="1273" /> though patients are suffering and the staff are demoralised because of the pressures imposed on them, lip service is being paid to the health services and there is no hope of any improvement in the months and years ahead.  As a member of a health board, I am aware of the pressures that the health boards will have to endure again this year.  Effectively, we will have to work with a reduced budget when the changes in salaries and wages are taken into account.</P>
    <P>Having criticised him earlier I must welcome the point made by Deputy Martin, my colleague from Cork who seems to be in favour of the idea of an all-party forum on jobs.  While we in all the parties here may argue among ourselves over the best way to approach the problem we have to be united in our determination to tackle the problem because if we are not seen to be united or to have relevant ideas and policies we will soon become irrelevant in the minds of the people.  People are bitter and their bitterness will deepen in the months and years ahead if we do not commit ourselves to tackling the question of job creation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many elected representatives are complacent when it comes to tackling the problems of the unemployed and the marginalised and wish that their problems would stay hidden on the outskirts of our cities and towns, but it will not happen like that. We must take note of the lessons learned in other countries who have seen their democracies undermined by complacency and a lack of commitment to meeting the social needs of the people.</P>
    <P>In recent years I spent some time in Central America where their problems led to conflict, and what happened there could happen here, I am not being over-dramatic and I warn the Members of this House not to become complacent in relation to the views being expressed by our people at present.  In the present atmosphere all politicians are being tarred with the one brush and there is a view that we are careless and have no thought for those who are suffering, of whom there are many.  This House <Col N="1274" /> would be jerked out of that state of complacency if, as a first and important step, an all-party forum on jobs was set up. This must be done.  I will plead with whatever leader we may have next week to put this at the very top of his list of priorities to allow the Opposition express their views on the question of job creation.  The previous speaker, Deputy Hilliard, criticised us for making criticisms but we do have our views, opinions and ideas in relation to job creation and we would like to be part of a forum on unemployment.</P>
    <P>I believe the Industrial Development Authority are losing the fight in relation to their responsibility for job creation.  I recently tabled a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in which I asked him to outline the number of jobs created by the Industrial Development Authority in recent years and while I do not have at hand the information he supplied, in 1989, 1990 and 1991, the number of real jobs created by the Industrial Development Authority decreased consistently.  What is the reason for this? The answer is that we have no overall industrial policy.  A report was published last week.  I hope it will be acted upon and not be consigned to the shelves.  I fear however that it will not be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment spoke today about waste management and environmental protection, key issues when it comes to job creation, but there was no clear policy or urgency.  For example, £1 million was allocated last year to meet the cost of the activities of the Environmental Protection Agency even though they had not been set up. This year only £710,000 is being allocated, which represents a reduction.  The absence of a waste management policy is costing us jobs because industrialists are afraid to set up in this country while we do not have such a policy.  Surely the Government are aware of this.  Neither do we have a policy on regional development. The Government and the Department of Finance want to keep their heavy hand on any initiative to be taken by the regions.  I would ask the new administration to allow the regions to take the <Col N="1275" /> initiative.  In Cork we are revamping our enterprise board and are turning it into a regional authority, comprising Cork Corporation and Cork County Council.  If we are given the resources we will create jobs.  All we need is freedom to take the initiative and, given the resources, we will translate that initiative into jobs.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish tax relief in respect of shares offered to employees of companies is one that I do not welcome because it reduces the incentive that should be there for such workers.  I ask the Minister therefore to reconsider his decision when framing the Finance Bill. I have received letters already from pharmaceutical and chemical industries in the Cork area who operate such schemes and they have assured me that it will lead to the creation of a major disincentive for their workers.  I know I am running out of time but the final point I would like to make is in relation to the Structural Funds.  Hundreds of millions of pounds have been spent in recent years but we have not spent them effectively.  The expenditure on roads and bridges is welcome but many of the improvements have bypassed the areas most in need of improvements, the areas in our cities and towns which are run-down environmentally because of unemployment. Unemployment creates a vicious circle: the area which unemployment affects most becomes run-down because the people become demoralised and the more run-down it becomes the less attractive it is to industrialists.  This vicious circle is not being broken by investment from the Structural Funds. Run-down areas in our cities and towns are not getting the benefit of Structural Funds; they are not being uplifted so that they will be more attractive to industrialists. The record shows that, even in my own city.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give even more attention to the areas devastated by unemployment, up to 70 per cent in some urban areas, and unfortunately they have all the signs of it through no fault of the people.  There should be an investment programme in those areas to <Col N="1276" /> uplift the people and promote industry. This will happen if there is a commitment to such a policy by the Government.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that I must condemn the budget because it contains no commitment to the underprivileged; the homeless have been ignored, the unemployed have been abandoned and there is not a positive thought in the whole area of job creation, which is the major problem in the country at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Allen disagreed with the thrust and content of the budget because it was a fairly spirited attempt to embrace the consistency of policy which his party, when sharing power with the Labour Party, regularly suggested was the right course.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance struck the correct balance in this budget between equity to the taxpayer, on the one hand, and the potential for investment and the maintenance of essential services, on the other.  Independent and objective observers have come to the conclusion that it is a very well structured, well thought out and pragmatic budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering taxation we should bear in mind the recently published report <i>A Time For Change &mdash; Industrial Policy For The 1990s</i> which in section 4 dwells on reform of taxation.  Naturally the annual budget is the focal point for reviewing taxation policies; it has the potential for reform and the ongoing requirements necessary to ensure an equitable spread of our resources, coupled with the potential for investment and job creation.  It is a fairly complex and difficult balance to strike because every Member in this House consistently calls on various Ministers to provide better resources for health, education, social welfare, etc. Every spending Department is under constant siege from public representatives at local authority and national level to improve the range of services and to allocate more funds.  Page 36 of the Culliton report reads that a fundamental programme of reform of the tax system on a phased but consistent basis should be initiated as a matter of <Col N="1277" /> urgency.  I do not think that one would be contradicted for suggesting that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, has given effect to that fundamental principle. The report goes on to state that there needs to be a broadening of the tax base through the reduction or abolition of the many reliefs, exemptions, deductions and other tax expenditures.  Much has been said and written about this particular aspect of our fiscal and taxation policy.</P>
    <P>The next recommendation is that the standard rate band should be extended to greatly reduce the numbers paying higher marginal rates, with special attention to the problems of single persons on modest incomes.  If we want to corral all that detail into an acceptable and equitable taxation policy we must continue the path taken by the Minister, who followed his predecessors in adjusting the tax bands and leaving more in the wage earner's pay packet, giving greater discretionary spending.</P>
    <P>I like to think that I am too young to remember the details of tax before the PAYE system but I know it involved half yearly or annual returns.  Because of computerisation and ease of access to information it has generally been accepted that the PAYE taxpayer has been in the forefront of tax or revenue collection although many other areas have been catching up over the years to the extent that now self-employed, corporation, capital gains and other forms of taxation are bringing an acceptable equity to the system so that everybody should &mdash; and progressively are &mdash; shouldering their fair share of taxation. However, much still remains to be done in relation to the PAYE taxpayer, and until there is a further reduction to greatly reduce the number paying higher marginal rates you cannot possibly tamper with the range of reliefs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, with the very committed and regularly publicised views of the minority partner in Government, has been making moves in the right direction. It is a matter which has been high on the agenda of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties for quite <Col N="1278" /> a number of years.  We would like to think that the Fianna Fáil Party in their minority Government period &mdash; I think it was from 1987 to 1989 &mdash; made a very positive leap forward in tax review and revisions.  The provisions in the budget are a continuation of this policy and the PAYE taxpayer is beginning to see that there is equity now in the overall taxation system.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation in the Culliton report is that taxation of savings should be overhauled to remove distortions and to move in the direction of equity between different savings.  I have not had an opportunity to study this matter <i>vis-á-vis</i> the report but it is a major, important recommendation which should be vigorously pursued.  Two further recommendations are that the 10 per cent corporation tax rate should not be continued beyond the year 2010 and that the range of activities to which it applies should not be extended.  The report gives a clear signal to the Government, and to various semi-State agencies, that no consideration should be given to the continuation of this tax.</P>
    <P>With regard to the broader thrust of the budget, there is a need to focus in on our inability to tackle the unemployment problem.  For far too long, parties on all sides of the House may not have been politically mature enough to realise the difficulty of achieving real progress in the area of job creation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the numbers who are unemployed.  Understandably, the IDA and Ministers of the day like to claim credit for jobs, or, as they were previously referred to in IDA statements, job approvals, which are created.  The growth in our population and the age structure of the population has made it difficult for the Government to create jobs.  Emigration was seen as one means of reducing our level of unemployment &mdash; people had access to the UK, limited access to the US and many emigrated to Europe.  However, those countries have had economic problems over the past number of years.  This has given rise to an increase in the number of returning emigrants.  This was reflected in the <Col N="1279" /> budget for the Department of Social Welfare for 1991.</P>
    <P>We need to have a substantial job creation programme.  Deputy Bruton has suggested on a number of occasions that we should have an all-party jobs forum. At Question Time yesterday the Taoiseach said that he believed all the relevant information is to hand and there is no need for further task forces, reports and commissions.  The present bureaucratic layers have to be cut away if the State is to be at the forefront of job creation.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the report has had a bearing on the budget.  It makes a very fundamental and decisive recommendation in regard to the Government's job creation agency, the Industrial Development Authority.  It suggests that the agency should be split.  I strongly support the recommendation that there should be one agency to deal with home industry and another agency to deal with foreign investment.  There has been a feeling abroad for some time &mdash; this is probably more the case among politicians than the general public &mdash; that the IDA have relied too much on mobile international industries for job creation and that the same level of support has not been given to Irish indigenous industries.  The Industrial Policy Review Group recommend the setting up of two separate agencies. To coin a phrase, this would level the playing pitch in that one agency would be responsible for assisting Irish industries while another agency would be responsible for attracting foreign investment here.  The Telesis report on the IDA, published some ten years ago made a similar recommendation.  However, while the Government welcomed the report, the recommendations in it were not implemented.  On this occasion the Government, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will set up a monitoring task force to implement the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group.  I hope they will carry out their task with great determination and vigour.  While there is potential for job creation, unfortunately there are too <Col N="1280" /> many impediments and too much bureaucracy.  These must be got rid of.</P>
    <P>I represent two satellite towns in County Dublin which have rapidly growing young populations.  The central policy for these towns has been very fragmented. Due to recent disturbances in Clondalkin another task force were set up at assistant secretary level to examine the prospects for job creation in the area. If it is decided to set up a project on a green field site in the area, the local authority, the IDA, the ESB, Bord Gáis, Telecom Éireann and various State agencies will have to be involved.  However, very often they do not work in unison. Attempts were made by Deputy Dick Spring, when he was Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, to tackle the unemployment problem.  During a by-election for the Dublin North-Central constituency, he made a very important announcement about job creation. However, through no fault of his, this proposal was never pursued.  He proposed the appointment of a development co-ordinator who would be responsible for the satellite towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown.  It was proposed that he would have the ability and capacity to pull together all the various State agencies, the private sector, chambers of commerce and representative groups so that there would be a cohesive and integrated policy for these towns.  However, as I said, this proposal was never pursued.  As a result, many vast urban local authority estates have remained unfinished and the IDA do not know where to locate new industries.</P>
    <P>This has had a major impact on taxation and employment.  It has also led to social problems, a bigger bill for the Department of Justice, the deployment of more Garda in the area, etc.  Even though the political will to tackle these problems has been there, unfortunately many proposals have not been followed through.  I hope that the budget and the report of the review group will lead to a realisation that there is greater potential for job creation in the economy than we have seen in the past.  I sincerely hope <Col N="1281" /> that there will be a follow through in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement referred to the need to create the right environment for job creation.  He referred to the strength of our currency, the need for stability and the need to reduce Government borrowing, which is like a two stone weight on every taxpayer. The Government have to take high levels of tax from taxpayers in order to pay our national debt.  This means that there is less money for investment in jobs. I think most mature politicians now realise that no matter on which side of the House one sits there are no instant answers, that this problem is bigger than any Government or Opposition and that it has to be tackled in a spirit of realism and co-operation.  This budget can lay the cornerstone for that co-operation.  Perhaps an all-party committee could be set up, even an <i>ad hoc</i> backbench committee to which many agencies could present their views and constructive criticisms in this area.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy in terms of farm incomes, employment in associated industries and exports, totally rejects the proposals of the EC Commission on Agriculture which, if implemented, would seriously erode our benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy, and which, taken in conjunction with the trend of the GATT negotiations, would seriously damage the nation's economy.</P>

      <P>Last night we got the impression from the Minister that he is doing his best to persuade the Commission and the Council of Ministers that the present Common Agricultural Policy proposals would be detrimental to Irish agriculture and to the Irish family farm. In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have left nobody in any doubt that I cannot accept the Commission's proposals as they stand.  As far as I am concerned major changes will have to be introduced in several areas before the proposals begin to approach acceptability.</P>
      <P>That is in line with the views of all Members.  Later the Minister said: &ldquo;Our approach to Common Agricultural Policy reform is a reasonable one and I am certain from numerous bilateral contacts with my colleagues in the Council that we can rely on their understanding based on the principle of Community solidarity.&rdquo; That indicated clearly to this House that the new Minister for Agriculture and Food is emphasising to the Council of Ministers and the Commission the serious plight for Ireland should the Commission's proposals be passed without reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> Today I received through the post, as did every other Deputy the Commission's press release, <i>The Week in Europe,</i> dated 31 January.  In referring to Common Agricultural Policy reform the document states:</P>
    <P>EC Agricultural Ministers met only briefly in the Council on Monday and spent the rest of their time in bilateral talks on the prospects for Common Agricultural Policy reform and its significance for the GATT talks.  The outcome of these bilateral meetings was that a substantial majority of Ministers agreed with the Presidency and the Commission viewpoint that Common Agricultural Policy reform is imperative and urgent and that the discussions should neither be delayed nor influenced by external factors i.e. GATT.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State in his contribution tonight clear up the ambiguity? The Minister clearly stated that he is changing minds to the Irish position on Common Agricultural Policy reform while the Commission document states that the majority of Ministers wish to see a conclusion of this matter on the basis of the Commission proposals.  It is necessary that we have clarity on the position of the Government and the Community on this matter.  I hope the Minister will clear up the ambiguity created by the contradiction between the press release from the European Community and his statement to the House last night.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the Fine Gael motion because we do not believe that the talks in progress are any different from those that have been going on for the last year.  We are very unsure as to how the Government are handling this matter and therefore this House should support the proposals as set out in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on this Private Members' motion.  I would like to refer to the serious plight of those engaged in agriculture, especially the small family farmers in disadvantaged <Col N="1284" /> and severely handicapped areas who have been greatly affected by the virtual collapse of the milk quota system and the reduction in milk and cattle prices.  The three reports issued in 1991 by the ESRI, the NESC and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, were unanimous that the second highest section of Irish people living below the poverty line were the small farmers, especially those in the dairy sector.  These are people with a proud and independent tradition, and to be considered, in three important reports, as people living in poverty does no justice to them.</P>
      <P>Reductions in farm incomes throughout the Community are set on a global basis at 22 per cent, but they can be as high as 40 to 45 per cent over a two year period in the case of small farmers.  It is accepted by farming organisations and others that our peripheral location adds substantially to the reduction in incomes.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, and the Government must take a firm stand to ensure that the living standards of the farming community are not further eroded.  Will the Government invoke the veto in such a serious matter of national interest?  Why do the Government not seek protection for Irish agriculture under section 39 of the Treaty of Rome which clearly states that any changes in the Common Agricultural Policy should impact equally on all regions?  It is accepted that the Common Agricultural Policy proposals as announced will impact more severely on the less favoured regions, and this is in contravention with what was agreed in the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas are being sacrificed for the benefit of the large commercialised farmers.  Unless this policy changes rapidly vast areas of rural Ireland will be covered with forests, with a dwindling population, closed schools and churches and a decline in voluntary and sporting organisations.  While we welcome forestry development &mdash; parts of Ireland have been recognised as suitable for forestry &mdash; the decision to provide higher grants for forestry is an adverse one.  Most of the land which is suitable for forestry was once mountainous land <Col N="1285" /> and bogland but substantial amounts of taxpayers money were used to reclaim it, making it excellent agricultural land. Dairy farming contributed to the wealth of many of the farmers on this land, particularly in the west.  However, the cow is now to be replaced by the tree, and many farmers will have to leave the land.  If the small farming community with its proud traditions is to be preserved in the west, firm action is needed. Many people, including bishops, community leaders and others, say that unless action is taken the end is in sight.  I urge the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure that the decline resulting from the MacSharry proposals is arrested so that hope may be restored to the community, because they are without hope at present.</P>

      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform and GATT negotiations have been debated here on a number of occasions &mdash; most recently in November last.  I do not propose, therefore, to go into the detail of the background to those negotiations.  I would like to pick up on a few points made by Deputies in this debate but before doing so I propose to address the motion directly and to say a few words on my area of responsibility &mdash; horticulture.  Although the negotiations will have less direct impact on horticulture, no area of the agriculture industry will be totally unaffected by the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT negotiations.  In relation to the motion, the importance of agriculture and its associated industries to the Irish economy goes without question.  We all know and appreciate the vital contribution from the sector in terms of output, employment and exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has been signalled for quite some <Col N="1286" /> time.  Continued increases in Community expenditure and growing structural surpluses cannot be allowed continue indefinitely, particularly in a situation where the benefits in terms of the development of farm incomes are minimal. A more effective way to support farm incomes has to be found.  The only realistic alternative to some shift from the current market price supports is a continuation of those supports but at increasingly reducing levels, that is continued reductions in prices and quotas but with no compensation.  Everybody loses in that scenario.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the need for reform is not the same as accepting any methodology and in particular the methodology proposed by the Commission. Let me say at the outset that the Commission proposals give rise to serious difficulties and they are not acceptable in their present format.  For a start, there is too great a movement in the proposals from market price supports to direct income payments and that movement is to take place at too rapid a pace.  Effective price supports must be maintained even at somewhat lower levels than at present.  Compensation must be made available to counteract the lower price levels and such compensation must have the same permanency as the existing price support mechanisms.  It is an essential point for us that adequate financial resources must be made available to underpin whatever new arrangements are agreed.</P>
    <P>However, it is important that at this critical time we in Ireland do not adopt an unnecessarily pessimistic attitude towards the process of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  What we have to decide is what we want to achieve in these negotiations.  In general terms we want a reformed Common Agricultural Policy which will deliver a higher percentage of EC expenditure into the pockets of farmers.  At the same time we must ensure that all types of family farms are protected and given a reasonable opportunity of a secure future in farming.  Of prime importance must be the preservation of the maximum possible <Col N="1287" /> number of farmers in the rural community. Otherwise, meaningful rural development will be impossible.  The smaller farmer must be given the opportunity to improve his income position and the larger farmer must be allowed to remain competitive on the European and world markets.  In addition, our agriculture based industries must be allowed to develop and to maintain their very important contribution to our economy. These, then, are our general aims but obviously the achievement of these has to be through the reforms in the various sectors.</P>
    <P>The dairying, beef, sheepmeat and cereals sectors are all directly affected by the proposals.  The accompanying measures involving an improved early retirement scheme, increased aid for afforestation and the encouragement of environmentally friendly farming practices are also of considerable importance. I would like to deal briefly with each of these sectors.</P>
    <P>The beef sector is of central economic importance to agriculture in Ireland. Beef production accounts for almost 40 per cent of our agricultural output, with cattle and beef exports accounting for almost 10 per cent of Irish export earnings. Practically every Irish farmer is involved in one way or another in beef production and the employment provided in rural communities by the sector is vital to their well-being.  No other agricultural sector in any other member state of the Community is of equivalent importance.</P>
    <P>The Irish beef sector is distinctly different from that in the remainder of the EC in two particular ways.  Because of our small domestic market 85 per cent of production has to be exported.  Secondly, most of our production is extensive and grass based.  Of prime importance for us, therefore, is an ability to continue to export beef and to ensure that the competitiveness of our grass based product is maintained.  The premia arrangements must fully compensate grass based producers for price reductions and intervention must be retained in a format <Col N="1288" /> which continues to support agreed price levels.  The House can be assured that the Minister has made and will continue to make these demands to his colleagues both in the Council and at bilateral meetings.</P>
    <P>Under the EC Commission proposals, extensive beef producers would be compensated for price reductions by increased direct income payments, that is the beef and suckler premia.  Obviously action will have to be taken to maintain the competitiveness of beef with other meats if cereals prices are reduced. Nevertheless it is important that the market continues to provide the main source of farm income.  The premium system will obviously become more important after reform and it must be operated in such a way that producers generally benefit in full and more realistic stocking rates and farm limits must be provided for.</P>
    <P>Another matter of concern to us in relation to beef in particular, but also to other products, is the effect imports have on Community markets.  Such imports can undermine any attempts to achieve a better balance in the beef market.  We have seen this in the recent past, particularly the effects which illegal imports can have.  At the very least legal imports of cattle and beef must be held at existing levels and illegal imports must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>In the dairying sector we have had milk quotas since 1984 in an effort to bring balance to markets.  Markets are now improving following the 2 per cent quota cut in last year's price fixing and intervention stocks of skim milk powder and butter have been reduced considerably in the past six months.  In our view there is no need at this time for the further quota cut of 4 per cent proposed by the Commission. This is particularly so when all the other major dairy producing countries have failed to match the supply restraint which the Community has been undertaking for several years.  What we are seeking in the negotiations in relation to milk quotas is that existing quotas be operated in a more flexible manner to cater for the needs of new entrants and to <Col N="1289" /> facilitate structural development.  There are stocking rate problems with the compensatory premia for milk producers, similar to those in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>As regards sheepmeat, the regime was reformed as recently as 1989 and, in fact, the last elements of that reform, the termination of the variable premium and the clawback payments in the UK, only took place in the past month.  It is entirely premature, therefore, to institute a further reform until the effects of the last one can be properly assessed.</P>
    <P>The cereals sector is central to the overall reform package since reductions in price in the livestock sector are, in part, related to the effect which the reductions in cereal prices would have on feed costs.  Besides the knock-on effects for the livestock sector we are also concerned at the level of price reductions for our cereal growers.  We would prefer that the problems in this sector be dealt with by means of supply control measures of a voluntary nature and with a lesser and more gradual price cut.  There is also the question of rebalancing but that is a matter to be achieved in the context of the Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is also a central element in the international negotiations in the GATT which have now entered a critical phase.  The Director-General of the GATT, Mr. Dunkel, recently presented draft framework agreements in all areas of the negotiations, including agriculture, in an effort to break the logjam and to conclude the negotiations at an early date.</P>
    <P>These proposals which were outlined by the Minister, Deputy Woods, already would be extremely damaging to the Community.  The result would be a considerable drop in the level of Community exports and an increase in imports into Community markets.  This would have the most serious consequences for internal prices, far in excess of the 20 per cent proposed by Mr. Dunkel, and would create major difficulties not alone for the farming Community but also for the economy, the well-being of which is directly related to the well-being of the <Col N="1290" /> agricultural sector.  Meanwhile our trading partners would be well placed to take over existing Community markets and producers would not even benefit from the anticipated increase in world prices which would normally follow such large support reductions.</P>
    <P>The Council has unambiguously rejected the Dunkel approach and said it must be modified.  It has also called for a genuine effort from major trading partners, especially Japan and the US, who would escape relatively unscathed, to ensure mutual advantages and benefits to all participants.  Mr. Dunkel has set a new deadline of mid-April for the conclusion of the talks.  The prospects for meeting this deadline will depend on how far other parties are willing to go to meet the Community's fundamental requirements. The omens are not good in the US, where all parties are gearing up for the Presidential and other elections. Events over the next few weeks will tell whether the talks can be concluded or whether a later date will be set when participants are freer to negotiate a reasonable agreement.</P>
    <P>Ireland's priorities in the negotiations are to avoid excessive commitments and to ensure that any commitments are realistic, coherent and balanced and will safeguard the basic mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is essential that whatever compensatory measures are agreed under Common Agricultural Policy reform existing structural and disadvantaged areas payments can be accommodated in the &ldquo;green box&rdquo;.  We will also be seeking credit for reform measures undertaken since the beginning of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>In both of these important negotiations the Government have been conscious of the need to maintain the fullest backing of all of the interest groups in the agriculture area.  Even before the Commission launched its Common Agricultural Policy reform discussion paper in February 1991 the Government had committed themselves in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to entering into discussions with the various organisations on the approach to <Col N="1291" /> be adopted to the Commission's proposals and to maintaining close contact with them as the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform and the GATT developed.  This has been done through the consultative mechanisms established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the various <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> partners have regular opportunity to express their views on the major issues involved in both sets of negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister for Agriculture and Food set up a forum in October 1988 to ensure that Irish agricultural and food interests were kept fully informed of GATT developments and were provided with a platform on which to put forward their views on the ongoing negotiations.  The group consists of representatives of the Department, the main farming organisation, the agriculture and food industry and the faculty of agricultural economics, UCD.  This group meet on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own area of responsibility, I am happy to say that the horticultural sector continued to show significant progress in 1991.</P>
    <P>The mushroom sector in particular continued its excellent performance.  In collaboration with the other State agencies involved, an in-depth study of the industry was commissioned by An Bord Glas with a view to the preparation of a further development plan.  The industry has expanded rapidly over the past three years but nevertheless can be expected to face continuing stiff competition in the UK market.  Based on the study, a strategy has to be put in place to chart its further development.  With a view to maintaining and improving the high standards in the industry, An Bord Glas sponsored the Mushroom Grower of the Year competition in 1991 and continued their policy of co-ordinating the efforts of the State agencies and commercial interests regarding investment in the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the highlights of 1991 was the successful hosting of the thirteenth International Mushroom Congress in Dublin. <Col N="1292" /> This is a prestigious international event, with delegates attending from all over the world.  It was an opportunity to demonstrate that Ireland has a highly developed and efficient mushroom industry and, in general, should lead to increased opportunities for Irish mushrooms in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>In the potato sector further progress can be reported.  Producers are showing continuing interest in forming producer groups and are continuing their efforts to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to production and marketing.  The number of applications for grants under FEOGA and the Operational Programme for Rural Development is encouraging, particularly as regards the provision of storage facilities.</P>
    <P>Returns to tomato growers improved in 1991 as compared to the previous year. An Bord Glas have continued their efforts to improve marketing.  The tomato quality monitoring programme introduced in 1990 was continued in 1991. In the first year of the programme the results showed that in general the quality of Irish tomatoes was as good as the competing product.  This high standard was maintained in 1991.</P>
    <P>The nursery stock sector continues to perform well.  The volume of exports has increased from £1.7 million in 1987 to an estimated £2 million last year.  An Bord Glas has continued to provide assistance to develop group marketing as well as to individual projects.  In 1991 An Bord ran the garden centre awards scheme, which was highly successful.</P>
    <P>I would like particularly to refer to an important development in collaboration between producers and An Bord Glas.  I recently announced that following discussion between An Bord Glas and the IFA a national horticulture organiser would be appointed by the IFA.  The work of this organiser will be to encourage horticulture growers to join producer groups or other groupings of producers. The objective of these groups is to encourage producers to organise their marketing through large and professionally managed structures.  An Bord Glas will be contributing to the cost of <Col N="1293" /> the new appointment for the first two years.</P>
    <P>Much progress has been made in horticulture in recent years.  The various grant schemes under the Operational Programme for Rural Development and FEOGA have been particularly successful in stimulating investment in much-needed potato storage as well as in general horticulture projects.  There is already in place a marketing co-ordinator for potatoes, who is making a valuable contribution to the development of the industry.</P>
    <P>I should now like to respond to some points which were raised in last evening's debate.  The first matter I should like to address relates to access for our cattle and beef to Middle East and North African markets.  This country has long experience of trading in these markets through difficult times.  I am pleased to see that exports to countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states increased in 1991.  This year prospects are even better. There are many hopeful signs.  On Iran, commercial negotiations for the sale of beef are under way between Irish sellers and Iranian buyers.  I wish them well. This trade will build on the better understanding achieved between Ireland and the Islamic Republic of Iran after a year's negotiations.  Libya has been an important market in the past.  I am pleased that the way is now clear for exports of beef and milk products.  There are good prospects of the cattle trade resuming later this year.  In relation to other North Africa countries prospects are also good. Exports to Morocco have resumed and following an Algerian visit to Ireland this January a veterinary protocol between the two countries is planned, which will facilitate trade.</P>

      <P>In relation to disadvantaged area payments, 80 per cent of participants were paid their full entitlements in 1991. This is in line with previous years.  While it had been hoped that an even higher number of applicants would have <Col N="1294" /> received their payments in 1991, I consider that the number of payments made was quite a good performance, particularly in view of the extra work that arose from the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the reclassification of some existing areas.</P>

      <P>The need for Common Agricultural Policy reform is accepted by all.  The GATT negotiations are on a world scale and we cannot dissociate ourselves from them.  We have to get in there and fight. There is a lot we can achieve in the negotiations which will benefit our agricultural industry.  We can gain nothing by standing back and saying that we do not want to know.  The position we have taken in both sets of negotiations is the correct one.  It is backed by the farming organisations, and the Minister's position would be strengthened even more if this House were to give unanimous approval to that position.  I would therefore ask the House to be positive and support the amendment to that motion expressing support for the Minister's stance in the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome the opportunity for the House to again underline our concerns about the proposals being put forward for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The repeated attention that has been given to this matter by both Houses <Col N="1295" /> of the Oireachtas underlines the seriousness of the issue to this country.</P>
      <P>It is worth repeating some of the relevant figures to remind ourselves to the exact nature of the problems we are facing.  For every single £ of net exports from this country, 40 pence is accounted for by agricultural exports.  In terms of gross national product, agriculture is three to four times more important to Ireland than is the case in other EC countries. A higher proportion of our population work in agriculture than is the case in the rest of the Community.  These are just some of the figures which must inform any debate on changes in agricultural policy affecting this country.</P>
      <P>There has been a tendency here to view agriculture distinctly from the rest of the economy.  That is a mistaken approach. Agriculture is not only a key factor in our economic performance, it is one of the key factors.  If our agricultural base suffers, the entire country will suffer.  This point was clearly evident before Christmas when SIPTU organised a special conference on Common Agricultural Policy reform attended by the IFA and Teagasc, amongst others, which demonstrated serious concern among the social partners at the possible consequences of damaging changes in Common Agricultural Policy practice and the threat, in particular, to thousands of jobs involed in the food processing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are some of the figures which should inform our response to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy but they should not blind us to the case for reform. Everyone accepts that there is a pressing need for reform in Europe's agricultural policy.  Even in this country, we can see the failures and shortcomings of existing policy &mdash; butter, milk and grain mountains growing by the hour, side by side with falling incomes, increased numbers fleeing the land growing disincentives to young farmers entering the industry.  The question, therefore, is not whether or not we should proceed with reform but what should be the nature of the reform which <Col N="1296" /> we pursue and what vital interests should we seek to protect.</P>
    <P>Our focus in this debate must be twofold. On the one hand, we must seek to ensure adequate compensation for any impact which changes may entail for the poorest sector of the agriculture community. This is more than just a matter of simple compensation.  Anyone familiar with Irish agriculture will be aware of the appalling poverty in which many farm families are forced to live.  Recent years with falling incomes and rising costs have been particularly difficult.  Merely compensating these people with one form of poverty for another is insufficient. Equally we must ensure that any proposals to redress these difficulties do not undermine the vital commercial sector.</P>
    <P>It has been a national priority for the last number of years to promote a market-orientated focus in Irish agriculture. Already this policy has had a substantial beneficial effect on the food processing industry in particular.  This industry accounts for almost one-third of the gross output of all manufacturing industry in Ireland, almost 30 per cent of the employment of Irish-owned manufacturing firms and over 20 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  Over the last 15 years Irish farmers have invested over £4 billion towards the creation of a profitable commercial sector.  This must not now be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>The greater danger, perhaps, in these reform discussions is that they will throw out the baby with the bathwater and confuse damaging our commercial sector with an unsatisfactory response to a serious social problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that in the recently published, excellent, report on Irish industrial policy by Jim Culliton and his expert colleagues, the need to focus efforts on building and strengthening this commercial sector has been fully recognised and encouraged.</P>
    <P>Obviously this whole debate is taking place against the background of the ongoing GATT discussions and it is impossible to discuss one without referring to the other.  Many strong words have been voiced on the whole question <Col N="1297" /> of supports and price aids since discussions began on this latest GATT round.  I take issue particularly with the assertion that the Community in some way gives a unique degree of assistance to its farmers compared to other countries. The average figure for producer subsidies in the OECD is 44 per cent of the value of output.  In the Community that figure is approximately 48 per cent.  In other countries, such as Finland and Japan, the relevant figure is 72 per cent and 68 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture is at a crossroads.  The result of the current negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform and the re-negotiation of GATT will have a crucial bearing on the future development of the industry in Ireland and, inevitably, on the wider Irish economy.  All sides must unite and show their support for Ireland's constructive approach to this debate and help ensure the best results possible for the country.</P>

      <P>This is the third or fourth occasion on which the House has debated the proposed changes in the Common Agricultural Policy but there is little evidence of any advancement in thinking on the matter.  There seems to be total refusal to face the reality that the Common Agricultural Policy, as we know it, is dead.  This is reflected in the motion from Fine Gael which simply criticises the proposed changes, offers no alternatives and, by implication, calls for more of the same.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the consequences of the package of reforms now under consideration will be very serious for Irish agriculture.  On the other hand, the consequences of not facing up to the need for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be even more serious &mdash; not just for agriculture, but for the Irish economy and the entire European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> Everyone recognises the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy, but we are also a trading nation, with rapidly expanding exports, of which agricultural products are just one part.  For instance, between January and November 1991, our total exports were valued at £13,818 million, but food and live animals accounted for just £2,808 million or just over 20 per cent.  We need to defend and develop our agriculture and food industry, but we must make sure that nothing is done which will jeopardise our ability to trade in other products.  Therefore, we have a particular interest in ensuring that the GATT talks which are dragging on and on are concluded and an acceptable agreement reached.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have been pointing out for several years now that the writing was on the wall for the Common Agricultural Policy and it was time to look for alternative structures for agriculture, yet successive Governments and the main farming organisations have failed to face up to reality and have tried to fight a losing battle to preserve Common Agricultural Policy spending at its current level.  Commissioner MacSharry has shown that he is prepared to bite the bullet.  We have to face up to that.  Vague aspirational motions passed by this House are not going to deflect the European Community from reforming the policy.</P>
    <P>As I have said on many occasions, a farming policy which produces goods for which there is no market, which adds up to £15 per week to consumers' food bills, which consumes up to 60 per cent of the entire EC budget and which allows 80 per cent of all price supports to go to the top 20 per cent income bracket, has no future and is not worth fighting for.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the theory, the intervention system in practice is simply unacceptable. If there was a long established industry in this country, employing thousands of workers producing, for instance, cars and there was no longer a market for that type of car, and in order to protect the jobs of the workers the Government or the EC decided to buy up the surplus cars, and so many cars had to be <Col N="1299" /> bought that the country ran out of storage space for the cars and had to hire ships to store them offshore, just imagine the outcry there would be over the waste of public money.  I have no doubt that Fine Gael would be leading the demands to halt this wasteful practice.</P>
    <P>Yet this is the story of Irish agriculture after almost 20 years of EC membership. There were no more enthusiastic advocates of Irish membership of the EC than the farming organisations, who promised that the whole country would benefit from the access of Irish agriculture to Common Agricultural Policy funds. Almost two decades later, despite the very substantial transfer of funds, the agriculture sector's net contribution to GNP remains unchanged; the numbers obtaining a living from farming have declined by 40 per cent and the number at work in the food industry has declined by nearly one-third &mdash; from 46,000 to 33,000.</P>
    <P>Ireland accounts for only a very small proportion of total Community agricultural production, but is one of the biggest users of the intervention system. At the middle of last year, this country accounted for almost 40 per cent of total skim milk powder held in intervention by the Community.  We produce only about 5 per cent of the Community's butter but account for around 30 per cent of intervention stocks.  Almost 25 per cent of total beef held in intervention is Irish. We have the totally immoral spectacle of families &mdash; farming families among them &mdash; being unable to put adequate food on the table for their children, while two South American ships had to be chartered and anchored in Cork harbour with tens of thousands of tonnes of butter deteriorating in their holds.</P>
    <P>On 17 December last the Minister for Agriculture gave my colleague, Deputy McCartan, some details of the incredible quantities of food being held in intervention. There was, he said, 137,583 tonnes of butter at value of £127.5 million, 185,756 tonnes of skim milk powder at a value of £139.2 million and 196,924 <Col N="1300" /> tonnes of beef at a value of £268.5 million, giving a total of £535 million. According to the Summary of Public Expenditure Programme for 1991, a total of £85 million had to be allocated in 1991 for storage, freezing and transport of intervention products, representing a 34 per cent increase over the previous year. This was almost three times the total amount allocated for the Teagasc budget.</P>
    <P>This is, of course, a Community-wide problem.  There are other products in intervention in the other EC countries, in respect of which Ireland accounts for very little, such as cereals, and others such as wine, pigmeat, tobacco and olive oil, in respect of which we do not feature at all.</P>
    <P>Any agricultural policy whether at national or Community level, should be assessed on how it measures up to the following objectives: to provide a good quality, varied and adequate supply of food as cheaply as possible; to enable the land to provide the maximum number of families possible with decent incomes and to increase its overall contribution to the economy, in terms of income generated and employment created; to do so in a manner that preserves, so far as is practicable, the environment and ensures that the countryside is preserved as a leisure resource available to the entire community; to take account of the need to support the development of the Third World economies, for whom agricultural production and exports is of such importance; and to provide raw material of sufficient quality, quantity and regular availability as is necessary to maximise the efficiency and potential for development of downstream industries in processing, marketing etc.</P>
    <P>The reality of the Common Agricultural Policy is very different.  It costs a fortune to run up to 60 per cent of the entire Community's budget, almost £25 billion in 1991.  Its complicated structure invites waste, inefficiency and fraud.  In 1989 it cost something approaching £2.5 billion simply to store intervention stocks and the value of those stocks depreciated by £1.8 billion over the year.  It takes an army of civil servants, inspectors and <Col N="1301" /> other unnecessary bureaucrats to operate, manage and police it.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that increased food prices and additional taxes cost the average family around £700 per year.  Much of the Common Agricultural Policy spending is absorbed by various commodity traders and other `middlemen'. Of what goes to farmers, 80 per cent goes to the top 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The obvious waste and huge cost of the Common Agricultural Policy has been successfully used, particularly by the UK, to block the development of other common policies by the Community in areas where they are clearly necessary. In any event, it leaves little of the Community budget for anything else.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the EC support prices are 20 per cent higher than they need to be in order to keep efficient farmers in business.  In theory they are subsidised by this additional amount in order &ldquo;to protect the incomes of the smaller farmers.&rdquo;  However, since it is a subsidy to production, the most efficient benefit disproportionately and, year by year, farmers get fewer and farms get bigger. Thus, while average farm income and the real gross income of the industry falls, that of the most efficient usually increases and consequently what was supposed to have been an exercise in &ldquo;social solidarity&rdquo; has actually seen a further widening of the income gap between large farmers and small landholders.  Several studies have actually shown that the Common Agricultural Policy is a much less efficient mechanism for getting subsidies to their targets than either the Regional or Social Funds.</P>
    <P>Finally, the drive for increased intensive production provoked by the Common Agricultural Policy has been doubly damaging to the environment, because of the consumption of resources and the pollution caused by waste.</P>
    <P>While there are many details which still need to be clarified, the main drift of the MacSharry proposals seems to be a step in the right direction providing as it does a step away from incentives to overproduction, chiefly by the big producers, <Col N="1302" /> and towards targeting spending on smaller and poorer producers.  What seems to have been overlooked is that the MacSharry plan actually provides for a substantial increase in Common Agricultural Policy spending, bringing it up from around £26 billion to around £30 billion. What reasonable person can object to more money being spent and more efficiently targeted, especially when it is likely to lead to cheaper prices for consumers and less wasteful production?</P>
    <P>The proposals for direct income support, rather than subsidies on production, are particularly welcome and should be of real value to the smaller farmers who need them most.  We must ensure that the overall level of EC support for Irish agriculture is maintained to at least existing levels, so that the overall Irish economy will be cushioned against the immediate effects of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry proposals are only part of what must be an ongoing process of reassessment of agricultural policy at both EC and national level.  In many respects the problems of agriculture are similar to the overall problems of the peripheral regions.  The problems must be approached in a similar way.  Direct payments to smaller farmers can only be a temporary arrangement, and neither is there any long term value in protecting low paying, inefficient industries.</P>
    <P>The existing Structural Funds must be retained, although to do their job properly the funds available need to be substantially increased.  Any decrease in Common Agricultural Policy spending in Ireland in the longer term must be compensated for by an increase in Structural Funds.  There must be a shift away from intensive production in favour of organic methods of production.  The demand for organic food products is likely to continue to grow, and such a shift could be particularly beneficial to Irish agriculture and other less developed regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>At home the priority for national agricultural policy must be to put the country's agricultural resources to their most productive possible use.  There is a need for a comprehensive plan to work <Col N="1303" /> toward this objective.  This plan should identify smaller farmers with development potential and provide these with the means to reach this potential.  Small farmers who do not wish to expand, but wish to remain in agriculture, should be encouraged to diversify into new areas such as forestry and agri-tourism.  Farmers who do not see a future in farming should be allowed to retire in dignity or move into new careers, with their land being reallocated to developing farmers, through sale or lease.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, there is a strong case for diverting much of the Common Agricultural Policy funding which currently goes to bigger farms into the EC's Structural Funds, with the specific aim of creating new job opportunities in rural areas for those wishing to diversify or move out of farming.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of agricultural policy should be the creation of a corps of commercial farms which can compete successfully in an open market resulting from reduced Common Agricultural Policy funding.  Such farms should be capable of affording their owners a reasonable living standard while supplying food to consumers at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>We need a farm population more committed to the long term development of Irish food products.  We can no longer afford an industry happy to feed animals on summer grass, selling into intervention in the autumn.  Agricultural policy needs to be aimed at developing a farmer-controlled meat processing sector.</P>
    <P>Irish farming has been badly served by successive Goverments since the foundation of the State.  We must remember that the Department advised farmers to continue their practice of traditional milk production, with a high level of output in summer and a very much reduced level of output in the winter months, which pattern of milk production prevented a genuine development of markets for more valuable, saleable short-life milk products.  The conversion of milk into long-life products, much in over-supply <Col N="1304" /> in all markets, meant that Irish milk products were not alone sold at the lowest market price but, to a considerable extent also, below at intervention price.</P>
    <P>I contend our agricultural community can have a prosperous future within the context of a more European-wide market.  We have a basic advantage in relation to our size, climate and, above all, our reputation of having a clean environment.  Many additional off-farm jobs can be created, founded on an efficient farming sector.  However, these goals will not be achieved if the various elements are left to their devices.  There is need for dynamic political and developmental leadership on the part of the State to get things moving, eliminate the chaff, create a sense of unity and purpose under a programme of reorganisation and reform, resulting in a better future for all of us.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for affording me an opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>There must be a consistent, sustained campaign to resist the American ploy to omit from the GATT any binding arrangements for the payment of adequate compensation to European farmers.  It would be totally repugnant to every farmer in Europe, particularly those in Ireland, to have a reformed Common Agricultural Policy in place, with compensation rates agreed, only to discover the United States scuttling the GATT talks on account of those same compensatory payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Government must initiate discussions within the EC to build up a strong lobby against current stocking rate proposals.  I have not sufficient time to comment on the overall European scene except to say that I regard the stocking restrictions as absolutely penal.  Indeed Commissioner MacSharry's recent strong defence of these proposals sent shivers down the backs of our agricultural community because, if implemented, those <Col N="1305" /> proposals would pressure good small farmers, indeed all farmers, with average to good stocking rates into actually selling stock before they become eligible for EC compensatory payments, which cannot be good for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry's intentions may have been honourable since the new proposals would disqualify factory-type farming activities, that have become part and parcel of the European scene, from receiving compensation.  However, within the Irish context, this cure could kill the patient.  It is the problem with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>I want to make some comments about a few crazy domestic features within agriculture. The Department should cop-on to themselves with regard to the recent decision that all farmers must supply a tax number in order to render themselves eligible for headage grants.  I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not against farmers paying income tax; that is the law and they should do so.  However, there is no sense whatsoever in asking small farmers to bear the cost of paying an accountant to convince the Revenue Commissioners they had no taxable income in the first place.  That cannot make sense.  The proposed system is so crazy 13,000 of our farmers currently in receipt of small farmers' dole, having already convinced the Department of Social Welfare they were below the poverty line, henceforth will have to convince the Revenue Commissioners of the same income and, into the bargain, pay an accountant to do so.  There is something crazy about the proposal.  There are at least another 20,000 farmers just above the social welfare ceiling for dole who are not within a shout of a taxable income. We all know that many of them have been assessed by the Department of Social Welfare.  Would it not be reasonable that such assessment be acceptable to the Department of Agriculture, demonstrating that such farmers have no taxable income?  There is also the current exemption of £500.  There is a precedent there to the effect that if a farmer receives less than £500 worth of grants he will be <Col N="1306" /> exempt from liability without having to supply a tax number.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food have several options open on this issue.  For example, the proposal in its entirety could be scrapped &mdash; which I believe it should &mdash; as farmers within the tax net must declare their headage grants anyway.  The Department could exempt all farmers in receipt of dole.  Farmers, recently assessed for eligibility for unemployment assistance, found to be above the ceiling but under the level which would render their incomes taxable, might be exempted also.  Probably the handiest way out of all this mess would be to increase the £500 exemption limit to almost £2,000 which would shake out thousands of small farmers, with small herds nationwide, from the tax system.  I believe the people who would be most pleased would be Revenue Commissioners officials around the country who would breathe a sigh of relief that they would not have to engage in all this investigation only to discover that, at the end of the day, no tax was payable.</P>
    <P>I understand that the application forms for sheep premia will be ready for circulation to farmers next week, continuing a space for the insertion of the RSI number and address of the local tax office.  The sheep premium payment is exempt but a sheep headage grant in excess of £500 will not be paid without a farmer furnishing a tax number.  This regulation will penalise hill sheep farmers in poorer areas such as Donegal, Wicklow, Connemara and so on whereas a farmer with, say, 1,000 lowland ewes would have no problem whatever in furnishing a tax number.  I find that proposal very difficult to understand regardless of whoever thought it up.  The bullock and beef cow premia are excluded but headage payments in severely handicapped areas will not be excluded.  I call on the Department of Agriculture to review their proposals and ensure that small farmers are not driven unnecessarily into the arms of accountants.</P>
    <P>I want to speak now about the nonpayment of headage grants to farmers, all grants &mdash; beef cow, the ewe premium <Col N="1307" /> subsidy, the whole range.  In this House last November I was given a commitment by the former Minister for Agriculture that over 80 per cent of the relevant headage payment cheques would be paid before Christmas.  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, a few minutes ago more or less congratulate himself that that has been the case.  I must stress that that was not the case, that a handful of cheques only reached their destinations by Christmas.  I have no doubt but that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Walsh, and every other Member of this House is being buttonholed, door stepped in every rural parish by people in uproar because they have not yet received their entitlements. I am led to believe that 25 per cent of our farmers have not yet received a single penny, that is six weeks after they were supposed to have received these payments or cheques.  Do the Minister and his Department realise the extent of the hardship they are causing?  Is the Minister aware that the biggest topic right across the country at present is the nonpayment of those headage grants?  Does he realise that financially, the months of December, January and February are the most crucial ones of the year for farmers? Indeed does anybody in the Department's offices in Kildare Street understand that many purchases such as feedstuffs and fertilisers are literally bought on the strength of the headage grants being paid on time?  Is the Minister aware that these grants constitute, in effect, part payment for value unrealised in the market place and are not some form of hand-out or prerequisite, as some people would lead us to believe?  Rather it comprises money not collected in its true value on the open market.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that many farming families depend on these grants to pay school fees, tax and insurance on cars and tractors, not to mention settlement of bank loans, etc.  When summing up, perhaps the Minister would tell me what went wrong?  How can the Department of Social Welfare on a two-day period prior to Christmas every year pay <Col N="1308" /> in excess of 200,000 social welfare recipients when the Department of Agriculture spend six months making 100,000 payments? There is something very wrong here.  Many farmers want to know who has the benefit of their money when they did not get it.  If the Exchequer has the use of that money while farmers are waiting for it, it is nothing short of disgraceful. All I am doing is re-echoing what thousands of farmers are saying and that is what they want to hear on the floor of this House tonight.</P>
    <P>How long after the last day of this month, or any other month, would civil servants, the Members of this House, including myself, wait for the few pounds at the end of the month?  I have no doubt we would not wait three days.  Why, then, do we ask farmers to wait six weeks, ten weeks and even six months?  There is something wrong in Kildare Street when somebody genuinely believes that those people can continue to wait.  I am aware that my time is running out.  This is a domestic issue and somebody might say it is far from the European scene&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if farmers are expected to have any confidence in the system there is no way a Minister in any Government can stand up and say: &ldquo;You will have your money by a certain date&rdquo; when he knows there was no way it can be paid in two or three months.  I do not want to labour the point but I am informed there are six civil servants who are responsible for sending out the cheques.  I do not have to be told how the system operates: I was in charge of it while I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture.  I can assure the House that in 1985 and 1986 headage payments were paid before Christmas in those years, admittedly there are more cheques to be issued now.  Why is this task confined to six people?  Not alone would I like to hear those questions answered but there are thousands of farmers at this very moment who cannot understand why their cheque has not come through.</P>

      <P>I wish to turn for a moment to the latest saga in the milk quota and the buy-up scheme.  I am informed that because of the European scheme for buy-up that of the expected 30 million gallons, only 10.3 million gallons were offered.  It turned out as I thought it would, that very few people &mdash; unfortunately it is all the smallest producers &mdash; who are getting out of milk could actually face the expense of waiting for five years to receive all their money.  If the EC and our negotiators were doing their job adequately they would be aware that a £2 per gallon offer, cash down, would have meant a huge difference to many people who had trouble with their banks, their merchants and so on.</P>
      <P>I said a few weeks ago there would be a drain from the small producer areas to the bigger areas.  That is actually happening even though the scheme has not been a success.  I am now informed that the suppliers of the Kiltogher group of creameries in Leitrim &mdash; one of the smallest creameries in the poorest area &mdash; have lost over 6.5 per cent of their milk. That is a shattering blow and many jobs will be lost in that area.</P>
      <P>I understand that because the scheme has not been taken up a permanent levy, a reduction of 1.6 per cent, will be imposed on the milk quota for everybody. I implore the Minister to ensure that small producers throughout Ireland who have less than 12,800 gallons will not be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the availability of the milk quota, when will Commissioner MacSharry, and everybody concerned, be made aware that if a man has a milk quota of approximately 10,000 gallons, and even if there was a fairy godmother to give him another 10,000 gallons for which he would have to pay, it is not financially feasible to actually pay for it. <Col N="1310" /> There must be another system for a certain category of farmers.

      <P>First, I thank Deputy Deasy for putting down this motion.  It is a timely motion and it is well worth having this debate.  I compliment the speakers who have contributed so far.  There have been many worthwhile and sober contributions.  It is very important to have sober contributions in an area relating to agriculture and farming because much of the time it is a misunderstood profession. The reason is that the representatives of agricultural interests, to use a modern cliche, &ldquo;go over the top&rdquo; to say there is disaster all over the place or that things are much worse or different from what they are.</P>
      <P>The reality is that farming is going through a very difficult phase at present. It is no harm to say that and to remind Governments, Departments and Commissioners that the farmers we have left in the country work extremely hard in a difficult area of activity.  They expect to get a decent income for what they produce.  They expect Governments to fight a case for them in national and international fora, but particularly in Europe. They expect their organisations to represent them accurately and their processing organisations to do a good job of work with the produce that comes off the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times we have seen that excellent produce is not made any better; in fact, it is made considerably worse on its way to the consumer by various processing organisations.  Farmers expect the marketing people to do an adequate job <Col N="1311" /> of marketing with the excellence of the products they have on hand.  At the end of the day they expect to get a return for their produce which would reflect the amount of hard work and the time they have put into it.  Regrettably, over the last couple of decades the whole agricultural scene has been intervention and European Community driven.  Many of the people with responsibility beyond the farm gate have leaned on the supports of intervention and taxpayers to the detriment of the industry.  Our marketing people had a very laid-back approach. We now have a situation where we are converting more of our dairy products into in-products for which there is no market, or for which there is a declining market.  Eight out of ten of the best steaks produced in the country go into intervention and all sorts of carousals before they eventually end up God knows where.  The marketing organisations, who have done a good job for the farming community should start with the consumer, be they here in Ireland, the United Kingdom or in any part of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that this has happened since we joined the European Community because, as we are all aware, there are 340 million consumers in Europe, many of whom are sufficiently well off to be able to pay well for good produce.  Even though we boast about our environment and our location we then go off and do nothing about that advantage, other than dump our products into the nearest intervention outlet.  If that intervention outlet here in Ireland happens to be full to the brim we will take it to some other country in Europe, so long as the taxpayers of Europe are paying.</P>
    <P>The scene is not a pleasant one and we do not have much time to ensure that Irish farmers will be there in sufficient numbers to produce the food required in Europe.  We sell 60 per cent of our agricultural output, for example, to third countries and only 40 per cent to the European Community where there is a consumer market.  The third countries are grand so long as that market is open <Col N="1312" /> to us; it is when it is not available to us, when some international political matter arises, that we find ourselves in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I would like to see our processing and marketing industry become far more serious about the situation we are in.  We are all aware, without having to take a stroll through the supermarket, not alone in Dublin but in Ballydehob, that up to half the food products on the shelves are not produced here in Ireland.  They are not produced here because, more and more, the Irish consumer is looking for the quality product which is produced elsewhere.  We find it much more convenient to produce a truckload of some particular product rather than produce the quality product required in small packs.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that so much food is imported.  This reflects our poor marketing and processing.  In all fairness to the farming community, everyone knows that our farmers are as good, if not better, than those in any part of Europe.  I believe that our shortcomings, and the bottleneck, lie in the processing and marketing area.  Last year, for example, international food marketeers and experts from all continents congregated in a very pleasant and beautiful place called Kinsale in west Cork which is known to Deputy Paddy Sheehan at least.</P>

At any rate there was consensus; it was pointed out at the conference that there was an unlimited market for quality food produced in Ireland if we would only get up and wear out some shoe leather in selling it instead of just paying lip service to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> We have spent a great deal of money, both Irish taxpayers' and European taxpayers' money, in modernising our industry during the past decade, and we are all aware of what happened in some famous cases with much of that money.  Grants of up to 75 per cent have been available and were paid to various plants around the country.  Approximately £500 million has been spent, £113 million of which has been spent during the past three years in providing state-of-the-art plant and equipment to do the very best job with Irish food.  Much of this has been invested for the sake of drawing grants because full use is not being made of the plant and the old unwanted products are still being produced.</P>
    <P>If we were not aware of all of this we were certainly aware of it following the publication of the Culliton report which highlighted, accurately and fairly, both the problems and the shortcomings of the agriculture and food industry.  We do not have much time to take corrective action.  I certainly hope action will be taken and that the report will not end up by accompanying the many reports which have been produced on the agriculture and food industry during the past few decades.</P>

      <P>I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, who complained about the failure of the Department of Agriculture and Food to send out cheques in relation to the beef subsidy, sheep subsidy and the suckler <Col N="1314" /> cow premium.  It is a disgrace that this should have been allowed to happen.  As the Minister of State realises, we have now entered the sowing season and farmers are waiting patiently for the postman to bring their cheque which is rightfully theirs.  As I said, it is a disgrace that this should have been allowed to happen.  I support what my colleague, Deputy Connaughton, had to say in that regard.</P>
      <P>The MacSharry proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy pose the single greatest threat to our farming community and our economy in general.  If these proposals are implemented 40,000 farmers will become redundant across the country during a five year period.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that the MacSharry recommendations, as presented, are adjusted as their effects would be devastating not only for rural areas but for every village and town.</P>
      <P>The importance of the agriculture industry in each of the member states must be taken into account when any changes are being made to the Common Agricultural Policy.  I agree that we must promote economic and social cohesion between the regions of the Community and I am therefore asking the Government to ensure, should the MacSharry proposals be accepted, that Ireland gets a derogation, given the paramount importance of agriculture to the economy.</P>
      <P>Irish agriculture is unique in the Community in the following respects: the nation is highly dependent on agricultural exports; livestock is dominant in particular sheep, beef and milk products which account for approximately 80 per cent of total agricultural output.  Clearly, the products of our grassland dominate our agriculture.  Furthermore, these products have very little import content and hence make a bigger contribution to net exports than the export figures suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single greatest asset the agriculture industry has is our national herd of approximately two million cows supplying the dairy and beef industry. During the past nine years milk quotas <Col N="1315" /> have been reduced by approximately 10.7 million gallons or 10 per cent, whereas deliveries in other OECD countries increased by 8.5 million tonnes or 7.8 per cent and Eastern European production increased by 14.5 million tonnes or 10.5 per cent.  This is a clear indication of where the problem lies in respect of the surplus milk in the European Community.   We should provide reciprocal supply management and proper import controls before anything can be agreed upon in respect of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>The European Community should continue  with its quota policy in order to achieve an acceptable balance in the marketplace and maintain prices.  A continuation  of supply management is viewed as a more effective and equitable mechanism to achieve balance in the market in contrast with the excessive price cuts included in the Common Agricultural    Policy  reform  proposals, Regions such as Ireland should be excluded from further cuts in quotas to reduce the income disparities between Ireland and the more industrialised nations of the European Community as provided for in the Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act.  We have already suffered a 10 per cent cut in our quota during the past nine years.  Surely this should be adequate to control our situation in respect of the European market.</P>
    <P>I should also add that a European Communiry-funded restructuring scheme should seek to increase the milk quotas of those farmers who are committed  to milk production.  Quotas which have been bought up should be reallocated  to smaller producers and provide access to quotas for young farmers.  We should seek a derogation from any further  reductions in milk quotas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the beef industry, it is only right that we should look at what happened in 1991.  Surplus beef is something  in the region of 800,000 tonnes and at the same time, as far as Eastern Europe is concerned, EC imports were approximately 800,000 tonnes.  This does <Col N="1316" /> not make sense as we are importing beef to create a surplus and damaging the markets for our farmers.</P>
    <P>When we look further down the field we find that some of these Eastern European  countries require the moneys or &mdash; as it has been described &mdash; the hard currencies to pay for the loans and on top of that the EC is now giving the Russians money to buy back the same beef.  That is a merry-go-round and is neither logical or makes economic sense.  These must be looked at in view of the fact that the surpluses in the EC are being created by imports from countries outside the EC, We keep complaining and yet from September  1991 to December 1991 the main reason for the collapse of the store trade was the fact that there was an over-supply in Europe.</P>
    <P>An effective price support mechanism is essential to underpin the market and to protect farm incomes from uneconomic low prices arising from disruption in internal and external markets.  The safety net of intervention must be preserved; the EC suckler cow premium scheme should be preserved for small scale milk producers and be extended so that small and medium scale dairy farmers can obtain premium payments on up to 30 cows to maintain the farms as viable units.  This is essential as nobody can underestimate the importance of the beef industry to this country.  We have a very high quality product but, as the Minister of State said, our processing and marketing  are a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Rome, Article 39.2, places an obligation on the Community to ensure that specific account is taken of the close link between agriculture and the economy of member states.  The Single European Act requires that all policies lead to greater economic and social cohesion.  Agriculture is over three times more important to Ireland than the EC on average and over seven times more important compared with Germany.  The agri-food sector as a proportion of total manufacturing employment is over three times more in Irerand than in the other EC countries.  Employment in agriculture and the food sector is twice as important <Col N="1317" /> to Ireland as the EC on average, further reinforcing the need for reform to take full account of the contribution of milk and beef to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I regret that this debate has not engendered more passion.  It is a very serious subject and the sequel to these negotiations will decide the future of not just the agricultural industry but the  that people, even Members in this House, take it seriously, I know that many people outside the House think it is just another little game being played within the EC but it is not.  I regret that more interest was not shown.  The speeches of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Woods, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, were anaemic.  The speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, was shorter but it was to the point.  They are all nice people and I do not want to be offensive but I must tell the truth as I see it.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food is following a very poor tradition.  His predecessor, Deputy O'Kennedy, was just not up to he job.  Again, I do not want to be offensive  but I must be factual.</P>
      <P>The agricultural industry is facing dire consequences because of a lacklustre approach, not just by the Ministers but by the Taoiseach.  It is incredible that this matter has not been highlighted by the Taoiseach at any of the last three summit meetings in Europe.  I remember that in 1983 the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, stormed out of a meeting of the Heads of State in Europe but, in doing so, he put the spotlight on Ireland within the European Community.  At the end of the day, by his intransigence, we got the result we needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what has gone on in this debate is really parish pump politics when we should be talking about power politics which take place at summit meetings.  If one makes the play at a summit meeting then one follows it up in the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels.  That is the way the game is played, I probably should not use the word ``game'' because <Col N="1318" /> the matter is too serious but that is the factual situation.  This item has not been on the agenda at the summit meetings. How can we expect to score at the Council  of Ministers? We hear the same type of speech time and again.  Deputy Sherlock said that this is the third or fourth time we have had this kind of debate.  I have heard the same speeches from the Government benches on all those  handouts.  They are not the thoughts of the Minister, I do not know whether he is knowldgeable enough to write his own speech but Civil Service handouts will not win us the concessions we need in discussions in Europe.</P>
    <P>If Commissioner MacSharry comes back to domestic politics I recommend that he joins The Workers' Party because they are the only ones who agree with proposals in this House.  Are The Workers' Party aware that two major analyses have been carried out on these proposals, one by the ICOS and the other by an independent team of researchers who are paid by the Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, said in regard to the food industry.  It is a pity the Culliton report has not been debated in this House, not just as a Private Members' motion but over a number of days or weeks because it is relevant to the major problem &mdash; unemployment &mdash; which this <Col N="1319" /> country faces today.  A large section of the report is devoted to what we should be talking about, the food industry, instead of agriculture alone.  We have really fallen down in regard to the food industry.  The Culliton report has some very pointed things to say and it raised pertinent issues.  However, we ignore the report because its comments hit home.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, is right in saying there are a number of areas in which we have been particularly weak in regard to agriculture.  I list them as education, research and development and, above all, marketing.  Our record on agricultural education since we joined the EC has been moderately good.  However, our performance in relation to research and development and marketing has been dismal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, talked about new products. What are we doing to manufacture new products?  Our problem is that we manufacture products which cannot be sold on the open market, a market of 340 million people.</P>
    <P>They are the issues we should address <Col N="1320" /> when we talk about agriculture and our food industry.  We need to stop making butter and skim milk powder and start making saleable cheeses and selling our beef, which is the best in the world; otherwise we will be evading the issue and we will not be doing our farmers any service. We are actually selling them down the river.  Those hard-working people are not getting a fair crack of the whip because our policy makers have failed dismally. We have abused the systems in Europe, particularly the intervention system, to an alarming degree.  That abuse cannot continue.  We must see to it that that abuse is brought to an end and that we have a viable food industry which produces goods which people need and will buy.  We need to stop dumping foodstuffs into intervention.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister's amendment.  This side of the House will keep pressing our concern that the negotiations in Europe be conducted at the highest level because that is the only way we will get a successful return at the end of the day.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Provision of Dialysis Unit at Tralee Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter on behalf of people who are undergoing great strain and hardship by being obliged to travel  to cork Regional Hospital for dialysis  treatment.  They have to travel three <Col N="1325" /> times per week on a continuous and perhaps  permanent basis.  Some people from  the Dingle area leave home at 5.30 a.m. and having arrived at the hospital they spend approximately five hour? on the  machine before returning home.  That  practice is repeated three times each week.</P>
      <P>The Kerry branch of  the Irish Kedney Association have lodged £90,000 in the banks, to purchase the necessary equipment.  That was  a  very  generous response on the part of all concerned. The only expense to the Department of Health would be in relation to staff.  The community have responded in such a I generous way because they are conscious  of the extreme stress, strain and hardship suffered by these patients and their families,  who have to continually undertake such travel over a long and hazardous route.  It now rests with the Department of Health to bring the ordeal of those people to an end by sanctioning the installation of a modem dialysis unit in  Tralee and to have the money collected by the people put to the use for which it was intended -- to provide a service to a  community suffenng great hardship -- rather than allowing it to lie idle in the banks.</P>
      <P>At the moment some 13 people travel from the area in question to Cork for treatment each week.  I urgently seek the co-operation of the Minister in giving her approval for the installation of the necessary unit.  It is a long time since the Tralee General Hospital was established, some six or seven years.  The provision of dialysis treatment facilities at the hospital was anticipated by the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no condition so requiring of instant specialised treatment as the condition  of those who need treatment under renal dialysis technology.  The treatment has to be carried out within a hospital and it has to be ongoing for a good number of hours.  Difficult as the journey to Cork may be in summer time for the patients in question it is almost impossible in winter when frost and snow descend on those mountain roads, with all the additional <Col N="1326" /> mental stress and strain that involves for both patients and their families lest it should not be possible to reach the treatment  centre.  The community have provided  possibly more than would be required for the purchase of a unit for the Tralee hospital, The Irish Kidney Association in the first instance requested only £60,000 but people of Kerry responded with a 50 per cent increase on that amount in order to put the cost factor beyond any doubt.  I appeal to the Minister  here tonight to say that the people concerned have suffered enough, that an end should be in sight and that they should be able without further delay to receive the treatment within the confines of their own county.  That would still involve fairly substantial travelling for some patients, but it would certainly ease the burden, the pain and the stress suffered  by patients and their families as a result of being obliged to travel a possible 200 miles to Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Michael Moynihan for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to out-line the position regarding the provision of dialysis services at Tralee General Hospital.  I am very conscious of the needs of kidney dialysis patients in Kerry and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently met rep- resentatives of the Irish Kidney Association and found it to be a fruitful and informative meeting.  Many aspects of the kidney dialysis services nationally were discussed, including the services for Kerry patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of services at Tralee General Hospital is, of course, a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board, having regard to their competing service priorities and the resources at their disposal.  A proposal for the provision of kidney dialysis services  at Tralee General Hospital was submitted  by the board to my Department in 1986 but it was not proceeded with then due to financial constraints.  While no further proposals have been received by my Department to date, I understand <Col N="1327" /> that the board at their meeting on Monday night decided that the provision of a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital should be included among their priorities for development at the hospital.</P>
    <P>Tralee General Hospital has also drawn up several other priorities, I understand, which will clearly compete for whatever resources are available.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Kerry branch of the Irish Kidney Association have raised funds for the purchase of equipment for a unit in Tralee.  The work and dedication of the people involved is very heartening.</P>
    <P>I have to conclude by saying that proposals for the establishment of dialysis services at Tralee would have to be examined by the Southern Health Board in the first instance and in the context of their overall service priorities, their priorities for Tralee and, of course, the resources they have available to meet those priorities. If the Department receive details of priorities from the Southern Health Board they will be considered in the context of resources available in the Department for the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>The decision to introduce a means test for ESF maintenance grants for students of regional technical colleges is a big mistake.  It is a retrograde step, a decision that will cause major hardship for many families, a decision that will put third level education beyond the reach of many other families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sligo Regional Technical College is in <Col N="1328" /> the heart of my constituency.  The catchment are is Sligo, Leitrim, parts of Mayo and Donegal, and north Roscommon. Nowhere have the ESF maintenance grants, as at present administered, been more significant both in the build-up of the college and in making available the opportunity of third level education to a large number of students who would otherwise have been forced to opt out.</P>
    <P>In turn, the success of the college has been an important factor in the economy of the whole north-west region and, in particular, in the attraction of industry. The graduates who have been forced to emigrate &mdash; and we have in that region the highest emigration rates in the entire country &mdash; have gone with very valuable educational skills, equal to anything they encountered in their age groups in the host countries.</P>
    <P>Now there is to be a means test for maintenance grants.  This will result in up to 60 per cent of all future students and those changing courses losing out.  Some will be deprived of the grant entirely, some will have only partial grants and some will receive nominal grants.  We must remember that the means test limits are very tight.  For instance, a family with two children will be disqualified from any grant at all if they have a gross income &mdash; that is gross income, not take-home pay &mdash; of around £13,000.  The average industrial wage is higher than that.  They will lose part of the grant if they have a gross income of around £10,000.</P>
    <P>Once again the PAYE people will be hit hardest.  The harsh reality is that many parents in the Sligo RTC area, and the other RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology areas, will have to tell their sons and daughters that they will have to forget about their plans to go forward to third level education.</P>
    <P>The RTCs have been particularly successful in attracting students from farming and manual worker backgrounds, leaving a very balanced socio-economic student body profile.  Now all of this is at risk.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the damage that the new means test decision will do to the educational pattern and prospects in the <Col N="1329" /> Sligo RTC catchment area, the one I know best.  I feel sure that the position will not be much different in Galway or in other areas.</P>
    <P>All around the country students are now studying for the leaving certificate but their educational fate will be decided by this decision of the Government, irrespective of the results they attain in the examination.  The Minister may well say that he wants to spread the available EC money.  In December Minister Davern said that he would assign a permanent official from his Department to Brussels in order to tap into EC funded programmes. That is what he should be doing.  He should be out there obtaining additional funds, and not just accepting the existing funding and spreading it around more thinly.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, has a particular personal interest in the regional technical colleges. I confidently appeal to him to ensure that the regressive decision to means test the grants will be rescinded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Nealon in demanding that this unnecessary step be rescinded immediately.  The grants are 65 per cent EC funded.  I fail to understand why a means test should be introduced at this time.  Up to 25,000 students throughout the country could be affected by this, up to 4,000 of them in the regional technical college in Galway, each receiving up to a maximum of £39 a week grant which does not pay for their accommodation.  It costs about £25 more to keep a student in Galway.  Parents with a third child going into the regional technical college this year would have to pay £75 per week and without the grant it would cost up to £200.  This would be an impossible task for many.  Apart from that, the spending power of students in Galway on accommodation and other things brings in about £250,000 a week to Galway.  I demand that this means test proposal be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 9,000 additional places are being provided in <Col N="1330" /> third level education.  Enrolments are now 75,000 and will increase to 90,000 in the next four or five years.  The number of students on ESF courses has grown from 10,600 in 1986 to 22,200 in 1991. The expenditure on ESF courses in vocational education committee colleges has grown from £35 million in 1986 to £86 million in 1991.  Of the students on ESF courses, funding from Brussels is available for 19,600 students only.  The State, therefore, has to meet 100 per cent of the cost of the balance of 2,600 students at a cost of approximately £9 million. Deputies will be aware that many of those students come from homes in which parents can well afford to pay.</P>
      <P>The choice was between limiting the number going on to such courses within the limits of available funds or trying to accommodate more students by applying a means test.  The latter solution was the only equitable one.  The emphasis in student grant support has to be on helping all those in the lower income group. My party in Government do not make any apologies for helping the less well-off. That is the important aspect of this change.  In a context of limited resources this can only be done through means testing.  At present, about half of all students in third level receive grant support. About one-third of the students in universities receive grant support and over 87 per cent of students in vocational education committee third level colleges.</P>
      <P>Apart from the existing ESF aided grant scheme all third level grant and related schemes operate on the principle of income assessment for determining the eligibility of applicants for maintenance grants.  In the context of developing greater equity and rationalisation the Government decided that the same income eligibility criteria should apply for the maintenance grant element of all higher education grant schemes.  The criteria will operate in the case of all new entrants to third level with effect from September 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with the proposed means testing the ESF students on those courses will still have a considerable advantage, since <Col N="1331" /> they will not have to pay any fees, regardless  of income.  The revised arrangements regarding maintenance grants will not apply to students already enrolled on ESF aided third level courses.</P>
    <P>As well as achieving greater equity, the Government have been concerned to ensure in so far as resources allow, a balanced improvement in student support  and I have recently been pleased to announce a range of measures which will lead to a fairer and more equitable distribution  of the available funds.  Mature students, families with more than one child attending third level education and lone parents, will benefit under the package  of reforms.  The principal improvements  being introduced for new entrants to third level this year are as follows: the income eligibility ceiling for families will be increased by £2,000 for each child after the first child attending third level education.  That is of great significance because many families now have more than one child attending third level education  and they do not have any relief. This applies especially to PAYE workers. Income eligibility will be assessed on the income and income limits in the year of entry to third level rather than as here-tofore,  on the limits in the year which the student sat the leaving certificate.  Mature students who secure a place in a third level institution will automatically be considered to meet the academic requirements for the award of a grant. Second chance education, especially for people with working class backgrounds, has to be a great new development in third level education.</P>
    <P>Mature students may be assessed on the basis of their own incomes and, if married, their spouses income rather than on their parents' income, which has been the case up to now.  Lone parents' welfare payments under the lone parents' allowance scheme will be excluded from the asessment of income for grant eligibility.  Income limits and mainenance grants will be index-linked in 1992.</P>
    <P>I also announced the setting up of a new review committee to develop more equitable income assessment criteria. <Col N="1332" /> The committee will comprise representatives  of concerned Departments, including Agriculture, Education, Environment,  Finance, Health, Social Welfare and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the objective of all the measures referred to is to achieve absolute  equity in the distribution of available funds.  Within these limits the means testing  referred to will ensure that a greater number of students from lower income families will be enabled to participate in third level education.  I commend to the House this most important new development  which will open up third level education  opportunities for a large segment of the community who up to now were being denied such an opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied beyond any doubt that there is a change in policy in the Department, hence my desire to have this matter raised in the House and to get a reply.</P>
      <P>In Ladysbridge in 1970 a decision by the Department of Education to close down three small schools in the area was accepted on the basis that the children would be transported to Kilcreadan school.  Now the Department are reneging on this agreement and consequently  children of the Walsh and Davis families in the Shanavagoon-Ladysbridge area, whose neighbours are being transported  to Kilcreadan, are being told that they must attend Shanagarry school which is outside their parish, and that transport there will be provided.</P>
      <P>In the upper Gortnaskehy-Araglinn area where transport is being  provided to Coolmohan national school, the Keane and Doherty families are being refused transport on the grounds that they reside in the Ballyheaphy closed school area and should be attending Ballyduff school which is six miles away.  Coolmohan is three-and-a-half miles away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue raised its head about ten years ago and the Department recognised <Col N="1333" /> the point that was made at the time.  I am sure the Minister will find that in the files.</P>
    <P>In Glenville, when the Chimneyfield and Knuttery national schools closed, the children were transported to Glenville, Now Norma Buckley is being refused free transport on the grounds that she should attend Burnfort national school.  In all cases fare-paying facilities are being offered.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to honour the agreement drawn up when it suited the Department to close down small schools.</P>
    <P>According to paragraph 1.3 of the primary  school transport scheme:</P>
    <P>Where a transport service is established  in place of a school which is being closed and amalgamated with  in the district of the closed school are eligible for transport to the amalgamated  school only.  The service will be continued for as long as there are seven or more such children availing themselves of it.  In general, transport from the closed school area may be given only to the school of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>In all cases what is required and demanded is that transport be provided to the school of amalgamation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Ladysbridge-Kilcreadan national school area, the children in question do not live in the Ladysbridge closed school area and are not eligible for transport to Kilcreadan where the amalgamated school is, Their eligibility must,  therefore,  be determined by reference to their nearest school, Shanagarry.  As they reside less than two miles from that school they are not eligible for school transport to any other school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incorrect to state, as Deputy Sherlock  did, that the Walsh and Davis children  were told that they must attend Shanagarry.  It appears that some children  who were in the Shanagarry school area did get transport in error to Kilcreadan  on the bus servicing that school. The Shanagarry school authorities have <Col N="1334" /> very kindly agreed to their continuing transport to Kilcreadan but, understandably,  they are not willing to extend that permission indefinitely to other pupils in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern has made strenuous efforts lo try to reach an agreement  whereby those children can be accommodated and those who have been taken off the buses and had been fare paying can be reinstated.  We are in discussion  in regard to that</P>
    <P>Regarding Araglen, which is known locally as Coolmoohan, the children in question here live in the Ballyheaphy closed school area and are eligible therefore for free transport to the school with which Ballyheaphy amalgamated i.e.  need to be living in the Araglen school area to be eligible for free transport to Araglen national school.</P>
    <P>With regard to Glenville national school, the children in question from the Coome area live in the Knuttery closed school area and are eligible for free transport to Bumfort national school, the school with which Knuttery national school amalgamated.  In order to be eligible for free transport to Glenville national school they would need to be living in the Chimneyfield closed school area.  Chimneyfield national school amalgamated with Glenville national school.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that transport entitlement is determined on the basis of the shortest available walking distance to the school in question and that much confusion arises because it is assumed that parish boundaries are the determining  factor.  Parish boundaries are not relevant for a variety of reasons, but mainly because school transport is basically  there to enable children without a means of transport to attend an accessible school regularly.  Both in the School Attendance Act and for all practicable purposes, accessibility is determined by walking distance rather than parish or other boundaries such as county boundaries.  It is commonplace to find schools situated well away from the geographic <Col N="1335" /> centre of the parish and this fact, combined with the irregular shape of parish boundaries, inevitably means that for many people their nearest local school is in a neighbouring parish.  It would create a very confusing situation if any criterion except distance was used in regulating a transport scheme.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the decisions in the cases he quotes were in accordance with the rules for school transport, as they have been for the lifetime <Col N="1336" /> of the scheme.  If any substantial amendment to the rules were proposed I would give proper notice and where necessary, consult with the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>We are making every effort through negotiation to accommodate as many people as possible within the existing schemes in the general area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 February 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the report in question.  The disposal of hospital wastes is covered in a general way by the European Communities (Waste) Regulations 1979, and, in the case of incineration of these wastes, by the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  This Act places a general obligation on the occupiers of non-domestic premises, including hospitals, to use the best practical means to prevent or limit emissions, and on the occupiers of all premises not to cause or permit emissions which are a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> More specifically, the licensing of all new incinerators is now required under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and licensing may be extended by order to existing incinerators.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, provides expressly for the licensing by the agency of the incineration of hospital waste, on the basis of integrated pollution control.</P>
    <P>I understand that plans are at an advanced stage for the provision of a central incinerator to dispose safely of the clinical waste from all the Dublin hospitals.  Any such proposal would be subject to the normal planning and environmental controls which include environmental impact assessment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="1114" /> Nos. 27, 49, 55 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 354 of 29 January 1992 in which I set out fully my response to the Naas water contamination incident, following on my receipt of a detailed report from the Kildare county manager and a meeting with local interests.</P>
      <P>The report referred to was requested so as to assist me in my wider responsibility of ensuring the adequacy of national guidelines for the protection of drinking water.  I have already announced my intention of revising these guidelines in the light of the Naas incident and of consulting local authority and consumer interests on their preparation.</P>
      <P>There are well established arrangements in local government law and practice regarding the provision of information by local authorities.  It would be inappropriate, in view of these, for the Minister for the Environment directly to procure the publication of a local authority report.</P>
      <P>Full national reporting of drinking water quality has now been established, and the results are being compiled and published annually by the environmental research unit.  The first such report, entitled <i>Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland</i>&mdash; a preliminary report for the year 1989 &mdash; is available in the Oireachtas Library and contains a national assessment of quality, as well as details for each county of all reported exceedances of the prescribed quality standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is not a legal requirement on sanitary authorities to publish reports on contamination of public water supplies, the action to be taken where a supply does not meet the statutory requirements is clearly set out in article 8 of the Drinking Water Regulations. This includes an obligation on sanitary authorities to warn users of a water supply where there is an unacceptable risk to public health.  In order to assess that risk, sanitary authorities are advised by my Department to consult the director of community care/medical officer of health, who will decide on the need to <Col N="1115" /> warn users and advise on measures necessary to minimise health risks.</P>
    <P>My Department have not received proposals over the last three years for the augmentation, as such, of the Naas water supply.  An application was received under the small schemes programme for 1991 for a grant to finance pumps and related equipment which had already been installed on the Sunday's Well source.  This application was not granted.</P>

The derelict sites levy under the 1990 Act was intended to apply primarily in cities, boroughs, urban districts and towns. However, the Act also recognised that there were other areas where dereliction exists and provision was made to apply the levy to such other areas as the Minister for the Environment may prescribe by regulations to be urban areas for the purposes of the Act.  Such regulations have already been made in relation to parts of counties Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick and Tipperary (South Riding).  I understand that Dublin County Council are now considering the making of a request to have parts of County Dublin so prescribed.  I will deal with any such request as quickly as possible.</P>

    <P>I recently announced a decision to go ahead with phase 2 of the Dublin transportation initiative, the main features of which will be: the development of an effective process for ongoing and <Col N="1119" /> integrated transportation planning in the greater Dublin area; the preparation of a long term integrated transportation strategy for the period up to 2011 which will be both practicable and updatable; and the production of a medium term investment and implementation programme for the period 1994 to 1998 based on that strategy.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 will have a 15 month work programme, with a final report due in April 1993.  A critical element of that work programme will be the preparation by autumn of 1992 of an interim report which will form a possible input to negotiations on EC Structural Fund investment for the period 1994 to 1998.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for phase 2 provide for an open approach, involving a two-way consultative process between the study team and the general public, institutions and interest groups.  There will be substantial public consultation, using market research techniques, discussions with interested bodies, public meetings, invitations to make submissions and other suitable methods.  The emphasis will be on public participation from an early stage in phase 2, while options are still genuinely open, and again at later stages when strategies and plans are being developed and refined.  A local authority committee comprised of local elected representatives and a consultative panel representing transport users and providers are being established at present, as part of the steering arrangements for phase 2.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference also provide for an appraisal of traffic and parking enforcement and a review of institutional arrangements relating to transport in Dublin.

      <P>Ireland has strongly supported the preparations for UNCED, in particular by hosting a major UN Conference on Water and the Environment which was held in Dublin from 26 to 31 January. The Dublin Statement and Report which emerged from that conference are intended as a major input on freshwater issues to Agenda 21 of UNCED.  Public awareness of UNCED in Ireland will be facilitated by this conference, by a number of non-governmental seminars which have taken place and by the publication shortly of the Irish Government's national report for UNCED.</P>

The purpose of this proposed scheme is to provide for effective elimination of discharges of untreated effluent from the existing sewerage system.  A decision on this report will issue shortly.

Financing of fully approved schemes under the water and sanitary services programme is provided by my Department.</P>

As regards environmental monitoring generally, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, will confer responsibilities on the new agency for preparing and co-ordinating national environmental monitoring programmes, including specific responsibility for the exercise of general supervision of the environmental monitoring carried out by local authorities.</P>

      <P>Acceptance of contributions from private individuals or companies for purposes related to the performance of the functions of a local authority is a matter in the first instance for that authority. I see no objection in principle to such contributions, bearing in mind that there is a sound basis both in local government law and practice for co-operation between local authorities and private sector interests.  I would expect, however, that a local authority, in considering the acceptance of a contribution in any particular case, would have regard primarily to the public interest and would take into account the nature of the contribution in question, the purpose for which it would be applied, and the significance of the contribution in terms of facilitating the performance of the authority's functions and of promoting economic, social and other development in the area.  It would, of course, be essential to ensure that no such contribution would lead to any conflict of interest or prejudice in any way the proper performance by the authority of its functions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any breach of EC or national air quality standards for smoke this winter.  Monitoring results available from local authorities in Dublin indicate that smoke levels in excess of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre were recorded at some stations on one day so far this winter.  A single daily exceedance of this value does not however constitute a breach of air quality standards.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the operation of the coal ban under constant review and I will bring forward further measures as necessary to ensure the continued success of the ban.</P>
      <P>As regards the cost of fuels, there is a wide selection of smokeless fuels available at varying costs to householders. Costs arising from the need to use smokeless fuels are being minimised for lowincome groups by means of a weekly special fuel allowance provided by the Department of Social Welfare to qualified households.</P>

      <P>Work on the northern cross route, which will link the western parkway to the N1 and the Malahide Road, <Col N="1129" /> is expected to commence this year and to be completed in 1995.</P>
      <P>The southern cross route, which involves a motorway link from the western parkway to Sandyford, is included in the operational programme on peripherality with a 1992-95 four-year construction period.  In view of my quasi-judicial functions in relation to the motorway scheme for this route which has yet to be determined, it would be inappropriate for me to give any further indication of the possible timing of the project.</P>
      <P>As regards the final link in the Dublin ring road, i.e. the south-eastern motorway from Sandyford to the N11 at Shankill, the position is that Dublin County Council have been requested by my Department to develop their route proposal as quickly as possible.  The actual timing of this project will be considered in the context of preparing the roads plan for the period after 1993.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that appropriate provision for the financing of expenditure on the foregoing projects will be made in the determination of the road grant allocations for 1992 and the following years.</P>
      <P>Pending completion by the Oireachtas of its consideration of the Roads Bill, 1991, specific tolling arrangements for any road would be a matter for consideration in the first instance by the relevant road authority.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban waste water treatment will come into force from 30 June 1993.  A programme for its implementation must be established by 31 December 1993.  The directive sets standards and other requirements for sewage treatment which vary according to the size of the discharge.  Secondary treatment is required as the norm for discharges from population equivalents of 2,000 upwards to internal fresh waters and estuaries and of 10,000 upwards to coastal waters.  More stringent treatment may be required for larger discharges to sensitive areas, as defined in the directive, and primary treatment may be allowed for certain discharges to less sensitive areas.  The time scales for the provision of treatment range from 1998 to 2005.  The directive also requires re-use of sewage sludge, whenever appropriate, and the phasing out of its disposal to surface waters by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>All of the above provisions are consistent with the policies announced in the Government's environment action programme in January 1990.  The action now well underway to implement the commitments made in that programme will ensure that all requirements of the directive can be met within the time frame envisaged.</P>

      <P>There are no generally applicable EC water quality standards in respect of bays.  Kerry County Council monitors bathing waters at two locations in the vicinity of Tralee Bay, i.e. at Ballyheigue  and Banna Strand.  I understand that both locations complied in 1991 with the standards set in the European Communities (Quality of Bathing Water) Regulations, 1988, and that, in addition, both were awarded blue flags.</P>
      <P>A major sewerage scheme has been proposed by Tralee Urban District Council to provide a level of treatment consistent with the objectives of the Government's environment action programme and of the EC Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment.</P>

      <P>The United Nations plan for elections in the Western Sahara provided for a ceasefire to mark the beginning of a transitional period during which the United Nations would organise and conduct a referndum in the Western Sahara in order to enable the people there to choose between independence and integration with Morocco.  The ceasefire entered into force on 6 September 1991 and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, has been established in the territory.</P>
      <P>It has not yet proved possible to secure agreement between the parties on the criteria to be applied in establishing the lists of those who will be entitled to vote in the referendum.  The former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, reported to the Security Council on 19 December 1991 that there is likely to be a delay of some months while consultations continue with the parties in order to establish the necessary conditions for implementing the United Nations plan.  The Security Council adopted resolution 725 on 31 December 1991, welcoming the report of the outgoing Secretary-General, and requesting the new Secretary-General, Mr. Boutros Ghali, to submit a further report within two months.</P>
      <P>The EC has decalred its firm support for the efforts of the Secretary-General to implement the United Nations plan. Several of the member states of the European Community &mdash; Ireland, France, Italy, Greece and the UK  &mdash; and contributing personnel to MINURSO.  They will be assisting in the organisaton and the monitoring of the referndum. Ireland already has six Army officers serving with MINURSO and will have fifteen Army officers and fifteen gardaí serving with the force when it reaches its full strength.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union, which was agreed by Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Maastricht in December of last year and which is to be signed shortly, introduces provisions dealing with trans-European networks (TENS) in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures.  These relates to the interconnection of national networks.  They take particular account of the need to link peripheral, land-locked and island region with the central region of the <Col N="1141" /> Community and they include the possibility of Community financial support for projects of common interest, financed by member states.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Treaty provides for a cohesion fund to be set up before the end of 1993.  This fund, which is to complement the existing structural funds, is intended to help member states with a GNP <i>per capita</i> which is less than 90 per cent of the Community average.  It will provide aid for projects in two areas: the environment and transport infrastructures aspects of TENS.  This fund is one of the many important elements relating to economic and social cohension which were included in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Commission has not yet put forward its detailed proposals on the funding and implementation of the measures and it would be premature to outline proposals before the specific eligibility criteria and operational procedures have been negotiated in the Council of Ministers. Ireland has been very successful in submitting worthwhile projects for existing Structural Fund assistance, with the result tht we have been able to benefit extremely well from the funds available to us.  We will seek to ensure that this will apply also to the new measures and to the increased and more flexible Structural Funds which will result from the Treaty provisions we negotiated.</P>

      <P>As previously indicated to the Deputy documents, if any, of the kind alluded to in his question would appear to be relevant to legal proceedings (which solicitors acting for the person named have indicated may be taken against the Attorney General, the body concerned and the Minister for Finance) thus making it inappropriate to supply them to a plaintiff.</P>
      <P>The body in question is an independent body, established under a statute and its staff (other than clerical staff who are civil servants) are appointed by the body under specified statutory arrangements. These arrangements &mdash; like those of many other State financed bodies &mdash; differ from those applicable to Civil Service posts and do not involve Civil Service recruitment or transfer procedures.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to ensure that problems which, in the past, have delayed payments of headage and other livestock premiums are eliminated.  In that way payments will be made earlier in the year and fewer claims will be delayed by queries.  This should reduce the need for Oireachtas Members and others to check on the state of play in regard to individual cases.</P>
      <P>Where such inquiries have, however, to be made I have arranged for them to be answered as quickly as possible, having regard to the need not to unduly divert the limited staff involved from the primary task of making the payments.</P>
      <P>Such inquiries should be addressed to the relevant local office which can obtain the required information both where the application is still being processed locally or where it has been passed for validation and payment to the computer division in Dublin.</P>

Since it was a condition of the scheme that animals be tagged at the time of application, only the two tagged animals were considered eligible for grants.

      <P>The EC Framework Programme (1990-94) is composed of 16 specific programmes including a human capital and mobility programme under which, <i>inter alia</i>, research students would spend time studying abroad.</P>
      <P>This specific programme has not yet been adopted and, therefore, no awards have yet been made under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The human capital and mobility specific programme is likely to be adopted in the near future.  It will contain a specific <Col N="1180" /> provision to prevent the brain drain from disadvantaged regions and to increase the effectiveness of training, whereby support may also be given for experienced researchers to enable them to carry out research and development in such regions.</P>

      <P>Eolas, the Irish Science and Technology Agency, promote the involvement of Irish researchers in EC science and technology programmes. The agency represent Irish research interests on many of the EC management research committees.  In this context, Eolas received only 2 per cent of the total funds of £57 million approximately allocated to Ireland under the EC second framework programme, 1987-91.  I recognise that there may be potential for conflict of interest between Eolas and other research interests in this area, and accordingly I am reviewing the arrangements to see if such a potential conflict can be avoided.</P>

      <P>The major aim of the Community framework programmes is to strengthen the scientific and technological level of European industry and encourage it to become more competitive <Col N="1181" /> at international level (Title VI of the Single European Act).  The research carried out is pre-competitive in nature, implying that further research of a product development nature is required to generate products in the market-place.</P>
      <P>I have no information readily available to me on what products, if any, have been introduced into the marketplace as a result of these research programmes. Indeed, the limited relevance to Irish industry of the framework programmes as currently structured is an issue which I have repeatedly pointed out in Community discussions and I propose to press this point further.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the children involved in the case referred to by the Deputy were removed from this country in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1991 gave the force of law here to international conventions designed to deal with the problems that arise when a child is abducted, usually by a parent across international frontiers in defiance of a court order or against the wishes of the other parent.  The Act, which came into operation on 1 October 1991, includes a provision at section 37 (1) which gives a member of the Garda Síochána power to <Col N="1185" /> detain a child who he reasonably suspects is about to be, or is being, removed from the State in breach of an order by a court here regarding the custody of, or right of access to, a child or while proceedings for such an order are pending or an application for such an order is about to be made.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the provisions of the 1991 Act mean that we now have in our law comprehensive and effective measures in relation to safequarding the rights of children and parents in the context of wrongful removals &mdash; or attempts at such removals &mdash; of children from the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>It is <Col N="1186" /> not the practice for the Minister for Justice to give detailed information to the House about individual Garda investigations except where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate. All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that this case was the subject of an exhaustive Garda investigation.  All the people on the premises at the time were interviewed following inquiries at the licensed premises and following press, radio and &ldquo;Garda Patrol&rdquo; publicity seeking assistance.  A very detailed file on the matter was subsequently submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed that there should be no prosecution. The Director of Public Prosecutions is, of course, under statute independent in the performance of his functions and I have no role in regard thereto.</P>
      <P>I am further assured by the Garda authorities that if any new evidence comes to light, it will be fully investigated and referred for direction, if appropriate, to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 141 to 146, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Housing authorities have no specific statutory functions in relation to the control or regulation of hostels, other than their general powers in relation to unfit accommodation under section 66 of the Housing Act, 1966.  However, the functions of housing authorities under the Housing Act, 1988 in relation to the accommodation of homeless persons include securing an emergency response to homelessness.  The responsibilities of housing authorities in this regard are set out in detail in my Department's &ldquo;guidelines for housing authorities in regard to the accommodation needs of homeless persons&rdquo; issued to housing authorities on 3 May 1991 and copies of which were placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A housing authority's arrangements for responding to homelessness may rely in part on hostel accommodation.  In regard to the standard of accommodation, emergency response and funding, I refer to paragraphs 24, 11 and 32-33 respectively of the guidelines.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern of local authorities in relation to the costs incurred in the administration of higher education grants schemes.  The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, which provides for the recoupment of the cost of grants paid by local authorities, does not provide for the recoupment of the administration cost of the scheme.  My Department is in contact with the Department of Education on the matter.</P>

I am satisfied that this information, together with the <i>Rules of the Road</i> booklet, should enable such persons to prepare adequately for a further test.</P>

      <P>The public inquiry into Dublin County Council's Southern Cross Route motorway scheme and eight associated compulsory purchase orders concluded on 11 October 1991.  Until I <Col N="1196" /> have received and considered the report of the inspector who conducted the inquiry, I will not be in a position to make a decision in the matter.  The question of a further public inquiry does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Southern Cross Route has been included in the Operational Programme on Peripherality which envisages construction during the period 1992-1995. In view of my quasi-judicial function in relation to the motorway scheme, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage on the likely timing of the project.</P>

      <P>I am assured by the health board that they are continuing to upgrade facilities at the hospital to ensure that patients are given the best possible treatment within available resources.</P>
      <P>Public psychiatric hospitals are inspected on an annual basis by the inspector and assistant inspector of mental hospitals.

      <P>I am aware that the Peto Institute in Budapest has developed a regime called conductive education for children with motor disorders like cerebral palsy.  This system has been examined in detail by professional staff from organisations in this country who are providing services for children with disabilities and some of them have been to Hungary to study the institute's methods.  The concensus of professional opinion here is that while conductive education has some helpful approaches to offer certain children it has not been established that, in the longer term, it is more effective than the education and therapy services available in this country.</P>
      <P>Assistance for referral of patients abroad is given where appropriate treatment is not available in this country.  The policy in relation to conductive education is to incorporate the beneficial aspects of it into existing programmes rather than to divert resources to the referral of children to Budapest.</P>

    <P>During 1989 and 1990 some 292 additional medical posts and 1,778 additional nursing posts have been recorded by my Department in their annual health services personnel census. These posts arose in the main from Government initiatives such as the reduction in the number of hours worked per week by nurses and non-consultant hospital doctors, the commissioning of new units and special budgetary allocations for the development of services for the elderly and mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Census data in respect of 1991 is not yet available.  However, the commissioning of further new units and the ongoing development of services for the elderly and mentally handicapped can be expected to reflect a further increase in medical and nursing posts in 1991.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that, apart from any additional posts created, normal staff turnover arising from retirements, resignations and other temporary <Col N="1200" /> movement out of the labour force results in employment opportunities for nursing and medical graduates.</P>

      <P>The 1991 original and revised allocations, and 1992 original allocations to health boards and voluntary hospitals are set out in the tabular statement <Col N="1203" /> which will be circulated in the Official Report.  The 1992 allocations are exclusive of the cost of certain pay adjustments which may arise during this year, notably general pay increases which may be payable under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and arrears of pay due to medical consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> Revised 1991 allocations and allocations for 1992 in respect of homes for the mentally handicapped funded by my Department, will issue shortly.  As health agencies operate on the basis of income and expenditure, the precise out-turn for 1991 has yet to be determined.  My Department are in regular contact with the agencies in this regard.</P>

      <P>My Department had designated some officials to assist schools in devising and implementing suitable programmes for such children.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of any such pupils my Department will be in touch with their schools with regard to meeting the particular needs of these exceptional pupils.</P>
