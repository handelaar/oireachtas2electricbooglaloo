      <P>I regret that the amendment I tabled, which proposed the deletion of subsection 3, has been ruled out of order.  It is my contention that the current problems facing the Government in relation to abortion derive directly from the appalling sectarian amendment which was incorporated in our constitution in 1983.  There is no point in rehashing the debate that took place in <Col N="764" /> 1983, but it was categorically stated at the time by those promoting the Eight Amendment that it was not intended to change anything, that it was simply intended to maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  It was stated that it would not interfere with the protection of the life or the health of women, their right to travel or the right to information.  Those of us who opposed the amendment forewarned on all of these issues.  It was equally claimed that all it was intended to do was to ensure that the 1861 Act could not be struck down by legislation in this Parliament.</P>
      <P>We now know of course that that has not been the case, that quite a lot has been changed since the passing of the Eight Amendment of the Constitution. We know that students have been hounded by the courts and charged as a result of complaints that they were distributing abortion information and the courts have banned such information. We know also that books on health have been removed from our library shelves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be embarking on a Second Reading speech which is inappropriate on Committee Stage of the Bill.  His amendment has been ruled out of order for obvious reasons, that it is in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.  Perhaps the Deputy's speech should be reserved for the Schedule where most of the amendments appear.  There is nothing much in section 1 and, therefore, I expect Members to be brief in regard to it and to reserve their main comments for the amendments to the Schedule.  Amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 all relate to the Schedule; it is not for the Chair to advise Members how to utilise their time but I respectfully submit to them that the least delay should occur on sections 1 and 2 of the Bill and that we should proceed, as quickly as possible, to deal with the amendments to the Schedule.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I thank you for your contribution. I am speaking to section 1 which provides <Col N="765" /> for the amendment of Article 40.3.3º. of the Constitution.  I was making the point that we would not be in the current situation if we had not amended the Constitution the way we did in 1983 and left the Dáil free to legislate in whatever way it saw fit, given the public support &mdash; or otherwise &mdash; of abortion in limited circumstances.  I disagree fundamently with what is proposed in section 1.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be putting the section shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining why I oppose section 1.  I intend to call a vote on it because I disagree fundamentally with the concept that we can solve our abortion problem by simply amending Article 40.3.3º.  That is the purpose of my comments; I was making the point that it was alleged the amendment would change nothing and that, in fact, it has changed quite a considerable amount in relation to information regarding the stocking of books on women's health on our library shelves and on the circulation of internationally renowned newspapers like <i>The Manchester Guardian,</i> which we know was prevented from being distributed in this State because it carried an advertisement on information regarding abortion clinics in Britain.  All these things are a direct result of the 1983 amendment and we should not simply pass over section 1 because it seeks to further amend Article 40.3.3º in a way &mdash; as we will see when we come to the amendments to the Schedule &mdash; which will simply provide for abortion in extremely limited circumstances and will not address the problems which this State faces.  That is the very stark problem, at least 5,000 Irish women have gone to Britain for abortions in the past year.  It would be a mistake for the House to simply agree section 1 when it approaches the problem in a totally inadequate way. I argued on Second Stage, and otherwise both inside and outside this House &mdash; that it is time this House took its courage in its hands and faced the reality that Ireland has a problem in relation to abortion which we cannot ignore by pretending <Col N="766" /> it does not exist.  We must put services in place for women who find themselves in that position and provide for circumstances in which someone can legitimately obtain an abortion in this State.</P>

      <P>I wish to conclude my remarks.  It is regrettable that the amendment I tabled, seeking to propose an amendment to our Constitution which would delete Article 40.3.3º, was ruled out of order.  It would have given Members of the House freedom to legislate for abortion in this State in the light of the current circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are addressed to the Minister for Justice.  In his contribution on Second Stage he stated that the Government were not persuaded of the need for supplementary legislation &mdash; supplementary to the proposed constitutional amendment &mdash; but that they would listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of the debate.  The Minister, in his reply to the debate, did not address that question.  In my contribution, I identified a number of reasons for bringing legislation forward; among these was the difficulty in attempting the encompass a matter as complicated as this in 55 words <Col N="767" /> in a Constitution because, no matter how well drafted and chosen the words, they are inherently open to doubt and debate as to their precise meaning.  In seeking to deal with the matter solely through the Constitution we are, essentially, handing over what would otherwise be a legislative role to the courts in so far as the main decision making process in the area will be through judicial interpretation rather than through legislation.  That is not a good way to make law in any country, particularly in one which prides itself on being a parliamentary democracy.  I said I accepted that a matter of this nature &mdash; being one of life and death &mdash; was something which should be properly dealt with in the Constitution.  I accepted that it should be dealt with in the Constitution and that an amendment to the existing Article is justified because of the decision of the Supreme Court which would appear to allow suicide as a general ground for abortion.  I said that needed to be changed &mdash; and can only be changed &mdash; by constitutional amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said I accepted that, I went on to argue that if we intend to deal with the matter in the Constitution we should also deal with it by legislation, to avoid doubt. I outlined in my contribution, to which the Minister did not advert in his concluding remarks, many difficulties which might arise in defining, for example, the meaning of the term &ldquo;life&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;health&rdquo; in practical medical situations, for example, where the threat to life is not immediate but is real just the same.  There is bound to be a situation in which one medical person could argue that it is just a threat to health and another could argue that it is a threat to life.  As we know, medicine is not an exact science, if it was we would not see medical people being called quite frequently on opposite sides of court cases, some to argue that the matter is very serious and others to argue that it is less serious.  Indeed, some people make almost a profession of appearing as expert witnesses on opposite sides of cases concerning medical issues.  Quite clearly there are areas in which the guidance <Col N="768" /> of the Legislature would be extremely helpful in setting out in detail the parameters we intend or the way the terms used in the Constitution are to be interpreted.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not present in the House when I spoke, for reasons I am not going to question, and so far as I am aware he did not reply to this aspect.  It seems to me that the House has a clear obligation to set out in detail the way in which we expect this provision to be applied in practice.  Otherwise, people will vote on a subject about which there is a great deal of confusion.  The public will hear people making categoric assertions as to the meaning of the terms of the Constitution which directly contradict one another and confusion will be the result.  One group of doctors will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of doctors will say that it has another meaning; one set of lawyers will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of apparently equally eminent lawyers will say the opposite; one set of politicians will say that the wording has one meaning and another set of politicians will say that it has another meaning &mdash; but that would not cause any great surprise.  People will be surprised, though, to hear so many eminent lawyers and medical people in direct contradiction with one another.  It is my belief that as a result of the contradictions and confusion the cause that the Minister is seeking to serve will not be served.  It is very unfair to the public that there should be a debate in which people are hotly contradicting one another without anyone being in a position to arbitrate as to who is right and who is wrong, that there is debate on an issue on which the public are left to make the decision in the midst of a storm of contradiction across the airwaves.  That is another reason for my feeling that the Minister would have been well advised to introduce first legislation that would accompany any constitutional amendment he was proposing. Such legislation would have been able to go in sufficient detail into the kind of circumstances that might arise.  For example, for certain heart conditions <Col N="769" /> doctors will now have to decide whether a termination of pregnancy is necessary to save a woman'a life.  It is clearly important that guidelines be set down but that cannot be done by way of constitutional amendment because the Constitution is too short and terse a document for that.  A guideline should be set out for doctors on the way in which that decision should be made and such guidelines can be set out only in legislation. I am surprised that for that reason the Minister has not decided to introduce legislation.  Perhaps in replying to this contribution he will indicate some change of mind.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs also to address in legislation the issue of legal liability for certain decisions.  For example, a doctor might decide that a woman needs chemotherapy during the first three months of a pregnancy but some medical evidence might suggest that such treatment could lead to very severe damage to the child in the womb though the child would be born alive.  Being born alive, the child would obviously have to be cared for and the cost of care and the burdens that would have to be borne financially as well as in every other way would be great. Under such circumstances one could forsee civil court cases being taken under which one party, suing on behalf of the child, would sue either the mother's doctor or the mother herself on the grounds that if the doctor or the mother were insured, damages could be obtained, the proceeds of which would be used to support the child.  It would appear to me that such a civil case would not be decided on traditional grounds of long-established legal interpretations in relation to torts in general, damages and so forth, but would be decided on the basis of this provision of the Constitution, on the basis of whether the doctor made a decision which was justified on the grounds that he or she was dealing with a life-threatening condition.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt, Deputy.  You will have heard my earlier comments in respect to the manner in which I feel the Committee <Col N="770" /> should deal with this stage of the Bill.  I feel that much of what is being said would be more appropriate when dealing with amendments later.  Seemingly, Members feel that they may now embark on Second Reading speeches on section 1, which is a very limited section, as is section 2. Little or no regard is being had to the amendments proper, tabled by various Members and various parties of the House, on the Schedule.  I am concerned that the Committee proceed to deal with this constitutional measure in proper order.  For that reason, I ask Members to have regard to what is contained in section 1.  Let us deal with sections 1 and 2 and then get down to the nitty-gritty of the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Stage was passed <i>inter alia</i> on the basis of a statement made by the Minister, which I quoted at the outset of my speech, to the effect that the Minister would listen carefully to views expressed about whether legislation would be necessary to accompany the amendment.  It is that question that I am trying to tease out with the Minister.  I have almost finished and, though you may think otherwise Sir, I am not trying to be difficult.  This is a genuine point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the Chair is quite unconcerned as to the way in which Members may dispose of this limited time.  I am merely seeking to direct the Deputy in a certain way so that the time might be utilised to the best advantage of the House in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all want to <Col N="771" /> get the best outcome from this discussion, and it is a pity that it is being rushed.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that legislation would be helpful in dealing with the aspect I have outlined?</P>
      <P>There is a final point I should like the Minister to deal with in relation to the question of whether he will have legislation to accompany the amendment.  I speak of a possible challenge in the European Court of Human Rights to this or any other amendment.  It is my understanding that the European Court of Human Rights would be much less likely to upset a provision on an issue of this kind if it were set out in fairly robust and detailed legislation and would be much more likely to upset any decision we might make if we confined ourselves solely to 55 words in the Constitution. It seems that the more detailed are the procedures, the more liabilities are set out and the more exceptions are provided for, the less likely it is that the European Court of Human Rights would upset the decision.  The more abbreviated and terse the provision, the more likely it is that the decision would be upset.</P>
      <P>The last thing anyone in the House would want would be to labour long and hard to put in place a legal position only to discover that it was upset subsequently elsewhere.  It would seem to me that all sides of the House would recognise that factor as justifying legislation.  Therefore, I have to ask the Minister for Justice whether he has not considered that argument as a justification for providing legislation first or to accompany this amendment.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will reply to the points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some brief points on the generality of section 1 of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I feel strongly that this is the appropriate time to make those comments because I am extremely concerned that by virtue of section 1 and the course we are now adopting and will pursue, we will compound errors that have been made by this House in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="772" /> Obviously, the errors made in the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution are all too plain to see.  In fact, the views expressed in 1983 by Deputies Flynn and Woods, in particular, arguing for the insertion of Article 40.3.3º highlight the uncertainty of this issue.  The Minister should take the opportunity to address his reasons for not bringing forward legislation to give effect to our responsibilities as legislators.  In 1983 Members gave their strong views which have turned out to be totally wrong and the courts have established their incorrectness.  It is time for people to acknowledge that and admit we are embarking on a course of action that will more than likely end in a bigger mess than the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  In that respect I say to the Minister that legislation would go someway towards reducing the uncertainties that now confront us.</P>
    <P>The obligations on the House have been well detailed.  This is an extremely complex issue, one described as being so complex by a moral theologian recently as to almost defy summary.  I accept that view.  It defies summary in a constitutional amendment if we are serious about trying to provide a solution to the difficult and complex problems confronting us.</P>
    <P>The judgement of the late Mr. Justice McCarthy, which has been mentioned in this House, should be the guiding judgment to us as we undertake our responsibilities.  There are many areas of conflict and uncertainty between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health in their public comments on this issue.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, gave a different version in the Dáil than had been given a matter of days previously by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health.  Perhaps on this Stage we will get clarification of some of those uncertainties. I would say to the Minister for Health that section 1 is leading us down a path which, unfortunately, we were led down in 1983, and those Ministers played a major part in that campaign.  All the opinions and certainties expressed with conviction by the present Minister for <Col N="773" /> Justice in 1983 have been proven to be totally incorrect.  We should acknowledge that before it is too late.  I worry that by accepting section 1, and pursuing this course of action by constitutional amendment, we are creating a problem rather than solving one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, in effect, allows us to insert additional words in the Constitution which are contained in the Schedule.  I do not want to delay the House by repeating what Deputies Bruton and Spring said but it is clear from the Schedule and this section, and from what the Minister has said to the House so far, that in addressing this issue the Government's sole intent is to provide for the insertion of an amendment into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Section 1 deals with the authority to go ahead and amend the Constitution.  From this side of the House has come the message that there is a need for legislation and not simply a need for a constitutional amendment.  It would be remiss of us today if we did not remind the Minister that the need for legislation has also been acknowledged by Government colleagues. It is noteworthy in this context that when the Minister gave his response to the Second Stage debate on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bills on 21 October 1992 for some reason that I find difficult to understand, he omitted to either refer to or respond to the comments made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not want to go into those comments in any great detail but I want to refer to comments made by the Minister who is part of this Government as to the need for legislation, comments which confirm the views expressed by Deputies Bruton and Spring.  In dealing with the mere insertion of additional words into the Constitution the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, said something that all of us know to be the case but which the Minister seems to have great difficulty in acknowledging.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are plenty of lessons to be <Col N="774" /> learned from the X case.  One is that the only interpretation of words in the Constitution that counts is the view formed by the Supreme Court.  Ministers, Deputies, doctors, clerics and lawyers can in all good faith give their view of what certain words mean, but their interpretation has no standing whatever. </P>
    <P>The need for legislation is based on the fact that you cannot fully and properly address this issue by simply amending the Constitution.  A simple amendment to the Constitution, in a sense, is an abdication of legislative responsibility because we are then leaving it to members of the Supreme Court, in a particular case or cases, to tell us what those words mean.  Indeed, if any lesson should have been learned from 1983 it is that any Member of this House who stands up here and asserts, in absolute terms, what words we are proposing to insert in the Constitution mean does so at his or her peril.</P>
    <P>If we are engaging in a true dialogue in this House &mdash; and not a dialogue of the deaf &mdash; the debate last week should have brought that home.  We are not engaged in trying to score political points but rather in trying to address a serious and difficult issue and, indeed, one that is greatly confusing many people outside this House.  There have been so many disparate interpretations of the Minister's proposal that section 1 would provide for being included in the Constitution from all sides, including his own, that that of itself should ring the alarm bells.  I do not wish to make a political point out of this but it is a reality that Members on the Government side of the House, even within the Fianna Fáil Party, have expressed a degree of confusion as to what the words mean. Apparently, the Minister's speech last Tuesday was such a wonderful presentation that all of a sudden all the fog cleared at the end of it.  Clearly, the fog did not clear in the minds of his other colleagues in Government.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, again making the case for legislation, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Surely the most fundamental lesson to be learned from the X case is that hard-case exceptions do occur.  Surely this should cause us to pause and ponder the wisdom of our actions in trying to reduce the whole complex question of the balance of rights between a pregnant woman and her unborn to a single constitutional statement.</P>
    <P>Why on earth can we not consider this as a serious problem?  Why is it that apparently anything said from this side of the House in this area is to be disregarded? It is all part of a political game of macho politics between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats; who can look the longest into the other's eyeballs and who will blink first.  Is that what the game is about?  Are we truly trying to address something of great seriousness?</P>
    <P>It is very curious that the Minister refused and failed entirely to respond to what Deputy O'Malley said.  Even if the amendment was passed in its current form the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley said:</P>
    <P>No matter what the people of Ireland decide in December regarding the Twelfth Amendment on the so-called substantive issue, the Progressive Democrats believe that legislation will be essential to guide doctors in dealing with the real life cases that simply will not readily comply with the formal constitutional text now proposed.</P>
    <P>I said something similar here the day before Deputy O'Malley's speech.  Presumably, Deputy O'Malley was making this case within Cabinet and within Government.  Why is it that the Minister will not address that issue?</P>
    <P>It would be reasonable in the context of section 1, which authorises a new provision to be inserted into the Constitution, for the Minister to acknowledge that legislation is needed and to acknowledge what the Fine Gael Party are saying, that legislation should be brought before <Col N="776" /> the House and at least published prior to a referendum being held.</P>
    <P>The fact that there are, in a state of confusion, so many groups on different sides of the debate, many well-meaning people outside this House with similar concerns to ours, who have no particular axe to grind should be sufficient for the Minister to realise the need for legislation in regard to the Amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley went on to make other points which are more appropriate to the formal amendments to the Schedule and I intend to deal with them at that stage.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the House further other than to say to the Minister that there is a great need for him to clarify why he is excluding legislation and ignoring the wish of the majority of the Members of this House in that regard. The Progressive Democrats are within that majority.  It is curious that their views are not deemed worthy of any serious consideration.  We are used to Fianna Fáil members in Government ignoring what the Opposition parties say, but one would expect that they would at least take half seriously what their colleagues in Government say.  I realise that the position of the Progressive Democrats is anomalous, the aim of the Fianna Fáil Party is to shove the Progressive Democrats out of Government on this issue. That is not what this debate should be about and it is regrettable that it has reached that stage.  I hope that during the afternoon some member of the Progressive Democrats will be in the House to express their views on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  When that party were about to be formed, Deputy O'Malley made a very impressive speech describing how he was standing by the Republic. However, it appears that on this issue and on a number of other issues the Progressive Democrats, rather than standing by the Republic, are bystanders in the <Col N="777" /> Republic.  There is a serious issue in relation to this Bill which the Minister is not addressing.  That issue is relevant to section 1 and the Schedules and we deserve a more detailed response than the Government have yet given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposition made by Deputy De Rossa that section I, as proposed, should not stand part of the Bill.  It is the motor of the vehicle which the Government propose to put before the people on 3 December, the proposition they are maintaining, that the complex issue of the availability or, indeed, non-availability of abortion in Ireland or for Irish women abroad can be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Constitution and by no other device.  For that reason the proposition that section 1 should stand part of the Bill should not be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In essence, the section and the wording proposed by the Minister is built on a proposition that was inserted into the Constitution in 1983, a proposition which, in itself, was wrong in principle and was as unnecessary and as divisive then as it is today.  It is wrong to ask us to legislate in relation to such a proposition. The Government's approach to this issue has singularly destroyed whatever basis or potential for consensus there may have been both inside and outside this House and which could have been built on and acted on.  It is time we appreciated and admitted that, while there are differing degrees of opposition to abortion as a general right and facility here, it is necessary in certain circumstances.  That principle has been accepted on all sides of the House.  In proposing this legislation, the Minister admitted that there are restricted circumstances in which abortion must be made available in our jurisdiction. That arises out of the X case which illustrated that there cannot be written into any Constitution words that would absolutely guarantee against anything happening in the future &mdash; that we cannot legislate out of existence the Supreme Court, their function and role as interpreters not only of our laws but of the Constitution itself and say that, as <Col N="778" /> times change, views there will also change.</P>
    <P>The 1983 amendment was put before us on the basis that it was an absolute set of words that would guard against, first, the Supreme Court even providing an alternative opinion or, secondly, the Legislature having to act in regard to providing for abortion in Ireland in some circumstances.  Those events have now occurred and we are making a grave mistake by not recognising that there are no absolutes in this world, that there is no formula of words available to anyone, including the so-called pro-life lobby, that will provide a solution from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCarthy correctly chastised the Oireachtas for not providing legislation based on the 1983 referendum. While the Minister has produced a formula of words under section 1 of the Bill, there will be a need for legislation one way or the other after this legislation is passed.  I urge the Minister to again reflect on the Government's approach to this matter and to take note genuinely of our reservations and concerns. Even if we proceed with the wording as it is the Government should at least undertake to examine the position in the light of the legislation as passed and bring forward legislation that will put some meat on it.  The amendment is not sufficient in itself.  For those reasons and because the Government have not indicated a willingness to address the need for legislation, intending instead, to stick squarely and stubbornly to the amendment, we believe that the section should not be supported by the House.</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate one is astounded at the apparent assumption of a lack of logic and of dignity on the part of the electorate.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment which many people had grave doubts about in 1983, suffice it to quote a politician who said recently in another Parliament and about another matter, &ldquo;the sky was darkened with the chickens coming home to roost&rdquo;.  The sky has been darkened by the interpretation of the Supreme Court in regard to the Eight Amendment of the Constitution and that interpretation is of concern to anybody who worked either for or against that amendment in 1983.</P>
      <P>The most logical extension of our experience, particularly through the X case, a lesson learned through painful embarrassment, was that words cannot be inserted into a Constitution to cover such a complex and life-threatening issue.  It is not possible.  Other countries through changes in their Constitutions have learned this lesson painfully as well. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy spelled it out, not in a mild way for us as legislators, but by way of criticism that we had not legislated to back up that amendment.</P>
      <P>The 1983 amendment failed on every level, now we are trying to put a patch on a faulty amendment, but the patch will only add to the confusion and to the life-threatening aspects of this amendment if it is put before a confused electorate and voted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister even at this stage, that this is a Republic and a State we can be proud of and it represents democracy.  Democracy must start with the leadership by legislators the voters have entrusted to give leadership and legislative guidelines. That is the principal reason we were voted into this House, and I would like all Members to remember that.  What has happened?  We have been debating a wording to which every party in this House, including the Progressive Democrats but excluding Fianna Fáil, objected.  We have requested that legislation be introduced so that we <Col N="780" /> would not put to the electorate a wording that would not only lead to confusion but might lead women and men to believe the issue had not been clarified and that they did not have the right to vote on this issue because the legislators had let them down.  We have not spelled out the implications of this wording and it will take only a few years, rather than the nine years the other amendment took, for this amendment to be appealed to our courts and to the European courts.  Once again we will receive world media attention, we will be shamed and embarrassed and people will wonder how this could have happened.  We never intended this amendment to have these incredible implications.  Surely we should have learned our lesson.  It is important for us to say in fairness that in 1983 many people, out of a real concern, voted in the belief that they were voting on a serious moral issue over which they could have some control.</P>

      <P>We do not have a majority of this House supporting this amendment to the Schedule; we have a majority asking for legislation first.  The majority of voters will not be clear on this issue.  In order to assert ourselves as legislators and to do what is expected of us in this Chamber and in the Seanad, it is wrong for us to consider putting the wording and the Schedule as they now stand to the people.  Daily the Minister must meet people who tell him they are concerned and confused.  Half of the electorate are wondering not only if their health but if their lives, too, is in the balance.  This amendment is anti-democratic, it is anti-life and it is certainly anti-women.  I wish the Minister would respond seriously to that.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak briefly on this section.  The reason we did not have division on section 1 in the other Bills was that people agreed with the need to have a referendum on travel and on information.  They were quite specific on that.  I believe there is general support among the electorate for what we are doing in that regard.  However, this is an entirely different issue.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly oppose what we are doing in this Bill.  What we are doing is, I believe, dangerous and wrong.  In all the Second Stage speeches last week, we had a catalogue of women's problems. The Minister for Health referred to cardiac failure, renal failure, hyper-tension, brain tumour, breast cancer, cancer of the uterus, and I could go on if I had a medical directory or encyclopaedia with me.  We are talking about all these issues in the context of the need for an abortion, a need for us to develop new thinking, having challenged our own thinking on the issue of abortion.  However, we are trying to put cement into our Constitution, yet one more concept which will make it more difficult for people to understand what they are doing, it will make it more difficult for doctors to understand their rights and the rules govening their particular procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with an issue which involves a risk to the life and health of women.  We are not talking about introducing social abortion, abortion on demand.  We are dealing with a crucial issue.  We have had the play and the replay of all the problems that can confront a woman which can make it necessary, even essential, that termination of a pregnancy is considered.  The Constitution is the wrong place to insert such provisions.  If we have a referendum on a simple issue &mdash; say, do you want PR? <Col N="782" />&mdash; people can vote yes or no.  However, nobody knows what will happen in regard to this issue.</P>
    <P>I appeal that we turn back, suspend this Bill and bring forward legislation.  I have a cutting of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 22 October which has the heading: &ldquo;Taoiseach offers tough choice to pro-life lobby&rdquo;.  Obviously, the Taoiseach has spelt out somewhere the type of legislation he would introduce.  I see this as nothing but blackmail and a threat, but if the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice have this in mind &mdash; and obviously he has a framework he wants to introduce &mdash; it should be before this House now.  We should know what we are talking about. I strongly object to the fact that elected representatives are being treated like school children.  If legislation is likely to be introduced &mdash; I suggest that it is likely because I can see this amendment being defeated &mdash; the Minister owes it to us to say what type of legislation he has in mind and when it will be available.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to add my vioce to the appeal to the Minister to bring forward legislation which would give certainty to the words he is proposing to include in the Constitution. On many occasions constitutional interpretation is a bit like literary criticism and it is possible for legal practitioners to assess the same quantum of information and come to different conclusions.  I remember on occasion reading essays on literary criticisms where one group of students could prove that Hamlet was mad and another group could prove he was sane, while relying on the same text.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;based on exactly the same information would have no difficulty in interpreting any constitutional amendment in <Col N="783" /> different ways.  We must remember that judges are barristers by profession in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Minister is being negligent in not looking at the decisions arrived at by judges in the past and what they said when they arrived at those judgments.  I would refer him again to what Judge Walsh said in the McGee case during the middle seventies.  He said that judges had an obligation to interpret the Constitution in accordance with the Preamble and, in particular, in line with the virtues of justice, prudence and charity, which are referred to in the Preamble.  I should like to quote what Judge Walsh said:</P>
      <P>The judges, must, therefore, as best they can from their training and their experience interpret these rights in accordance with their ideas of prudence, justice and charity.  It is but natural that from time to time the prevailing ideas of these virtues may be conditioned by the passage of time; no interpretation of the Constitution is intended to be final for all time.  It is given in the light of prevailing ideas and concepts.</P>
      <P>That judgment was given in 1975.  In 1976 in the State <i>v.</i>  O'Donoghue, Chief Justice Tom O'Higgins echoed the same point. He said:</P>
      <P>In my view, this Preamble makes it clear that rights given by the Constitution must be considered in accordance with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, which may gradually change or develop as society changes and develops, and which fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with prevailing ideas.  The Preamble envisages a Constitution which can absorb or be adapted to such changes.  In other words, the Constitution did not seek to impose for all time the ideas prevalent or accepted with regard to these virtues at the time of its enactment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It absolutely follows that the Constitution is not going to be interpreted at the time of amendment purely by reference to the <Col N="784" /> ideals which prevailed at the time of the amendment, if we could even come to a consensus on what those ideals are.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the judgments I have quoted are very significant. Mr. Justice Finlay quoted these sections with approval in the X case and said he was, in effect, continuing with that school of interpretation of the Constitution when he was arriving at his conclusions. He decided it was prudent, just and charitable to lift the injunction on the girl in the X case so that she could travel.  Quite clearly, the more words that are included by way of amendment the greater the scope there is for a variance in constitutional interpretation.  I suggest to the Minister that far more words are being included here than are necessary to exclude the suicide exception, if that is his intention.</P>
    <P>One of the merits of the constitutional cases on Article 40.3.3º is that at least we now know what it means in so far as the Supreme Court is concerned.  It seems to me that if the Minister was going down the constitutional road solely he should have preserved intact what had been adjudicated and simply dealt with the suicide exception by way of amendment, if that is what he intended to take out. However, the Minister has not done that; rather he has restored the ambiguity to Article 40.3.3º which the Supreme Court had taken out in the X case.  That was extremely foolish.</P>
    <P>It is also self-evident that in the absence of legislation it is not clear now and will not be clear in the future what the words mean.  Of course, that is not the sum total of the problem.  Even if we could now establish what the words mean that is not necessarily what they will mean in five years or ten years time, as a subsequent Supreme Court interpret them in accordance with the mores of the time in line with the Preamble of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the X case was not the only constitutional adjudication on Article 40.3.3º.  There were previous cases also.  The same judges in previous cases of quite recent date &mdash; it is interesting to read the judgments &mdash; took a view <Col N="785" /> far closer to that of the proposers of Article 40.3.3º than they took in the X case.  It seems that the same judges changed their view fairly dramatically over a very short period of time about the essence of the case relating to Article 40.3.3º.  That being so, I see no reason the same or different judges could not change their view fairly dramatically again in the future.</P>
    <P>The third point I should like to make is that previous judges of the Supreme Court, particularly chief justices going back as far as the time of the late Cearbhail Ó Dalaigh, have always argued that the Constitution is an organic document, that it is not possible to rely totally on just one section of one Article for one's interpretation and, in so far as the human rights and personal rights sections are concerned, it must be taken in its totality. In drafting this amendment the Minister went to great pains to draw a distinction &mdash; for many of us this is an unreal enough distinction &mdash; between threats to life and threats to health.</P>
    <P>In interpreting the Constitution organically, there are other personal rights in it also.  For example, the Minister has quoted and waved the stick of the Bourne case in the United Kingdom at us.  He argued that he must include the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; as otherwise it would lead to a widespread abortion on demand and he quoted the British experience as a precedent.  That is not the precedent in the United States. In the Roe <i>v.</i>  Wade case in the United States the constitutional interpretation was pinned on concepts of privacy, privacy of the woman, and bodily integrity. These concepts are unenumerated rights in the Irish Constitution also and I suggest a Supreme Court in the future will not be able to rely totally on simply an interpretation of Article 40.3.3º together with this amendment but will have to go right back into the panoply of personal rights contained in the Constitution and measure one against the other.  It is not possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have two very simple points to make.  I am advocating that the Minister is foolish to proceed without having a Bill before the House to spell out his intention or, alternatively, committing himself fairly strongly to legislation as soon as the amendment is passed and giving us an idea of what the legislation would contain. I have two further points to make to support this view.</P>
      <P>Our Supreme Court has modelled itself to a considerable extent on the type of Supreme Court in the United States of America.  This is particularly so in terms of the kind of judicial extension of boundaries we have had in Ireland since the middle sixties when various Supreme Courts found a variety of unenumerated rights in the Constitution.  In accordance with this, it is relevant, as it is in America, to know who is appointed to the Supreme Court; personalities come into this.  It would be possible to predict certain types of adjudications if one were to suppose that certain people who are now loud in the Law Library were appointed to the Supreme Court in, say, ten years time. Again, it needs legislation to give any certainty; otherwise we are transferring a primary function of this House to persons unknown who will be members of the Supreme Court in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be extraordinarily macho about introducing legislation if the amendment fails on 3 December.  He has given commitments that there will be legislation to enshrine in law the decision of the Supreme Court. It seems the only reason the Minister is not bringing forward legislation arising <Col N="787" /> from today's amendment is political cowardice. He is afraid it will not get through the Oireachtas.  If that kind of modest proposal would not get through the Oireachtas to spell out in what circumstances intervention is permissible to save a mother's life, how can the Minister suggest that legislation will get through the Oireachtas which would enshrine in law the totality of the Supreme Court judgment?  We have to take it that the Minister is not being fully honest with us and that he is simply waving a stick about legislation being introduced to enshrine the Supreme Court judgment in our law. A far more modest proposal would be to spell out in legislation exactly what is meant by these words.</P>

      <P>I support a point made by Deputy Noonan.  I raised the point on Second Stage, which the Minister did not answer, as to why 49 of these 55 words are required.  The Minister made it clear in his opening speech that the sole reason for the amendment was to deal with the issue of self-destruction or suicide.  Leaving aside the question of whether or not we want to eliminate that, if it is the sole reason, on what grounds are the other 49 words included?  The logical thing would have been to draft a sentence such as &ldquo;Notwithstanding the above, a risk of self-destruction shall not be regarded as a threat to life&rdquo; or words to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When such a fundamental point is raised on the inherent self-contradiction in the amendment, the Minister ought to reply.  I am sorry he did not do so on Second Stage and I feel he should do so now.  Unless he can offer a very compelling explanation of that contradiction, there is no case whatever for the amendment to the Constitution as now drafted, even in terms of what the Minister wants to do.  On the question of whether one should or should not exclude the case of self-destruction, it is an extremely difficult issue, on which I have great difficulty in making up my own mind.  The case either way is compelling and it is very hard to know the right thing to do. <Col N="788" /> Certainly if that is the sole purpose, the Minister would need to tell us what the other 49 words are for.</P>

Most of the matters raised were dealt with on Second Stage and some were ruled out of order, in that amendment No. 1 was not in order.  Many of the matters are referred to in amendments Nos. 14 and 15.  I have no difficulty in responding to some of the items raised, but the Chair is asking me to make a Second Stage contribution or a continuation of my reply to matters raised on Second Stage.  I have no problem in doing that if it would be helpful to the House but strictly it is out of order.</P>

      <P>The Minister is telling the Chair what the Chair has already announced.  When things are done in an orderly way the end product can be better.  Perhaps we could resolve at this stage to dispense with sections 1 and 2 and deal with amendments which are in order in the Schedule.  I am advising the House what the position is.  The House is well aware of the rules in respect of Committee Stage debate.  We do not have another Second Stage debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>All of us on this side of the House appreciate your position in that you are seeeking to facilitate the House in relation to the most expeditious and fair manner in which business might be done.  Members have spoken during the past one-and-a-quarter hours on a topic which the Minister raised on Second Stage when he referred to the possibility of legislation and said he would listen to the debate and respond.  When he replied he just said that the Government are not persuaded of the case.  He did not <Col N="789" /> elaborate.  In view of the very cogent arguments put forward for legislation first, why is the Minister unwilling to have such legislation?  It is an important matter which needs to be cleared up as far as possible before proceeding to the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister will choose the points to which he wants to respond, regardless of what we or the Chair advise.  Section 1 is the basis of this whole Bill in that it proposes the amendment of Article 40.3.3º and refers to the Schedule.  I have made the case that we should reject section 1 and I would expect the Minister at least to attempt to respond by putting the opposite case.</P>

      <P>It goes a little deeper than that.  This section is being used as a vehicle for the addition of further difficult words to the Constitution.  That begs the question as to whether the Minister intends to have legislation to explain what these additional words will mean. Otherwise we will be compounding an error made in 1983.  The Minister intends to use this vehicle for further amendments to an already deficient constitutional amendment.  It has been proven to be deficient in the view of the public.  We expressed views on it but we were outvoted.  We are adding insult to injury.  Does this require legislation? The Minister said &ldquo;no&rdquo; before but he might say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; now.</P>

      <P>The Chair was not going to be so bold as to prevent the Minister from replying.  I was suggesting to the Minister that he would make his reply as brief as possible without extending the debate further.  Because the debate has been extended, we cannot entirely exclude the Minister from replying and he will reply now.  However, in respect of future comments I hope we will bear in mind that generally speaking, in the opinion of the Chair, the contributions for the past hour were not exactly in accordance with Standing Orders governing Committee Stage debate.  That is the point the Chair wanted to make.  The Minister will now reply.</P>

I cannot know whether to oppose it if the Minister does not answer the question. There must be some reason for having these words.  The Minister must have some idea in mind.

Be that as it may, we can move along and, I hope, get some kind of understanding on the matter.  Amendment No. 1 was ruled out of order, and of course it is out of order for me to refer to it now.</P>

      <P>It was raised on a couple of occasions and Deputies De Rossa and McCartan seemed to think it was an important matter on which to contribute. It is hardly being seriously suggested in the House that the people who voted by such a large majority to include Article 40.3.3º in the Constitution would be likely now, nine years later, to reverse their views and vote to remove Article 40.3.3º from the Constitution.  That prospect is not likely and, because of that, I regard the amendment as academic.  I fail to understand why it is being pursued but, be that as it may, people are entitled to comment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to a remark I made in my Second Stage contribution when I raised the question of legislation and the possibility of legislation being introduced to supplement the amendment. In responding to Deputy Bruton when winding up the debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the test proposed in the amendment was straighforward and it was based on whether termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother.  I indicated I did not think it would give rise to any difficulty in practice and that I would certainly listen to contributions made in that regard but that it did not seem to us then, nor does it seem to us now, having listened to some of the contributions that have been made with regard to the possibility of introducing legislation in advance of the amendment, that that suggestion holds water.  I gave a brief outline of my reasons for refusing that suggestion when summing up Second Stage debate.  I specifically mentioned that the amendment which the Deputies talked about would, in effect, negative the suicide aspect of the Supreme Court test for the termination of pregnancy.  Any legislation to supplement the amendment would have to take that change in the law into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to suggest that it would <Col N="793" /> be objectionable even from the legal point of view, not to talk of the general point involved, to bring legislation before the House and almost through the House in anticipation of the outcome of the decision of the people in a referendum. That would not be an appropriate thing to do or to contemplate.  It would be unusual to have legislation introduced on the assumption that something will happen, but not quite finalise it, while awaiting something to happen.  Apart from being unusual, Deputy Bruton will agree that it would seem somewhat bizarre to proceed in that fashion.  I left that aside and said I would listen to further argument to see if there was a good basis for contemplating what the Deputy had in mind.  I got alternative views even from among his own party.  Deputy Nuala Fennell expressed the view that it should be left aside entirely, that we should deal with this matter of legislation in isolation and leave the amendment until some other time.  That is not possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton did say that it would be less likely that the European Court of Human Rights would challenge the amendment if there was detailed legislation.  Whether the legislation was to be finalised before the referendum or afterwards was not quite clear, but that was his opinion.  I see no reason why the European Court of Human Rights should challenge a provision which is designed to protect women.  Whether or not there is detailed legislation in addition to the amendment does not seem to me to have any bearing on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter made comments about different things.  He said that because the interpretation of the constitutional amendment is a matter for the Supreme Court legislation is necessary to say what the interpetation of the words should be. I put it to Deputy Shatter that, whether or not legislation is enacted, the interpretation of the amdendment would still be a matter for the courts, just as the interpretation of any legislation would be a matter for the courts, and any legislation <Col N="796" /> enacted could put an interpretation on the amendment which would be binding on the Supreme Court if the court took a different view.</P>

      <P>The Minister is supposed to know.  He is supposed to be the one who will be in a position to make sure the legislation says and does what the amendment is intended to do but, because the Minister does not know what the amendment sets out to do, he cannot write the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in quite some detail on two previous occasions precisely what the amendment sets out to do but Deputy Shatter suggests that if one had legislation to give better understanding or interpretation of the words it might somehow influence the Supreme Court in some way that they might not otherwise be influenced.  I do not accept that.  The Supreme Court is the ultimate in so far as the interpretation is concerned anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we are satisfied that the interpretation does not need to be expanded upon in so far as legislation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also went into detail about comments made by other members of the Government.  I am not going to go down that road with him because, of course, he did not have the opportunity of listening to whatever, if anything, was said by the Government concerning this matter except that he should at least bear in mind and accept that the collective responsibility attached to the Government in dealing with this matter should be clearly understood by him.  On the <Col N="797" /> previous occasion it was put to the test in the House it was proved to be so, and and Deputy will find the same this afternoon.

      <P>I accept what he says &mdash; basically, that the courts, if asked in a specific case will make any interpretation they see fit.  The fact that there are disparate interpretations knocking about outside this House might be reflected upon as being different attitudes to things we have agreed upon rather than as a difference of opinion in so far as the interpretations of the words are concerned.  That is a different matter and we have seen some element of that this afternoon.  The arguments of some people who are opposing certain elements of this legislation bear no relationship with the understanding I know is coming from the Opposition side of the House.  We heard a good instance of it this afternoon.  There are certain individuals in the House who do not want this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am saying that a different point if view has been expressed by Deputy McCartan and others in this House and it is that we should not be here discussing this matter at all, that there should be no amendment put to the Irish people on 3 December and that the only thing we should be doing is removing what is already there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I understood it we all accepted that Article 40.3.3º should stay in the Constitution in that it sets out to guarantee the right to life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother.  I understand that is something we all subscribe to.  However, it has been indicated that that is not being subscribed to with as good a will and so collective an understanding by certain Deputies.  I regret that that is the way it is but at least today, unlike on Second Stage, we are getting the true position of a certain Deputy or Deputies on the whole question of abortion and the introduction of abortion services into this country.</P>

      <P>I raised that.  Deputy Shatter had not as many supporting him on the previous occasion when this matter was raised by me and I heard shouts from the side asking me to name people.  It was necessary to name them then because I knew that, as sure as day follows night, when the time came they would put their marker down.  They have done so today so that at least those outside have a good idea how Deputies McCartan and De Rossa view this matter.  I presume that what Deputy Shatter says &mdash; and I must <Col N="799" /> be careful how I phrase this &mdash; represents what some of the other Deputies in Democrat Left feel on this matter.

      <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the need for democracy in these matters and made the point that voters look to the legislators to give leadership but it occurred to me as she spoke in this vein that voters were quite specific in 1983.  It was their wish that the legislators would act in a certain way.  They also made it quite clear in the way they addressed the 1983 amendment that they did not wish to see any changes made without the matter being first referred back to them. I would have thought that everybody would have concluded that what we were doing in referring the amendment back to the public was precisely in accordance with their wish expressed in the 1983 referendum.  I take it that the Deputy shares this view.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made the point that the electorate should not be confused in these matters and I think that was a fair comment.  When I replied to the debate on Second Stage I said that I would not be able to respond to every single question raised.  I am sorry that I did not respond to the points raised by Deputy FitzGerald and I will attempt to do so now.  I answered as many of the basic questions as possible in the short time available to me and thought I did so rather well.  Indeed, some of the Deputies on the other side of the House suggested to me afterwards that I had made a decent effort to respond to the points made in the limited time avilable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes is right when she says the electorate should not be confused. However, I do not think they are confused in relation to what we want to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as is the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution as well.  I think the public want to see the Supreme Court test retained in all circumstances apart from suicide.  If comments made outside the House are to be taken into account, they do not want suicide to be regarded as a ground for termination. They want to see some protection for pregnant women, which is one of the <Col N="804" /> fundamental aims of the amendment and they want them to be entitled to receive whatever treatment is necessary where there is a substantial risk to their life. They want to see this right enshrined in the Constitution.  They want to see Article 40.3.3º retained in so far as the right to life of the unborn is concerned, with the mother having an equal right to life.  The public know exactly what they want and it is our contention that the wording will ensure this neatly.  I am pleased to learn today that some of the senior people who commented on this matter on a previous occasion now feel that we have got it right in that regard.  I sincerely hope that the House will also accept this before the end of the day.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to what Deputy Fennell said in relation to the proposal that the referendum should be cancelled. I do not think I should say anything further except that I believe Deputy Fennell is wrong in that regard although she expressed it in a fervent way.  I suggest that the amendment should be disposed of along with the other two referenda on 3 December and that that is the best way to proceed.  This is no more than what the general public expect of us.  The Government proposal that the referenda on the right to travel and information as well as on the substantive issue should be held on 3 December has received a warm welcome.  It is my understanding that the vast majority of Deputies who represent the vast majority of the people of this country also share this opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan spent some time in dealing with a previous judgment handed down by Mr. Justice Walsh in which he stated that no interpretation of the Constitution can be final for all time.  I suppose that is true and I see nothing wrong with that.  Deputy Noonan also made the point that times change and that the questions of prudence, charity and justice would apply in the judgements given by judges at various times.  Indeed, I thought he was making the case for me at one stage.  We are trying to clear up whatever ambiguities might have arisen, in so far as the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution is concerned, from the Supreme <Col N="805" /> Court interpretation that suicide could be regarded as a ground for the termination of pregnancy where there is a substantial risk to the life of the mother. However, they set out the test clearly.</P>
    <P>It would be fair to say that no one foresaw the Supreme Court judgment of 5 March this year but, as I said, they set out in some detail the test to be applied. As I have quoted this test on a couple of previous occasions it is not necessary for me to do so again.  They made it possible for us, in regard to the language used in the judgement handed down in the X case, to frame an amendment to deal with the matter referred to by Deputy Noonan.  It was for that reason that the language used in the amendment was chosen.  In using the language used in the Supreme Court judgment I put it to the House that it is not now necessary to do what Deputy Bruton suggested.  I have not heard any good argument which would convince me otherwise, but that does not mean that the matter is finished even today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan went further about the possibility of the amendment failing.  I do not contemplate that.  I think the vast majority of people will see precisely what was intended here.  I predict that any element of confusion &mdash; to which people have referred &mdash; about understanding can be cleared up between now and the date of the referendum.  It is my hope there will be a resounding understanding by way of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on the part of the electorate.</P>
    <P>Taking a hypothetical case of the electorate deciding to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, I say to Deputies Barnes and Noonan one would have very little alternative except to take that as a clear indication they wanted the matter attended to other than by seeking to change the Supreme Court judgement of 5 March last.  We are saying we want to take out suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy.  If the electorate said &ldquo;no&rdquo; in those circumstances they would be saying to us &ldquo;no, we do not want that&rdquo;.  Obviously the implication of the alternative is that, in some circumstance, termination of pregnancy must be permitted. That would require legislation; I accept that.  I would regret it but it would <Col N="806" /> be the will of the people and would have to be attended to in that fashion.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I contend that was a very fair thing to say rather than leave some people in some kind of limbo, asking what will happen if there is a rejection of the referendum proposal or if it is not endorsed by the people on 3 December next.  That was the reason that was said in that way.  I think many people thought it was a very fair comment to make because, in those circumstances, the people would have been turning their backs on what we were asking them to do, asking us to accept the full thrust of the Supreme Court judgment which allowed for abortion in certain circumstances in this country.  We do not want that and we are asking the people to support us in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald maintains the amendment should simply confine itself to saying that self-destruction should not be a ground for termination of pregnancy. I might point out that the present amendment does three things.  It enshrines the Supreme Court decision except, of course, in the case of proposed self-destruction; Deputy FitzGerald is quite right there.  It excluded self-destruction and, by using the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; ensures that in the future health could not become a ground for termination of pregnancy.  That was specifically using Supreme Court language in order to prevent abortion being introduced into this country by some other means, as has happened in other jurisdictions, thereby creating circumstances in which there would be widespread abortion available.  We did not want that.</P>
    <P>Somebody said to me that sounded harsh.  I replied that we looked at a whole range of words that could have accommodated the same thing in another way. However, it reverted to the simple fact that if one is to do it effectively one must use the Supreme Court language itself, so that whatever interpretation there has been already more than likely will withstand the test of time in so far as the language used would be the same.  That was the reason for that.  It is being used <Col N="807" /> only to ensure that abortion cannot be introduced into our jurisdiction on some other ground, some other day.  We wanted to prevent what Deputy Shatter referred to, the possibility of another referendum in a couple of short years.</P>
    <P>We were seeking also to endeavour to put in place circumstances in which matters would not be referred to the Supreme Court if at all possible but, of course, as we have all said, anybody can take a case; we are all agreed on that. However, the use of the language, as in this amendment, we think overcomes the matters raised by the individuals concerned. Certainly it will never overcome the matters raised by Deputies McCartan and De Rossa.  We are quite happy in saying that.  By and large, that is my answer which I recognise refers to other amendments tabled.</P>
    <P>Deputies have contended that the amendment might be open to different interpretations by the courts.  I should like to revert to that matter in so far as Deputy Shatter's contribution was concerned. What Deputies seem to forget in that regard is that the amendment is based in every single respect, except self-destruction, on the test set out by the Supreme Court.  I should like people to remember that because it is the basis of the whole argument that has been going on here, the decision in the X case. Therefore, I believe there is little basis for suggesting that the amendment would be interpreted in any other way.  I have nothing more to say except that I would oppose amendment No.1 tabled by the Democratic Left.  The other matters raised substantially by Deputy Bruton and added to in different ways by others have been answered reasonably.</P>
    <P>We should hold the referendum, have it positively endorsed and I predict it will work without hindrance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister sought, with characteristic mischievousness, to seek to represent the position of the Fine Gael Party on this matter inaccurately and misleadingly.  As he knows, our position is that the House should not consider <Col N="808" /> this amendment of the Constitution until 15 January next by which time the Government should have produced the legislation we believe to be necessary to underpin and explain it, and have that discussed here before we are asked to consider the amendment of the Constitution. It is our view that in that event we would have a much less acrimonious and a more informed debate.  I hope the Minister has read me clearly in what I have just said and does not seek to make any attempt to reinterpret that position.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the Minister missed a few points when replying.  The first point he missed was the fact that the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy in the Supreme Court &mdash; and the Minister has been quoting the Supreme Court here frequently in support of his position &mdash; specifically criticised the Legislature for having failed to bring forward legislation to underpin the existing amendment of the Constitution.  Now we are proposing to bring in another amendment of the Constitution supplementing that and are still not going to produce the legislation. Yet, the Minister is quoting the Supreme Court language to justify his wording.  Of course, he failed to cite the quotation of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy which is very relevant, when he excoriated this Legislature in terms I have rarely heard, in perhaps the most extreme criticism of this House from the Bench since the two institutions came into being.  I refer to the criticism of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy of this House and successive Governments since 1983 for failing to introduce that legislation.  For us to carry on this debate, ignoring that statement of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy, is unreal in that he made it quite clear that they, the Supreme Court, wanted to intepret the Constitution on the basis of legislation also to supplement, explain and deal with the particular aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy went on to say that as far as abortion was concerned the Legislature had two responsibilities &mdash; a negative responsibility to prohibit abortion in circumstances in which it should be prohibited but also a positive responsibility <Col N="809" /> to create conditions in which people would not find themselves having to consider that option.  He made it very clear he believed that legislation should be introduced to deal with both the positive and negative responsibilities of the Legislature. He criticised us in particular for having failed to introduce legislation to deal with the positive aspect of creating social conditions and so on whereby people would not find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to me to have failed to address two other points both now and on Second Stage as to why legislation should be introduced.  The first point to which he failed to reply was the question of legal liabilities in the event of disputed decisions after the event.  For example, would the civil cases that might arise not be likely to be determined on the basis not of existing, well established legal practice, but on the basis of an interpretation of this new wording in the Constitution?  If such were the case, to avoid unnecessary litigation and uncertainty, rather than wait for case law to determine what is &ldquo;health&rdquo;, what is &ldquo;life&rdquo; and so on, surely we should sort out those things in legislation before enshrining them in the Constitution.  Will the Minister deal with that point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not do so.  Earlier I made the point I did not want circumstances to arise where there would be repetition of what had been ruled out of order.  I would advise the House that we have before us an order which requires us to finish at 6.45 p.m.  As there are 15 Committee Stage amendments, 13 of which are in order, in deference to Deputies we should resolve to get away from what is out of order and not be perpetuating disorders in this fashion.  I ask Deputy Bruton to accept that so that we can proceed in the fashion that obtained in respect of discussion on every Amendment of the Constitution.  The question will be put presently &ldquo;That the Schedule stand part of the Bill&rdquo;, and a further question will be put &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.  It is most disorderly to accept <Col N="810" /> what occurred earlier as the base on which to operate.  We all know that is not in order.</P>

      <P>I would hate to find myself in the position of being in conflict with you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in a matter of this nature.  There is no need for a Schedule if we are not going to have an amendment to the Constitution at this juncture.  What we are deciding in section 1 is the issue of whether at this time we need an amendment.  It is my contention that we need legislation first, to be followed by an amendment which would be influenced by the debate on the legislation.</P>
      <P>There are two other points in favour of legislation.  First is the issue of conscientious objectors.  In the family planning legislation of 1979 there is specific provision for conscientious objectors.  It may be that under the proposed Amendment of the Constitution medical people will object even to performing the operations in the limited circumstances set out here.  It seems that provision must be made for those conscientious objectors and for people who might have to rely on them for life saving operations.  If it was necessary to make such provisions in legislation in 1979 in regard to family planning, which is a much less fraught and contentious matter, surely similar legislation is needed to deal with conscientious objectors in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should look at Article 27 of the Constitution which provides for legislation to be referred to the people. He made much of his argument which was an interpretation of what the people decided in 1983.  He stated that the people said they wanted every such alteration to be subsequently referred to them.  Just as people have great difficulty interpreting what the Danish people meant when they voted no to the Maasstricht Treaty, anybody who attempts to say what the people meant when they voted a particular way in a referendum is engaging in a fools' argument.  Even taking that assumption as valid, it seems the Minister should look at Article 27 of <Col N="811" /> the Constitution which allows for Bills to be referred to the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to misunderstand Deputy Noonan's contribution.  He seemed to think Deputy Noonan was arguing in favour of having a constitutional amendment first.  As I understand it, what Deputy Noonan said was that if you rely solely on constitutional provisions, because of the way judicial interpretation changes over time and is, influenced by the atmosphere of the times, you will never achieve certainty, and that you are much more likely to achieve certainty through legislation, accompanied perhaps by a constitutional amendment.  Legislation, because it deals with matters in greater detail and with all possible eventualities and circumstances that might arise, is much more likely to create certainty and predictability in certain cases than would 55 words in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan elaborated on why legislation is necessary in view of the fact that in the interpretation of the 1983 Amendment the approach of the Judiciary changed in the period between 1983 and 1992.  The emphasis of the decision changed significantly even in that short period.  If the Minister wants certainty and the entrenchment of particular concepts he would be much more likely to achieve that by legislation, perhaps underpinned by a constitutional amendment than by a constitutional amendment alone.</P>
    <P>I fail, therefore, to understand the Minister's insistence on this 55 word solution. Far from achieving the objectives he is seeking, he will, as he and others did in 1983, achieve the direct opposite. It behoves the Minister to take seriously the points made on this side of the House. They are not being made simply as debating points; they have validity.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that even today he is open to argument about legislation being introduced to accompany this Amendment, and I have given him a few examples of where legislation will be patently necessary &mdash; in the case of conscientious objectors, legal liabilities, <Col N="812" /> procedures for determining disputes about medical treatments in hospitals and so on.  The Minister has simply asserted that the European Court of Human Rights would be as willing to accept 55 words in the Constitution alone as it would to accept 55 words in the Constitution underpinned by legislation.  My information &mdash; and I have good information &mdash; is that the European Court of Human Rights, from past performance in cases in other countries, would be much more likely to uphold a provision in the law of a member state if that was underpinned in detailed legislation which provides for determining disputes and deals with the position of minorities and people who may feel oppressed by a particular decision.  The European Court of Human Rights would be much more likely to accept that position than it would a simple blanket provision of 55 words in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is seeking, as I believe he is, certainty and predictability he should not rely on these 55 words alone because of the risk of them being overturned by the European Convention on Human Rights.  That risk could be avoided by underpinning the constitutional amendment by legislation which would be discussed here first.  The arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of introducing legislation first, and I hope the Minister will reflect further on this subject in the light of what has been said here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to two points made by the Minister. Although the Minister, towards the end of his speech, left a door open, he was dismissive of the need for legislation.  He said that the constitutional words are clear and straighforward.  He used a form of wording that is apparently a mantra to be recited by members of the Fianna Fáil Party whenever this issue comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have researched all the debates that took place in 1983 and the Minister was one of the main proponents of the wording which is now in the Constitution.  He and Deputy O'Hanlon, who was Health <Col N="813" /> spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, recited the same mantra.  At column 469, volume 340 of the Official Report of 17 February 1983, after Members of the Fine Gael Party put on the record of the House reservations about the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, Deputy O'Hanlon said: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil believe the wording we put forward is correct and nothing that has been said has convinced us that we should alter that view&rdquo;.  That is a sentence I heard churned out in the Dáil last week on Second Stage and the Minister told us again today that nothing he has heard indicates that he should alter his view.  If I were Minister I would be a little more timorous in my approach to this matter.  I would drop the theatrical self-righteous indignation he engaged in at the beginning of his response to Members on this side of the House in the light of his record and that of his colleague in getting this issue utterly and totally wrong in the area of constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the specific issue of legislation, the Minister said that &ldquo;publication of legislation would be objectionable because of the constitutional position.&rdquo;  In other words, we could not possibly publish legislation based on an amendment to the Constitution because the existing legislation could be unconstitutional. The Minister said it would be a most unusual stance to take to publish such legislation.</P>
    <P>Indeed he went on to say that it would be &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; to publish legislation based on a change in the Constitution.  I scratched my head when I heard that because the remark came from the same Minister who, approximately ten days before publication of the three Bills, including the Bill we are debating, published a paper on marital breakdown. What did it contain?  It contained a suggestion that we might amend the Constitution in the area of divorce with five possible constitutional Articles, none of which has yet been put to the people, none of which forms any legislation in front of the House and none of which will be dealt with in a referendum during the lifetime of this Government.  But what <Col N="814" /> did we find in this document?  The Government's proposed legislation to provide for divorce if the Constitution was changed.  Apparently what is &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; in addressing this area is the norm in addressing another area; if it is acceptable and usual to publish a proposed divorce Bill in the context of the legislation the Government might introduce if the prohibition on divorce was removed from the Constitution, what makes it bizarre to introduce and publish legislation that the Government might &mdash; and indeed should &mdash; introduce if this amendment, or a modified form of it, was made to the Constitution?</P>

      <P>Can we please come back to section 1?  It now seems to the Chair that Members are speaking with little or no regard to section 1.  They are making general statements, Second Stage speeches and generalising.  I should like Members to return to the Committee Stage procedures.  We should dispose of section 1 as it is irrelevant to what is being said.  The same applies to section 2 and we could then get down to the main business of the amendments to the Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is relevant because, as the previous speaker, Deputy John Bruton, indicated, it is the section which triggers the holding of a referendum in the context of these words going into the Constitution.  Members on this side of the House have made it clear that legislation is needed in advance of this trigger being pulled.  This trigger has already exploded as a result of the Minister getting things extremely, extraordinarily and bizarrely wrong in 1983. Apparently he is willing to put his finger to the trigger again and make it explode without providing the details of necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to the case being made that section 1 should not <Col N="815" /> proceed without legislation, asked what way such legislation would influence the Supreme Court in interpreting the Article.  The Minister should be aware that there is a plethora of Supreme Court decisions in relation to legislation which has been tested against the contents of the Constitution.  In that context, in any legislation published after 1937 the Supreme Court start on the premise that the legislation has a presumption of constitutionality. In so far as this Article' provides the skeleton of principle to be applied in dealing with situations which affect the lives of mothers, women and indeed unborn children, detailed legislation would provide a comprehensive substance to the application and implementation of the Article.  If such legislation was put in place it would be a starting point for the Supreme Court in applying these provisions and they would only set it aside if it was unconstitutional. You cannot divorce the need for legislation from the enactment of an Article. If this provision, like that of 1983, causes so much confusion and is open to so many disparate interpretations, the lesson of 1983 should be that we need legislation in this area if we are to have another referendum on this issue.  It is not satisfactory for the Minister to tell us that there is less confusion outside today than there was a week ago; he has merely to pick up his newspaper to see the totally contradictory pronouncements by a variety of people who approach this issue from different angles, all from an interpretation they have taken from the 55 words.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, you &mdash; or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; asked why we raise this issue in the context of section 1.  We are doing so because, if we do not get a satisfactory response from the Minister, we will vote against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend my remarks to be relevant to section 1 and I hope, Sir, not to be in conflict with you.  I will endeavour not to be.  However, as Deputy Shatter said, this is the trigger section which provides basically for two things.  It says: &ldquo;Article 40.3 of the Constitution is hereby amended&rdquo;.  It sets out to amend the Constitution and it goes on to provide that it will be amended as provided for in the Schedule.  Deputy John Bruton pointed out why we believe that is the wrong procedure and why we should not have the words in the Schedule &mdash; or indeed any other words &mdash; without first enacting legislation.</P>
      <P>I should like to dwell for a moment or two on why I believe it is wrong to provide that the Constitution should be amended, as the first part of this section sets out.  Deputy Shatter referred to the lessons of the Eighth Amendment but the Minister and the Government do not seem to have referred to anything that happened in 1983.  Those of us involved in the debate in 1983 will have a very clear memory of the fact that the proposal for amending the Constitution at that stage rested on a very simple proposition, that neither politicians nor the courts are to be trusted.  I am afraid that some people may read the X case as being a vindication of that suspicion but, of course, they would be totally wrong because, what most of those critics seem to forget &mdash; and what most of those who claimed in 1983 that the courts could not be trusted seem to forget &mdash; is that our Constitution expressly provides that the Supreme Court are the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.  They are not the final framer of the Constitution, that is for the people, but they are the ultimate interpreter and if we put words into our Constitution no Member of this House can say to the people with 100 per cent assurance what those words mean. We cannot do that because, in the event that somebody with a proper <i>local standi</i> in the issues takes a different view, the matter must be referred to the Supreme Court; the Constitution will mean what the Supreme Court say it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard colleagues of the Minister <Col N="817" /> for Justice &mdash; and others on the Government side of the House &mdash; say, wisely, as we were passing legislation through this House, that it did not matter what we said because the courts would not read the record of our proceedings and would not be bound by any meaning we might state here.  That may well have been true and wise but it is a much more apposite comment in the case of an amendment to the Constitution.  It is futile for the Minister for Justice to come into the House to say that he is satisfied beyond a shadow of a doubt that the meaning of these words is what he says it is &mdash; rather than maybe what the Minister for Health said the previous night &mdash; and that there can never be any dispute about it.  The nine years which have passed since 1983 have surely given us all ample reason to understand that such assurances cannot be given.  I am not casting doubt on the sincerity of the Minister's intentions, all I am saying is that the record and the constitutional reality show that we cannot accept an assurance of that kind from the Minister, even without including any intent on his part to mislead us.  He cannot give such an assurance.  At the end of the day we have no option but to trust the Supreme Court because that is what our Constitution provides.  Of course, there is always the option if we disagree with a decision the Supreme Court has made, as many people do in this instance, to consider changing the Constitution.  But, again, the lesson of 1983 and the Eighth Amendment should be that we proceed with great care because we are not the Supreme Court, we are not the final interpreters any more than the people are the final interpreters. The route of a constitutional modification should be taken only if we are very clear in our minds what we want to do and why we want to do it.  I do not think the Government are very clear in their collective mind &mdash; if such still exists today &mdash; on what they want to do and why they want to do it.</P>
    <P>The other basis for the proposal to have a constitutional amendment in 1983, and the reason we are having this debate today, was that politicians are <Col N="818" /> not to be trusted.  There was a feeling that there was some movement of opinion in the House that the proponents of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution did not like.</P>
    <P>Those people should remember why we elect Members of this House.  We elect Members because in a democracy &mdash; even one as small as ours with 3.5 million people &mdash; it is hardly practical to have everyone involved all the time in making the decisions.  We delegate people to make decisions on our behalf, hence, the word &ldquo;Teachta.&rdquo; It also has the advantage that because Members are relatively near the electorate and they have to come back to the people at least once very five years &mdash; it happens a little more often than that &mdash; they can be held accountable for what they do.  If this House were to do something that was utterly repugnant to the majority of people, the people have a remedy.  They could put other people in place of any or all of the 166 Deputies.</P>
    <P>The basic motivation of the people who proposed the original amendment that got us into all this trouble was highly suspect, both constitutionally and in the logic of their position.  They should remember &mdash; and it would do a number of them no harm to remember now &mdash; that another advantage of having issues of this kind dealt with by the normal process of the Houses of the Oireachtas, through legislation, is that it is easier to change legislation if it appears there is a flaw in it than it is to change the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for legislation. I have had many discussions in the past nine years, and particularly in the past couple of months, with people who, like the Minister, say that the Supreme Court decision in the X case went against what people thought they were voting for when they voted for the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution in 1983.  Such people keep coming naively back to the proposition that there must be some simple form of words that we could put into the Constitution to do what we think and the Minister thinks he is setting out to do. <Col N="819" /> The more we try, the more it becomes evident that it is not possible to do that.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Justice would have been one of the people to say, perhaps six or nine months ago, if the question had been put to him, that there must be a simple way of resolving this matter by putting a few words into the Constitution. The Schedule proposes the addition of 55 words.  The Minister for Justice has a different view from that of the Minister for Health on what those words mean; both Ministers have a different view from that of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce does not believe any of them.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to be facetious and I am not accusing any one Member of insincerity &mdash; stupidity maybe but not insincerity.  It is very clear that the Government, even having gone to the trouble of trying to put a clear amendment into the Constitution, have failed. The reason they have failed is that the issues they are dealing with are very complex. Those issues cannot be described or provided for in a text that is not itself complex.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the parallel is exact, but I defy any Member, no matter how well qualified technically and no matter how gifted linguistically, to describe without the use of a diagram the working of a differential gear in the driving axle of a car.  That is a very straightforward mechanical process, but it cannot be described in simple words because the issue involved cannot be dealt with in that way.</P>
    <P>When we add to this particular issue, which is much more complex, the fact that our understanding of the human person and of the human body continues to expand and that medical practice and medical treatments keep advancing &mdash; things are possible now that were not even dreamt of 20 years ago, and that will continue &mdash; it must be clear to any reasonable person that one cannot safely do what the Government seem to want to do, by the wording, complex as it is, in the Schedule.  The Government are <Col N="820" /> engaged in an enterprise that is bound to fail.</P>
    <P>I have heard assurances from different Ministers and from other people in the past couple of weeks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Please, Deputy Dukes.  We are making no progress on this Bill.  We are getting bogged down on section 1.  We are hearing Second Stage speeches, generalising, and we are getting nowhere.  As far as the Chair is concerned, the procedure is wrong.  I have consistently appealed to Members to work with me in getting to the nitty-gritty of the issues and the amendments before us, but Members are not prepared to play the game.  Are we or are we not going to get away from sections 1 and 2 and discuss the amendments?</P>
      <P>The Chair hesitates to intervene in this way, especially on the Committee Stage of a Bill to which is applied a rigid time limit.  It is for Members to decide how they should utilise that short, precious time and it should not be a function of the Chair to put pressure on Members.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about the clear violation of the Committee Stage procedure which is going on here today.  It is a clear violation of all I have learnt in respect of dealing with the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I ask Members to finalise this section and the section thereafter, to which no amendments are tabled, and let us move to the Schedule, to which all of the amendments apply.</P>
      <P>I ask for co-operation in dealing with these matters as the House knows they should be dealt with.  Deputy Dukes and so many others have long experience in this House and know how to deal with a Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I understand your concerns, Sir, and if I speak quietly it is because I do not want to be argumentative. However, my remarks are addressed to the two issues: One, that the Constitution is hereby amended by the addition of the words in section 1 (a) and (b), and, two, by the Schedule to the Bill.  I am trying to point out why I disagree with the proposition that the Constitution be hereby amended without first &mdash; as Deputy Bruton has proposed &mdash; having legislation to clarify the issues. The issues are too complex and too important to too many people to be dealt with by way of a constitutional amendment as proposed here.  I suggest that the example we have of the last constitutional amendment to deal with the issues covered in this Bill amply demonstrates why that particular approach is so unwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come to another reflection, if I may.  The Minister has relied several times, during the course of this afternoon's debate, on the assertion that people will see what is intended.  We have had discussion about why the Minister believes that what he is proposing in this Bill is needed in order to give effect to what people intended in 1983.  What I am saying is that, given the delicacy and the complexity of these issues, it is not enough to say to people that they know what he intends and that we know what the people intend &mdash; which ever way they vote &mdash; in order to be satisfied that the issue is dealt with.  The experience of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution shows that in the final analysis it matters not a great deal what people thought they intended when they were voting for the text; what matters at the end of the day is what the Supreme Court says that amendment of the Constitution means, and it is not enough for the Minister to continue to assure us.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the Minister illustrated just how fraught with danger this kind of assertion is when he stood up a few minutes ago and started to speculate as to how we might interpret what he calls the hypothetical case of a negative vote on this referendum.  If people were to vote No to this text on 3 December how would we interpret that?  Would that mean that they objected to the insulting words &ldquo;as distinct from the health of the mother&rdquo; that are being used?  Would it mean they were in disagreement with what the Minister is proposing about an inclination to self-destruction?  Or would it mean that people did not want to see abortion under any circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Or would it mean there were certain medical treatments with which people disagreed?  Or would it simply mean that people had got so fed up with the confusion and the nonsense that has taken place on the Government side for the past couple of weeks that they just said, a plague on all your houses, we will not <Col N="823" /> have anything to do with any of this?  I do not know whether anybody could interpret or read it.  I certainly would not be able to do so.  If this matter is put to the people on 3 December &mdash; and the Minister has given no explanation why we must have it on 3 December &mdash; and they vote No, as I would hope they would vote if this is the text and all we have before us, I would not be able to come into this House on the following day or even the following year after studying it all and give an indication with any certainty as to why people had voted No any more than anybody is able to tell me today why people voted Yes in 1983 or what they had in mind then when they voted Yes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, and I have deliberately refrained from being provocative, to reflect on those things again, if having been one of those &mdash; and he was in very wide company in 1983, some of it very august and sanctified &mdash; who advised people solemnly in 1983 that if they voted Yes to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, abortion could never happen in this country and now having found that given our constitutional procedures &mdash; of which I suppose he is a defender and good republican &mdash; and having lived through that experience, he has not come to the conclusion that with the best will in the world it is not open to him to give people the kind of assurances he has given them for the past few weeks and that it would, therefore, be prudent to deal with the details of this matter legislatively before we go any further with a referendum on this issue, the subject of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. G. FitzGerald Dr. G. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. G. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A net point arising from section 1 is whether the section is desirable.  The Minister's justification for 49 of the 55 words in the section was that they were replicating what the Supreme Court had said.  First of all, if he were replicating what the Supreme Court said, it would be a work of supererogation because, they having said it, it is in fact the constitutional position, and putting it in the Constitution would do no good at <Col N="824" /> all.  Secondly, he is not doing that, he is taking the exact words of one judge and not using them.  I do not know how he can say he is using them.  The words the judge used were:</P>
      <P>... if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, that such termination is permissible ....</P>
      <P>The wording here is quite different, &ldquo;unless such termination is necessary to save the life&rdquo;&mdash; words which the judge did not use &mdash;&ldquo;where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, it shall be unlawful to terminate the life&rdquo;. If he wanted to replicate the judgment, which would be unnecessary anyway, what he should have said in this wording was: &ldquo;it shall be lawful to terminate the life of an unborn if it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health of the mother, which can be avoided only by the termination of her pregnancy&rdquo;.  He has not done that. Incidentally, I have to say that Mr. Justice Finlay put the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in the wrong place.  Had I indeed been replicating his judgment I would have had a grammatical difficulty because he should have said &ldquo;which can be avoided only by the termination of her pregnancy&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;only be avoided&rdquo; are not logical.</P>
      <P>I would not have argued if the Minister had tampered with the judge's decision to the extent of shifting the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;, but when he changes it around completely and makes it unlawful instead of lawful and introduces words such as &ldquo;save&rdquo; and &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; which the judge did not use and when he takes a statement by one judge and says it is a Supreme Court judgment and justifies the amendment by saying he wants to incorporate that wording in the Constitution and then does not do so, but introduces fresh ambiguities with new words, he knows he is talking nonsense.  He has in no way justified these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The only thing he could possibly justify is what he said on Second Stage that he disagrees on the suicide issue.  It is a point of view; you can accept it or not accept it.  Having disagreed on that he would be entitled to bring before the House the last few words and have a wording &ldquo;notwithstanding the above, a risk of self-destruction shall not be regarded as a threat to life&rdquo;.  We could have debated that here, some might be for it and some might be against and the House could have decided it.  What the House must not do is to incorporate, as a result of section 1, wording which is not wording used by any judge, under the guise of <Col N="826" /> being the Supreme Court judgment, and introduce fresh ambiguities which will have to be interpreted by the Supreme Court eventually, and we have no idea what that interpretation will be.  To do that would be unwise and absurd and the Minister has given no possible grounds for it.  I cannot see how anybody in this House, on the basis of his arguments, could possibly support this amendment.</P>

      <P>There are a number of amendments in the names of Deputies De Rossa, Mac Giolla, Spring, Howlin and others.  I note that many of these amendments are related.  Amendment No. 3 is an alternative amendment to No. 2.  Amendments Nos. 5 to 12, inclusive, are alternatives to amendment No. 3.  Therefore, I suggest we debate amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 5 to 12, inclusive, together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  That leaves three amendments to be dealt with at a later stage in the names of Deputies Spring and Howlin, De Rossa, Sherlock, McCartan and others.</P>

    <P Just="Center">PART II</P>
    <P>Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to replace the Government's wording with a new formulation.  We have just seen by way of vote that the Government insist they want to proceed with a referendum.  I argued on section 1 that if we were to have a referendum it should be to delete Article 40.3.3º., the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, and thereby revert to the pre-1983 situation and leave this House free to deal with the question of abortion in Ireland in a way the legislators, elected by the people, would find acceptable and would have to defend to their constituents at a future date.  That approach has been rejected by the Minister on the basis that he regarded it as an academic approach.  I fail to see how the Minister could define it as such, but it has been rejected.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the Minister accepting that approach I and my colleagues in Democratic Left submit that the wording which the Minister is proposing should be deleted and substituted by the wording of our amendment.  It is a positive expression of what might be done in the event of this House legislating for abortion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> The amendment states:</P>
    <P>Subsection 3º of this section shall not limit freedom to provide or obtain, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, termination of a pregnancy in order to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman. </P>
    <P>Our amendment would be in addition to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and should be read in tandem with the statement therein that the foetus and the woman carrying the foetus have an equal right to life.  The Supreme Court has already defined that section of the Constitution as in certain circumstances giving the woman's right to life precedence over that of the foetus.</P>
    <P>The wording I am suggesting eliminates the proposal by the Minister and his Government that anything outside the conditions proposed in his amendment would be unlawful and, therefore, a criminal act.  In a later amendment we propose that the reference to unlawful should be deleted.  To include this reference in the Constitution is quite an extraordinary approach not only to this issue but to our Constitution.  Nowhere else in the Constitution do we declare anything to be unlawful.  We leave it to the Houses of the Oireachtas to make laws and decide what is lawful and unlawful. The Constitution generally states principles on which our laws should be based.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that approximately 5,000 women per year, or at least a large proportion of them, in effect would be criminalised as a result of the passing of the amendment as proposed by the Government.  The majority of those who go to Britain, as I understand the analysis of the statistics, go there not because of a direct physical threat to their lives but for in my view other legitimate reasons. Nevertheless, they would be involved in a criminal act by having an abortion for reasons other than a direct physical threat to their lives if we adopt the Government's amendment.  Our amendment also seeks to provide that the termination of pregnancy would be permissible in <Col N="831" /> order to protect the life or the health of the woman.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that much of the remaining time in this debate will be devoted to discussing how the Government expect it might be possible that the life of a woman can be distinguished from her health; how a doctor may be expected to distinguish a life shortening threat to her life as distinct from an immediate physical threat to her life.  Indeed, we have heard conflicting statements from Government spokespersons on whether the Government's amendment is intended to eliminate life shortening illnesses as distinct from an immediate threat to life.  On the one hand a Minister told us that it excludes any possibility of a termination in a life shortening situation and provides for situations where there is an immediate threat to life while on the other hand others claim that it is intended to cover both situations and no woman will be refused treatment if her life or, as the Minister claimed, her health are at risk.</P>
    <P>Our amendment seeks to broaden the capacity of this house to deal with this issue.  We very clearly insist in our amendment that health should be included as the basis for a possible termination and that it is to protect against a real and substantial risk to the life or health of a pregnant woman.  We also seek to delete the phrase &ldquo;mother&rdquo; from the proposed amendment.  By accepting the term &ldquo;mother&rdquo; we willy-nilly accept the thesis that what a woman is carrying from the point of conception is a child.  There are serious and widespread differences of opinion, even among Roman Catholic theologians, on this issue.  On Sunday a Roman Catholic theologian pointed out on RTE that there is a grave question mark over this issue.  I do not wish to delay the House on this issue but it is tendentious to continue to refer to a woman who has become pregnant and is carrying a foetus as a &ldquo;mother&rdquo;; without question, it literally accepts the theological argument that life begins at conception.  This is only a theological argument; it is not a medical argument. <Col N="832" /> There is no consistent medical opinion which says that life begins at conception. Who knows, but perhaps in five or ten years' time it may be proved or disproved.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;a real and substantial risk&rdquo; to the health of the woman would also provide for situations where the psychological health of a woman would be at issue.  I find it both insulting and difficult to understand how it is possible for the Government to argue on the one had that there is a separation between the life and health of the woman and on the other to go further and argue that her mental health is of no consequence; that a threat of self-destruction will be banned and giving any recognition to the threat of self-destruction arising from a crisis pregnancy must, under the Constitution, be ruled out.  This seems to be stepping back 100 years to the time when mental illness was regarded as something evil and had nothing to do with the physical well being of a person. It is obvious to anyone, even a lay person like me, that one cannot distinguish between the physical and mental health of any person in society, that one impinges and works on the other.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to achieve a situation where people can give their verdict that they want the Dáil to legislate for abortion in certain circumstances where the life and health of a woman is at serious and substantial risk.  It states that this should be done by way of legislation in the Dáil; it would be regulated by the Dáil.  Given the particularly conservative make-up of this Dáil, which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, it is highly unlikely we will have what the Minister seems to fear, abortion on demand.  The fact is that the 1983 Amendment has been interpreted by our Supreme Court in a way which virtually no one anticipated by way of its effect on information and travel and the way it was defined in relation to suicide and the right to a termination.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dukes said earlier, it would be far more beneficial for the health of politics and democracy here if the Dáil were allowed to do the job it was elected <Col N="833" /> to do, that is to legislate; for the Constitution to lay down the principles and for the Dáil to legislate rather than try to incorporate legislation into our Constitution which is extremely difficult to change for obvious reasons.  In a curious way it would probably work more in the interests of the so-called pro-life groups if the Dáil were permitted to legislate in the way it clearly feels it should.</P>
    <P>I do not want to unnecessarily take up the time of other Deputies in this short debate.  The Minister has consistently attempted to portray the Government amendment as a so-called pro-life amendment.  I know from statements he is reported to have made at press briefings and so on, that the Taoiseach has said this is not an abortion amendment. The fact is that the Government's briefing paper makes it very explicit that this is an abortion amendment.  Although it has not yet been admitted by the Government I assume this briefing document which was given to the Leaders of the Opposition parties was drafted by the Attorney General.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.  Under the heading &ldquo;Supreme Court Decision in X Case&rdquo; the briefing document states:</P>
    <P>The effect of the Supreme Court decision is that an abortion is permissible in this jurisdiction where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by the termination of the pregnancy and that a risk of suicide may constitute a real and substantial risk to life.</P>
    <P>That is a clear statement that the Supreme Court judgment provided for abortion, termination of a pregnancy. The briefing document goes on to refer to the effect of the proposed Government amendment.  It states:</P>
    <P>The amendment is proposed as an addition to Article 40.3.3º.  The effect is to leave undisturbed the existing affirmative acknowledgment of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, contained in that Article.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The amendment accepts the test set out in the Supreme Court decision in every respect except suicide.  It therefore, sets out to negative the decision in respect of suicide but in no other respect.  The effect is that where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered, the pregnancy may lawfully be terminated if that is necessary to save her life.</P>
    <P>That is a very clear, explicit statement that what the Government are proposing is the legalisation of abortion in this State.  The Minister should stop the nonsense of trying to claim that in some way this does not permit abortion.  The Minister's briefing document states that it does.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is at last breaching the theological ramparts that have surrounded this issue for so long.  We have been caught up in theological argument about when life begins, when abortion is direct or indirect and whether if indirect it can be called abortion and so on.  We have an acceptance by the Government that abortion may take place in a specific circumstance. That is an advance.  I should like the Government to go much further and to respect the health of the woman.  I should like them to respect her mental health as much as her physical health, but their amendment refuses to respect her mental health.  That is where I disagree with them.</P>
    <P>It is a silly argument that what the Government are proposing is not abortion and what everybody else is proposing is abortion.  The Government are proposing abortion.  Let us get away from the nonsense that they are not and let us have a mature debate on how far we should go on that road.  That is fundamentally what the debate is about.  The Government say we should allow a legal abortion only where there is a substantial physical risk to the life of the mother.  I say it should also include a serious and substantial risk to the health of the mother.  I would argue also that where a woman or a young girl is pregnant as a <Col N="835" /> result of rape or incest, that would be a serious case for allowing a legal termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, as others have claimed that I am, that all a person should have to do is go to a doctor claiming to be suicidal and request an abortion.  That is nonsense.  What is at issue is whether we accept that there is a medical argument from psychologists.  Every Deputy has received a briefing document from the Psychologists' Society of Ireland which goes into some detail in examining existing research.  It raises the question in the same terms as the Attorney General's briefing.  It is impossible to rule out the possibility that a woman's life may be at risk as a result of suicidal tendencies or in the longer term that her life may be at risk because her health is threatened or damaged by a pregnancy.  I am not arguing that the case is made and accepted by everybody that suicide or health grounds are an absolute in terms of requiring a termination of pregnancy, but I object to the attempt to incorporate in our Constitution an absolute statement that under no circumstances will the health of a woman or suicidal tendencies be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's briefing document states that even though the risk to life may occur in only a limited number of cases, we cannot rule out the possibility of its happening.  We cannot rule out that suicide may result from a crisis pregnancy.  We cannot rule out that a woman's quality of life may be destroyed as a result of a crisis pregnancy.  We should not try to rule out these possibilities in our Constitution.  That is why I am proposing the alternative wording in amendment No. 2 which would leave intact Article 40.3.3º but would qualify it by introducing some compassion.  It would extract most of the piety and inject some pity into the whole problem of a woman who may be at risk as a result of pregnancy.  I appeal to the Minister to approach this question in those terms rather than try to score political points against me or others by accusing us of wanting abortion on demand.</P>

      <P>I wish to discuss the amendments in my name which seek to remove the distinction in the Minister's proposed amendment to the Constitution between life and health.  I have taken medical and legal advice on this point from people who would be very anxious to restrict abortion and who believe that a termination should only be available in life threatening situations.  They nevertheless feel that inserting the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; creates a totally artificial tension between the two concepts, health and life.  If the wording were left without the addition of these words, it would obviously remain the case that termination would have to be necessary to save the life of the mother.  They do not understand why the provision as to health has to be inserted.</P>
      <P>Doctors will have to start interpreting this new distinction in the Constitution and will have to look over their shoulders. If they are in an operating theatre, one of the people present might feel that the condition of the mother was health-threatening as distinct from life-threatening and the doctor might feel that he or she could be reported to some authority for giving treatment in those circumstances which would have the effect of terminating the life of the unborn.  It is feared that this will introduce a legalistic atmosphere into clinical decisions by doctors in operating theatres and elsewhere. Who will be the losers?  The women whose lives will be placed at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the increasing incidence of litigation and the costs of medical liability, doctors will tend when there is any doubt to take the most cautious course, which may not be the most efficacious course in regard to saving the life of the mother.  While they would be able to argue afterwards that they did things to <Col N="837" /> save the life of the mother they will not have done them as quickly or as effectively as they would have done, if they did not have to look over their shoulders in this way, because of this artificial distinction that is being introduced.  By taking out the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; from this amendment one is not saying, although some would argue it, that health alone is a ground, because the words remain &ldquo;such termination is necessary to save the life.&rdquo;  I cannot understand why the Minister has taken this course.  The argument he advanced in his Second Stage speech is unconvincing. The Minister basically concludes that if we take out the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; we will get an amendment which allows abortion on health grounds alone and that that would lead to abortion on demand.  That is not true.  There is no basis on which that can be read into the wording.  If we take those words out the amendment will still read:</P>
    <P>It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>Those words clearly very narrowly circumscribe the circumstances in which a termination can take place.  There is no need for the insertion of those words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; and all the Minister is doing is putting in the Constitution words that will create the impression that this House and the electorate if they approve of this, are unconcerned about women's health and that we regard this as a lower order concern. I know that will not be the legal meaning of the words, but the fact that those words are put in will create that sort of atmosphere. Let us remember that the Constitution is more than a legal document. It is also a statement of our values as a people.  To put in this hairsplitting distinction between life and health in these circumstances shows that we went to enormous trouble to exclude certain possible health threatening conditions <Col N="838" /> from being considered, because we want to make absolutely sure that there will be absolutely no doubt.  Given what I understand the Minister wants to achieve, he is not going about it in the right way.  The Minister is making a very serious poitical error in including these words, as well as everything else, because he is creating a situation in which many women and doctors will feel they cannot support this amendment because of the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; being included gratuitously and unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said it is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and that it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life.  The Minister went on to say that he did not think this would arise in this case but he did not make any case to demonstrate that point.  The Minister attempted to reply to this concern by saying:</P>
    <P>I think that I can provide reassurance on this point.  The intention of the amendment is that a risk to health unrelated to a risk to life is not sufficient to warrant termination of the life of the unborn.  It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination.</P>
    <P>I do not say it is the intention but the Minister's intention is entirely irrelevant. It is the words that go into the Constitution and how they are interpreted by the Supreme Court perhaps in five or six years time that will count.</P>
    <P>The Minister and many others had lots of intentions during 1983 and many people outside this house and inside it gave assurances in 1983 as to the meaning of certain words; and they made it abundantly clear that it was not the intention to interfere with the right to travel or to prevent the dissemination of information. All these intentions amounted to nothing because the Supreme Court interpreted the words differently.  The Minister's language in his speech was extremely tentative where he said &ldquo;I <Col N="839" /> think that I can provide reassurance on this point.  That is unbecoming modesty on the part of the Minister.  The people are entitled to more than that.  The Minister attempted to suggest that if the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; were taken out we could have terminations where there was no risk at all to the life of the mother.  I cannot understand how the Minister could come to that conclusion when the words of the amendment say that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of the unborn unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother.  The Minister based his case on the Bourne case in England.  I do not know if the Minister has read the judgment in that case.</P>

      <P>That judgment was given in a criminal case where one cannot necessarily say that the judgment of the judge was the reason the jury came to their conclusion in the case.  Mr. Justice McNaughton said on that occasion that if there is a doubt, any doubt as to the motivation of the person concerned, he was entitled to be acquitted.  The case the Minister is trying to make is that the Bourne judgment would allow health alone to be a ground for a termination here.  The Bourne judgment was uttered in a country where there is no written Constitution and where there is no custom of interpreting the Constitution. To suggest that the Irish Supreme Court might come to a similar conclusion to that in the Bourne judgment if these words were left out is fanciful in the extreme. In charging the jury Mr. Justice McNaughton said:</P>
      <P>As I told you yesterday and as I tell you today the question that you have got to determine is not whether you are satisfied that he did it in good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl.  The question is whether the Crown have proved the negative of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, that he did not do it in <Col N="840" /> good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl.</P>
    <P>The important point to draw from that summing up of his judgment by Mr. Justice McNaughton was that the case was about whether the motive was to preserve the life of the girl, not the health.  It was the life that was at stake in that case.  I do not see how the Minister can draw a conclusion from this that it creates a ground for health alone being the judgment or for drawing any conclusions as to why the Bourne jury came to the decision they came to in that case or as to how that would apply in Ireland.  I feel that the Bourne judgment is so ambiguous that it is not helpful and should not have been introduced into this discussion. We should be looking at the words that are in our Constitution as it stands.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that I would be particularly worried that the clinical decisions by doctors would become the subject of litigation.  For example, a midwife involved in an operation might have very strong convictions and might feel that a doctor had acted on grounds of health preservation rather than life preservation, and might seek an injunction to prevent the carrying out of a particular operation.  We might have a situation at a later date where a treatment given to save a mother's life which resulted in injury to but not termination of the life of an infant might lead to the infant or persons on his or her behalf suing the doctor who might be claimed to have acted to save the health and not the life of the mother.  By introducing this distinction here, these sorts of issues will be contested on the strength of the wording in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the Minister's intention but I think it could be the result of this amendment.  The Minister should very carefully reconsider the inclusion of those words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the amendment.  I do not believe he has proved to anybody's satisfaction that they are necessary.  If he has doubts about the matter he could introduce accompanying legislation to make it very <Col N="841" /> clear what he means by treatment necessary to protect life.  There is no need to include the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the amendment.  If the Minister wanted to achieve some measure of support for his approach he would have done that but it seems he has taken the view that because this is his starting position he is not willing to change or listen to any argument from any quarter.  I feel very strongly that the Minister should take out these words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;.  I do not feel any cause is being served other than causing gratuitous and unnecessary worry and hurt to women by the continued use of those words.</P>

      <P>I refrained from intervening earlier because I understood the major debate would take place on the amendments.  I am glad you have given me the opportunity of speaking now. Like everybody else, with the exception of Fianna Fáil, we in The Workers' Party also feel that this matter should have been dealt with by legislation.  This was the feeling in 1983.  A grave error was made in 1983 by putting in a totally unnecessary amendment to ban abortion which was already banned under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This legislation was in need of amendment and updating, and that is the way this matter should have been dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those years medical decisions were made by doctors on the basis of protecting patients as they have always done. Even before the 1983 amendment, where a pregnant woman had an illness the doctor recognised that under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, his first responsibility was to his patient, that is, to the woman rather than to the unborn child.  The unborn child was of the utmost importance to the doctor and the woman as far as treatment was concerned, but must be secondary to the treatment of the patient for whom the doctor is responsible, that is the woman. Under the Hippocratic Oath doctors <Col N="842" /> must protect the life of their patients. Despite the 1861 Act and the 1983 Amendment of the Constitution, doctors have continued to do that.  Article 40.3.3º only gives equal right to the mother but doctors continued to give prior right to the mother, as they must.  The so called pro-life people who forced through the 1983 Amendment with the help of the bishops know this is the case and they agree with it.  They said specifically that they do agree with it.  They know that the woman is given prior right and yet they forced through an amendment giving her only equal right with the foetus.</P>
    <P>The medical profession are now in an impossible position where they have neither legislative nor constitutional support or backing for their actions in saving lives.  They are the real pro-life people, the only pro-life people in this business. The so-called pro-lifers salve their consciences by pretending that ending the life of the foetus to save the life of the mother is not abortion.  That is fine, and nice and cosy for them but where does it leave the doctor?  It has no legal standing and therefore the medical profession have no legal protection for their actions.</P>
    <P>The words in the current constitutional amendment, particularly the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; put doctors in an even more impossible position.  They are dedicated to protecting the health of their patients and in many cases they would find it very difficult if not impossible to say that where health is seriously affected the life of the patient is not at risk.  How can they say in cases where health is seriously affected that the life is not at risk?  This wording will leave doctors even more open to possible court actions either for not taking action to save the woman's health or for taking acton to save the woman's health which endangered or damaged the health or life of the foetus.</P>
    <P>Whatever wording is decided in this amendment, legislation will still have to be brought forward to put the legislators' interpretation on the constitutional amendment and I think this was made clear by the Supreme Court.  When the Taoiseach advised me of the wording <Col N="843" /> being put forward he told me that if the wording were defeated in a refendum he would deal with this by legislation.  I was delighted when I heard that and I said as much to him because now there would be a choice.  If one did not vote for the referendum there would be legislation. People see that as a big stick held over the pro-lifers; perhaps it is but I still think that it is a good idea and hope that this will be explained to voters.</P>
    <P>The question that must be asked is, where will we stand if the amendment is passed.  If there is one lesson that we have learned it is that the wording that will be put before the people should be as simple and as straightforward as possible.  That is the reason the amendment in my name has been formulated in simple terms.  We have not included the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; because it is meaningless &mdash; an unborn what?  One could not perform an abortion on a cat.  Neither have we included the word &ldquo;mother&rdquo; which is equally dodgy and dangerous because it only covers women who already have one or more children.  It does not cover women who are not mothers or indeed who may not be mothers following an operation to save their lives.  They may then be incapable of having a child.  The inclusion of ridiculous words such as &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; leads to the creation of enormous legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>What I have tried to do on behalf of The Workers' Party is outline the grounds on which it should be lawful to terminate a pregnancy.  We make no mention of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; but rather make a positive declaration in which we state that it should be &ldquo;lawful to terminate a pregnancy where there is a threat to a woman's life or health and in the case of a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest.&rdquo;  That is both simple and clear.</P>
    <P>No man &mdash; and I have spoken to women about this matter &mdash; can understand the effect rape or incest has on a woman's mental attitude and feeling about herself.  It affects them not only mentally but also physically in that they have a feeling that they are unclean and that their womanhood has been <Col N="844" /> destroyed.  No man can understand these feelings and given what I have been told in relation to the effect rape and incest have on some, if not all, women they must have a choice.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we say the Government should outline the grounds clearly in the amendment because every comma is open to a legal interpretation.  However, I presume it is too late to do anything about this matter now, having regard to the fact that two special Cabinet meetings have been held to agree on the wording to be put to the electorate and that we are wasting our time debating the matter. Fianna Fáil have had their wording accepted and they are going to push the Progressive Democrats to come in behind them on it.  Even though it may be foolish to propose a wording, our amendment points to where we stand on the issue, and I am strongly of the view that we should be specific.</P>
    <P>I should point out that even if the wording I have suggested was accepted we would still need legislation which would stipulate the period &mdash; say, 12 weeks or 16 weeks &mdash; within which it would be unlawful to terminate a pregnancy.  Yet, when I asked if the Government's wording is passed would that be the end of the matter, the Taoiseach replied that it would.  They are going to leave the matter hanging in mid air again, despite what the Supreme Court had to say, that the legislators had done nothing since 1983 when an amendment which was open to all sorts of interpretations was inserted into the Constitution.  No attempt was made to introduce legislation to give effect to that amendment.  It is absolutely essential, if the amendment is passed, that legislation be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party will be opposing the amendment mainly on the grounds that this is not the way to proceed.  We believe that the matter should be dealt with by way of legislation.  We intend to oppose the amendment to ensure that it is dealt with in this way.  I am aware that we would then have another battle on our hands as to the legislation that should be introduced by the Government but that is the way we should proceed given <Col N="845" /> that it would be open to any future Government to amend that legislation without the need to hold a referendum.</P>

      <P>Let me respond to some of the points raised.  In relation to amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy De Rossa, this would introduce abortion on all grounds where there is a substantial risk to the life or health of the mother. Clearly, this would lead to abortion on demand.  This is what happened both in England and other jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unacceptable to the Government and I am quite sure to the vast majority of the people.  As I have explained time and again, the Government are not in the business of introducing abortion; this is a pro-life <Col N="846" /> amendment.  What we are doing is reducing the number of grounds, under the law since the X case, on which a pregnancy may be terminated.  What the amendment is seeking to do is to turn that back, and we have consistently said this.  It must also be borne in mind &mdash; and Deputy De Rossa should appreciate this &mdash; that existing medical practice will continue.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court test, which has been quoted by Members on all sides of the House since the debate started, is straightforward, and indeed, has already been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Consequently, there is no need at this time to pursue the question of further legislation because the interpretation is already in place.  Today, under the law of the land, suicide or self-destruction is a ground on which a pregnancy may be terminated.  What we are asking is that this be ruled out.  We have been asked why on a number of occasions by Deputies McCartan, De Rossa and others.  We have said it is a totally unsatisfactory criterion, that it is uncontrollable and defies regulation.  I am advised that there are no scientific means to establish whether a woman is suicidal.</P>
      <P>In present circumstances the law states, in so far as the Supreme Court judgment is concerned, that termination of pregnancy, abortion, is available here as long as the test is satisfied.  One of the grounds for the test is that a pregnant mother is suicidal.  We disagree with that and have been stating that quite clearly for some time.</P>

      <P>When talking about suicide I might refer Deputies to a letter written by a Maura Ó Riordan which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 24 October 1992 which read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Dr. Anthony Clare's article on abortion and suicide &mdash; October 17th &mdash; it may be of interest that Dr. David Owen, the former leader of the SDP in Britain, boasts in his autobiography, <i>Time to Declare,</i><Col N="847" /> that he personally advised women to threaten suicide in order to obtain an abortion.</P>
    <P>It is that kind of thing I was bringing to the notice of the House which leads us to believe that there would be those who would seek to use the suicidal element as a means of securing an abortion.  It is to stop that possibility that the amendment has been framed in that we believe &mdash; and we believe a majority in the House believe &mdash; the people do not wish to see suicide as a ground for an abortion.</P>

      <P>I might refer to amendments Nos. 9 and 10 on which Deputy John Bruton made some comments. Those amendments refer to the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;.  I am opposing those amendments. <Col N="848" /> In proposing them Deputies raised various points.  On occasion they referred to the innate offensiveness of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; and claimed that the use of that term also could rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman.  While I can well appreciate that there is some strength of feeling in that regard, many of the comments made suggesting that the inclusion of the phrase could have adverse unintended effects are without foundation.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that a line cannot be drawn unambiguously between &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo; and that this will give rise to difficulties.  I have to point out, of course, that the Supreme Court has already drawn that line and had no difficulty in so doing.  The essence of the Supreme Court judgment is that such a line must be drawn on the proper interpretation of Article 40.3.3º.  That Article, on its true interpretation, will allow the right to life of the unborn to be superseded only where that is necessary to save the life of the mother, in the sense that otherwise she would die.</P>
      <P>The Twelfth Amendment would not make any change to the constitutional test on this point, as it has been interpreted by the Supreme Court up to now, but rather would establish that interpretation as something which could not be changed at any time in the future without the consent of the people.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the debate on the Bill, a view was expressed that the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be read as including the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;.  The fact is that all five members of the Supreme Court spoke specifically in terms of the life of the mother and in no instance was health unrelated to a risk to life contemplated as a ground.</P>

      <P>The distinction between the life and health was included in the general test laid down by the Chief Justice, which has been acknowledged by Deputy FitzGerald.  It is clear that the distinction was accepted by the other judges and was inherent in what they had to say.</P>
      <P>It seems that a test of whether action is necessary to save the life of the mother is straightforward and, in practice, should not give rise to difficulty.  This test, as laid down, has existed explicitly since the decision was given in the X case.  Indeed, prior to the publication of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill I heard no suggestions about any possible difficulties in the operation of that test.  I agree it has arisen since we came in here but, before that, there had been no reference, no complaints, no difficulties suggested that might exist in so far as the application of the test was concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Indeed the phrase reflects the Supreme Court decision in so far as it provides that the risk must be to the life of the mother in the sense that, unless the risk is avoided, she would die.  The phrase is taken from the Chief Justice's judgment but it is clear that the other judges also had in mind a risk to life rather than a risk to health. The reality which we cannot ignore is that in other jurisdictions a risk of damage to health is the ground which has led to widescale abortion on demand; nobody <Col N="850" /> is denying that.  It was in order to prevent such circumstances developing here that the phrase has been included in the amendment.</P>
      <P>Some doctors have expressed concern that the inclusion of the phrase could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which, under current medical, practice, doctors are permitted to exercise in the best interests of their patients. It is suggested that in any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity, to which Deputy Bruton quite rightly referred.  It is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk of life.  The concern of the doctors involved seemed to be that the wording may result in their being forced to have a greater degree of certainly about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment which may result in the loss of the foetus, whereas normal medical practice cannot operate on the basis of certainty but rather on the basis of probability only. That is the key phrase.</P>
      <P>When I used the words before &ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash; of which Deputy Bruton reminded me &mdash; the manner in which I used them was by way of reassuring Members.  It is a mode of language the meaning of which is well known to Deputy Bruton.  It is not the intention of the amendment to affect in any way the degree of probability of risk to life that is necessary to warrant treatment resulting in termination.  In the X case the Supreme Court laid down the test as being a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability. There is nothing in the proposed wording that would change that.</P>
      <P>I want to allay fears, expressed by some, that the use of the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the amendment might result in pregnant women being denied necessary medical treatment to protect their health.  There is no basis for that fear and people should not express that fear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the amendment <Col N="851" /> women will continue to receive all necessary medical treatment to protect their health.  Current medical practice in this regard will not be affected.  Under current medical practice the question of termination of pregnancy arises only where there is a threat to the mother's life.  After all the amendment does no more than adopt the test laid down in this regard by the Supreme Court in the X case.  There has been no suggestion that medical practice regarding necessary treatment to protect woman's health has been affected in any way since that decision.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this, that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother.  Let there be no doubt about that.  The amendment as it stands will allow all necessary treatment to be provided for an expectant mother in all circumstances where her life is at risk even if that would result in the loss of the life of her unborn child.</P>

The clear intent of the amendment and the clear meaning of the words used in it is that medical intervention will be allowed in all situations where it is necessary to save the mother's life because of a life-threatening physical, medical condition. If the Government saw any way of omitting the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; without giving rise to the real danger that it might eventually lead to abortion on demand we would have left them out.</P>

However, the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; formed part of the test enunciated by the Chief Justice in that case. If those words were to be omitted now from a constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of that test, significance might well be read into that omission.  In a future hard case health unrelated to a life-threatening condition, might be found to be a good ground for abortion, as happened in another jurisdiction, the result of which we are all familiar with.</P>

Unforeseen death of the foetus in the course of a medical intervention to protect the mother's life or her health, where all due care is taken to preserve the life of the foetus, is of course an entirely different matter and is not prohibited by law.  What the proposed Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution seeks to do is to maintain a just and proper balance between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn child.</P>

      <P>In fairness to Deputy Fennell, I hope she will have an opportunity to contribute.  I would point out to the Deputy that I sat here for most of the day without contributing.  I did not contribute to section 1 until people badgered me into doing so.  As I said, I am very happy to contribute, and this is my first contribution since the first vote was taken.  I have no problem in allowing all Deputies to make Second Stage speeches again on all these issues, but I do not want anybody to say that I did not respond to them.  For that reason I am taking a little extra time, but I promise to be as quick as I can.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear Deputy Mac Giolla's comment that he understands the reason the Government say that if the amendment is not endorsed on 3 December there will be need for legislation.  While others may think that is some kind of threat, that is not the intention but it is the reasonable thing to do.  Deputy Mac Giolla summed up the matter neatly when he asked what else would one do.</P>
      <P>I would take issue with Deputy Mac Giolla in that he saw no reference to &ldquo;mother&rdquo;.  This is one of the points raised by many people but they seem to forget that what is involved is not 55 words, as was continually referred to by Deputy Bruton, but 133 words, the number of words in Article 40.3.3º together with the 55 words &mdash; I take for granted Deputy Bruton's numerical ability on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only making the point that the party leaders agreed that there would be a referendum on travel and information and that the substantive issue would be dealt with by a referendum and/or legislation in the autumn.  The Government have honoured that commitment, which people should recognise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to discuss amendments Nos. 3 and 12 as they are being taken with amendment No. 2.  They deal with existing medical practice.  Doctors may feel that, in some way, the inclusion of <Col N="857" /> the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the Government amendment will inhibit them from acting until there is a degree of certainty in relation to the existence of a risk to life, which would be wholly impracticable in medical practice and which can only proceed on the basis of probability.  I have explained previously to the House that the Supreme Court decision requires only that the existence of a real and substantial risk to life be established on the balance of probabilities &mdash; there is nothing in the amendment which would change that.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; does not mean that the risk to life must be imminent or immediate before action to terminate the pregnancy will be permitted. In this context cases of cardiac conditions or treatment involving chemotherapy in the early stages of pregnancy are mentioned; the test enunciated by the Supreme Court does not require that the risk to life must be immediate.  The court specifically rejected that proposition, neither does the wording of the proposed amendment require that the risk to life should be immediate.  I am advised that the phrase &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; means that the pregnancy could be terminated if the doctors were able to form the view that, even after childbirth and recovery of the mother, other treatment, for whatever condition from which she was suffering, would be ineffective to protect her life.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the Bill will render unlawful medical treatment for mothers where that treatment is for the benefit of their health as opposed to saving their lives.  The Bill is not changing the law in this respect, it adopts the existing law as set out by the Supreme Court and nobody has ever suggested, as far as I know, that the Supreme Court decision has given rise to the consequences which it is now claimed would flow from the amendment.  My understanding of current medical practice is that medical treatment for a health condition which is not life threatening is not permitted if the foreseen result of that treatment is the death of the feotus but that medical treatment is permitted <Col N="858" /> where the life of the mother is at risk and the loss of life of the foetus from such treatment is foreseen.  It may, of course, also occasionally happen that a drug or other therapy given for some condition causes an entirely unforeseen adverse response and leads to the loss of life of the foetus.  I am advised that the wording proposed could not be held to imply a breach of the law in circumstances where the life of the foetus is lost as an unforeseen and unintended consequence of treatment carried out in good faith.</P>

      <P>Matters like this raised in the debate have implications not only for the general public but for the medical profession.  It is clear that medical care of women and the provision of that care when life is at risk should remain to the fore of the debate.  The medical profession are called upon to deal with issues of life and death with the complex legal and treatment considerations of patients under their care.  Individual doctors will be at the forefront of the decision making process implicit in the issues raised by the referendum on the substantive issue.  It is not the referendum which brings this about, it is a fact of medical life.</P>
      <P>Every day the medical profession provide expert medical and surgical care for pregnant women regardless of the medical complexities, rarity of diagnosis or the trauma which, in exceptional individual cases, may arise.  It is necessary to reassure people generally &mdash; and women in particular &mdash; that that caring and expertise will remain fully available in our health services, regardless of the outcome of the referenda.  It should be stressed that such treatment and care have been the hallmark of our health services for many years.  It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding on matters that are the essence of life and death.</P>

      <P>It should be clearly acknowledged that the medical profession are obviously to the fore in deciding matters which are the essence of life and death and that reliance on the profession has been well placed as evidenced by the high national &mdash; and international &mdash; reputation of our obstretric and by gynaecological services in particular. This faith is clearly shared by the general public and must be safeguarded at all costs during the referenda debate. That is an important element.  This has been a major element of the contribution to the debate of the Minister for Health in the House and outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know my contribution was long but, in fairness to those who made decent contributions in the House, the least I could do was to acknowledge that and <Col N="860" /> respond in kind by giving a good, clear outline in as precise terms as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister during all stages of this debate and indeed prior to the Second Stage debate.  Will he admit that he might be wrong this time as well?  The Minister prefaced his remarks by saying he was &ldquo;advised&rdquo;.  Needless to say, he is being advised by a broad range of people on this occasion but I am sure he was also advised in 1983 when he got it miserably wrong.  The people at least deserve an apology in that respect because of what the Minister said throughout that debate. Indeed, I questioned his motives on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the medical profession; with all due respect, he is doing a great disservice to the medical profession and if he had the respect for them which he claims to have he would not go about the amendment in this way because he will cause more problems for the medical profession.  Problems were caused by the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach in their first attempts to explain what the Minister for Justice was trying to do, consequently confusion was rampant.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not allay the fears expressed by myself and others that certain medical treatments which are available at present will not be available after the amendment is passed &mdash; if it is passed, which is doubtful.  There might have been some possibility of allaying those fears if legislation had been enacted.  I am at a loss to understand, after the Minister's last contribution, why the Government are reluctant to introduce legislation now that it is an option.  However, the Minister will introduce it without any difficulty if he is defeated on 3 December.  If it does not cause any problems to introduce it the second time round, why not do it properly and try to avoid some of the consequences of the awful mess we got into since 1983?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the conduct of the Taoiseach in Dublin Castle today, it appears that we are looking down the barrel of a gun in relation to a general election and <Col N="861" /> I hope that courageous people will hold on to their nerve in the face of that election because, if we find ourselves on platforms within a matter of weeks, I trust the Minister for Justice will still stick to some aspects of his Second Stage speech which are a major advance on his previously adopted position.  In that speech he said: &ldquo;under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is in danger if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated if that is necessary to save her life&rdquo;.  I trust that the Minister for Health will explain that sentence to many of his colleagues, male and female, who supported him on Thursday last because, if a general election is declared, as seems likely, and if Cabinet confidentiality and collective responsibility mean anything, then I suspect that many of the Minister's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may want to read the newspapers.  To answer that question quite bluntly, it is my opinion that the whole notion of collective responsibility has been thrown out the window in the context of the Taoiseach's remarks at the Beef Tribunal today.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something the Minister can catch up on.  I trust that Government Deputies will stick to the sentence I have just read out, from the Minister's Second Stage speech because from comments I have read in the press today it would appear that some of them neither understand it nor want to understand it and certainly do not want to support it.  That sentence results from the advice of the Attorney General or at least that part of his advice that the Minister obviously accepted.  Unfortunately, as was demonstrated when the Minister set out to explain the words in the context of the amendments put down in my name and in the name of Deputy Howlin, practically <Col N="862" /> every word in the Minister's amendment to the Constitution is loaded with potential meaning.  We might have had some opportunity to clarify the meaning if we were dealing with legislation. One thing is obvious: the statements of Government intent, even if they were clear and not as confused as they have been, are meaningless because it will be the Supreme Court who will again in due course &mdash; I would say it will not take another ten years, because I am sure these words will be tested before then &mdash; who will be asked to interpret the meaning of the amendment.  The words and phrases that I do not think the Committee will have resolved by 6.45 p.m. this evening are, &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;, &ldquo;save&rdquo;, &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, &ldquo;disorder&rdquo;, and &ldquo;not being a risk of self-destruction&rdquo;. The potential meaning and the consequence of each of those both individually and taken together will, I believe, place many women at risk.  I have not heard anything in the House this afternoon to allay those fears.</P>
      <P>The use of the term &ldquo;save the life&rdquo;, could, as I said in my Second Stage contribution be much better phrased as &ldquo;protect the life&rdquo;.  Somebody's life could be protected from the probability of a medical emergency in the future as opposed to protecting somebody's life from the consequences of that emergency, a distinction the Minister seems to have difficulty in accepting.  Apart altogether from the offensiveness of the term &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in its implying that the health of women is not an area of concern to the Members of the House, and that what we are having is a reflection of a debate that took place in this country about 40 years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On 3 December the women of Ireland will demonstrate that they consider the wording to be an insult to their health.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has the opportunity to reply to this debate, perhaps he will say on what basis he was advised &mdash; he used the words &ldquo;I am advised&rdquo;&mdash; in relation to the operations which we believe may be ruled out as a result of the use of the term &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman.  Could the Minister give examples to which that advice relates?  I think it is only if we have the concrete examples that we can know what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;is necessary to save the life&rdquo;, as distinct from saving the health, of the mother is also a matter of concern. After the Minister's previous contribution, I foresee that there will be grey areas and these areas will have to be dealt with by the medical profession when it is our responsibility to clarify what is meant.</P>
      <P>The use of the word &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; does not include psychological and psychiatric disorders.  Reference to that word in the explanatory memorandum circulated by the Government states that it is necessary to include ectopic pregnancies but it is unfortunate that it rules out &mdash; and the Minister persists in this exclusion &mdash; all forms of psychological and psychiatric disorders.  I believe that to be an absolute insult to the advances that have been made in those areas of medicine in the past years.  Again, that is an element the Government will have to examine.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate aspect is that the Minister seems to have made up his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the Taoiseach's manner in offering the people this amendment which the majority of Members in the House consider to be unsatisfactory, and the manner in which he referred to legislation, <Col N="864" /> to be a threat to the Irish people. What the Taoiseach is saying is that we can deal with absolutes in an extremely complex area.  This is not a black and white issue.  Unfortunately, we will not have the matter ironed out.  The medical profession will carry the brunt of the lack of responsibility shown in this House on this occasion and, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, we will be back in the House legislating one way or the other within a very short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet had an opportunity to talk on the Committee Stage in relation to the amendments that are being dealt with.  I should like to deal with certain aspects of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister constantly makes an inaccurate statement &mdash; one with which Minister O'Dea, who briefly visited the Chamber this evening, seemed to agree &mdash; that the formula now presented to us derives directly from what the Supreme Court decided.  The Minister correctly states that the Chief Justice made the distinction in his judgment when he referred to the life as distinct from the health of a woman.  The Minister then takes unto himself insights of de Valeran proportion when he attempts to look into his heart to discover what was in the minds of the other four members of the Supreme Court, none of whom sought to make that distinction. It is an outrageous inaccuracy for the Minister to justify what is an appalling distinction in this wording &mdash; a distinction that is justifiably causing a great deal of concern to women, a distinction that should not be in a Constitution &mdash; by stating constantly that he is reflecting what is stated by the Supreme Court, because in the context of the majority judgments none of the judges with the exception of the Chief Justice made such distinction or felt that there was need to make such distinction.  To state that to remove the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; from the amendment would in some way provide an open door to abortion <Col N="867" /> on demand is such a gross misrepresentation as to be unworthy of the Minister, though it is worthy of the kind of approach we had from him in 1983.</P>
    <P>In deference to colleagues who want to make a contribution, I do not want to delay the House by repeating the quotations from the judgments of Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, Mr. Justice Egan and Mr. Justice McCarthy which I put on the record of the House during the Second Stage debate.  Suffice it to say that not one of those judges felt the need to make that distinction.  What the Government are attempting to do is to insert a distinction into our Constitution which is, in legal terms, an <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Chief Justice, which was irrelevant to the decision that was reached because there was no question in that case other than that the mother's life was at risk and that issue was not teased out.</P>
    <P>In this context it should be said that we have a great deal of worry that what the Government are trying to achieve in this amendment is something the Attorney General unsuccessfully attempted to achieve in the Supreme Court.  Deputy Bruton, and other Deputies, correctly pointed out that a number of the words contained in this Article &mdash; if the Minister is trying to rely on the Chief Justice &mdash; do not arise in the judgment of the Chief Justice.  Nowhere in his judgment did the Chief Justice talk about a necessity to save the life of the mother. The words &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; do not appear in the judgment of the Chief Justice. Indeed, one has a great deal of worry as to why that phrase is used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring correctly asked whether, for the mother who does not require immediate medical treatment to save her life and it is only something that may be required in the long term, it will be available.  The Minister is giving us assurances and telling us of his intentions on this, that and the other but, of course, the intentions of the Minister are irrelevant, it is what is in the wording that is important.  It is worth referring to one passage in the judgment of the Chief <Col N="868" /> Justice which has not been referred to in this debate.  On page 32 he referred to the need for a harmonious interpretation of the Constitution and the necessity that it be carried out with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, to which my colleague Deputy Noonan referred earlier. He went on to say:</P>
    <P>It leads me to the conclusion that in vindicating and defending as far as practicable the right of the unborn to life but at the same time giving due regard to the right of the mother to life, that the Court must, amongst the matters to be so regarded, concern itself with the position of the mother within a family group, with persons on whom she is dependent, with, in other instances, persons who are dependent upon her and her interaction with other citizens and members of society in the areas in which her activities occur.</P>
    <P>In other words, in determining issues relating to the life of the mother the Chief Justice said a broad number of matters must be dealt with and addressed.  These have not been explained.  Neither the Minister nor the Attorney General in his statement explained how this portion of the judgment of the Chief Justice fits into the proposal we now have.  What is interesting is the following reference by the Chief Justice to the Attorney General's submission:</P>
    <P>Having regard to that conclusion, I am satisfied that the test proposed on behalf of the Attorney General that the life of the unborn could only be terminated if it were established that an inevitable or immediate risk to the life of the mother existed, for the avoidance of which a termination of the pregnancy was necessary, insufficiently vindicates the mother's right to life.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Attorney General, on behalf of the Government, in the Supreme Court and in the High Court stated that for there to be a medical intervention to terminate a pregnancy there was a need for an immediate risk to the life of the mother.  I wonder whether what <Col N="869" /> the Attorney General could not achieve in the Supreme Court he is now attempting to achieve in the wording before us now in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;inevitable or immediate&rdquo; were used in the Attorney General's submission.  Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have tabled amendments seeking to remove the words &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; and to replace them with the words &ldquo;protect the life of the mother&rdquo;.  I query very seriously why the words &ldquo;save the life&rdquo; are in this amendment.  Presumably this amendment was sent by the Attorney General's office to the office of the Minister for Justice, was discussed within the Cabinet group that sought to reach a decision on this issue and then presented to us.  I have very serious reservations as to whether this wording will allow medical intervention to take place in circumstances where there is a long term as opposed to a short term risk to the life of the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Let no one say this is not a real problem because as recently as 28 September 1992 the story of the late wife of one Brendan Hodges appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> detailing how during her period of pregnancy she suffered a reactive tumour in her back, having previously suffered cancer, and how medical treatment was delayed until it was too late.  This woman lost her life and the life of her baby was lost also.  That is a real example of a situation that can arise where medical doctors are confused as to whether they should intervene because of provisions in our Constitution.  I understand that case is heading towards the courts but no one has objected to the article in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our case is that we cannot be absolutist about this.  When the Minister gives assurances in the absolutist manner in <Col N="870" /> which he has done this evening, he is replicating what happened in 1983.  What we can properly and validly say is that this wording is open to disparate interpretations which can give rise to confusion. The distinction in relation to health as contained in this could result in treatments which women require more quickly being delayed; it could result in debates within the medical profession that are not concerned with saving the life of a woman but rather with whether doctors will be subject to court injunctions or constitutional actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not an interpretation. Obviously we are raising an issue that is of real concern to the Minister for Health because this is not some esoteric interpretation of these events that is confined to this side of the House. I should like to refer to one passage only from the speech by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley &mdash; a passage to which I did not refer earlier &mdash; which states:</P>
      <P>Another major concern about the proposed Amendment wording is the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo;. This could take away from doctors, from the courts and from this House any right to deal with those hard cases which will arise.</P>
      <P>No one can really know whether a pregnancy which will, as a matter of probability, drastically shorten and devastate a woman's life, be permitted to be terminated under this proposal. It seems to me that the wording is calculated to try to distinguish between life shortening and life threatening pregnancies and to exclude completely &ldquo;life-shortening&rdquo; risks as a ground for termination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was said by a Minister who was privy to the advice of the Attorney General and who, presumably, participated in the Cabinet sub-committee.  Unfortunately, <Col N="871" /> he is absent from today's debate.  It is worth repeating, that the Progressive Democrats were founded on the basis of standing by the Republic; on this issue it seems to me they are bystanders in the Republic.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue about the health of women and how we can predict this amendment will work out in practice.  I do not pretend to have the foresight or prophetic vision the Minister has and say categorically that a particular interpretation of the workings of this amendment in practice or by the Supreme Court will happen.  However, this amendment, like the 1983 amendment, is open to a variety of possible interpretations and because of its ambiguity one of its impacts could be to place the life of women at risk.  I say this on surer footing than the Minister is on, in that, unfortunately, things I said in 1983 have come to pass. Queries I raised about the wording in 1983 have been proved correct.  Practically everything the Minister said about the 1983 wording has been proved to be utterly and completely wrong.</P>
    <P>I regret we are dealing with this issue in this way today.  Originally when the Taoiseach talked about the possibility of consensus certainly within the Fine Gael Party there was a hope that we would be involved in a genuine discussion and exchange of views to see whether this issue could be tackled in a way which would allow for a consensus to be reached.  The Taoiseach's version of a consensus is simply that he puts up a proposal which everyone else must accept and there is no suggestion of taking on board genuine concerns from people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal briefly with <Col N="873" /> some of the reasons I believe this House should support the amendments tabled by Democratic Left in respect of a proposal to substitute a better formula of words to those put forward by the Minister, not just in respect of the difference between the life and health of women, but in regard to a number of other important aspects.</P>
      <P>Throughout this debate the Minister has constantly sought to dismiss Deputy De Rossa and me, and indeed my other colleagues in Democratic Left, with a shake of the hand by suggesting that we propose a case for abortion on demand in Ireland.  I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to deal with that briefly.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Minister sought to dismiss the proposals made by Deputy De Rossa in advancing his amendment was insulting in the extreme. The note I took of what the Minister said was that because, as a party, we propose that abortion should be available in the State to assist women faced with a real and substantial risk to their health as well as their life, we are, therefore, arguing for abortion on demand.  He then used the cliché &mdash; and I do not understand why he continues to use it &mdash; that the Government and himself are not in the business of introducing abortion, that their amendment is a pro-life amendment. I am pro-life; I am the father of children but I am also pro-abortion to the extent that I recognise there are circumstances in which abortion is necessary to assist women to guard against threats, real and substantial, to their life as well as their health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Government, with the wave of the hand and the use of abusive language, continue to dismiss those who in some way wish to address this debate, because they believe we support abortion on demand.  My understanding of the words &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo; is that regimes somewhere in the world provide for the absolute right of a woman to present herself at a clinic up to a certain stage of pregnancy, to be given, without let or hindrance, an abortion as a means to terminate a pregnancy or as a method of birth control. <Col N="874" /> That is what I understand abortion on demand to mean.  No one in this House, and indeed no one in the wider debate outside this House as I understand it, has yet sought to make that case and neither Democratic Left nor I are making that case as a medical or other proposition.</P>
    <P>In a document which we published during this debate &mdash; to which, regrettably, the Minister paid no regard or took no time to consider &mdash; we proposed that in certain specific circumstances set out in that document a woman should have the right to opt for termination of her pregnancy.  Those circumstances include a case where the life or the health of a woman are threatened with a real and substantial risk, where the woman is subjected to rape or incest or where the medical advice and opinion is that the foetus has no hope of survival beyond delivery.  In those circumstances, within a certain period of time, we proposed that a woman should have the right to opt, on medical advice, for a termination of her pregnancy.  We set out a broad range of circumstances into which that regime should fit which included proper counselling and support before and after the termination.  We suggested a proposition, which has the support at least of one Minister, because he made a similar proposition on our national airwaves, that there is a contradiction in insisting in those circumstances that abortions which take place in another jurisdiction should end and that we should provide for them at home.</P>
    <P>Although the Minister has a much narrower definition of the meaning of abortion on demand, he must accept that it exists as a fact of life for many thousands of Irish women today.  It has been estimated conservatively that more than 5,000 Irish women each year travel to England with a view to ending their pregnancies. Because he maintains it never happens here but can be facilitated by the right to travel and right to information on such services in a jurisdiction, in some instances no more than 60 or 80 miles away, is the Minister suggesting he is dealing with this issue in a morally correct manner? <Col N="875" /> In a document the Taoiseach circulated to party leaders as representing the basic briefing material from the Attorney General to the Cabinet and upon which the Minister and the Government were making the decision with regard to the legislation, it is stated on page 3:</P>
    <P>Some doctors are of the view that it is possible to treat these conditions without resorting to direct abortion. However, it seems difficult to advance, a categorical statement that circumstances could never arise which would require a direct abortion to save the mother's life.</P>
    <P>Acting on that advice, that there can never be an absolute proposition advanced that rules out direct abortion in all circumstances, the Government should proceed and they have proceeded.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that the Minister had absolutely no regard for the acknowledgment I recognised in the Government's proposals, limited though they were, that they squarely address the preposterous argument advanced by the pro-life group that there is an absolute formula of words that can be written into the Constitution ruling our forever the proposition of abortion being provided for in Irish law and medical practice.  I acknowledge the Minister had at least taken that ridiculous proposition squarely on board and said categorically that it cannot be adhered to and that the Government were providing, although in restricted circumstances, for abortion in certain circumstances in this State.  Yet, the Minister has said that his amendment does not provide for abortion, it is pro-life. Why are we engaging in such dishonesty even at this stage?  We have had a reasonable debate on Second Stage and sometimes on Committee Stage.  Therefore, why are we reducing this debate to the level of hurling insults across the floor?</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment makes proposals for abortion although he may want to call it something else.  I am not worried if he wants to call it termination of pregnancy; that is his right and I do not wish <Col N="876" /> to deny him that right.  However, when someone stands up here and uses the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; it is not a basis upon which the Minister should dismiss us as if we were making some unreal proposition which has not been made in this debate. The Minister must listen to the arguments put forward.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have serious reservations on the distinction between life and health. The Government only want to talk about the right to life, which I accept, but it must be the right to a healthy life.  It is no good the Government saying that they will allow women to survive without regard to their condition?  Is there to be no regard by our medical profession, our Government and our legislators to the condition in which women will be left after they deliver their child?  For instance a woman said on radio only last week that the advice she received was that the inevitable consequence of the delivery of her child to full term would have been incontinence for the rest of her life.  Is such a woman to be denied the opportunity and choice to say, &ldquo;if I want to be a healthy, living woman to care for the other children in my family, I cannot cope with that condition and, therefore, should have the right to consider, in consultation with my medical advisers, a termination of the pregnancy&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>What of the position of the Mrs. Hodgers of this world?  Is it a proposition that they are to be helped to the point of delivery, and to survive for only two days after the birth?  Can anyone explain to me, either by reference to the previous law which the Government say they are abiding by in this amendment or, indeed, in consequence of what is now before us, what the position of that woman or any woman will be should they have to go through that unbelievable experience, where the husband could stand at the front door of the hospital and hear his wife scream in pain four floors above?  What medical practice, what proposition in law or what succour under the Minister's proposal is to be given to a woman in similar unfortunate circumstances?</P>
    <P>We in Democratic Left have reservations <Col N="877" /> that have been spelled out in the amendment.  A paper prepared by Dr. Anthony Clare, one of the most eminent psychiatrists in this country, concluded &mdash; and I quote from the document he prepared: &ldquo;The relevant literature is reviewed which shows that suicide is an occasional outcome of refused abortion and has fallen in those jurisdictions which permit abortion on psychiatric grounds&rdquo;. To my mind it is utterly inconsistent for people, particularly the Minister for Health, to argue that suicide, which is a clearly identifiable medical condition, cannot be considered as a proper ground for abortions on medical supervision or advice.  I utterly reject the Minister's view that it is not scientifically possible to evaluate or establish suicide as a phenomenon. That flies in the face of all medical advice and beliefs as I understand it.  It is an incredible statement by the Minister and represents a total shift of ground on his part of this debate because up to now the Minister had argued that if suicide was allowed as an option &mdash; following on the partial reliance on the David Owenses of this world &mdash; it would represent &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo;.  That was the only argument and proposition put forward by the Minister as to why the issue of suicide could not be considered.  The Minister, in this preposterous statement, suggests that suicide is scientifically unquantifiable.  That proposition must be totally rejected.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make this brief contribution in support of the amendment proposed by Deputy De Rossa and other Deputies in Democratic Left.  I believe the Government could have done much better.  We have put forward a number of alternative proposals and if the Government ever seriously considered achieving consensus on this issue, they should have adopted the amendment to remove the ridiculous proposition which makes a distinction between the life and the health of the woman.  That in itself would have gone some way to meet the reservations on all sides of this House.  I do not believe that the Minister, the Taoiseach or anyone on the opposite side of the House had ever <Col N="878" /> any interest in achieving consensus on this issue.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the views of all speakers in this debate, and I did not wish in any way to demean or diminish any other Deputy's contribution.</P>
      <P>The Minister is deluding himself totally about his support in this House, which he has mentioned frequently.  The Progressive Democrats did not support what the Minister was doing.  It was a shotgun vote.  As far as I am concerned there was not majority support in this House.  The majority feeling was against this amendment which is now before us.  I regret that the Progressive Democrats decided that this was not an issue on which they could make a stand.  We heard the contributions of their two Deputies and we know how they feel about this issue. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister reflect and realise that he does not have a majority in this House for his actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make the appeal that we should be laying down principles in our Constitution, that we should not be inserting definitions such as we have discussed here today.  This amendment is laden with uncertainty.  It will create difficulties for doctors, in hospitals, and it will introduce uncertainties that were not there previously. It will make women fearful and uncertain when they are beginning a pregnancy.  I can assure the Minister &mdash; and my views on this do not stem from the last letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> or the last television documentary that I have seen &mdash; that I am speaking from my experience as a woman and as a mother, and as somebody who has very close contact with the pregnancy culture, I know what women talk about.  I know the kind <Col N="879" /> of secret fears they have.  I can assure the Minister that the legislation he is railroading through this House will compound that fear and that doubt.</P>
    <P>I have three children and my daughter will soon give birth to a baby.  It is a wonderful experience, but I can assure the Minister I have listened to the doubts and uncertainties that women have expressed.  This debate, and the following debate, will make women even more uncertain about their treatment and about the kind of dictates that will be made by their doctors.  The Minister should have listened to the views of women.  He should have listened to people such as Justice Mella Carroll, who gave the Minister a very detailed brief. He should have listened to Frances Fitzgerald and the people in the Council for the Status of Women.  He should have listened to the women TDs in this House. I suggest that I, no more than Deputy McCartan, did not like the snide manner in which the Minister referred to my feelings in this debate.  Of course there may have been slight differences among the members of this party, but I am proud to belong to a party that allows us to have these differences.  Since I entered the party in 1979 we have been allowed to express views that may be different from the mainstream.  Unlike the Minister's party, we are not beaten around the head and told that there is only one viewpoint with which everybody must agree.</P>
    <P>I support these amendments because I cannot accept the distinction between the health and the life of a woman.  The Minister's contribution reads a little like something from a legalistic or moralistic Disneyland, where we are talking about matters which are not quite what they seem, the Minister's own definitions.  So far as I am concerned, the life and health of a woman are the same.  During my years working and being in close contact with women I have seen many women &mdash; some poor and a few with heart complaints &mdash; who were worried about their tenth or eleventh pregnancy.  Such women would want the freedom to consult their doctors and make the right <Col N="880" /> decisions.  I have very little hope that this debate or the debate in the Seanad will change the minds of the Government or the Minister.  It seems that these words are written in tablets of stone and it is not possible to change them at this stage. The approach being taken on the health and life of a mother, and excepting suicide, is seriously wrong and I regret it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as possible. Like Deputy Fennell, I appreciate the concern, anger and outrage which has been expressed by men and women during this debate about the proposed wording.  I am glad to say that these feelings are shared by people outside this Chamber, particularly by fathers and men who care about the life and health of their wives.  These men recognise that childbirth cannot be taken for granted and that it is a time of high anxiety. The Minister referred to the popular and warm approval given to this wording by the majority of people outside this House.  He is either totally out of touch or he has not spoken to the majority of the people who believe otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleagues, I believe the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; should be included instead of &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; is affirming <Col N="881" /> ative and signifies life.  Every pregnant woman needs to know that she will be protected in every way possible.  The word &ldquo;save&rdquo; is stark and is regarded by women as life threatening.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the enormous difference between those two words and the fear &ldquo;save&rdquo; can engender.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a point which needs to be pinned down here.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it.  There is a duty on all of us to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken. </P>
    <P>I welcome that affirmation but unfortunately it cannot be guaranteed by the wording in the substantive issue.  My colleagues have referred to health and quality of life.  As we know, women have been worn out, have become invalids, had their lives shortened and their quality of life destroyed as a result of a pregnancy and the health problems which can arise from childbirth.  These problems may not be life threatening but they are life shortening and can destroy the quality of life not only of the woman but also of her husband and children.  Consideration has to be given to the necessity for a good quality of life.  Hopefully it will be recognised that a healthy and protected mother is the most positive unit in our society. The emotional and mental well being of a mother has a ripple effect not alone on her family but on the community as a whole.  Everyone in this House knows that if women avail of the opportunities they get to enhance their lives this too will have a ripple effect on society.</P>
    <P>Above everything else, I am astonished that the mental, emotional and psychological health of women is being excluded.  It is already legally accepted that women suffering from post-natal or pre-natal depression cannot be held responsible for any crimes they commit. How can the Government say that <Col N="882" /> mental, emotional and psychological problems are not life threatening?  It has been legally established that a woman suffering from pre-natal or post-natal depression is of disturbed mind.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fennell said, there is a feeling among the Government that they consulted with everybody who needed to be consulted.  I wish to state clearly in this House that neither women nor their representatives were listened to.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Council for the Status of Women, the Society of Psychologists of Ireland and 13 gynaecologist obstetricians from Cork, Dublin, Donegal, Kerry, Portlaoise, Wexford, Galway and Limerick were not listened to.  The Minister may feel that he has listened and learned, but I wish to point out that women have an inbuilt disgust at this wording and feel they will have no control.</P>
    <P>I am referring in particular to cases involving rape and incest where a young girl or woman will not be able to terminate a pregnancy.  We all recognise that rape and incest represent domination and control and that they destroy people's lives.  This violence should not be compounded by more domination and control where a woman is told she has no choice about terminating her pregnancy. This represents an invasion of the integrity of all women.  Other Catholic countries and countries which care deeply about life have introduced legislation and, where necessary, constitutional amendments which dignified and valued women and did not sideline, marginalise and frighten them as this wording does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record that I appreciate what Deputy Bruton said earlier in so far as he had taken advice on certain aspects of this matter. He fully recognised that the use of the words &ldquo;as distinct from the Health&rdquo; is in no way to mean giving less care and consideration to the health of the mother. That was generous of him.  He put it on the record and he accepts that if that impression is given by the words as framed, it is the wrong impression.  It is <Col N="883" /> an important thing for him to say and I gladly acknowledge it.  There is nothing that can be interpreted as not allowing all medical attention to be given to a pregnant mother in so far as her health and the protection of her life is concerned.</P>
      <P>I had hoped I would not have to waste any time in dealing with a matter which Deputy Shatter persisted in raising on Second Stage, and on occasion today, regarding the words used in the decisions of the judges of the Surpreme Court.  I would ask the Deputy to look again at those judgments.  I could give quotations to show that all the judges, as well as the Chief Justice, were talking about life, not health.  I take it Deputy Shatter agrees that Mr. Justice Finlay made that reference. The late Mr. Justice McCarthy used the phrase &ldquo;when there is a real and substantial risk attached to her [the mother's] survival&rdquo;.  Survival, I would suggest to Deputy Shatter means life, not health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter continually made his point about the use of the word &ldquo;life&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice O'Flaherty and Mr. Justice Egan, as well as Mr. Justice McCarthy, always made that distinction. It is quite obvious from their judgments that it can only mean life and not health.</P>

      <P>Regarding health as a ground for termination of pregnancy, several Deputies would like to have it both ways.  I regret that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the saving of her life, all medical and surgical treatment that is necessary must be given, as has been the common medical practice for many years.  It is not altered in one iota by the wording of this amendment. Everybody seems to accept that, except for a few chosen ones.  I would ask the Deputies to reconsider.  It is the fact of the matter that medical attention will be given to pregnant mothers in so far as the protection of their life and health is concerned, just as it is now, except that suicide is being ruled out as a ground for a termination of pregnancy.  Some do not want that.  I have heard on various sides of the House that they would like to see it included, but we have stated specifically that this is the real thrust of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution.  Suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy will not be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 40.3.3º is being retained and the right of the unborn is not diminished in any way by this constitutional amendment. The constitutional protection remains undiminished.  It is worth remembering that.  This is about protection of pregnant mothers and their entitlement to get all medical attention needed for the protection of their health and their lives.  It is not just pro-life in so far as the unborn are concerned.  It is pro-life in so far as the mother is concerned <Col N="885" /> as well.  That is what we are trying to convey in this amendment.  I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say unequivocally that it would be an act of national economic treachery for this <Col N="889" /> Government to fail to respond in a coherent and considered way to the crisis facing Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>It may be asking a bit much to expect anything coherent and considered from this Government.  This debate takes place on a day when the Taoiseach has deliberately accused one of his senior Ministers of, in effect, committing perjury at the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry.  It is hard to imagine any more serious charge being levelled by one Government Minister against another, and it would be impossible in any normal Government to imagine such a charge being levelled without a resignation either being sought or offered. However this is no normal Government.</P>
      <P>This is a Government which fought and won a Supreme Court action to uphold the principle of Cabinet confidentiality, based as it is on the constitutional principle of collective Cabinet responsibility. Within weeks of securing that victory in the Supreme Court, this has become a Government which make a complete and total mockery of the principle it sought to uphold.</P>
      <P>In this Government, there are two principal protagonists.  They both see themselves as hurtling together towards a narrow door set in a brick wall.  One of them is going to go through, and the other will crash headlong into the brick wall of political oblivion.  All they care about is elbowing each other out of the way &mdash; the economy, the social fabric of our community, the major political issues of the day, even old fashioned concepts of political honour and integrity, all take second place in this headlong rush to secure political survival.</P>
      <P>It has long since ceased to be in the national interest that this Government should survive.  Indeed, I believe it is long past time that this sordid and disreputable Government should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main purpose this evening, however, is to try to persuade whatever shred of principle remains in this Government to start taking at least one issue seriously.  The crisis facing Aer Lingus <Col N="890" /> demands nothing less than a united response from this House and the Government.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of my contribution this evening, I want to make the point that I do not see this motion in any way as a case of special pleading for Aer Lingus.  I have always been, and will remain, a committed supporter of public enterprise.  I believe that public enterprise has played a major role in the development of the Irish economy since the foundation of the State; and that it can, will, and must play a significant role in our recovery and future development.</P>
    <P>I also believe very strongly that public enterprise must be just as accountable as any firm in the private sector; that it must be just as well managed; and that it must be rewarded for its best efforts and penalised for its mistakes.  In short, it is essential to separate the social and commercial aspects of any public enterprise from each other and to make commercial decisions on the basis of the soundest possible commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>There is one other criterion which must be applied in the consideration of any issue that affects public enterprise.  That criterion is the public and national interest.  There might well be times in the life of a public company when the public and national interest demands decisions that are not congenial or palatable to the company or its workforce.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to make it abundantly clear that the Labour Party is not motivated in moving this motion by any consideration other than our best belief of where Ireland's national interest lies. Against that background, I will repeat my assertion that it would be economic and political sabotage of the national interest for the Government to allow Aer Lingus to face this crisis alone.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years, the present Government and their immediate predecessor have followed a policy of forcing Aer Lingus to subsidise, albeit indirectly, the operations of a small private competitor. This policy was carried out in the name of competition, but was in fact a policy motivated by ideological spite towards the national airline.  At least two <Col N="891" /> of the present Minister's immediate predecessors have given direct instructions to Aer Lingus the sole purpose of which was to favour Ryanair at Aer Lingus's expense.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence to suggest that the present Minister has brought the same attitude to bear in the recent dealings with Aer Lingus.  Over the five years since 1987, and particularly since the Gulf War, it has become increasingly apparent that national aviation issues require a detailed policy response; and it has become increasingly clear that this Government have no interest in anything other than <i>ad hoc</i> crisis management.</P>
    <P>It may not be fair to blame the present Minister entirely since she has been in the job only since February, and can be said to have inherited the bias of her predecessors.  Of course, the Minister does work for a Taoiseach who believes that policy on major national issues can consist of off-the-cuff one-liners &mdash; it is only when he wants to insult and provoke his partners in Government that he resorts to scripted notes.</P>
    <P>It is not possible however, to exonerate the Minister from responsibility entirely. Almost on the first day she came into office the Minister announced that she would be taking all the necessary decisions to put Ireland's tourism infrastructure on the best possible footing and particularly that decisions could be expected imminently from her in relation to the Shannon stop-over.  I remember her saying, because this matter was of such vital importance to tourism and aviation in general, that the decision would definitely be made by her before Easter of this year but instead it has taken her until today to make an announcement that has been promised for months.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement about the Shannon stop-over.  I never believed that a Government decision to desert Shannon would help Aer Lingus and I have always argued that the Shannon issue should be treated as an issue of regional rather than aviation policy, but I condemn the dithering in which the Minister has indulged on this <Col N="892" /> issue.  She has allowed and encouraged fear of the future, and uncertainty about the prospects of economic survival, to prevail throughout the mid-west for far longer than was necessary and she has set one region of the country against another in a way that has been most unhelpful for the economic development of both regions.</P>
    <P>Many people will be pleased that the Minister has preserved the Shannon stop-over, but how long can it last if there are no aircraft to fly in and out and no carrier to use the airport?  The Minister on radio today said she believed in balanced regional development.  In saying that she was accepting the onus, whether she likes it or not, of addressing the Aer Lingus crisis as seriously as the Shannon crisis has been belatedly addressed.  The Minister has, of course, taken one other step which has greatly inhibited public debate and awareness in relation to these issues. She has effectively placed a gag on the boards of the State companies under her control and has prevented them from discussing issues of great public importance in the public arena.  It is an inevitable consequence of this peculiar and somewhat undemocratic approach that a crisis, such as the crisis which is now confronting Aer Lingus, will unfortunately take the public unawares when it finally erupts as it is doing before our eyes.  It would have been far better, from the point of view of the development of public policy, if it had been possible for companies moving into difficult positions to have been more open about those positions from an early stage.</P>
    <P>No one in this House should doubt the fact that the future of Aer Lingus is in the balance.  If Aer Lingus's financial position was far healthier than it is and if its fleet requirements for the mediumterm future had already been met, the position would still be difficult because of the advent of deregulation within Europe.  Aer Lingus's problem is therefore a two-fold one: how to recover from its present difficult financial position and how best to equip itself to meet an infinitely more competitive future.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense of the most gross kind <Col N="893" /> to argue that the State has no role to play in resolving these two problems.  If the State now turns its back on Aer Lingus, we will simply have no national airline in the very near future.  I cannot think of one sane or rational reason anyone would argue that it would be in Ireland's national interest to allow its national airline to die.</P>
    <P>In the years since it was founded the State has invested just under £70 million in Aer Lingus.  In return the Irish taxpayer owns a company worth more than £600 million which employs almost 14,000 people world-wide, half of them in Ireland.  To put it another way, that is an average investment by the State of £1 million in Aer Lingus per annum.  In terms of Irish jobs, it represents a cost per job of £9,200.  The State recouped almost 100 per cent of its total investment in Aer Lingus last year alone in PAYE and PRSI.</P>
    <P>Whether that is looked at on the basis of investment strategy or industrial policy strategy, the return that the State has got from its investment in Aer Lingus is quite remarkable.  In short, it is impossible to sustain an argument that the people of Ireland have not got value for their money.  This takes no account of the balance of payments surplus that Aer Lingus has earned, of the enormous investment in Ireland by the Aer Lingus Pension Fund, worth over £200 million, of the spending on goods and services in Ireland, including the payment of airport charges directly to the State, which added up to £120 million last year alone.</P>
    <P>Of course, figures only convey part of the picture.  The economy at national, regional and local level depends on Aer Lingus and has benefited greatly from Aer Lingus.  The tourism industry, which has been targeted by successive Governments as the single biggest area of our economy with growth potential, would be devastated without the input it receives from the national airline.</P>
    <P>This Government have announced again and again that their first economic task is the regeneration of the economy to provide wealth and investment.  Only this morning, at the beef tribunal, when <Col N="894" /> he was not busy stabbing his Coalition partners in the back, the Taoiseach attempted to be very eloquent about the need for value-added in the economy. Every Fianna Fáil manifesto since 1987 has emphasised the same point.</P>
    <P>Here we have a company which has led the way in adding value, not only through its tourism acquisitions in other parts of Europe and the United States, but also through the development of TEAM Aer Lingus, which has created 2,000 jobs at the very frontiers of high technology. Yet, the only response the Taoiseach can make, when asked about the future of the company, is to suggest that 49 per cent of it be flogged off to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>How is it possible for a Taoiseach, who has a track record as a successful businessman, to so easily dismiss all of the strategic issues that surround Aer Lingus and its development?  If a management consultant were to have presented a report to the Taoiseach, during the years when he was building up his own business, that suggested to him that the way to solve any temporary financial problems was to strip the most lucrative assets away from his company and hand them over to his competitor, I would venture to suggest that that would be the last time the Taoiseach would ever employ that management consultant.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's response to the crisis of Aer Lingus was sadly another unfortunate example of his glib, unthinking and cavalier approach to any issue of major importance.  This Taoiseach, it appears, does not know the difference between partnership and privatisation, between strategic alliances and asset-stripping, or perhaps he just does not care at this stage.  He is at his most revealing when saying the first thing that comes into his head and what he has revealed about his grasp of Ireland's national interest in this area does not bode well for the future of Aer Lingus and this country.</P>
    <P>So let me make the point again for his benefit if nobody else's &mdash; the crisis facing Aer Lingus will not disappear with a wave of the Taoiseach's hand.  It requires the <Col N="895" /> Government to get stuck in with a coherent and considered response, and that response must include the recognition that if it takes several years to solve Aer Lingus's problem and to equip our national airline to face the future with confidence, then the Government must stand behind the company four square throughout that time.</P>
    <P>The unions representing employees in Aer Lingus recognise the difficulties that the company faces.  They recognise, and have said so explicitly, that in any package which is put together the unions can and will play their part as they have done in the past.  They know that the cost structure of the company is one of the issues that has to be addressed and they are prepared to sit down with the company and negotiate, in a serious way, the measures necessary to ensure the company's viability in so far as they are within their control.  The unions also insist, and they are quite right to do so, that they are not going to indulge in a game of cat-and-mouse with the Government.  It is not possible for anyone to take the Government's position seriously until it is fully and comprehensively spelled out.</P>
    <P>In spelling out that policy the Government cannot ignore the issue of equity. Additional funding is necessary to enable the company to modernise its fleet and equipment, and without that modernisation long term survival is not possible. Even if the answer were privatisation, and I would argue strenuously that it is not, additional equity would be essential to prepare the company for that eventuality.  The Government should begin this process by saying clearly &mdash; I hope in this House &mdash; that they are willing to maintain the strength of Aer Lingus and their investment in Aer Lingus as part of whatever package is negotiated by agreeing to make the necessary injection of capital as part of next year's public capital programme and, if necessary, for the following two or three years in order to sustain our national airline.</P>
    <P>We should not be under any illusion.  I said earlier that if Aer Lingus was a cash-rich <Col N="896" /> company it would still face many difficulties and challenges in the coming years.  On 1 January next under a new era in European-wide deregulation every airline in Europe will have to effect cost reductions.  Every airline in Europe will have to achieve a proper balance between cost and revenue, between brand image and the return on that image, between route management and all the social factors that must be taken into account. For some the strategy they will have to follow will be to seek to expand as fast as possible, probably gobbling up smaller airlines en route.  For others, the only viable strategy will be to achieve a dominant position in what is known as the niche market which can be protected into the future through a combination of brand image and customer loyalty.</P>
    <P>All of Europe's airlines will have to face certain realities in a deregulation environment and these can be fairly simply stated.  The first is that airlines that keep their costs under tight control will have strong advantage; second, despite low costs airlines will have to continue to improve standards; third, there will be a lot more competition for passengers and customer loyalty will not survive excessively high fares; fourth, it will be a great deal easier to protect a niche in the market-place if the airline involved has a strong, highly developed tourism package backed up by the requisite infrastructure.  Fifth, deregulation opens the way, to a far greater extent than ever before, for charter carriers to compete on the basis of lower prices and lower costs than all regular carriers.  The bottom line in all of this is that it will be those airlines with the strongest financial and capital base that will be best equipped to meet these challenges.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has been a net contributor to our economy for many years.  The staff have made many sacrifices in the past to ensure that the company remained a net contributor to our economy.  They have indicated their willingness to approach the future realistically and the least they are entitled to expect from this House and Government is an unequivocal statement <Col N="897" /> of support as they face a difficult and challenging future.</P>
    <P>In calling on the Government now to make that commitment, we demand that they set aside any ideological bias they have toward Aer Lingus.  We demand that the Government recognise there is a bounden national responsibility on them to assist Aer Lingus in the most positive way possible, by reassuring the company that its capital base will be strengthened to the extent necessary to enable the company face the future with confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in seconding the motion before the House. It is my hope that tomorrow evening this House, having considered the various points advanced, will be unanimous in putting forward proposals to the Minister and Government that will enable Aer Lingus put in place the type of structure necessary to ensure its continuity.  We should not lose sight of the fact that over the years Aer Lingus has made a major contribution to the development of our society at local, national and international levels.</P>
      <P>The aviation industry worldwide has witnessed unparalleled growth and change since the deregulation agreement was introduced in America in 1978. However, the principles of a market economy and competition, at the heart of that agreement, have been less than a qualified success.  It is true that consumers have benefited from lower air fares but at the expense of enormous social upheaval worldwide, with hundreds of thousands of workers made redundant.  Mergers, take-overs, bankruptcies and liquidations have been monthly occurrences as some 196 carriers went to the wall in America between 1978 and 1991.  The industry in America was in the red to the tune of US$ 2.7 billion in 1991 and I understand the position is no better now.  Unfortunately, similar circumstances are beginning to unfold in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these developments the Government must be condemned out of hand for failing completely to produce a coherent policy on aviation, particularly <Col N="898" /> when they knew that the deregulation of air transport would become fully effective on 1 January 1993.  If the Minister had been unhappy with the approach of Aer Lingus management &mdash; which she made clear last week when she met them &mdash; to their future as our national airline why did she not appoint aviation industry consultants to outline in detail the options for Aer Lingus in the context of the national interest, including tourism considerations? The last time we heard of a policy was in 1985 when the then Government produced a Green Paper.  To date we have had nothing except piecemeal developments of what could be classified as constituting policy.  For the last three years successive Ministers for Transport have come to this House and stonewalled when answering questions on Government policy in relation to the future of State enterprises.</P>
    <P>However, from experience, we have discovered that there is a hidden policy, that of privatisation.  When the decision to license Ryanair was taken in the mideighties the objective was to secure lower consumer fares on the Dublin-London route without damaging Aer Lingus or sea transport companies.  If the Minister cares to analyse passenger movements between Ireland and Britain before and after the licensing of Ryanair, she will discover there has been no direct net increase in passenger numbers; rather what happened was a simple transfer from sea to air transport.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-London route, once profitable, is now a major loss for Aer Lingus.  What has happened on this route over the past two years is unsustainable. Not only does the Minister know this but she has refused to take any action to correct it other than attack Aer Lingus when their back is to the wall.  Indeed it must be pointed out that it was not Aer Lingus who struck the initial fares; they responded on the basis of figures filtering through to their offices showing they were losing passengers on the route.  Last year the withdrawal of British Airways underlined the lack of profitability on that route.  If British Airways, who have slashed their manpower levels following <Col N="899" /> privatisation could not make a profit how could Aer Lingus, or Aer Lingus competing with Ryanair, sustain fares as low as £58 return, in any period other than off-season?  It should be noted that the Chairman of British Midlands, Sir Maurice Bishop, has been drawn into this controversy, saying he will take the case of Aer Lingus to the EC if they do not increase their fares.</P>
    <P>There is no possibility that Ryanair could expand from their present low-base operations.  It would be better if the two airlines would agree that services on the Dublin-London route be provided at a reasonable profit.  The Minister, as regulator, and senior Minister responsible for Aer Lingus, must intervene ensuring that sanity prevails and profitability is restored to both airlines.</P>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor made a major mistake in taking Aer Lingus off the Stansted route in 1989.  In regard to landing charges, Ryanair's landing charge at Stansted is £91.15 whereas Aer Lingus must pay £398.30 for a Boeing 737 at Heathrow.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated recently that for Aer Lingus to overcome their current difficulties and secure their future all that would be required was to find a European partner.  However, in the next breath he suggested that 49 per cent of the company could be privatised.  If the Taoiseach meant that a European airline could have a substantial stake in Aer Lingus that would be acceptable, but we are opposed to privatisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the crisis facing Aer Lingus cannot be worked out solely within the company.  In her own way she has washed her hands of the matter.  Basically what she is saying is that the board of Aer Lingus are responsible, that they should come up with the solutions and hand them to her.</P>
    <P>Government involvement and a fresh injection of equity is required.  Last week the Government rushed an Estimate through the Dáil which we supported, to provide £50 million to help businesses affected by the devaluation of sterling. This was done without breaching the <Col N="900" /> national borrowing targets for this year. Are we to believe that the Government are not prepared to get involved in providing the resources and policies necessary to protect the future of the fourth largest employer in the State, employing more than 7,000 in Ireland and a further 6,000 worldwide?</P>
    <P>Earlier today the Minister introduced a package aimed at securing the future of Shannon.  I am now calling on her to provide the necessary finance for Aer Lingus to secure the future of Dublin Airport and its workforce.  The privatisation of Aer Lingus will come about by allowing the airline to bleed to death by starving the company of equity capital until the new deregulated regime comes into force next January which will restrict greatly the possibility of State investment in national airlines.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what some European airlines have been doing to meet the new market.  Air France have bought their domestic in-flight competitor, which was privately owned, to strengthen their home market base.  They have acquired a 40 per cent stake in Sabena, the Belgian national carrier, and have also taken a stake in Czechoslovak airlines.  British Airways and KLM have failed to agree the terms of a partnership, but both continue to seek one.  The largest European airline, Lufthansa, have embarked on a policy of increased services while recently being forced to reduce costs because of the recession.  However, the financial director of Lufthansa recently stated that the key policy issue was a strategy for the future and not simply current profitability or losses.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the EC report on the evaluation of aid schemes established in favour of Community air services.  It acknowledges the problems that existed during and after the Gulf crisis.  It refers to Sabena and Air France and states that the Commission wants to create, as of 1993, a level playing field for competition &mdash; as one of my constituency colleagues said this must have been written by an Irishman &mdash; but it acknowledges that some airlines carrying the financial burden of the past must have the oppor- <Col N="901" /> tunity of a fresh start provided this does not adversely affect the position of competitors. The report also refers to State owned companies and states that the Commission acknowledges that State-owned companies may have a justifiable need for additional own capital to realise an investment programme necessary to improve their efficiency and competitiveness. The first tranche of the capital increase to Air France in 1991 is an example of that.</P>
    <P>Here we have examples of two companies whose Governments had the foresight and commitment to put forward proposals to help them out of their difficulties. That makes a lie of the assertions by right wing economists that we can do nothing in this country for fear of the EC.  Provision can be made to help companies and we should work towards that aim.  Aer Lingus carried 75 per cent of the total number of visitors to Ireland by air in 1991, an increase from 51 per cent in 1986.  This figure alone indicates that if Aer Lingus are forced by the Government to adopt a policy of asset disposal, reduction in services and no equity, Irish tourism will be massively damaged.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that last Friday a report was published by the Government tourism task force, chaired by Mr. Padraig Ó Huigín, Secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach, acknowledging the role of Aer Lingus in tourism and recommending that the Government invest in Aer Lingus.  Given Ireland's peripheral location within the EC the task force recommend that the European Community should be approached to assist Aer Lingus in the provision of their replacement fleet, the cost of which is a major burden on the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that Aer Lingus have served this country exceptionally well over the past 50 years.  State investment in the company has been relatively modest at £68.6 million.  The result of that investment is to be seen in many areas &mdash; in Cork, Limerick and Dublin and particularly north county Dublin. The effects of the present proposals would be detrimental to the livelihood of thousands of families.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> In recent years Dublin has been discriminated against in terms of jobs.  In real terms Dublin has lost out in terms of industrial jobs and services.  If the Minister goes ahead with this proposal the greater Dublin area will be decimated.  I ask the Minister to consider the proposals in real terms and to take note of what we are requesting in this motion.  I hope that some of my constituency colleagues, who advocate the same line I am taking, will support the proposal I put forward.  I hope that the Minister, having looked after Shannon, will also look after the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;acknowledging the role played by Aer Lingus over the years in the development of Ireland's trade and tourism</P>
      <P>&mdash;appreciating the contribution of its employees over the years in enabling the airline to fulfil that role</P>
      <P>&mdash;recognising the serious financial difficulties currently facing Aer Lingus</P>
      <P>&mdash;noting that it is a matter for the Board in the first instance to determine the urgent remedial action necessary to restore the airline to profitability</P>
      <P>&mdash;noting the Government's objectives of job maintenance and job creation</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>supports the Government's air transport policy as being in the best interests of the Irish economy and supports the <Col N="903" /> Government's view that the airline should maintain employment at the maximum possible level, consistent with maintaining a viable commercial operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not only pleased that this motion has been put down today, I am delighted because it gives me an opportunity to place on the record of this House &mdash; and before the people &mdash; the fact that this Government have a fully integrated and well thought out air transport policy for the country.  Within that policy we have a clear vision for the role of Aer Lingus and their employees.  Not only have we the vision, we also have a proven track record of specific measures taken to achieve a strong and dynamic Aer Lingus as well as a dynamic air transport sector for our economy.</P>
    <P>In western parliamentary democracies there is a convention that one does not impugn other members of the House by attributing to them the deliberate telling of lies.  Despite the calumnies which have been perpetrated against me personally &mdash; and the Government of which I am a member &mdash; I will abide by this convention. However, there are certain untruths which I want to expose unequivocally in this House.</P>
    <P>The first untruth is that I am anti-Aer Lingus.  I am not, I have not been and I never will be.  Seán Lemass founded this great company which have carried the Irish shamrock to every corner of the world.  They have done so with the continuous support of many great Ministers of Transport and, as the custodian of that tradition, I am determined that it will continue.  The company are facing major problems, they have done so in the past and will do so again in the future.  They have surmounted these problems in the past and they can and will do so again because I will ensure that they do.  The second untruth is that I and the Government do not care about the employees of Aer Lingus.  Let me expose that for the culumny it is.  I am in politics and Government because I come from a tradition which passionately believes that Ireland's <Col N="904" /> strength is her people.  Our whole economic philosophy is built on this principle. I have consistently said that tourism is a people industry.  Let me now put firmly on the record of the House my conviction that Aer Lingus are a people company. They have been built on the quality and commitment of the staff over the past 55 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now gag them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They have survived many crises because of this.  The current staff in Aer Lingus have not only shown this commitment but have also made sacrifices, over the past two years in particular, in the interests of the company. As well as acknowledging the sacrifices I want to formally put on the record my appreciation of them.  I also want to assure them that these sacrifices will not be in vain.  The Government have the vision and the resolve not only to maintain this great company but to develop them to their full potential.</P>
      <P>The third untruth is that we do not have an integrated air transport policy. We do and it is better than the one which the Government of which Deputy Spring was a member and when they were in office not so long ago.  I will give credit where credit is due.  Fianna Fáil do not have a monopoly of great Ministers for Transport.  Deputy Jim Mitchell, when Minister for Transport, was a very good and courageous one although I disagree with some of the decisions he took.  It was he, with Deputy Spring's approval, who first licensed Ryanair to compete with Aer Lingus, which was a good decision and one which benefited the nation because of the imaginative and constructive way we built on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now once again articulate, for the benefit of Deputies opposite, exactly what our air transport policy is.  As with all policies it has been &mdash; and must be &mdash; developed against the background of trends in the world economy in general and in world aviation in particular. Ireland is a small open economy which is heavily dependent on exports to other <Col N="905" /> countries.  Our primary economic objective is job creation through economic growth and we have the policies in place to achieve this.  These are designed to create an economic and business climate conducive to confidence and enterprise within a framework of consistent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies.  It is also crucially important that we are competitive in international markets if we are to be successful.</P>
    <P>Our approach to air transport policy is based on this philosophy.  In order to prepare the Irish airline industry for the European Single Market conditions which will apply from 1 January 1993, the first objective of air transport policy has been to focus on strengthening the Irish presence on existing routes to and from Ireland and to open new opportunities for our airlines to compete in international markets.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the point that with effect from 1 January 1993 my Department will no longer have any control over the allocation of routes between carriers who meet certain criteria.  We will also not have any power to prevent any EC nationals from establishing an operation in Ireland.  My strategy, therefore, in so far as air transportation is concerned, has been to develop new opportunities for Irish airlines through the negotiation of new and extensive bilateral agreements and, within these, the pursuit of fifth freedom rights to further widen access to markets for Irish airlines.</P>
    <P>In the case of Aer Lingus I have a dual role.  First, I regulate the air transport sector in which they operate.  Second, I represent on behalf of the people the interests of the shareholder in Aer Lingus.  As regulator, I have succeeded in opening up many opportunities for Aer Lingus, not only in air transport but in all the activities of the group.  I have also safeguarded the airline's vital interests in EC negotiations.  I did so after full consultation and with the active support of the central representative council in Aer Lingus.  I wish to express my appreciation to them in that regard.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office I have concluded new bilateral agreements with Austria, <Col N="906" /> Hungary, Belarus, Malaysia, Russia and Bulgaria.  That is not a bad start for eight months.  In addition to route rights for the airline I have, as I already stated, personally instructed my officials to seek extra business opportunities across the whole range of activities in which the Aer Lingus group are involved.  To this end, a senior Aer Lingus official is part of the Government's negotiating team.</P>
    <P>The general policy and specific strategy I have outlined are an integral part of my overall policy for air transport, yet specific decisions I have taken within these parameters have been deliberately distorted to imply that I do not have a policy.  I will be more specific, I have been accused of not having an air transport policy because of my decision to license a third Irish scheduled airline and my decision to license a fourth airline to serve Waterford, Luton and Stansted. It has been further suggested that these were anti-Aer Lingus moves.</P>
    <P>I will nail these lies for what they are. The decision to allow Translift to operate a Los Angeles service was taken because Aer Lingus refused to operate the route. They had sought these rights since the late eighties and, following successful negotiations by the Government, they got them with effect from 6 September 1990.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus made specific and quantified proposals to the Government to enter into a five to seven year lease of two Boeing 767s for the Los Angeles route.  Before approving this proposal the Government questioned its wisdom because they were concerned at the proposal to acquire such expensive new aircraft. However, they were assured that it made sense for the airline in virtually any scenario of continued transatlantic operations and the Government accepted the arguments of Aer Lingus because it was a commercial decision which had the approval of the board.  There was no question of it being contingent on a regulatory change with regard to Shannon. Despite this, Aer Lingus subsequently refused to operate the Los Angeles route unless there was a change in the Shannon stop policy.  The Boeing 767s have never <Col N="907" /> been used by Aer Lingus on the trans-atlantic route.  Instead they have been leased to other airlines.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that there is considerable untapped potential for extra traffic from the west coast of the USA.  I cannot force Aer Lingus to operate this route to take advantage of that potential. That is a commercial decision for the board of Aer Lingus to take.  Equally, in the national interest, I could not refuse another Irish airline the opportunity to generate extra traffic from that region, which will generate much needed employment in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>There is specific provision in the Ireland-US bilateral agreement for multiple designation.  If I refused an Irish airline the rights to operate on a particular route, it would be open to US interests to incorporate themselves and get automatic rights and, in all probability, use US pilots and other staff.</P>
    <P>Tour operators and travel agents in the Boston areas have consistently told me that the potential for extra traffic from there was immense if they could get a low-cost operator to provide a service from Boston to Ireland.  I decided to test this assertion by providing limited extra capacity through Translift.  Indeed, I was criticised for putting such a low limit on that capacity.  I also specifically sent a senior official from my Department to meet the Boston travel trade and emphasise that I expected extra business from the extra capacity.  I did not want existing Aer Lingus business to be diluted.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to my decision in relation to Waterford Airport.  I want first to emphasise to the House that under the existing bilateral agreement with the UK, I have no power to prevent any UK airline from operating on any route between Ireland and the UK provided they meet certain financial and technical standards.  From 1 January next this will also apply to all Irish and other European airlines, both under the third EC air transport package and the European Economic Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>In so far as specific services to Waterford are concerned, I remind Deputies <Col N="908" /> that both Aer Lingus and Ryanair ceased services to that airport.  Aer Lingus have consistently refused, for commercial reasons, to resume services to Waterford Airport.  In these circumstances I cannot comprehend objections to anybody else servicing Waterford Airport, apart altogether from the fact that legally I could not prevent such services.</P>
    <P>Let me continue to articulate other elements of our air transport policy. Apart from strengthening the Irish presence on our international air routes, a further critical part of the Government's overall aviation policy is to provide and develop support infrastructure.  We have and will continue to ensure that our airports are of the highest international standard and have the capacity needed to meet the growth in traffic arising from future economic growth.</P>
    <P>We have backed this policy with resources.  Substantial investment has been put into the State airports in recent years to enable them to keep pace with traffic growth.  In the four years to the end of 1991 investment in infrastructural improvements amounted to £82 million. The projects funded in recent years were a new runway, a multistorey car park and extension of the departures and arrivals levels at Dublin Airport; extension of the terminal building and of the main runway at Cork Airport; and a new self-drive car park at Shannon Airport.  The continuing growth in traffic, particularly at Dublin Airport, which is reaching capacity levels, is due to the success of our policies. This will necessitate further substantial capital investment in infrastructure in the years immediately ahead.  We will make that investment. Projects planned at Dublin Airport include a major extension of the passenger terminal, construction of a new passenger handling pier and extension of the apron, as well as further phases of the multistorey car park.  There are also plans for improvements to the passenger terminal at Shannon and further terminal expansion at Cork Airport.  Let me put a figure on our plans.  It amounts to more than £138 million in the period up to 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have emphasised the need for competitiveness.  We have taken specific action on this front. We have frozen airport charges at their current levels since 1 April 1987.  This Government's policy is and has been to keep charges at the lowest possible levels for the main users, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in the interests of low access transport costs for tourism and other economic development.</P>
      <P>In addition to physical infrastructure, this Government have heavily invested in high technology radar and communications equipment which have revolutionised Irish air traffic control systems.  The bill for this was an additional £30 million Exchequer money. Irish controlled airspace, expanded by 50 per cent and fully covered by radar, is now among the most modern in Europe and can fully conform to the emerging plans for the harmonisation and integration of European systems.  Our modern technology ensures that we offer airlines optimum routes with minimal delays or restrictions through our airspace. Our regulatory and ATC services are among the most economical and cost effective in Europe.</P>
      <P>Despite the reported downturn in aviation, the fact is that since 1988 traffic in Irish airspace has increased by more than 30 per cent and will continue to expand. I intend to ensure that through development and investment in equipment we can fully exploit the opportunities provided by expanding air traffic.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated, I am firmly committed to the concept of regional development.  Through the Air Navigation Services Office of my Department I already have more than 300 staff in the Shannon area.  Apart from the control zones for Dublin, Cork and the regional airports, all of Irish airspace is managed from Shannon and that will continue to be the case.  Indeed, I am confident that in the future the Shannon control functions can be further developed and expanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the State airports, the <Col N="910" /> Government, in pursuit of their commitment to the regions, have also pursued an active policy of developing regional airports.  The six regional airports at Waterford, Kerry, Carnmore, Connaught, Sligo and Carrickfin are operated by private limited companies. However, this Government have already invested a total of £14.2 million Exchequer moneys in the development of these airports.  In addition, we have obtained from the EC Commission the resources for a capital development programme costing over £20 million.  This programme, which is funded jointly by the European Regional Development Fund and the airport companies, is due for completion by the end of 1993.</P>
    <P>This last point brings me to the fifth component of the Government's aviation policy.  This is to develop Ireland as a centre of excellence in aviation, with the focus primarily on Shannon.</P>
    <P>Employment in aviation and in aviation related activities in Ireland has been buoyant and is expected to expand in the coming years.  The development of a world aviation park in the Shannon area has been a major factor in this success. This caters for industries involved in the manufacture, service and repair of aircraft, spares and components and also developments in relation to attracting additional aviation services from Eastern Europe.  The aviation park has already got off to a good start and it is estimated that about 5,000 people will be employed there by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>I outlined earlier my role as a regulator. Let me now deal with my role as a shareholder.  As I stated in this House during the Adjournment Debate last Wednesday, I have been concerned for some time at the continuing deterioration in the financial performance of Aer Lingus, particularly in its core air transport business.  I have repeatedly made this concern known to the chairman and management of the airline.</P>
    <P>The air transport division of Aer Lingus lost more than £80 million in the past two years and is facing major losses again this year.  This is despite a cost reduction programme which my predecessor <Col N="911" /> was assured would get the airline into a breakeven situation.  This programme was introduced almost two years ago to counteract the effects of the economic recession and the Gulf War.  It was still being negotiated well into this year.</P>
    <P>Other airlines took fast and immediate action to deal with these problems.  Aer Lingus took over 18 months to make a full response and it is still a long way short of sufficient.  I must acknowledge that the problems are at least being tackled now so I will say no more on this.  Suffice it to say that it is clear that urgent remedial action is necessary to restore the airline to profit.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised for not giving specific proposals to the board of Aer Lingus to solve these problems.  It is quite correct to say that I have not done so &mdash; that is not my job.  That is the responsibility of the board of Aer Lingus.  When the board have produced specific proposals then I, as the shareholder's representative, will carefully examine them.</P>
    <P>Apart from the untruths about aviation policy which I have already dealt with, there are some other myths about that I would like to dispel here and now.  One of these is that the Government have invested only £74 million in Aer Lingus. This is not the true picture.  I have here independent professional advice from a major corporate firm to prove it.  The fact is that the Government's direct investment in Aer Lingus in today's prices is equivalent to £612 million.  The State's investment in Aer Lingus is far greater than the direct capital investment when retained earnings are taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from some small dividend payments in recent years, the Government as shareholders have left their investment in Aer Lingus to be used for growth.  Other companies have achieved more with less.  By way of example, a recent newspaper report showed that Guinness Ireland now has an net worth of almost £0.5 billion on an investment of £16.2 million by the shareholders.  This shows what can be achieved when a company generates consistent profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet another misconception making the rounds is that Aer Lingus have a value of between £600 million and £700 million. I do not know where these figures are <Col N="913" /> emanating from.  I wonder if the people making these claims have looked recently at Aer Lingus's annual accounts.</P>
    <P>I have here a set of the Aer Lingus Accounts for the latest financial year ended 31 March 1992.  These show clearly that the net worth of the Aer Lingus Group at March 1992 was not £600 million or £700 million but £361 million approximately.  This is a substantial reduction on the previous year's level of £399 million.  With the continuing high level airline losses and other adverse factors, a further reduction in the company's net worth must be anticipated. That is why I have expressed my concern to the board as the shareholder's representative. That is why the board are now taking corrective measures to turn the company around.</P>
    <P>With the commitment and co-operation of the Aer Lingus workforce we will succeed.  Many people conveniently ignore the fact that the Government's investment in Aer Lingus has not just been confined to its investment as a shareholder.  For example, in the period 1983 to 1986, additional once-off funding was made available by the Government amounting to £14 million in respect of the trans-Atlantic operation.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus have also been extensively supported by the Government through the IDA.  TEAM Aer Lingus have had two separate projects aided by the Industrial Development Authority to a total amount of over £13 million.  Airmotive, both on their own and in respect of their joint venture with Pratt &amp; Whitney, have received total IDA aid amounting to £15.8 million.</P>
    <P>On top of this, Aer Lingus have received, via the Government, extensive EC funding for their training programmes over the years.  For example, Aer Lingus have benefited from EC training grants of £5.6 million in the period since 1986.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government have over the years given very substantial State guarantees in respect of Aer Lingus' borrowing. I have heard it said recently that the Government should not have allowed Aer Lingus to borrow some £500 million <Col N="914" /> for fleet replacement.  People who make such claims misunderstand the role of the board.  Let me put the record straight on this right now.</P>
    <P>The Government certainly had concerns about the fleet acquisition proposals of Aer Lingus and made their concerns clear to the company.  This was countered with cogent arguments from the board as to why the acquisition should go ahead.  Detailed and comprehensive economic justification was provided in each case.  I have already explained what happened in regard to the Boeing 767s for the Los Angeles route.</P>
    <P>This Government and previous ones, including the previous Coalition Government, made it very clear when Aer Lingus were looking for approval to acquire aircraft that the acquisitions must be funded without recourse to Government equity or State guarantees of borrowing. This condition was accepted by the board of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The large debt burden now faced by Aer Lingus highlights the need for the company to strengthen its corporate planning procedures, particularly in a cyclical business such as commercial air transport.  I have urged them to do so. There is no doubt that if Aer Lingus' European fleet had been replaced in a more gradual manner over a longer period of years, the current problems might not be so serious.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Aer Lingus' debt burden, although a serious impediment, is not at the core of the difficulties confronting the company at the present time. The most serious problems facing the company is the level of airline losses.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the Minister for Finance has already made clear on several occasions that the position of the Exchequer finances is such that the Government are not currently in a position to invest additional equity in semi-State companies, including Aer Lingus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, such investment would not make sense unless the airline can produce a credible <Col N="915" /> plan showing that this business will be operated profitably so as to produce a return to any investment.  The days of free equity are gone.  Indeed EC competition rules preclude this.</P>
      <P>Both I and my predecessors have down the years encouraged Aer Lingus to develop linkages with foreign airlines with a view to improving access to international markets as well as achieving additional earnings in areas such as maintenance, overhaul and training.  These objectives can be achieved in a number of ways, such as minority cross investments, joint venture agreements and service contracts.  No proposals for such minority cross investments or joint venture agreements have been received by me.  I have always made it clear that, if such a proposal were to emerge, I would give it every support.</P>
      <P>There is noting new in these ideas.  In fact, Deputy Jim Mitchell when he was Minister responsible for Aer Lingus in 1987, raised the question of private participation in the airline.  Aer Lingus were also looking for more equity at that time. Let me quote a brief passage from his speech to the Chartered Institute of Transport in that year:</P>
      <P>If Aer Lingus needs substantial funds to expand, protect present employment and perhaps create more jobs in the future then I would not stand in the way of private shareholders up to 49 per cent.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House again that this was stated by Deputy Jim Mitchell when he was Minister in 1987 &mdash; in the Government in which Deputy Spring was a partner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much controversy over the question of a partial sale of shares in Aer Lingus recently.  Let me stress once more that proposals for a viable future for the airline are, in the first instance, a matter for the board.  What I can say, and I say so publicly in this House, is that we would welcome such proposals.  Finally, I want to put it on the record of the House that, in formulating proposals for dealing with the current crisis, I have asked the board to be particularly sensitive to the <Col N="916" /> need to maintain employment in Ireland. Rather than see large numbers of staff laid off, I want to be assured that every other avenue has been explored.  I want to see a range of options explored and costed which show the effect of different measures rather than be presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  Put in simple terms, it is clear that Aer Lingus problems must be tackled on two fronts &mdash; increasing yield and reducing costs.</P>
    <P>While calling for an increase in yields may seem incompatible with the interests of tourism, this is not the case.  Our long term interests are best served not only by competitive but also economically sustainable fares which will provide the necessary resources for the long term development of our Irish airline industry. For some time I have been very concerned about the low level of fares charged by both Aer Lingus and Ryanair on the Dublin-London routes.  These fares are suicidal in the long term and I have, therefore been calling for an increase in the lowest fares charged by both airlines.</P>
    <P>In so far as the costs are concerned, I have emphasised to the board that I want to see the maximum employment possible which is compatible with the Aer Lingus's commercial viability.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Government is to sustain and create jobs.  That is what I want Aer Lingus to do when it solves, as it will, its current problems.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I urge the House to support the Government amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House following her handbagging escapades of last Thursday.  I should like to stitch into the record the need for statements of the kind we heard from the Minister at Dublin Airport, on RTÉ, in Luxembourg etc., on Government policy &mdash; or the absence thereof &mdash; to be made in this Chamber of the democratically elected Parliament.  It is offensive to democracy as well as to the national Parliament and the people that the Minister <Col N="917" /> so frequently engages in bland public relations exercises rather than making important contributions on her policy, if any, to the House.  When would we have had this urgent and important debate on Aer Lingus if it had not been chosen by the Labour Party for Private Members' time this week?  There was no indication from the Minister at any stage that she wished to make a policy statement within the confines of this Chamber.</P>
      <P>We have listened attentively for 30 minutes to the Minister's response to the crisis in Aer Lingus but we heard nothing about jobs, funding or that a plan would be produced and published within a month to deal with matters affecting Aer Lingus. The most important point, continuously referred to by the Minister, was the contribution to our aviation policy of Fine Gael's Deputy Jim Mitchell who, I am sure she would concede, was the best Minister for Transport in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the comments emanating from the beef tribunal this afternoon I would hazard a guess that the people might not have to wait too long before they have a choice to nominate Deputy Jim Mitchell to take responsibility &mdash; in which the Minister is lacking &mdash; of a Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be for the people to decide.  We do not intend amending the Labour Party motion but rather adding the following paragraph to what has been proposed by Deputies Spring, Kemmy and Ryan:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;, such policy to include the introduction of legislation to allow Aer Lingus commercial freedom to enter into cross investments with other airlines; to provide for the issue of shares to private investors in order to meet its capital requirements, to enable Aer Lingus to enter into joint marketing arrangements and alliances to develop new routes and achieve cost reductions with a view to placing the national airline on a sound financial footing, thereby <Col N="918" /> protecting jobs in the airline and ensuring an efficient and competitive air transport service to and from the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to address three questions to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications.  Why did she and her Government get us into this mess with regard to Aer Lingus?  Second, why is she now engaging in national sabotage, undermining confidence in the workforce of Aer Lingus and putting off potential investors?  Third, why has no aviation policy been prepared either by the Minister or her predecessors over the past five years?  Is it because she and her Government are bankrupt of ideas and she now chooses to look for a scapegoat in the workforce of Aer Lingus?  Since the Green Paper published in November 1985 by a previous Coalition Government on all aspects of air transport, there has been no follow-up either by way of a White Paper or a Government policy statement on aviation matters.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this debate that the Government have no aviation policy, no plan, no vision, no co-ordinated approach.  For the first time at political level there is a need for an urgent overall policy and strategy for the aviation sector.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael are the only party with a national aviation policy, a policy which was devised following extensive consultation, negotiation and cross-fertilisation of ideas with a wide-range of people in the aviation industry.</P>
    <P>Our primary objective for the aviation sector is that Ireland should have an efficient and competitive air transport service.  This involves developing routes necessary to sustain the growth of our tourist and commercial sectors.  We will only have a competitive and efficient air transport service if we deliver on four key objectives.</P>
    <P>First, we must ensure the survival of Aer Lingus as the national flag carrier for Ireland.  Second, we must develop Irish international &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; for passenger and freight services which will ensure that we have major aviation centres here.  This is <Col N="919" /> based on the fact that Ireland's geographic location is suitable as a pivotal gateway for traffic to the East as well as to the West.  Third, we must establish a clear policy for Ireland at EC level.  I am surprised the Minister did not advert to her role within the European Community. It would appear that we do not have any line on the process of liberalisation of air transport within the European Community.  This is particularly important in view of the deregulation which will take effect on 1 January 1993.  Fourth, we must develop an adequate short haul air route network between domestic airlines.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have become paralysed by indecision.  It is amazing that no constructive suggestion was made by the Minister either last week in her visit to the board meeting or tonight in response to the crisis.  Threats emanating from political party meetings to fire the board or to bring in Commissioner Ray MacSharry do little to address the problems.  Was the Minister joking when she adverted to such suggestions in Luxembourg?  Is this some kind of farce we heard from Government circles in recent weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister meant Deputy Ray Burke and not Commissioner Ray MacSharry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That might do something for the crippling difficulties being experienced by Aer Lingus.  Many of the problems in Aer Lingus are global but some are peculiar to Aer Lingus and need to be addressed in a concise policy statement of the type envisaged in the motion. To put it starkly, if Aer Lingus were an airline company only they would now be in liquidation.  The Minister has no right to exclusively blame staff in Aer Lingus when it is a fact that the Government have prevented the company from operating successfully over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the workforce of Aer Lingus is concerned, it cannot be over-stressed that sacrifices of considerable significance <Col N="920" /> have been made in recent years.  Industrial relations have been exemplary having regard to the many demands for salary moderation, new pay scales with lower starting points, the foregoing of increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as well as changes in staffing levels and increased flexibility in work practices.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to offer in response to the sacrifices made by the employees in recent times?  It is grossly offensive to the workforce at Aer Lingus that there is no plan or policy on the airline, and no rescue package to date in respect of likely job losses which will have a devastating effect on the economy. More than anything else the problems of Aer Lingus have stemmed from the necessary purchase by them of 28 new aircraft at a cost of over £500 million. Added to this is the urgent need to replace the ageing fleet of jumbo jets which will require an investment of £150 million within the next five years.  The payment by Aer Lingus of interest on loans in respect of fleet replacement has had a crippling effect on the company.  It is in this area that the refusal by the Government to invest significantly has led directly to the crisis.  An immediate rescue package must be put together. This can only be done by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to today's decision on the Shannon stopover, with specific reference to the fleet replacement requirements of Aer Lingus for jumbo jets over the next five years.  Does the Minister realistically believe that under present circumstances jumbo jets, the property of Aer Lingus, will compulsorily land at Shannon within the next five years?  Will Aer Lingus have the planes?</P>
    <P>In relation to today's stopover decision, what about the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies which examined in depth the Shannon stopover airbusiness in recent years?  What about the recently leaked Tourism Task Force Report which recommended that direct air services into Ireland on the North Atlantic Route should be shared between <Col N="921" /> Shannon and the west and the generation of additional direct line traffic into Ireland.  The Minister is clearly ignoring this advice, or is it true to say, as she said on Saturday last, that the report arrived on her desk on Friday.  Is it still on the Minister's desk, unread?  In view of what the Minister has said today in relation to the Shannon stopover, I doubt that this decision can be regarded as final.  The debate will have to continue, as the information on all the related matters has not been published, all the data are not out in the open and until such time as this happens, this matter will not be resolved.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the long-term future of Aer Lingus will only be secured by significant private investment, most probably by way of partnership in a joint venture with another airline.  Aer Lingus are the only European air carrier that do not have or are not contemplating outside share participation.  Only Tap Air in Portugal and Al Italia in Italy retain 100 per cent State ownership.  Many European State airlines have a significant non-Government equity investment.  For example, Swiss Air have 77 per cent non-Government investment; Scandinavian Airlines have 50 per cent non-Government investment; Sabena have 47 per cent non-Government investment and they have a recapitalisation programme.  In Greece, legislation is expected to allow for a 49 per cent sale in Olympic Airlines equity this year; Lufthansa have 45 per cent non-Government investment; KLM have 61 per cent non-Government investment; Iberia plan to partially float their company; Finnair have 24 per cent non-Government investment; British Airways have 100 per cent non-Government investment.  There is a BNP proposal to buy over 8.8 per cent shares in Air France and Aerflot &mdash; my friends on the left might remember Aerflot &mdash; and British Airways are considering a proposal for a joint venture participation.</P>

      <P>The estimated expenses over the coming years are staggering.  The <Col N="922" /> total capital requirement within five years is to the order of £7 million.  It is further estimated that from the period 1996 to the year 2000, an additional £600 million capital will be required.  These sums are enormous and it is clear that Aer Lingus will not have the borrowing capacity to proceed along these lines and, therefore, an alternative capital source must be found.  As sole shareholder the Government's policy on equity investment is of paramount importance.  There appears to be no Government policy on the matter of EC funding for air transport.  The Minister will, I am sure, agree that regional policy is vital for the survival of Ireland's national airline.  Why therefore, has no application being made for Structural Funds for the air transport business? There is no reason why the craft fleet replacement should not be eligible for European funding on the basis that air access to this country, an island, is a vital aspect of our regional policy.</P>
      <P>The Government recently allowed an extraordinary suicidal state of affairs to develop on the Dublin-London route.  At one stage six airlines operated the route on which fares were slashed to grossly uneconomic levels, to allow Aer Lingus wipe out the competition.  The ending by British Airways &mdash; now one of the most efficient and successful airlines in the world &mdash; of their Dublin-London service should have triggered the necessary alarm bells with Aer Lingus and the Minister. This, regrettably, did not happen and the Dublin-London war cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The influential Boston Consulting Group stated that cost cutting alone would not be sufficient to resolve air transport losses for Aer Lingus.  Apart from the global depression in the airline industry, Aer Lingus are hampered by high maintenance costs and airport charges.  Aer Lingus have in the recent past imposed a cost cutting programme and it is fair to say that they cannot operate under the current fare structure policy operated by the Government.  What the airline needs is greater flexibility on fares so as to maintain viability along certain routes.  Market sources are such that the <Col N="923" /> airline must be given commercial price freedom in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have a number of policy proposals which the Government must consider in the context of the Aer Lingus crisis.  We propose that a corporation development plan be set out for Aer Lingus over a ten-year period.  The objective of this should be to make Aer Lingus part of a super carrier in the new air transport globalisation process.  In order to meet the huge capital needs of the airline Aer Lingus must have the commercial freedom to enter into cross investments with other airlines in line with the European trend.  The Government should issue additional shares to private interests in order to increase the capital available to the company while retaining a major shareholding on behalf of the Irish people.  This must also include an opportunity for employee shareholding under the Finance Act as part of an approved profit sharing scheme.  In this scheme the rights of the worker would be protected.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus should seek to pioneer new services to the Far East and the Southern Hemisphere.  It is a clearly established principle that the profitability from long haul transport is the key to a greater performance by any airline.  Aer Lingus should be free to enter into joint marketing arrangements and alliances to develop new routes and achieve viable costs.</P>
    <P>At EC level, Fine Gael are committed to the following proposals: the implementation of the Single European Air Traffic Control System which it is estimated could reduce air fares by up to 10 per cent; opposition to the abolition to duty-free facilities and to the imposition of VAT on an intra European Community fares; opposition to excessive flight crew restrictions which could cost Aer Lingus over £35 million per annum; promotion at EC level of a fair apportionment of slots at congested airports.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael call for the amending of the fare approval structure for passenger services to and from the UK and Ireland <Col N="924" /> so that Government approval should no longer be required.  We are not satisfied with a situation where airlines making record losses pay landing charges to State airport authorities who are making considerable profits.  We believe that a civil aviation authority should be established in this country.</P>
    <P>If Aer Lingus are to survive radical steps are needed.  It is all very fine to talk about privatisation or plans to sell part of the company to an outside interest. The reality is that very few interested parties are on the horizon.  The Government must ensure that the airline is put into a position of being attractive in respect of a merger or a joint venture partnership or cross investment.  So far as we have heard nothing along the lines of a constructive suggestion.  The Minister, in my view, has a conflict of interest between her position as sole shareholder of Aer Lingus and their statutory regulator. She is the owner of all our airports where planes must land according to her regulations.  It is difficult to separate a sound commercial decision from a shortterm political decision and in this regard the Minister must stand culpable.</P>
    <P>Good relations between the Minister on the one hand and Aer Lingus on the other are necessary if this crisis is to be tackled.  It is clear that the relations, at present, are in a disastrous state.  The Minister's ill-aimed attack on Aer Lingus is both unwarranted and unfair.  In clear terms, the airline will not survive without a capital injection, be it public or private. Having regard to the present attitude of the Government and of the board and management it is difficult to see what crucial steps can be taken to save our national airline from destruction.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of the great strengths of our Constitution is its powerful democratic base. The Constitution acknowledges that all powers of Government derive from the people whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy. At the refenda on 3 December the people will exercise this prerogative in relation to the three vital issues which this House has been debating.  The purpose of this Bill is to contribute in a modest way towards ensuring that the decision of the people will be informed and effective.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to assist voters at the referenda on the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution by making available to them a statement relating to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda and by providing for headings on the ballot papers in order to help distinguish between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum sets out the purpose and contents of the Bill. Briefly, section 1 provides that a special polling card, containing the statement set out in the Appendix to that section, will be sent to every elector.  There will be a single polling card relating to all three referenda.  A copy of the statement will also be sent to each postal and special voter.  The statement will be displayed in and in the precincts of polling stations. Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and marking the <Col N="926" /> ballot papers in accordance with the voters' instructions.</P>
    <P>The statement for the information of voters which is contained in the Appendix to section 1 of the Bill sets out, in terms which are as clear, simple and direct as possible, the proposals which are the subject of the referenda.  The statement, in Irish and in English, simply quotes the words which the three Constitution Bills propose to insert in the Constitution with the minimum of associated wording.  I am sure the House will agree that this is the correct approach and that it would be inappropriate to attempt to paraphrase or interpret the proposed constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>The arrangements proposed in section 1 are the same as those made in relation to the referendum in June of this year and, indeed, at all previous referenda.</P>
    <P>A further step to aid voters in distinguishing between the ballot papers at the forthcoming referenda is proposed at section 3 of the Bill.  This section provides that a heading be printed on each ballot paper indicating the proposal to which the ballot paper relates.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that where two or more polls are taken on the same day, the proportion of spoilt ballot papers tends to increase sharply.  One of the reasons for this is probably that some electors may have difficulty in distinguishing between the separate proposals. In a single nationwide poll the proportion of rejected papers is normally somewhat less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Where two or more ballot papers are involved the proportion tends to increase quite substantially to 2 or 3 per cent or even higher.  This is particularly so in the case of referenda where there is nothing other than the short title of the relevant Constitution Bill together with the colour of the paper to distinguish one ballot paper from another.</P>
    <P>On this occasion there will be three separate ballot papers.  In order to reduce the risk of a high number of spoilt papers the Government decided that a further distinguishing feature should be included on the ballot papers.  I am sure the House will agree that it is proper to do so and <Col N="927" /> that the inclusion of a descriptive heading on each paper, as proposed by section 3, is the most appropriate arrangement.</P>
    <P>I would have to say that this is not a novel proposal.  In 1979 when two proposals to amend the Constitution were put to the people on the same day provision was made for the inclusion of distinguishing headings on the ballot papers. In section 3 we are following this precedent.</P>
    <P>The provision, along with the measures I have already mentioned, will help electors distinguish between the three separate proposals and should ensure that the number of spoilt ballot papers will be kept to the minimum.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the headings is to distinguish between the ballot papers and to provide a signpost to the subject matter to which each relates.  I believe the headings proposed fulfil this purpose.  The headings have no significance other than as an aid to electors in distinguishing between the three ballot papers.  The actual questions on which the electors will be invited to vote are the proposals contained in the Constitution Bills as passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992, provided that a statement for the information of voters at a referendum may be prescribed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The statement prescribed in section 1 of this Bill could, therefore, be so prescribed.  However, it was considered appropriate to include it in this Bill, which is required in any event in order to provide for the descriptive headings on the ballot papers.  Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, provides that section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992, shall not apply in relation to these referenda.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a brief technical measure, following the general pattern of corresponding measures at previous referenda. It fulfils a useful function in providing the electorate with objective, factual information which will assist them in making a rational and informed decision on these important questions.  It <Col N="928" /> further assists them by providing for clear, easily understood headings and labels on the ballot papers in order to distinguish between them.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If a piece of dead fish could ever pass into history this speech would be it.  The Minister's speech on this Bill shows not the slightest sensitivity to the issues which underlie it or the slightest notion of the significance of the Bill.  I am appalled to have to say that but never during my 11 years in this House have I heard a speech that was so much beside the point.  That is an awful thing to have to say to the Minister.  I think it is the first time I have debated an issue with him in person across the Floor of the House.  All I can do is congratulate him that on this occasion he has not had the gall to send in his Minister of State, Deputy Harney, to do the work for him. I do not think even this Government would have the nerve to go that far.  It is outrageous that a Minister should come in and present such a pedestrian dead speech on the issues before us.</P>
      <P>This Bill basically provides for statements to be published on polling cards and other material to assist and guide voters in the forthcoming referenda and to provide for descriptive headings on the ballot papers also for the guidance of voters.  In essence, that is a very sensible provision, but the application of the provision proposed in the Bill in regard to the proposed Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution can only be described as utterly perverse.  I will come back to that point in a moment.</P>
      <P>There is another part of this Bill which is very significant and I would like to make an observation on it.  Neither the Bill before us, the explanatory memorandum circulated with it nor the Minister's speech make any attempt to explain why section 2 of the Bill provides that section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992, shall not apply to the referenda referred to in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year we went to the trouble of enacting the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992.  Section 2 of that Act <Col N="929" /> provides that at a constitutional referendum, other than a referendum relating to the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution, which was to do with the Maastricht Treaty, a statement in relation to the proposal which is the subject of the referendum may be prescribed for the information of the voters by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.  We solemnly enacted that provision this year.  There were good reasons for providing that it should not apply to the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution, but it was to apply to every other constitutional referendum.  On the first occasion when we have a constitutional referendum after the passing of that Act, the Government want to set aside a principal provision of it.  I have to ask why.  The Minister has not touched on this.  He has given no explanation, nor is an explanation given in the explanatory memorandum.  I have to ask why the Minister is coming before us with a Bill which specifically sets aside a provision of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992.  I have to suspect that the Government have some ulterior motive which they do not want to discuss with the House.  Looking at the provisions in the Appendix to section 1 and at the provisions of section 3, I suspect that the Government's motives in setting aside that provision are fear and a desire to mislead the public.</P>
    <P>The title which the Government propose in this Bill to put on the statements to be included in polling cards for the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution and the descriptive title to be put on the ballot paper are designed to be deliberately misleading.  They are designed to mislead voters as to the substance of what is proposed in the Twelfth Amendment. That and only that is the purpose of calling this Twelfth Amendment by the title which appears in this Bill &mdash; Right to Life, Ceart chun Beatha.  That is nothing less than a very underhand and base attempt by the Government to influence the outcome of this referendum.  It is the act of a Government who are anti-woman, spineless, hypocritical, inept and confused.  This attempt at deception by <Col N="930" /> the Government is nothing less than an insult to the women of this country and to the voters in general.</P>
    <P>The proposed Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is about the termination of pregnancy.  The proposed amendment states:</P>
    <P>It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>I would be out of order to go into my views on that.  I had to suffer under the Chair's lash earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the matter which is the subject of the proposed amendment which this Bill is designed to regulate.  I have quoted the terms of that amendment.  The proposed Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is about the termination of pregnancy.  It deals with the circumstances in which it shall not be unlawful to terminate a pregnancy if the amendment is passed.  It is not about anything else.  It has been demonstrated in this House and elsewhere in the past weeks that the Government are confused about what would and would not be lawful if this amendment were to be passed, but the Government's ineptitude, confusion and downright dishonesty on this issue cannot be an excuse for an attempt to mislead the voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Neither is it an excuse to say that the Government are divided on this referendum, with at least half the Progressive Democrats Deputies, Deputies O'Malley, Harney and Quill, who have spoken on the issue being fundamentally opposed to the spirit and the approach proposed by this Government of which they are members or supporters.  I do not know the views of the other half of the Progressive Democrat Deputies.  We have not heard from the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, nor have we heard from Deputies Clohessy and Wyse. That division is no excuse for the Government trying to mislead the voters in a mean, underhanded fashion.</P>
    <P>The Government find themselves totally at sea on this issue and they therefore resort to a further attempt at confusion and obfuscation of the issue.  That kind of conduct, as we know from long experience, is par for the course for Fianna Fáil.  They have always been a party who consider words more important than actions, perceptions more important than reality and concerns more important than performance.  Given the opportunity, they would rather verbalise than act and in a tight corner they will run for the cover of the nearest platitude.  They will throw up a smoke screen of verbiage and express concern about all the respectable issues, but they will not do anything, unless they absolutely have to, that might actually deal with the problem.  If they are pushed to it, as in this case, they will look for the way out that requires the least thought, without counting the cost or damage to people who will be affected. In this case that is women.</P>

      <P>I have to support the comments made by Deputy Dukes so far as the wording on page four of the Bill is concerned regarding the white ballot paper.  I have some doubts as to whether the inclusion of that misleading description, Right to Life, is a constitutional wording.  It must throw some doubt on the constitutionality of this Bill.  The essence of the Constitution is that there should be a fair description given and put before the people in this referendum.  I take the view that the referendum is not necessary but we are to have it.  The Constitution could well be interpreted as requiring a description and a choice put before the people that would represent the intent of the Bill.  This has not happened so far as the white ballot paper is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could use strong terminology to describe the intent and purport of the Government in doing this.  To describe it as totally misleading is apt.  The purpose of the Government is to put into the minds of people the idea that in supporting this referendum they will be doing something towards the generality <Col N="933" /> of the right to life.  That is not so.  If one was to take an analogy, for example, the green ballot paper dealing with travel, the description there ought to be &ldquo;right to travel&rdquo; but it is just the single word &ldquo;travel&rdquo;.  If there was to be equality in the two positions it would say &ldquo;right to travel&rdquo; and the other ballot paper also would say, &ldquo;right to information&rdquo; not just &ldquo;information&rdquo;.  To put in there &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; is a fraud and a misdescription. It suggests that the Twelfth Amendment Bill is about the right to life whereas, as Deputy Dukes said, it is a measure which defines the circumstances under which a termination of pregnancy may lawfully take place in this State.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Twelfth Amendment Bill it was pointed out to the Minister for Justice that the Bill authorised abortions to take place here albeit in all too limited circumstances.  The Bill reaffirms the position of the Supreme Court authorising termination of pregnancy where the life of the mother is at risk, but it rolls back the Supreme Court decision authorising it in the case of threatened suicide.  To describe that as a right to life is confusing.  Many people will think they are voting for something else.  Why are we doing that?  The Government, and the Minister, know what they are about here.  It is not an accident.  The parliamentary draftsman did not casually throw it in.  It is much more invidious than that.  This was a deliberate ploy to try to secure votes for this measure on the basis that it is a grant of a right to life position, which it clearly is not.  The House should defeat this matter or at least amend that position so that it reflects fairly what the Twelfth Amendment Bill seeks to enact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question as to the constitutionality of this Bill.  We could not ask the President to do anything about the Bills to amend the Constitution but this legislation setting up the procedure to be followed in amending the Constitution is questionable.  It contradicts what the Taoiseach said quite recently to the effect that he, and his Ministers, knew what they were about <Col N="934" /> and that the people would make their decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech today said the statement in Irish and English simply quoted the words which the three constitutional Bills proposed to insert into the Constitution with a minimum of wording.  He said he was sure the House would agree that this was the correct approach and that it would be inappropriate to paraphrase or interpret the proposed constitutional amendments. That is exactly what the heading on the white ballot paper will do.  People will feel that if they vote No they will be voting against the right to life.  This is the first time in the history of the State that we are proposing a constitutional provision to permit an abortion in certain circumstances.  That is not the right to life.  Let us be honest about it.  We should tell the people exactly what we are doing. The heading on the ballot paper will cause confusion and it contradicts everything the Taoiseach said.  It contradicts also the Minister's Second Stage speech. That is an insult to the intelligence of the people and to our integrity as legislators. We will oppose this when we have the opportunity on Committee Stage.</P>

He said there was no significance in the titles other than to distinguish between ballot papers.  The decision of the Government to head one of the ballot papers for the forthcoming referendum with the term right to life, may well be in conflict with the provisions of the legislation governing the holding of a referendum here.  I would refer the Minister to the 1942 Act which was quite explicit and stated in section 15 (5):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> The proposal which is the subject thereof shall be stated on the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as such proposal is stated in the Bill containing such proposal passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The clear intention of the legislators was that there would be no confusion.  The decision by the Government to misleadingly label the amendment &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; is an underhanded attempt to influence voters in supporting the amendment. The other two ballot papers simply designate &ldquo;travel&rdquo; and &ldquo;information&rdquo;, not &ldquo;right to travel&rdquo; or &ldquo;right to information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is striking about them is that these words are taken directly from the proposed amendments whereas &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; is not taken from the amendment on pregnancy termination.  The words &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; do not appear in the amendment proposed by the Government.  It is an emotive simplistic slogan which has been hi-jacked by one side in the current controversy and it has been used in such a way as to suggest that anyone who opposes their narrow view of the abortion issue is in some way anti life.  It is astonishing that the Government should now have decided to put this label on the ballot paper.  Those who are contemplating &ldquo;No&rdquo; may be misled into believing that if they do so they are voting against the right to life when the reality is that if one votes &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Government amendment one is voting to increase a woman's right to life, not diminish it.  It is deplorable that the Government should seek to mislead in this way.</P>
    <P>Nowhere in the legislation governing the holding of a referendum is it envisaged that such a blatantly partisan heading could be used on a ballot paper.  There can be no justification for the use of such a false and misleading term.  I acknowledge that at the end of the day a small number of people may be misled by it but it is quite conceivable that a small number of people may well be the deciding factor in this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> I have heard much agonising by the Progressive Democrats during the week about how they have had no choice but to support the Government wording of the abortion referendum in order to avoid a general election.  Surely they do not have to go along with this charade.  I invite them to support our amendment which is similar to the Fine Gael amendment and seeks to replace &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; with &ldquo;pregnancy termination&rdquo;.  Even the Taoiseach could not justify going to the country on the basis that the Dáil had made a democratic decision to replace the wording at the head of a ballot paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister spoke, certain words literally jumped out at me.  I could not believe that what he was saying related to what we are discussing. The Minister began by saying that one of the great strengths of our Constitution is its powerful democratic base.  Ideally that is the case, but there is nothing democratic about the Government's handling of this whole affair. Their approach is not designed to contribute in a modest way towards ensuring that the decision of the people will be informed and effective, as the Minister says.</P>
      <P>Our great fear is that what will be put before the people on 3 December, if the Government get their way, is a wording that will confuse and raise concerns and fears.  That was bad enough but now we reach the nadir with this Bill not alone using its rightful title but introducing language that is not even part of the substantive issue.  It says here that the Bill proposes to assist voters at the referendum. The description &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; which we know is the slogan, the propaganda blatantly used by the pro-life campaigners and which has a certain colour because of that and implies a certain insult to the rest of us who according to that definition are anti-life, is the last wording that should ever be used particularly as the Minister suggests that he wishes to have the words and the terms as clear, simple and direct as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, <Col N="937" /> that those words are certainly simple and direct and will strike a resonant chord among those who wish to whip up the kind of campaign we had in 1983.  I really find it hard to believe in the Minister's total naivety when he says the headings have no significance other than as an aid to electors.  Is it the hidden agenda that they will be an aid to electors not just subliminally but outwardly.  We would all be worried about subliminal persuasion, but this is so outrightly crude that it does beg the question whether or not it is constitutional.  That raises a very big question over this Bill.</P>
    <P>I concur with the points made by all my colleagues, particularly those raised by Deputy Alan Dukes regarding the question of whether this fits within the confines of another Bill, the Electoral Bill.  Let me conclude by saying that we have advertising standards in this country as they do in most other countries, which do not allow misleading descriptions or claims about any consumer product.  If this was referred to the advertising standards of Ireland it would be found not just to be misleading but confusing to the extent that it would have to be banned. I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with my colleagues in being very critical of this Bill, particularly in relation to the title on the ballot paper which will be so misleading and distorted.  I hate crediting people with ulterior motives; I do not normally do it.  However, I really believe that some sort of sinister thinking went into the planning of this wording.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in this debate about the right to life, and really very little was said in this House about the right to life. This legislation is about information, about the right to travel and about the termination of pregnancies.  The equal right to life of the mother and the unborn are already enshrined in the Constitution. This title will cause nothing but confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable confusion already.  A woman came up to me in the supermarket last Saturday in a state of considerable agitation wanting to know <Col N="938" /> what she should do on 3 December.  She said that she had telephoned the Attorney General's office, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach's office and that nobody could tell her.  I suggest that there is great confusion and there will be even more confusion when people see how this ballot will be presented to them.  I can see absolute disaster at the polling stations with presiding officers being asked questions by people who are illiterate, who do not understnd, who are blind, etc.  This is not something that can be solved by a Yes or No answer.  I can see great rows and great difficulties at polling stations over the whole presentation of this.</P>
    <P>I think that maybe it would be a good idea for some of us to say that this is not about the right to life but about termination of pregnancies.  People who are going to vote should be told that if they do not understand it, if they are confused about it they should vote No.  They should not put anything into the Constitution about which they are confused or which they feel is not clear.  I believe this heading on the ballot paper is anything but clear.  It is regrettable that, despite the fact that there are amendments down and that Deputies on this side of the House have made the case for giving it a realistic title, once again the Government are intransigent.  That is going to create great difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government announced their proposals to hold a referendum on the questions to be put to the Irish people on 3 December some two weeks ago, they indicated that they were prepared to embark upon a process of discussion and consultation with the other parties in this House with a view to achieving consensus.  It has become evident in the last few days that this commitment to consensus-forming was a very shallow one indeed.  At a time when the Government were inviting us to meet with them, at least at leadership level, they were drafting and finalising their various legislative measures and in the midst of it all was this particular proposal, <Col N="939" /> the aspect of this legislation that we are now debating that is most contentious and is entirely dismissive of any other view of this debate, that is the suggestion that the substantive question should be titled &ldquo;right to life&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is also evident that the Minister for Justice has a very consistent view in this throughout, that the Government proposals is a &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; proposal and that any questioning of that or any debate or analysis of what is included is a demand for abortion on a widespread basis.  Coupled with that view, the Government decided on this phrase to guide the vote on the day of the referendum as to how they should address the so-called substantive issue.  It is grossly misleading.</P>
      <P>Let me put the following question to the Minister: how does he think the voter will address the proposal in the amendment which provides for abortion in limited circumstances in light of the headline &ldquo;right to life&rdquo;?  The Minister will have to reconsider this matter.  I hope on Committee Stage he will see that our proposal is reasonable.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for the Environment I have become used to systematic attacks from Fine Gael whenever I made a calm and reasoned contribution in the House.  I had thought that the appointment of Deputy Dukes, who tends to adopt a reasonably enlightened approach, to the Fine Gael Front Bench would have led to the end of these systematic attacks.  If the Fine Gael Front Bench want to drive down that cul-desac on every debate in this House, so be it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes' contribution this evening indicated a great degree of confusion. He accused me of having a hidden agenda in relation to section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992. Let me repeat what I said in my Second Stage contribution for his benefit:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992 provided that <Col N="940" /> a statement for the information of voters at a referendum may be prescribed by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The statement prescribed in section 1 of this Bill could, therefore, be so prescribed.  However, it was considered appropriate to include it in this Bill, which is required in any event in order to provide for the descriptive headings on the ballot papers.  Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, provides that section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1992 shall not apply in relation to these referenda. </P>

What he tried to do, mischievously, was muddy the waters so what we would not have a clear picture this evening.  Once again, he trotted out the reference that women are the target. At the same time he tried to convey the view that the referendum on the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is an abortion referendum but nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

In that event the right to life of the mother prevails.  The Bill is about the right to life of the unborn and the mother and the right of a woman to receive whatever medical and surgical treatment is appropriate to her condition. Therefore no matter how often Members of the Opposition parties want to muddy the waters in relation to these essential characteristics it will not maker any difference. The problem will also arise when there is a conflict; where the two lives are threatened because of the pregnant mother's medical condition.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 is in the name of Deputies Spring and Howlin.  Amendment No.2 is an alternative.  It is proposed therefore, <Col N="943" /> for discussion purposes, that we take amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  a person shall not interfere with or obstruct or impede an elector going to or coming from or in the vicinity of or in a polling station;</P>
      <P>(f)  during the period commencing 30 minutes before the time appointed for the taking of a poll at a referendum to which this section applies and ending 30 minutes after the close of the said poll, a person shall not, in or in the curtilage of a polling station or in any place within 50 metres of such station, for the purpose of promoting the interest of a political party or soliciting votes for a purpose relating to the Referendum, do any or all of the following things:</P>
      <P> (i)  loiter or congregate with other persons;</P>
      <P>(ii)  attempt to induce, by any means whatsoever, an elector to vote in a particular way or refrain from voting;</P>
      <P>(iii)  display or distribute any notice, sign or poster (other than a notice, sign or poster displayed by the returning officer) or card, circular or other document relating to the referendum; or</P>
      <P>(iv)  use or cause to be used any loud-speaker or other public address mechanism to broadcast matter relating to the referendum;  </P>
      <P>(g) A person who contravenes paragraphs (e) or (f) shall be guilty of an offence;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is similar to amendment No. 2.  I do not wish to spend too much time on this amendment because the wording is self-explanatory.  It provides that a person should not interfere with or obstruct an elector going to or coming <Col N="944" /> from a polling station while these referenda are being held in the interests of fairness and democracy.</P>
    <P>In the past on issues of this kind undue pressures were brought to bear on electors. This issue is complex and one about which many thousands of people care deeply.  It is wrong and inappropriate therefore that undue pressure can be brought to bear on electors.  As we are aware, outside this House on Molesworth Street undue pressure has been brought to bear on Deputies.  Given that we as politicians are at the cutting edge we can withstand that pressure although on occasion the pressure to which we are subjected is excessive &mdash; this will be dealt with in another amendment &mdash; but the electors are entitled to be allowed consider and study the issues and make up their minds without being subjected to displays of the lurid material which has been put on display at demonstrations and around this House.</P>
    <P>This amendment speaks for itself and should not lead to objections or disagreement. Any reasonable Member will have to agree that it is fair and should be accepted in the interests of democracy.  I ask the House to agree to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment the Minister might well take on board without diluting in any way his or his party's approach to this referendum; in fact I contend it would strengthen their approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 tabled in the names of members of the Democratic Left differs in some respects from that tabled by the Labour Party in that we propose that people may not encroach for electioneering purposes within 100 metres of a polling station, whereas the Labour Party propose 50 metres.  We propose also, in subparagraph (g), a point from which that 100 metres would be measured.  A confusion I have often witnessed at polling stations arises when a complaint is received by the Garda that the entrance to a polling station is being blocked, whether the entrance be the gate or the actual doorway to the polling station.  As Members are aware, many of <Col N="945" /> the schools in which polling takes place are located in grounds, when there is a constant dispute whether people should be inside or outside those grounds, when all of those weird and wonderful things our party faithful get up during election time.</P>
    <P>I have a distinct memory of a by-election in 1982 or 1983 in the Dublin Central constituency when a polling station in Cabra had upwards of 100 people outside shouting and haranguing the trickle of voters winding their way through a narow gap &mdash; in fact in most cases they had to force their way through &mdash; extremely intimidating for people endeavouring to vote on that occasion.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would agree with me that in some of our polling stations in Dublin North-West, after 8 o'clock on a polling day, one may find 30 to 40 people standing outside literally shouting at voters as they approach the gate.  I do not suggest that all of this is engaged in by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael; my party supporters are just as likely to get in on the act as anybody else if the competition dictates, when one has to be in there fighting toe to toe with the best of them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I contend our amendment would be a worthwhile one to introduce for the forthcoming referendum &mdash; given that we can see already the temperature beginning to rise &mdash; even if in, say, half a dozen locations nationwide people were to be intimidated from actually going into a polling station, whether they intended to vote in favour or against. Apart from that aspect, I am sure many people will abstain because of the confusion created, particularly resulting from the title on the abortion question ballot paper.</P>
    <P>Our amendment also proposes penalties for any breach of the provisions of the relevant section.  I contend acceptance of our amendment would be an advance since it is almost a direct lift from the proposal in the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991 [Seanad] with which the House is currently dealing.  I would have to say it is curious, and only came to my attention <Col N="946" /> when I began to examine it with regard to this impending referendum, that the proposal in the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991, does not relate to referenda but to elections.  Even if that Electoral (No. 2) Bill 1991, had been law by now, that section would not apply to this forthcoming referendum.  The Minister might accept with some grace &mdash; helping to lower the temperature in this House &mdash; either of these amendments or, alternatively, introduce another which would carry through the spirit of what we propose here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the statements made on this amendment are in line with the views expressed by Members from all sides of the House on the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991, in that they portray the type of ideal circumstances we should like to see prevail at all future elections and referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that, on the occasion of the last referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, there were some extraordinary scenes outside some polling stations, not perpetrated by any people involved in political parties but by others who, for some unknown reason, had confused the Maastricht Treaty referendum with abortion.  Some tactics were engaged in in rural areas &mdash; not too far from the Minister's constituency area &mdash; by people well known to the Minister who had gone around confusing people, contending that if the Maastricht Treaty referendum was carried, the next step the Government would take was to introduce euthanasia.  All of these things were being said on the ground in private nursing homes and welfare homes run by the State.  Unless we agree now to tidy up the provisions such people will be engaging in these practices again against all our wishes, that is people on the fringe of society who feel they have a particular right to interfere with and express people's views, who will produce some of the most extraordinary documentation and photographs to Members of this <Col N="947" /> House, as they have done through the post already.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister woke up to this fact.  There were innuendoes in the course of the last Presidential election campaign on the part of many people, including the Minister himself.  All sorts of complications have arisen on the ground on sensitive issues such as this one.  I predict that, unless we come to grips with the position now and agree to tidy it up before the date of the referendum, we shall be heading for trouble again.  In making that point I have excluded the last referendum campaign when there were disagreements among Members of the House but when a cleaner campaign was conducted.  Nonetheless, there were others who were prepared to say and do anything, especially to old people who can be easily confused, some of them my own relatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of these two amendments.  I hope I will not be regarded by my colleagues on my right as being in any way divisive if I say I have a slight preference for the amendment proposed by Members of the Democratic Left because it does go somewhat further in every respect than I myself proposed in the course of the debate on the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991 &mdash; that we should make the <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around polling stations 100 metres rather than 50 metres. I am delighted to hear that Deputy McCartan, a fairly affable man in all respects, listens to me; indeed I listen to him; I hope it is to our mutual edification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Members have pointed out, this is something the Minister could do quite easily if he wished.  Each of these amendments is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of what the Minister himself proposes for elections in the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, 1991, the Second Stage of which I gather we are to complete tomorrow evening.  I am not sure when the Minister proposes taking Committee <Col N="948" /> Stage.  For my money, the sooner it is done the better.</P>
    <P>I might support what the proposers of the amendment have said by recounting a minor experience of mine.  All of us have had the experience of standing outside polling stations at various times.  I remember in a very well celebrated by-election in May 1982 standing outside a polling station in Lucan &mdash; other Members in the House will remember that particular day &mdash; not realising until I sat into my car at approximately 9.30 that evening just how wet I was.  It was only when I sat down I realised I was wet through to the skin, from the back of my neck down to my heels.  That is a fate we could easily spare ourselves if we wished to do so even for our comfort.  On the occasion of that infamous Eighth Amendment of the Constitution referendum I remember quite clearly I was one of the people who had the privilege of being picked out by a certain lobby group for designation as an abortionist. I remember one woman in particular running from the back of a meeting in a large hotel in my constituency to the front, when I stood on the platform to speak, screaming at me that I was a baby killer, a murderer, an abortionist and that I had blood on my hands.  I met the same woman again on polling day except that she happened then to be in charge of a caravan: I was not quite sure whether it was for Fianna Fáil or the PLAC.  But I did manage to embarrass her on that day into giving me coffee and chocolate cakes.  That showed that, behind all of these dreadful things people do on polling day, there is a basic humanity we all share and that we should allow come to the fore.</P>
    <P>A measure like this in referenda of the kind we shall have shortly certainly would do no harm to the sanity of the debate both in the meantime and on that day, and indeed to the proper conduct of that day.  There is a golden opportunity here for the Minister to retrieve his reputation. Instead of the piece of dead fish <Col N="949" /> he gave us in the form of his Second Stage speech he should give us a piece of political sustenance and show there is life in the Government and that they are capable of thinking of something that will benefit the populace.</P>

      <P>I know it is not suggested by any Member that these amendments are an effort to stifle comment on or contribution to any particular political campaign or referendum.  A number of Deputies have expressed reservations about what may happen at a public meeting or what might be said in old people's homes or institutions run by the State but we cannot legislate for these issues and we should never seek to do so.  People have the right to behave and display whatever pictures or postcards &mdash; however heinous, divisive they may be &mdash; they wish.  It is not our place to try to lay down parameters in that regard.</P>

      <P>If people have a right to speak and campaign in an open election, it is for the voters to decide their political fate.  There is legislation dealing with incitement to radical hatred and other such matters, and that is the way to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>The amendments before the House are designed to restore an element of dignity and propriety to the act of voting.  I have had experiences outside polling station similar to those recounted by people here, even to the extent of watching members of the same political party battle in an attempt to get one candidate's literature to the voters before another member of the same party in the same constituency &mdash; I will not say where that happened or to which party I am referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the holding of a referendum in Chile in 1988.  This was a significant experience because it was the referendum that ended the rule of the dictator, <Col N="950" /> Pinochet and returned democracy to the Chilean people after almost 20 years of a brutal dictatorship.  My most significant impression of that referendum was that all electioneering was banned and all literature taken down two days prior to the vote.  People were allowed that respite to reflect on the basic question as to whether they wished Pinochet's rule to continue.  On polling day there was no electioneering; there was a suspension of work to enable people to travel without hindrance to the polling stations, all of which were guarded by heavily armed members of the armed forces to remind people who was in control on that day.  The dignity with which people went about their business was very impressive.</P>
    <P>It would serve our democracy well and would help to restore a great deal of lost dignity if the Minister accepted these amendments.  Otherwise there will be many unseemly and unnecessary incidents outside polling stations as people cast their vote on what is an extremely important matter.  I hope the Minister agrees to reflect on what is in these amendments.  As has been pointed out, they reflect Government views and positions generally with regard to the holding of elections and there is no reason that they should not be in place for the important referenda on 3 December.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief because we have very little time.  I would ask the Minister, as the person with responsibility for the Electoral (No. 2) Bill, to outline the rules and guidelines governing elections.  I have vivid memories of, and indeed still have photographs showing the presence of unauthorised people sitting in polling stations while people vote.  This is intimidatory to say the least.  It was always my belief that the polling station was an impartial area where nobody was allowed to sit in judgment.  I have photographic evidence of this practice in the 1983 referendum and I hope the Minister will do <Col N="951" /> everything possible to ensure it does not happen again.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Early in my career here, which has been very short, I mentioned oxymorons and paradoxes. There is another paradox here in that the Government had an opportunity of legislating in regard to polling stations, but it is very strange that there is no mention of clearing polling stations in a referendum in which both sides will be more extreme than in any other election. This is one time when the voting area should be kept clear.  The Minister said that Government statements will be displayed in and in the precincts of polling stations, but this will lead to other people putting up posters.  This is one time when the Minister should take his own advice in terms of the Electoral (No.2) Bill and accept the amendments proposed here.</P>

      <P>This year the Department of the Environment have beaten all records of any previous Administrations in terms of reforming legislation.  Of all the laws enacted in the House, legislation from this Department will have taken up 25 per cent of the time of the House.  I would like to inform Deputy Dukes who may not be familiar with those developments that I am open to reform.  Not since 1963 &mdash; the Deputy and his colleagues had an opportunity during that time to reform electoral law &mdash; has such fundamental electoral reform been attempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy and understanding for the views put forward tonight in relation to reform.  I am not only anxious to support what has been put forward but I am ambitious enough to believe that the Second Stage of the Electoral (No. 2) Bill will be completed tomorrow evening and that the Committee Stage will be completed next week, giving us an opportunity to have it enacted in good time for the referendum. I will be seeking the co-operation of the <Col N="952" /> House and I do not think it is too much to expect.  There was reference to the fact that it may cover only Dáil elections, which is true, as section 147 indicates. However, the Bill amends the electoral code covering all elections, including referenda and we will deal with that more specifically next week on Committee Stage, if necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the curtilage of polling booths, it is a matter for discussion in the House whether it is 50 metres from the gate or gates.  The idea is to make certain that there is a dignified approach &mdash; not just in relation to this referendum &mdash; but for the future.  I am quite happy to listen to the views of Members and to come to a broad consensus in relation to what the distance should be.  It is not appropriate to deal with it in a piecemeal way in this type of legislation, especially when the House will complete its work on the Bill for electoral reform next week.  On the ybasis of the contributions here this evening, I am sure I will have the fullest possible support in the passage of that Bill to enable it to be implemented by 3 December.  In those circumstances, I hope the Deputies will withdraw their amendments.</P>

It clearly does not have any relevance to holding questions on referenda.  Does any other section in the Bill refer to this or does the Minister propose to table an amendment to section 147 to facilitate its application to the holding of a referendum? If the Minister can assure us in relation to that point we will not have any difficulty in withdrawing our amendment in favour of an undertaking that this House will have the legislation in place by 3 December.</P>

    <P>In page 3, Part I of the Appendix, line 39, to delete &ldquo;Ceart chun Beatha&rdquo;<Col N="954" /> and substitute &ldquo;Foirceannadh Toirchis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am delighted at the fact that, while the other two sets of amendments are not identical, they are certainly going in the same direction.  The basic point which all these amendments want to make &mdash; which have already been made in the House &mdash; is that the title it is proposed to put on the notice to voters which will be distributed in relation to the Twelfth Amendment and the title it is proposed to put on the ballot paper dealing with it are totally unsuitable and out of keeping with the intention of the amendment. The Minister may not like it but I should like to read the text of the proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution which it is proposed to add to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution: &ldquo;It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self destruction.&rdquo; That text deals with the circumstances in which it shall not be unlawful to terminate the pregnancy, that is the intent.  I will not at present go into some of the claims made for that amendment but its substance, what it sets out to do and what it appears, on the face of it, to do is to regulate the circumstances under which it shall not be unlawful to terminate a pregnancy.  If the Minister does not like me using the words &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; I should&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He objected to this a short time ago.  If he objects, why does the phrase appear in the wording of the Twelfth Amendment?  I may be blaming the Minister unjustly for things in which he did not have a hand, act or part directly but we are dealing with the text before us.  If the Minister wanted to say that this is an anti-abortion amendment, <Col N="955" /> why do the words &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; or &ldquo;anti-abortion&rdquo; appear on it?  The text of this proposed amendment deals with the circumstances in which it shall not be unlawful to terminate a pregnancy; that is what it is all about.  To call that text in a notice to voters &mdash; or in a notice on a ballot paper &mdash; a proposal dealing with the right to life can be done for only one reason, the Government want to give the impression to the voters that it is about something other than that dealt with in the text of the constitutional provisions being put before the people.</P>
      <P>I have accused the Government of having ulterior motives in this regard and I stand over that accusation.  There can be only one reason and we all know what it is.  We have known it since 1981 when this nonsensical and ridiculous campaign started, it is to appeal to the emotions of voters.  It is to appeal to the feelings in all of us which wish to protect, preserve and promote life and to suggest to voters that voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this proposal is the same as doing something to preserve, protect or promote life.  It is also to suggest to them &mdash; not even subliminally as Deputy Barnes said &mdash; that doing anything else, particularly voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;, means in some way going against the feeling ingrained in all of us that we want to do things which are life enhancing.  It is nothing more and nothing less than a very cynical manoeuvre by a Government who are totally at sixes and sevens in relation to their own intentions.  It is an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the voters.</P>
      <P>The words proposed to be used as a title on the ballot paper and as a guide to voters on polling cards are nothing less than an attempt to deceive people into thinking that what is before them is something that it is not.  I will not go any further than that, we can use all kinds of emotive language and, God knows, we have seen plenty of emotion and appeals to emotions in the way this campaign has been run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> I will not talk about that but I want to make it very clear that neither my party nor I will stand for this attempt by the Government to sell people something that is plainly other than what appears on the ballot paper.  I do not know why the Government should feel that they have to try to mislead people in this way. It seems to indicate a lack of confidence on the Government's part in the merits of their own case.  I have to say that if that is how the Government feel they are perfectly entitled to that view.  The merits of what the Government are proposing are very dubious indeed.  I shall not go into the detail of all that as we have had it in the debate on the other Bill. However, I cannot stand by and allow this particular piece of deception to be foisted on the Irish public.</P>
    <P>We know that the words &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; have all kinds of emotional connotations; that they have associations in people's minds with photographs, presentations and claims that we have been used to since 1981 and particularly since 1983. We know that those words are associated with a particular kind of campaign and with a particular groups of people.  We know perfectly well that the words &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; are used in a very negative way to associate people who take a different view from that being put forward by the Government with a particular evil intent.</P>
    <P>I am one of the people &mdash; and there are a few of us in the House &mdash; who because we disagreed with what was being proposed in 1983 were labelled abortionists.  I have not the slightest doubt that sometime between now and 3 December I will again be labelled an abortionist.  Only a few weeks ago I was labelled an abortionist; I am used to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very significant that a great many of the people who throw those kind of labels around are in another capacity members of and supporters of <Col N="957" /> the Minister's party.  I do not consider that to be an accident.  There is a deliberate attempt to weave a way between the feelings that people have and to prevent people from seeing the reality that is before us for what it is.</P>
      <P>The Government are setting out in this Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution the circumstances under which it shall not be lawful to terminate a pregnancy. I do not think they are doing that particularly well or particularly wisely or that they have thought out the proposal at all well but that is what they are doing.  What they are doing in the measure before us is trying to pretend they are doing something else.  It has been the approach of the Minister's party to all of these kinds of issues from a long time back to be afraid of any issue that has the slightest sexual connotation; to try to pretend that there is not a real area where the individual must make up her or his mind; to try to pretend that one can have one's conscience neatly packaged up and decided by somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because the Government feel that it is worth while to maintain that fiction, to keep on trying to sell that false bill of goods to the Irish people, that they have decided to use the misleading wrapper &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; to describe the measures before us.  I do not like using abusive words, but I would have to say in this case that it seems to me to be an absolutely craven exercise in misleading, mis-packaging and misrepresentation what the Government are at.  Deputy Barnes said earlier &mdash; and she was perfectly right &mdash; that if this were a trade description and it were brought before the Director of Consumer Affairs it would be rightly condemned as giving a completely false and misleading impression of the product. That is why I have proposed that we should call the ballot paper and describe the proposal on the advice to voters, the polling card that we will get, &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; and that that description should be used in all parts of the Bill where that is proposed.  We should speak <Col N="958" /> directly of what we are doing in this Bill and not try to mislead people into thinking that it is something else.  I have made a proposal for the Irish text also.</P>
    <P>If permitted, I would like to make a plea for a little attention to the niceties of the Irish language.  The Labour Party amendment speaks of &ldquo;An tSaincheist Shubstainteach&rdquo;.  I ask them to remember that it is a well-established rule of grammar that one does not have to ally the &ldquo;s&rdquo; after a &ldquo;d&rdquo;, an &ldquo;n&rdquo;, a &ldquo;t&rdquo;, an &ldquo;l&rdquo; or an &ldquo;s&rdquo;.  Since there is one monument to my concern with Irish grammar in the proceedings of this House I hope we might get another one written into these amendments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to go ahead with this attempted deception and to be honest about what the Government are proposing to do.  Unless and until Governments take an honest and open approach to the kind of issues we are dealing with we will be forever condemned to the kind of debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I leave that to the Ministers; they are doing quite well without any assistance from me.  I want to make the point that for so long as this Government or any other Government take such a sneaking, concealed approach to the issues that are before us we will be for ever condemned to the kind of poisonous campaign and poisonous debate we have had since 1981 on this issue.  We will be for ever damned to having only partial, only totally unsatisfactory and, at the end of the day only totally unjust attempts at resolutions to these problems.  The present attempt will be unjust to a number of women here over the years to come.  We will continue to deal unjustly with these issues for as long as Governments try to use deception to pander to perceptions rather than to reality in the way the Government are doing here.  The <Col N="959" /> Minister would be doing a great thing for the way we treat these issues if we were to accept any one of the series of amendments put forward, although, of course, I would have to admit, if I may use a malapropism, a certain pride of paternity in the amendments I have put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for his lesson in Irish grammar, which we appreciate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Labour Party amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 11, one of the reasons the Labour Party decided to put forward the words &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; as opposed to any other terminology was that we knew there would be disagreement between all sides about whether this amendment is what it purports to be.  I could not disagree with Deputy Dukes when he says that it is about the termination of pregnancy.  This amendment actually legalises the termination of pregnancy. The right to life that the Minister talked about, as confirmed today by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, was included in Article 40.3.3º and not in this subsection.  There is no way that the Government can misrepresent the subsection by labelling it the right to life.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party felt that, rather than try to be derogatory, as Gaeilge nó as Bearla, we would say &ldquo;the substantive issue&rdquo;.  As a result of the use of that terminology by the Taoiseach, Government Ministers, spokespersons for all parties and by the public, the moment the phrase &ldquo;the substantive issue&rdquo; is mentioned there is no doubt in people's minds that what is being addressed is the real issue, whether there is a right to termination of pregnancy to save a mother's life.  That is why the Labour Party chose that wording and not a wording that might make the Minister feel we were trying to walk down the road of admitting publicly that this referendum was about the legalisation of termination for pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can easily be argued that the Government are endangering the success of the <Col N="960" /> referenda by this Bill which may be unconstitutional on the grounds of being an interference with the referendum process, contained in Articles 46 and 47, and with the constitutional right to vote. Never before in the history of this State has a referendum ballot paper on any issue been marked by the inclusion of a catch-phrase, a headline or a slogan such as this.</P>
    <P>Even in 1983 when there might have been some argument that this could have been an appropriate title, it was not used.  We will simply confuse the issue in such a way that a private citizen could seek an injunction against this legislation. Apart from that possibility, and here I mention the hypothetical situation, the President could conceivably take the view that the Bill is inappropriate for setting up the three referenda and for scrutiny by the Supreme Court because it does not amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to set up a procedure for an election process.  We could have this dilemma even if she were to refer it to the Supreme Court.  Following the passing of this Bill the President would have seven days in which to refer it and the Supreme Court would have up to 60 days to consider whether they could hear it.  If that happened, the deadline of 3 December could not be met even if the court decided in favour.  There is a distinct possibility that because the Government have sought to mislead the public by calling the white ballot paper the &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo;, we are doing a disservice even to ourselves as legislators, by misleading people into voting for something we know &mdash; if we are honest &mdash; is not what this referendum is about.  The white ballot paper is not the right to life and the Minister knows that; three Ministers disagreed with it; the Taoiseach and Minister for Health said it was legalising indirect abortion and the Minister for Justice talked about direct abortion. However it is done, it is a legal termination of a pregnancy.  This is a very <Col N="961" /> serious matter and we are anxious that the Minister would realise we are not trying to be provocative.  The reason we use the words &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; is that there is no doubt in anybody's mind as to what that stands for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in my name and those of the other Deputies of Democratic Left. There is very little difference between the amendments tabled by Deputy Dukes and myself.  I do not know whether there is a legal difference but the terms are similar.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Ferris's comments on the substantive issue.  That term is vague for many people.  While we may like to think there is avid interest with everybody listening to the debate and knowing precisely what we are talking about, I think the term &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; is media terminology, which the Government promoted to avoid the use of the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; or &ldquo;pregnancy termination&rdquo;.  In the long run it may cause more confusion to substitute &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; with that phrase.</P>
      <P>I was surprised when I saw from the Bill that the Government intended to refer to this amendment as the &ldquo;right to life&rdquo;.  I should not have been surprised because the whole approach of the Government on this issue has been to pretend it did not deal with the question of abortion, that all it was doing was providing for the reassertion of Article 40.3.3, that the Supreme Court had gone too far in defining Article 40.3.3 and that they were bringing it back into line by ruling out suicide as a reason a woman could seek a termination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from the debate in this House that what the Government are proposing is abortion, obviously in extremely limited circumstances, but nevertheless they are providing for abortion in circumstances that did not exist prior to the Supreme Court judgement.  It is in line with the Government's approach that they are denying that is the case by <Col N="962" /> labelling this referendum the &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo; because they want to continue to pretend to a significant number of their own supporters and to people in the so called pro life movement that their heart is still in the right place and that they are defending, come what may, the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>The Minister argued that what is being proposed is the right to life of the unborn and the right to life of women.  I strongly refute that argument because the purpose of the amendment, while providing direct abortion in limited circumstances, is also striking down the decision of the Supreme Court that there was a right to life of the woman in circumstances where she was suicidal.  In fact the Government are narrowing the grounds on which a woman can claim a right to life rather than extending it.  Therefore, it is grossly dishonest for the Government to pretend that this is a right to life amendment.  It is a gross distortion of what this debate is about.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith, from my knowledge of him, is not normally engaged in that kind of deception.  I am surprised he is defending that proposal.  I appeal to him to agree that there should be a change in the title. Three formulations have been put before the House: one from Deputy Dukes &mdash; termination of pregnancy; one from myself &mdash; pregnancy termination, and one from the Labour Party &mdash; the substantive issue.  Either of the first two formulas would be a much clearer expression of what the people are being asked to vote on.  The Minister would do well to take that issue on board.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a particular issue &mdash; the referendum.  I do not think Deputies on any side should be engaged in adding to the myth that politicians cannot be trusted, that they talk in double dutch and that they constantly try to confuse. The impression is that very few of them can be believed no matter what they say.  Labelling this referendum in this way adds to that kind of alienation.  Those <Col N="963" /> who have followed the debate will see it as a device to try to cod them into voting in a particular way or looking at the issue in a way which does not tally with the facts.</P>
    <P>The other two referenda have given very little cause for dispute or dissension in this House because we acknowledge a right to travel and a right to information as general principles.  I, and I am sure other Deputies, have a reservation that there is a pretence that information and travel are not for the purpose of abortion when clearly that is what is being provided for because it is only in those two areas that the question as to these rights has arisen.</P>
    <P>If we were to follow the logic of the title of the abortion referendum which the Government are calling the &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo;, surely the other two should be called the &ldquo;right to travel for abortion&rdquo; and &ldquo;right to information on abortion,&rdquo; because that is what they are about. Although the wording does not clearly state that, we all know what is the intention. On all counts this approach to labelling this referendum the &ldquo;Right to life&rdquo; is wrong and is a mistake on a number of grounds but specifically because it is misleading and will simply add to the alienation and discontent out there with the way politicians handle their business.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt Members but as the question must be put at 10.30 p.m. I would be grateful if they would bear in mind that there is a number of Deputies hoping to contribute.  I am sure, too, that Members would like the Minister to reply to some of their comments before the time expires.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Environment, quite rightly, is very proud of the reforming legislation which he has introduced and I am sure we would all agree that reform of legislation is an important part of our role as legislators. Therefore, I ask him to follow through <Col N="964" /> the thrust and democracy as contained in the Electoral Act.  The issues being discussed here today come within the same area in so far as it should be our aim to put to the people on 3 December, in as clear, direct, simple and non-confusion a form as possible, the three referenda. The people deserve that and we will be undemocratic if we fail in that regard.</P>
      <P>One of the significant and, indeed, sad facts in regard to the 1983 referendum was the very high number of people who did not believe they could exercise their democratic right to vote.  They stayed at home and abstained from voting because they did not know what morally was the right way to vote.  That resulted from the air of confusion which existed in regard to that referendum.  It is a tribute to the electorate that they would show such responsibility and would not cast their vote lightly, particularly in a referendum such as the one we had in 1983.  People here have a high level of respect for our Constitution and seriously consider proposed changes to it.  They will be even more cautious on this occasion.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to take our suggestions on board.  He accused us of muddying the water.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the fact that he was labelled an abortionist at one time and the Minister indicated that he, too, had been labelled in a similar manner. The best, most sincere and solid way in which we can meet that type of labelling and insidious intimidation, of which we have all been victims from time to time, is to be clean, honest and sincere on all sides of the House in presenting a face that does not attempt to be devious or give the electorate any sense of being used or abused.  A major part of the <Col N="965" /> reform the Minister is proposing should involve taking on board the amendments that have been tabled to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence, what we are discussing at this stage of the debate is not the actual wording of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, but a descriptive title that will appear on the ballot paper, nothing more.  This is not something that, if the Minister feels sympathetic towards what is being urged on him from all sides of the House would require going back to the Attorney General or to the parliamentary draftsman. He need not have any concern in regard to interference with the main thrust of the Bill.  Nothing like that arises.  We are talking about no more than a marginal title and description.  If the Minister feels that there is force to our arguments he can, with perfect safety, accept the fact that, to be fair to the public, a more neutral description of what is being put before them in the referenda should be adduced.</P>
      <P>The use of the description &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; imports that that, in effect, is what the Twelfth Amendment is doing.  It is appropriate that we should hear the views of the Minister for Justice who moved the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and, therefore, is responsible for it. His views in regard to the thrust of this Bill would surely assist the Minister for the Environment in deciding whether he should alter the description.  Fortunately, the views of the Minister for Justice are set out in his opening speech to which I would refer the Minister for the Environment. In a paragraph entitled, Summary of effects of Bills, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The first point I want to make about the amendment proposed in the Twelfth Amendment Bill is that it will leave undisturbed the existing affirmative acknowledgement in Article 40.3.3º of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> The Minister for Justice stated that the affirmative acknowledgement will be undisturbed in Article 40.3.3º and will not be affected by the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Bill.  He went on to say that the amendment will be an addition to the existing Article 40.3.3º, not a substitution for it.  I would draw the attention of the Minister for the Environment &mdash; this is really the nub of the matter &mdash; to the following remark by the Minister:</P>
    <P>Under the amendment, where a pregnant women is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated if that is necessary to save her life.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister for Justice's summary of the effect of the Twelfth Amendment. We in the Labour Party would be happy if the Democratic Left or the Fine Gael amendments were accepted, but our neutral format has much to commend it.  The Minister for Justice holds a similar view to ours because when he referred to the substance of the Twelfth Amendment the headnote in his speech referred to the substantive issue.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but I would like to advert again to the time factor involved and to the desirability of other Members participating in so far as time permits. The House may also wish to hear the views of the Minister in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice used the description &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; in his speech.  We should not underestimate the intelligence of the electorate; they know what the substantive issue is.  There has been plenty of talk about it.  They know about the right to travel, the right to information and about <Col N="967" /> the substantive issue.  A neutral description is required and for that reason, the most important of the suggested amendments before the House is the one dealing with the substantive issue.  I ask the Ministers who are in the House not to make a big deal of this point.  It is only the descriptive title we are discussing.  It does not affect the thrust or the wording.  Why not acknowledge the deeply felt views of so many Deputies on the issue and accept the change without making a big political issue out of it.  There will be enough division on the issue without disagreeing on the matter of descriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Fine Gael amendment because looking at this proposal on the white ballot paper which is headed &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo;, one must ask, whose right to life?  The details that we have been given do not specify who, in that situation, has a right to life.  What right to life has the mother, what right to life has the foetus?  That is not specified in the proposal and in previous debates in the House the Government have said very clearly that they will not bring legislation before the House to clarify the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What right to life has the foetus?  At what stage will it be lawful to terminate a pregnancy where the life of the mother is threatened?  In relation to a mother who has an illness that may be life-threatening for her, at what stage can she receive treatment that could and will bring about a termination of her pregnancy in order to save her life?  Who will decide that and at what stage will the decision be made?  There are no specific guidelines on this issue and the position is most unclear.  This wording is totally misleading.  It is giving an impression to the electorate that this is specific to giving certain persons the right to life.  Deputies know that the Twelfth Amendment concerns the termination of pregnancy. However, I can see the hand of Fianna Fáil in this and the hand, in particular, <Col N="968" /> of those who would consider themselves as cute Ministers, who said, we know how to deal with this, we will keep them all happy.  I am sure the Minister for Justice had a big hand in it also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He thinks he is a cute Minister.  Unfortunately, when the electorate cast their vote on this issue they believe that they will have in their hand a ballot paper that will be specific in relation to the termination of pregnancy or abortion in certain circumstances. Instead, they will be presented with a ballot paper headed &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo; which is completely dishonest, unfair and confusing to the electorate.  The Government are attempting to confuse the issue and in the final analysis, the electorate are being asked to vote, having been presented with three questions which will confuse them even more.  The Government hope that by creating confusion they will manage to carry the vote on the day. This is a most irresponsible stance for the Government to take.  The honourable thing for the Minister to do this evening is to agree to the amendment and substitute the words &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; for &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo;.  The wording as it stands is a deliberate attempt to mislead voters.  This form of wording on a ballot paper is unprofessional and does not comply with the normal legal presentation of constitutional referenda in the past.</P>

      <P>I wish to add my voice to what has been already said. There is, I believe, a certain element of &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; politics attached to this issue. Nevertheless, I support the Labour Party's amendment because I believe a neutral title is required.  For the past six months people have been hearing about the substantive issue.  It is a well known phrase now and I believe people understand <Col N="969" /> its meaning.  I do not know if the Minister would consider changing the wording but it is very important that he would.  I am sure the Minister and the Government have other considerations in mind such as the bishops' views, but the electorate must be given an honest, straightforward ballot paper, and a wording such as &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; would be most suitable.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to substitute &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; or &ldquo;pregnancy termination&rdquo; or the &ldquo;substantive issue&rdquo; for &ldquo;right to life&rdquo;, both in relation to the headings on the ballot papers and in the statement for the information of voters. The sole purpose of the proposed headings on the ballot papers is to assist the voters to distinguish between them.  Just like the colours chosen for the ballot papers, the headings have no significance whatsoever other than as a distinguishing feature.  The actual matter on which the electorate will vote is the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the relevant constitutional amendment Bill. The question on the ballot paper will be, do you approve of the proposal to amend the Constitution contained in the undermentioned Bill.  The short title of the Bill concerned will be printed immediately beneath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the people will vote on. In this context, the heading is entirely irrelevant.  People are not being asked to vote on the heading or to comment on it in any way.  The heading is simply a <Col N="970" /> distinguishing feature which sets one ballot paper apart from the other two.  In theory, at least, any kind of distinguishing characteristic could be used, such as a symbol, or number, or letter or different sizes of ballot paper.  The clearest and simplest method is to use a word or words which will convey clearly to the electorate which of the three separate issues the particular ballot paper deals with.</P>

      <P>It provides for a situation where there may be a conflict between these two rights.  In this event, the right to life of the mother will prevail.  Far from being a slogan adopted by any one faction in this controversy, the right to life is the matter with which everybody involved is passionately concerned.  I have to say that the expression &ldquo;termination of pregnancy&rdquo; is not used at all either in the existing article or in the Twelfth Amendment, nor is the concept of termination of pregnancy, nor the expression &ldquo;the substantive issue&rdquo;.  Why, at this stage, should we seek to complicate matters by the introduction of a new concept and a <Col N="971" /> new form of wording?  Deputy Dukes, again used the words &ldquo;it shall be lawful to terminate&rdquo;.
