    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to amend motion No. 7 on the Order Paper of 21 October in regard to sittings and business concerning the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. I propose that: We delete all words after &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo; in paragraph (5) of the text and substitute the following under the heading &ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo;: Tuesday, 27 October, Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Third Stage, to conclude by 5 p.m.; Tuesday, 27 October, Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Third Stage, to conclude by 7 p.m.; Wednesday, 27 October, Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Third Stage, to conclude by 10.30 p.m.; Tuesday, 3 November, Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Fourth and Fifth Stages to conclude by 6 p.m.; Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Fourth and Fifth Stages to conclude by 9.15 p.m. and Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Fourth and Fifth Stages to conclude by 11 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main difference between my proposal and that of the Government is that it allows a delay of a weekend between Committee Stages and Report Stages of the various Bills.  It is usual in debates on legislation in this House that points are raised during Committee Stage discussion which suggest amendments that need to be drafted and brought in on Report Stage.  If Report Stage immediately follows Committee Stage it will not be possible to draft those amendments or to take advice on them.  I propose, therefore, that there be a further gap of a weekend between Committee Stages and Report Stages of the Bills to allow any points that arise during Committee Stages that warrant amendment, either from the Government or the Opposition, to be framed and discussed.  That is a reasonable proposal which would not unduly delay the timetable &mdash; it would simply delay it by one week.  It would not add to the amount of debating time in the House but would allow a period wherein amendments arising on Committee Stage <Col N="4" /> can be drafted for discussion on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the taking of No. 7 without debate, as I did yesterday, because it is the wrong way for this House to do its business.  If the Taoiseach persists in holding the referendum on 3 December he is doing a great disservice to the way we do our business.  Given the divisiveness in the debate yesterday evening, perhaps the Taoiseach would consider allowing more time for consideration of this issue so that the House might arrive at a consensus.  The error on the Taoiseach's part is his persistence in holding the referendum on 3 December.</P>

      <P>I see no problem with Deputy Bruton's proposal in so far as it seeks to provide additional time for debate, and I hope it will be possible to reach agreement in providing it.  The main reason I rise is to point out that the Referendum (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which provides for the holding of the <Col N="5" /> referenda and the form of the ballot, was circulated this morning but there is no indication in the schedule of business as to when this Bill will be discussed.  Will the Taoiseach say when the Bill will be introduced and how much time will be provided for its discussion?  Will he say why the so-called substantive issue will be headed on the ballot paper, &ldquo;The Right to Life&rdquo;?  This is an under-handed, &ldquo;sleeveen&rdquo; way of dealing with the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

I will repeat what I said yesterday, we never at any stage tried to stifle debate; we offered whatever time was required but we were never told distinctly what this was.  We said yesterday that we would discuss it last night and there was agreement on an extension of time.  Let us hope people are satisfied with that.  I gave my word to the people which will be kept, my word is my bond, let everybody else sort himself out.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, a Cheann Comhairle, I have already asked the Taoiseach, in relation to the referendum amendment (No. 2) Bill, two questions to which he has not replied.  One question is when will the Bill be taken and how much time will be allocated to it?  I also ask the Taoiseach why it is that he is insisting on describing the white ballot paper on the abortion question as &ldquo;the right to life&rdquo;, which is misleading in view of the debate that is taking place in this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>At midnight last night certain views were expressed by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, in particular, on this subject and during the debate they almost tried to wash their hands of the <Col N="20" /> situation which arose in 1981 and 1983.  I should like to put the record straight.  In 1983 the Parliamentary Labour Party, in the Seanad in particular, were totally opposed to the taking of that Bill on Second Stage because, as we pointed out with considerable force having regard to the legal advice available to us at that time, the words presented by Fianna Fáil and supported by the Pro-Life Movement could lead us into dangerous situations which would put people's lives at risk.  It does not give me any satisfaction &mdash; or the Labour Party any kudos &mdash; to say that our worst fears in 1983 were confirmed and that the words that were used or, more specifically, the legal interpretation of the words used have led to where we are today in regard to this matter.  Are we about to make the same mistake again and if we are, will we compound the original mistake?  By the insertion of these words in the Constitution will we do a disservice to the lives, welfare, health and protection of more than 50 per cent of our population, whether they are our wives or our daughters?  Should we be asked by any Government to accept words which would give women a lesser right to life than anybody else? That brings us back to the question of leadership, trust, consensus or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party tried to achieve a consensus in this regard and, as has been said, it is doubtful whether the Government side ever wanted to reach a consensus. They obviously had their minds made up as was the case when they were in Opposition in 1983.  Because the electorate trusted the Fianna Fáil Party and the Pro-Life Movement in 1983 they voted overwhelmingly for what they believed to be correct, to protect the life of the unborn and the mother and the Constitution was amended giving both the child and the mother equal rights in a pregnancy where a choice might have to be made.  Unfortunately, when a case arose where that choice had to be made, namely the X case, we discovered the implications of that decision.  From discussions I have had with people in my constituency, I am satisfied that the majority of people in giving that view in <Col N="21" /> 1983 believed that what they were doing was giving a positive right to the unborn child and an equal right to the life of the mother.  To date, I have not seen any evidence to suggest that the people have changed their minds in regard to that decision.  The majority of people whom I know want to protect the life of the unborn and the lives of women and girls at risk during pregnancy.  We, in the Labour Party, share those objectives which is why our leader said yesterday that he is the pro-life leader of a pro-life party which is the oldest pro-life party in the country.  At the same time, we believe that few people in Ireland would want to place a restriction on the freedom of any of those people to travel.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Maastricht Treaty Deputy O'Kennedy, who is a barrister, said there was no restriction on people in regard to travel and members of the Government also said this.  Some judges of the Supreme Court said that there was a restriction on travel and patiently explained why and under what circumstances. It is extraordinary that Mr. Binchy informed us that he sees no problem in regard to the right of women to travel.  We do not need that kind of assurance from a self-appointed spokesperson such as Mr. Binchy or, for that matter, from any group.  However, a question was raised in regard to the right to travel in certain circumstances and, therefore, it was patently misleading for people, such as Deputy O'Kennedy and others, to suggest that there was any confusion in this area.  It is for that reason there are three Bills before the House today, in regard to the right to travel, the right to information &mdash; on which, at last, people have reached agreement &mdash; and the right to abortion.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if we are doing a disservice to the people again, because we have shown a lack of leadership or, indeed, courage in being unable to get the Government to agree to address any of these problems by way of legislation by which they could have been dealt with by way of intrinsic amendments in this House, but the Government ran away from this problem.  The X case was <Col N="22" /> brought to the Supreme Court and the Government castigated that court and its members for their decisions.  The Minister for Justice has now assured everybody that there is no problem in this regard and that in the Government's view a consensus has been reached.  They say that all the people, including the pro-life people, were wrong, apart from the Minister for Justice.  Last night the Minister for Health assured us that he would lay down regulations and guidelines for the medical profession who have already stated that they are divided on this issue. How can we lay down regulations for professional people who will be confronted in the future with making a decision that is supposed to combine its movements within the constrictions in the Constitution, defend the right to life of the mother and the unborn, with all the pious platitudes and aspirations that one expects in a Constitution?  It is a very dangerous way to deal with this matter. It comes back to trust: can anybody trust any medical or legal view of any side of this House when from experience in this very difficult area we know this issue could eventually be returned to the Supreme Court for their interpretation of what we now accept, or do not accept, will be inserted into our Constitution? Can anyone trust the Government on their record on these issues when we remember that during the Supreme Court case &mdash; which they suggested would be taken and for which they agreed to cover the costs &mdash; a barrister representing them in the Supreme Court said that if an English woman came to Ireland, learned she was pregnant and wished to return to England to avail of what is a legal service there, and if he learned of her pregnancy he would have no choice but to prevent her returning to England?</P>
    <P>How can we trust a Government who have decided, without consultation, to insert a Protocol into the Maastricht Treaty?  Can we trust them when they told us that this Protocol would be legally binding but then sought a derogation on the Protocol?  Having discussed the matter with their colleagues in Europe we were given another assurance that it <Col N="23" /> would have legal binding when the legal opinion from Europe at the time was that it would not.  How did the Minister, Deputy Flynn, deal with the Protocol in his speech yesterday?  He said:</P>
    <P>The Protocol relates to Article 40.3.3 as it stood on 7 February 1992 when the Treaty was signed.  On the face of things Article 40.3.3 as interpreted by the Supreme Court should retain the protection of the Protocol when the Treaty comes into effect and this would mean that abortion could not in any event be legalised beyond the extent permitted by the Supreme Court.  The Solemn Declaration on the Protocol to the Treaty, adopted by the member states on 1 May 1992... </P>
    <P>One can question with hindsight whether that Solemn Declaration means anything.  It provides that&mdash;</P>
    <P>... in the event of a constitutional amendment of Article 40.3.3 the contracting parties to the Treaty will, following the entry into force of the Treaty, be favourably disposed to amending the Protocol so as to extend its application to any such constitutional amendment.  If the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution is passed the question of invoking the procedure set out in the Solemn Declaration with a view to securing an amendment of the Protocol will be taken up. </P>
    <P>If the Government do take it up, can we trust them or will we be left again with two constitutional amendments, one of which has already been interpreted by the Supreme Court and the other which we are trying to ensure they cannot reinterpret? We then have to link that with our colleagues in Europe, the contracting parties to a Solemn Declaration.  All we can say to the Irish people today is that it will be taken up.  Our party leader was correct yesterday when he stated that for the first time this Bill will incorporate into our Constitution the principle of legal abortion.</P>
    <P>Our task is to reassure the Irish people <Col N="24" /> that they can trust the legislators.  When it comes to this subject they have stated that they cannot trust them.  I have met various groups and I had letters from people, such as Sister Brid McKenna, a person for whom I have the greatest respect, and with whom I could not disagree about anything she stated in her letter.</P>
    <P>I have also met people representing the pro-life movement in my constituency and I did not notice any sign of intransigence in their views.  They were concerned that the opinion they had expressed in 1983 had been proven to be incorrect.  I suggested that they come up with alternative wording if they were so concerned about the matter.  These people were reasonable and we had a consensus in that all of us felt we had a duty to perform.  However, when the pro-life movement suggested an alternative wording to the Government recently, the Government rubbished it.  Yesterday the Minister, Deputy Flynn, rubbished the idea of any wording that the pro-life movement put to him.  He gave us legal views as to why they were not acceptable. Indeed, the Minister has treated suggestions from all the political parties with disregard.  In other words, he is right, and what he says is right.  As President Bush would say, &ldquo;read my lips&rdquo;; it is like a papal dogma; he does not make mistakes.</P>
    <P>This was the line followed by Deputy Briscoe last night.  Now that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, and Deputy Briscoe have spoken there is no need to continue this debate.  That is a very intransigent attitude to adopt when people are concerned about this issue and it will not be resolved with the wording that has been presented by the Government.  That will lead to further difficulties and make more difficult the task that lies ahead.</P>
    <P>Apart from suggesting amendments to the Government this week, our task is to protect the rights espoused by all Deputies and that will involve much debate, argument, compromise, analysis and, finally, a decision which we should not simply dump on the electorate by saying it is the only option.  The reality is <Col N="25" /> that in this case they have no options. They have the opportunity to vote Yes or No on two items that are not contentious, but then they must vote on an issue which gives them no option, an issue they felt they had decided in 1983.</P>
    <P>There are fundamental differences in our approach to these matters and I am concerned that this will lead to further divisiveness.  It will lead to a national debate that no Member will understand because it will be so emotive.  If the pro-life movement takes on the Government &mdash; it is quite obvious that the Progressive Democrats are unhappy &mdash; it will be an amazing turn of events that two groups, who were originally merged, will come apart because the Government are providing for legalised abortion in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Those are the options the Irish electorate have.  The electorate accepted the advice given them in 1983, foolishly in our opinion.  That will pale into insignificance when they consider the confusion that will arise on the legal interpretation of the wording.  There are members in my party who are more capable of interpreting these words.  I am concerned, having listened to the medical and legal advice available, that the words proposed by the Government do not address the question.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it will be necessary, irrespective of whether this legislation is passed, to introduce some legislative measure to address the two aspects of these constitutional amendments, the question of information and of the right to life of the unborn and the superior right to life of the mother when her life is at risk.  They are two important areas and the Government have not satisfied me that they know or care what they are doing in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this debate ends people will be clearer in their minds as to the options before them which are being put forward in haste, without proper debate or any effort to reach consensus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As a man I feel somewhat inhibited talking about these matters, <Col N="26" /> particularly the substantive issue, because no man can fully appreciate or understand the emotions and feelings that women experience in the process of conceiving and bearing a child, or perhaps losing a child.  It is with that <i>caveat</i>, of which I am painfully conscious, that I contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>The history of this sad and sordid constitutional mess is rooted in something which I find to be offensive, fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-republican. The claim made by some people is that politicians are not to be trusted and therefore into our Constitution had to be written a provision for the protection of the life of the unborn, so that no group of elected politicians could at some future stage remove that protection.  A group of highly motivated, well financed and fanatical fundamentalists unfortunately persuaded the then Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Haughey, and the then Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Fitzgerald, to give a commitment in 1982 to insert in our Constitution the amendment which has brought us to the point where we are today.  That is where it started.  It is to his eternal credit that the late Frank Cluskey in his inimitable fashion told those people where to get off.  It is a tribute to the courage of the present Leader of the Labour Party that within a week of taking on that responsibility in November 1982 he said that he would not give such a commitment to these fundamentalists because of the constitutional implications which could arise from the proposed wording.  The rest is history, but history has a tragic way of repeating itself.  I cannot use the Marxist phrase, &ldquo;once in tragedy, second in farce&rdquo; because this is no farcical matter.  It is an extraordinary matter which is of concern to everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party unashamedly exploited the decency and religious belief of large numbers of the population in 1983.  They mobilised those sincere people, telling them there was a way to amend the Constitution which would not have complications.  In 1983 the people in Dublin South-East, my constituency, who silently manned the polling stations <Col N="27" /> were in many cases Fianna Fáil activists wearing pro-life labels and taking pleasure in what they saw as the political discomfort of the Government of the day. There was total disregard for the sincerity and beliefs of the people whose hearts and minds they had mobilised and total disregard for the political damage they were inflicting on the fabric of this republic by putting into the Constitution a nonsensical wording which would ultimately be found to be contradictory by the Supreme Court.  Today Fianna Fáil can run but they can no longer hide.  They have to say that they are legislating for abortion.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two parts of yesterday's speech by the Minister for Justice. I am not purporting to include the Progressive Democrats in this farce.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under the amendment, where a pregnant woman is suffering from a physical medical condition such that her life is endangered if the pregnancy continues, the pregnancy may be lawfully terminated if that is necessary to save her life.</P>
    <P>For lawfully terminated, use the more colloquial phrase, the pregnancy may be legally aborted.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>There is no warrant whatsoever for any suggestion that the amendment will open the door to abortion.  It is most emphatically not an abortion amendment.  Far from making the law concerning abortion more permissive, as some people are wrongly suggesting, the amendment will have exactly the opposite affect: it will prohibit abortion in circumstances where it is now permitted without disturbing existing medical practice and without putting mothers' lives at risk. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When is an abortion not an abortion?  This is the nub of the question. <Col N="28" /> This Fianna Fáil pro-life Government are putting forward legislation to give legal effect to abortion.  They have insulted, misled and betrayed a constituency, in many cases a sincere and well meaning constituency, who trusted them.  I hope that lesson of betrayal will be learned by that constituency at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>We have three Bills before us relating to three proposals which will be put to the people on 3 December.  Citizens are being asked to vote for the right to travel. In 1992, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the dictatorship in Argentina, the collapse of totalitarianism in countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain and after the amelioration of the fundamentalist Islamic Republic's stance in relation to women's rights in Iran, in this Republic of Ireland citizens are being asked to affirm by way of an amendment to the Constitution, because of an interpretation by the Supreme Court of the 1983 amendment, the right to travel.  As a citizen, I find that absolutely insulting and if I was a woman I would feel degraded by being asked to vote to affirm that right.  Nevertheless I will vote and will recommend that people generally do so.  The right should never have been questioned in the first place.</P>
      <P>The second point is the right to information. What kind of country is this republic when we have to affirm the right to information about services which are legally available?  When did the Inquisition end?  When did the Cold War end? When did &ldquo;darkness at noon&rdquo; end?  What is the mentality of a political party who can bring themselves in 1992, eight years from the end of a second millenium and 70 years after this State was created by people who had the courage to put words on paper honestly and openly, to ask us to do this sort of thing?  They claim it is necessary because of the Supreme Court judgment, a judgment which they repeatedly asserted in 1983 could not possibly be made.  Now we have to vote for the right to information about services legally available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I publicly applaud the students who led the charge in this matter.  I hope as a consequence of this right being formally <Col N="29" /> put back into the Constitution that the oppressive witch hunt that SPUC have mounted against those students, both collectively and individually, will cease. That witch hunt had the effect that many of those students who were cited and charged in various judgments still have hanging over their heads the threat of legal costs resulting from previous actions, which would have the effect of bankrupting any one of those students. As has been said by an eminent lawyer they have been effectively exiled from this country by virtue of the SPUC threat to pursue them in the manner in which they have been pursued.  No doubt, Deputy Taylor will be better able to refer to that, if he chooses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the substantive issue, we have here a proposal to introduce abortion under our Constitution, but a commitment not to provide legislation to interpret how it can be administered by doctors, nurses and hospitals or understood by lawyers and everybody else.  I do not know of any other provision in our Constitution about which the Government say, &ldquo;we will put this in&rdquo;, while giving an undertaking in advance that under no circumstances will they produce legislation to enable us to understand or interpret it.  It is like demanding that a pilot be sent up into the air without a flight plan, instructions, maps or navigational equipment.  What a risky way to embark on any kind of civil action. Ultimately this will again end up in the Supreme Court and we will have a Y case.</P>
    <P>Hard cases make bad law, yet we are being asked to use the wording from the X case judgment which refers to saving the life as distinct from the health of the woman.  The Minister justifies the reason for using that sacrosanct phraseology by saying it is because it came from one of the Supreme Court judgments.  It is certainly a very eminent judgment but it should not be sacrosanct.  We are not locked into it.  We should do what the late lamented Supreme Court Judge Mr. Justice McCarthy, asked us to do, take democratic courage in our hands and do <Col N="30" /> the job we were charged with, which is to legislate.</P>
    <P>If we are to legislate for abortion, as we are being asked to do and as the Minister's text has clearly indicated, I do not want to save the life, as distinct from the health of any woman.  I want to protect the lives of all women and their health by implication.  I do not want to make a distinction and I will live with whatever way history interprets the meaning of the life of the woman and what threatens the life of any woman. Every woman should have the right to respond as she wishes if she becomes pregnant as a result of rape or incest. They should have that choice in this Republic and not have to scurry away in the middle of the night like criminals, carrying the hurt of the criminal act without having the right to have it redressed in this Republic.</P>
    <P>The leader of the Progressive Democrats came into this Chamber and ended his speech by referring to his declaration that he will stand by the Republic.  Where is his stance now?  Where are the Progressive Democrats now when the Republic is being undermined by this kind of legislation that will drive citizens of this State to another jurisdiction which is much maligned in the pantheon of rhetoric from the Fianna Fáil Party, to find redress for crimes committed here, when they should, as citizens, have the right to redress here.  This is the offensive nonsense we are being asked to write into our Constitution.  I reject it utterly.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I want to concentrate on one aspect of the referendum that will be put to the people. It is particularly odious and unacceptable that we are being asked to approve a measure that deliberately sets out to roll back the Supreme Court judgment in the X case in respect of the threat of suicide. What this provision means is that we do not trust the Supreme Court.  Last night in this House, Deputy Briscoe dismissed the Supreme Court judgment as highly controversial and said that its validity had been disputed by many eminent lawyers without, of course, managing to name any of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> It follows from our Constitution that judgments of the Supreme Court cannot be invalid.  One may disagree with them but they are the ultimate tribunal of assessment and interpretation of our law. In the X case the Supreme Court, to their eternal credit, got this country off a hook on which it was firmly dangling.  If the Supreme Court had held otherwise what would have been the outcome assuming the unfortunate girl had carried out her threat which eminent psychiatrists had determined was a real one?  That is what we have to face in this referendum so far as the issue of suicide is concerned.  There is and must be a very real risk that in some cases some unfortunate girl or woman will be considered by psychiatrists to be likely to carry out a threat of suicide, and will do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice in his speech yesterday referring to the context of danger of life from an ongoing pregnancy said:</P>
    <P>If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it.  There is a duty on all of us to ensure that nothing is put into the Constitution which might, even in the remotest possible case, mean that action that was necessary to save a woman's life would not be taken.</P>
    <P>If the risk to a girl or woman from suicide is only one in a million, why then do the Minister and the Government take it upon themselves to specifically exclude that case in the wording for this referendum?</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is considerable room for a subjective judgment in assessing whether a risk of suicide exists.  Maybe there is a subjective element in it but nonetheless we have here skilled and experienced psychiatrists who know their job and we should pay attention to and respect what they say although they may say that the risk may not arise in many cases.  If it arises in only one case how would any of us in this House feel if we adopt this referendum and exclude the provision for a termination <Col N="32" /> in the case of a threat of suicide?  If the person is unable for financial and other considerations to avail of the safety net being allowed, to go to the UK to have the termination and goes ahead and commits suicide, thereby destroying herself and the foetus, how would any of us feel about carrying that on our consciences for the rest of our days in the knowledge that we contributed to it? That is one major responsibility for any Deputy to take upon himself and it is quite outrageous that the Government are prepared to put such a suggestion before us today.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe's contribution yesterday was a milder version of the whispering campaign that is being conducted by elements of the so-called pro-life movement and by members of the Fianna Fáil ever since the Supreme Court judgment was issued.  That campaign has been conducted against the Supreme Court, against the girl at the centre of the X case and against her family.  It has been a degrading and debasing exercise.  It says far more about the people conducting it than it does about their targets.  Much worse, the amendment we are being asked to pass into law in the form of a constitutional amendment is asking us to state that we do not trust women.  The inference to be drawn from the whole approach taken by the Government is that if we give women any grounds for seeking abortion they will be queueing up to avail of the service. What a comment that is on the men who have put this law together.</P>
    <P>Last night on RTE television a family that had been systematically abused by their father told in simple and moving terms of the trauma and suffering they had endured at the hands of a sexual abuser.  It was a good illustration, if one were needed, of the prevalence of pain, mental disturbance and guilt that a sexual abuser can inflict, and it was an illustration in microcosm of a serious social problem that has been a hidden part of our society for many years.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had another illustration of a different aspect of the same <Col N="33" /> problem when the tragic story of Anne Lovett was carried in full detail in all our media.  I can remember well meaning people all over the country saying that we must not let this kind of thing happen again.  We do not know how Anne Lovett became pregnant.  All we know is that the shame of her pregnancy killed her.  We do not, in the nature of things, know how many victims of sexual abuse become pregnant.  All we know is that those who do suffer the kind of mental torment that most of us never have to experience.</P>
    <P>Much reference has been made in this State to the study published last week by Dr. Anthony Clare.  One aspect of that study which has not been adverted to was the finding that in general terms the risk of suicide among pregnant women is lower than among the population in general, but it exists and is real nonetheless. Several reasons have been adduced by professional psychiatrists for this.  First, for the great majority of families and mothers pregnancy is a happy and fulfilling event, often a long sought event.  Second, there is an innate sense of responsibility and compassion that characterises women and that enables them to face motherhood in a positive spirit.  Third, pregnancy is a time when families provide a high degree of support.</P>
    <P>The study also showed that there are occasions when these ingredients might not be present, particularly in societies which have a repressive attitude and history in relation to sexual issues.  The victim of rape or incest can also find herself the victim of intolerance, deprived of love and support when she needs it most, outcast from the society to which she belongs, and that is when she is most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the head of a supposedly caring organisation called Women Hurt by Abortion addressed the annual general meeting of another supposedly caring organisation called Family Solidarity. He was not able to find the time in his address to refer to the victims of rape and incest.  Instead he referred to women who had secured abortions and said that they had been reduced to the <Col N="34" /> status of garbage which produces garbage. This was the &ldquo;caring&rdquo; description of this caring organisation of the women they claim to care about.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, too, the <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i> published what I would describe as a truly caring response.  I believe it is worthwhile quoting what they had to say for the record of this House:</P>
    <P>Ministers must make up their minds &mdash; whether to bow to blackmail and organised pressure, or to decide that in a modern, adult society, the only honourable course is to allow people to make up their minds about the things that vitally affect their own lives &mdash; after legislation is in place to ensure order, reflection and protection for others who may be involved.</P>
    <P>It is long past the time when we must cut through the hypocrisy that surrounds this issue in Ireland.  There can be no more odious form of hypocrisy than a set of laws underpinned by a constitutional framework that says to the women of Ireland &ldquo;you can have an abortion in Ireland provided you are at death's door for the want of it, and provided that you can find a doctor who will agree that you are ill enough and can reconcile the operation with his own conscience; otherwise you are free to leave and have the abortion in England &mdash; and, by the way, here is a set of brochures to facilitate you in finding a clinic somewhere else.&rdquo;  I find it hard to imagine a more hypocritical formula then this, and I find it hard to believe that any Government who believe in the democratic will of the people would seriously be foisting this amendment on them.</P>
    <P>There is a famous legal textbook called <i>Constitutions of the World.</i>  I searched for such a formula in it, looking for a parallel somewhere else, anywhere else for this proposition, but there is none.  What this means is that we are about to become the first country in the world that, on the one hand, will write into our Constitution an explicit provision that will provide directly for legal abortion and, on the other, make a set of arrangements that will ensure that no woman will ever be <Col N="35" /> able to avail of that provision.  Why are we doing it?  Surely the only answer is that we have to make these kinds of arrangements because women cannot be trusted, and what on earth gives us the right to say that?  On what basis are we making the outrageous assumption that women in Ireland are going to abuse the law to terminate pregancies on some sort of whim?</P>
    <P>In a sense this debate has come full circle.  It started because a small, intolerant and professional organised pressure group decided that they did not trust the legislators.  Then they decided they did not trust the courts and now they have decided they do not trust women.</P>
    <P>If I am ill and go to hospital, I am not going to stand for any doctor saying to me that I am not yet sick enough to warrant treatment.  I do not know a doctor who would say it in the first place, and I am certainly not going to tolerate a doctor taking down his copy of the Constitution and telling me that according to his interpretation of the Constitution I can have one form of treatment that will probably shorten my life but that he cannot give me the treatment to protect my life.</P>
    <P>I will campaign in any way I can to defeat this amendment.  If I needed an incentive to do so it is contained in what the Government obviously see as their threat to legislate on the issue if the amendment is defeated.  The defeat of this amendment would restore this whole issue to the place where it has always belonged, the Floor of this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, as a woman, as a feminist, as a liberal and as a life long member of Fianna Fáil I very much welcome <Col N="36" /> the amendments we in Government are putting before the people of Ireland on 3 December.</P>
    <P>Amendment 12 gives full protection to the lives of pregnant women.  Amendment 13 ensures that the Constitution cannot be invoked to prevent a woman travelling abroad, whatever the purpose of her journey, and Amendment 14 means that the Constitution cannot be invoked to prevent the dissemination of information about services lawfully available for women in another State.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Shatter spoke in this House of the docile acceptance by Fianna Fáil women of the wording.  About two weeks ago an eminent journalist in the <i>Irish Press</i> also spoke about docile women in Fianna Fáil.  I cannot believe that any reasonable man &mdash; although I would have to say that I do not count Deputy Shatter in their number &mdash; can look at my political track record and hope to get away with calling me docile.  Not only am I not politically docile but I was a member of the sub-committee which developed this wording.</P>
    <P>Because these amendments enhance the position of women in our Constitution, on this issue they enhance the protection and entitlement of women.</P>
    <P>The amendments should be welcomed by every woman in Ireland.  The one that has sparked off most headlines and controversy is the one that has come to be called the substantive issue, and, as far as women are concerned, one phrase in the amendment has been singled out and attacked on the basis that it is offensive to women &mdash; that is, the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think many women have been concerned by this inclusion.  I must also say that political opportunists, frightened of stating openly what they feel on the substantive issue themselves, have used this phrase as a stick to beat the Government with and in the process needlessly heightened the fears of women.</P>
    <P>The political opportunists have used this phrase to frighten and mislead people.  That is precisely what they are using it to do; to mislead women into the belief that there is some lack of respect <Col N="37" /> for their health in the way the wording runs.  There is no lack of respect.  On the contrary, the lack of respect is in the political opportunists on the other side of this House who know very well what the wording means, but who are prepared to sow confusion and dismay rather than acknowledge it.</P>

      <P>Why does the wording include the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;?  Let us get one thing clear &mdash; the pedigree behind the phrase is very distinguished.  It was used by the Chief Justice in his judgment in the X case.  Not only that, but as the Minister for Justice pointed out yesterday in this House, the other judges also focused on a risk to life rather than a risk to health in their judgments.</P>
      <P>Why then should women have expressed concern?  Part of the reason was a view expressed by some doctors that introducing the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could be seen as limiting the flexibility which doctors are permitted to exercise in the best interests of the patient under current medical practice. The concern of those doctors was that the wording might result in pushing them for a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before giving treatment which might result in the loss of the foetus.  As all of us know, normal medical practice operates on the basis of probability, not certainty.</P>

    <P>If those are the concerns of women &mdash; mirroring the concerns of doctors &mdash; let me offer some ease and clarification.  The amendment is not seeking from doctors a greater degree of certainty about the risk to the mother's life before providing treatment.  Nothing in the wording changes the basic test given by the Supreme Court in the X case as &ldquo;a real and substantial risk to the mother's life arising as a matter of probability.&rdquo;  Let me put it <Col N="38" /> more bluntly &mdash; pregnant women will not be denied medical or surgical treatment necessary to protect their health.  As at present, under the amendment women will receive all treatment necessary to protect their health.  The question of termination only arises where there is a threat to the mother's life.</P>
    <P>Let us imagine, for a moment, that we were to remove the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; from the proposed amendment.  This would mean that we were omitting from the constitutional provision which reproduces the essence of the test laid down by the Supreme Court, an element which now would be significant because of its omission.  If it could be safely left out, we would leave it out, but we cannot, because if we left it out any future hard case which was not related to a life-threatening condition could be the ground for abortion.  I am not scare-mongering; I am extrapolating from the British experience.  This is precisely what happened there, in the Bourne case, and the end results of that case are clear.</P>

      <P>In seeking to misconstrue the wording &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; as anti-women, Members of the Opposition are knowingly fudging the issue of the consequences which would be inevitable if that phrase were removed.  The Twelfth Amendment seeks to maintain a just and proper balance between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me spell out yet another reassurance for women &mdash; as the Supreme Court pointed out, the threat to a woman's life need not be immediate.  A pregnancy may be terminated if doctors form the view that even after recovering from childbirth other treatment for whatever she was suffering from during the pregnancy would be ineffective to save her life.  Overall, the most important reassurance for women comes from the essential meaning of the whole amendment: &ldquo;all <Col N="39" /> treatments necessary to save her life will be allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and her entitlement to have her right to life vindicated will be safeguarded.&rdquo;  Let me state my personal belief without equivocation. The Government have shown courage and a commitment to women in this wording.  Courage?  Any wording which provokes the extremes of an argument into such vehement antipathy requires courage.  There are safer options but we did not take them.  Commitment of women?  Of course, because we are being realistic about the threats to a woman's health.</P>
      <P>Let nobody tell me that a life threatening illness, associated with pregnancy or exacerbated by pregnancy, can never happen.  It can happen, does happen and will happen, and when it happens there is an absolute imperative that a doctor has the right to take action involving termination of the pregnancy to save the woman's life.  A substantial minority of our doctors see it that way.  They believe that there are rare cases where, to save a woman's life, termination of pregnancy is medically indicated.</P>
      <P>Knowing that there are doctors who have seen such rare cases, how could the Government pretend that they do not exist?  How could the Government fail to acknowledge the right to protection of this group of women &mdash; this small group of women?  We could not fail to acknowledge the right to life of those women.</P>
      <P>Because we are pro-life in the full meaning of that often abused term, we are pro the life of the unborn and of the mother, and we are, in good conscience and with good intent, seeking to amend our Constitution to express both concerns in a realistic and humane way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to be pro-life if you limit your concerns to the life of the unborn. It is also very simplistic and very, very dangerous for women.  We must be pro-life in the fullest sense and that is what this wording expresses.  Someone once <Col N="40" /> said that there is an answer to every question that is simple, straightforward and wrong.  Legislation, as an answer to the abortion question, is simple, straightforward and wrong.</P>

      <P>Any legislation introduced without an amendment of the Constitution would have to accept in full the findings of the Supreme Court in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, not to mention the very real threat that, were legislation to be proposed, the kind of posturing we witnessed here yesterday would be exacerbated not alone inside but outside the House.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to have members of the Opposition warily predicting a divisive and destructive debate on this issue when, at exactly the same time, those members of the Opposition are using precisely the wording most calculated to create that divisive and destructive debate.  Yesterday, in this House, members of the Opposition chose to use words like &ldquo;cruelty&rdquo;, &ldquo;brutal and divisive&rdquo;, &ldquo;cowardice&rdquo;, &ldquo;misogynistic&rdquo; and &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Who are the Opposition kidding with their sanctimonious predictions that the plain people, left to themselves, will have a graceless and distasteful debate?  What could be more graceless and distasteful than the contributions of yesterday, with their intention of raising fears and anger and their deliberate misinterpretations of the implications of the wording?  The real truth is that the people can be trusted to conduct their affairs, to debate this issue and to have the final say on this issue. They can be better trusted than some members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I was quite astonished to hear the Leader of the Opposition say yesterday that this was dumping the issue on the Irish people.  I find that to be a strange view of the ultimate step in the democratic process.</P>

      <P>If the people decide not to adopt the Twelfth Amendment, then legislation will be introduced by the Government to regulate the position obtaining as a result of the X decision.  That is not a threat; it is an inevitability.  If the position obtaining after the X case is not addressed by way of amendment to the constitution, it has to be dealt with by legislation, and there are no alternatives.</P>
      <P>The Government are proposing a form of amendment that protects women and protects the unborn.  We hope, we trust, we expect that the constitutional amendment will pass, but, to cover the eventuality that it might not pass, we must indicate precisely what our legislative proposals would be to cover that eventuality. That is proper; it is necessary; it is open, and only speakers with a deadly poverty of ideas would portray it as a threat to anybody.</P>

Maidir leis an cheist ar a dtugtar an phríomhcheist, níl aon athrú ar alt 40.3.3º de Bhunreacht na hÉireann.  Ní mhaolóidh na leasuithe atá á moladh anois ag an Rialtas an chosaint bhunreachtúil atá ar fáil don bheo gan bhreith.  An fhoclaíocht atá i gceist anseo ag an Rialtas, léifidh mé arís é:</P>
      <P>Beidh sé aindleathach beatha gan bhreith a fhoirceannadh mura rud é gur gá an foirceannadh sin chun beatha, ar leith ó shláinte, na máthar a shábháil i gcás breoiteacht nó neamhord a bheith ar an máthair is cúis le baol réadach, substaintiúil dá beatha nach baol féindíothaithe é.</P>
      <P>Tá athrú i gceist sa mhéid is go bhfuil an Rialtas anois ag léiriú a n-imní faoi chás na mban agus ag cur cothromaíochta san áireamh freisin.  Tugann an leasú bunreachtúil seo, mar a dúirt mé leis an Teachta Ó Higgins ar an teilifís aréir, cosaint agus ceartas.  Tá cosaint ann do bheatha na mban agus tá ceartas acu maidir le cóir iomlán leighis sa chás gur léir go bhfuil a mbeatha i mbaol.  Tá sé léirithe cheana féin ag an Taoiseach istigh sa Teach seo agus taobh amuigh de go bhfuil sé in aghaidh an ghinmhillte, agus tá an Rialtas in aghaidh an ghinmhillte, agus ní mhaolaíonn ná ní laghdaíonn an fhoclaíocht atá molta anseo sa Bhille ar aon bhealach an chosaint a thugann an Bunreacht don bheo gan bhreith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Is é atá i gceist anseo againn ná a admháil go gcaithfimid, sa Bhunreacht, cothromaíocht a shocrú idir ceart na máthar chun beatha agus ceart an bheo gan bhreith chun na beatha freisin.  Is é atáimid ag cur os comhair an phobail ná, nuair atá baol substaintiúil ann do bheatha na máthar mar gheall ar easláinte, gur ceadmhach do dhochtúirí deireadh a chur leis an toircheas.  Is éard atá an Rialtas dáiríre ag iarraidh ar an bpobal anois ná an t-alt bunreachtúil, a chosaíonn ceart beatha na máthar agus an beo gan bhreith a fhágáil mar atá siad, ach ráiteas eile a chur leo ag rá, má bhíonn baol tromchúiseach ann do bheatha na máthar mar gheall ar easláinte, mar a dúirt mé cúpla nóiméad ó shin, go dtabharfar cosaint dá beatha, fiú má chailltear an ghin dá bharr sin.  Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná go mbeadh mar aidhm nó mar sprioc leis an gcóir leighis i gcónaí, beatha na máthar a chosaint, agus sa chomthéacs ina bhfuil baol substaintiúil dá beatha, go gceadófaí é.</P>
    <P>Tá roinnt cásanna &mdash; ní cuimhneach liom anois ar luaigh an tAire Dlí agus Cirt iad, sílim go mb'fhéidir gur luaigh, ach is fiú iad a lua arís &mdash; mar shampla, rith fola: uaireanta, sa chás sin, ní féidir beatha na máthar a shábháil gan deireadh a chur leis an toircheas; galar croí; bíonn cásanna ann ina gcaillfí bean thorrach a raibh drochghalar croí uirthi agus gurbh é an t-aon bhealach lena beatha a shábháil ná deireadh a chur leis an toircheas; ailse bhroinne: más gá an bhroinn a bhaint as bean cuirtear deireadh leis an toircheas dá bharr sin; drochailse chíche, i gcás go mbeadh címeteiripe, nó obráid nó raidtheiripe i gceist, d'fhéadfadh an comhairleoir leighis a mheas nach bhfuil aon rogha ann ach deireadh a chur leis an toircheas mar nach bhféadfaí an chóir leighis a sholáthar ar aon bhealach eile nó go mbeadh sé ró mhall fanacht nó go saolófaí an leanbh.  Cásanna ar leith iad seo, agus nuair a bhí mé ag caint i mBéarla ar ball beag dúirt mé é sin, ach ní chreidim gur cheart dúinn iad a fhágáil gan déileáil leo díreach mar nach dtarlaíonn siad do chuile bhean, agus aontaíonn na dochtúirí ar fad atá á lua sna nuachtáin go dtarlaíonn siad, gur féidir <Col N="45" /> leo tarlú agus go dtarlóidh siad sa todhchaí.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall air sin, creidimse go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach go mbreathnódh an Rialtas air sin, go nglacfadh siad sin ina gcloigne agus iad ag cur leasú den sórt seo faoi réir agus go mbeadh sé clúdaithe in aon leasú a chuirfí ós comhair an phobail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not make any apologies for bringing a touch of anger and emotion to this debate.  I am deeply angered by the statements of the Minister for Justice in the House yesterday who, once again &mdash; similar to actions taken by him and his colleagues in 1983 &mdash; is trying to pigeonhole people in this very controversial debate.  Who are the extremists with the extreme views to whom he referred in his speech yesterday?  Is he referring once again to concerned women who have expressed their horror and offence at certain terminology in the wording of the Twelfth Amendment? How dare this male Minister attempt to categorise women &mdash; or indeed anybody &mdash; who suggests that the wording is inaccurate and can, therefore, be pigeonholed into one extreme view?  Do we not have the history of 1983 to assist us in our assessment that Fianna Fáil got the wording wrong?  Why should we trust them again in 1992?</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the editorial in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 9 October last because it is salutary to remind ourselves of how we come to be discussing this matter again today.  The article states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not reassuring to note that those who are most adamant that this or that text be adopted so as to solve the problem were among the most vociferous who argued a decade ago that the wording of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution would effectively rule out abortion in Ireland forever.  Then along came Miss X and the Supreme Court ruling.  That ruling, if it did anything, significantly dented the case of those who argue that there is a group of words which, if found, can copperfasten this or that view on abortion. <Col N="46" /> Whatever the final text or the forthcoming referendum, it seems perfectly safe to predict that it will not do what its protagonists insist it will do and we will be back wrangling over the issue.</P>
    <P>In the last two days four Government Ministers have made speeches.  Consistently, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Women's Affairs and the Minister for Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, have assured us that, in absolute terms, they have got it right this time.  I should like to remind Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn of what she said in 1983.  I will also remind her of what Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Woods and others said.  In the Official Report, column 494 of 17 February 1983, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said:</P>
    <P>People ask why there is a necessity for an amendment to the Constitution. As it now stands the Constitution does not contain any specific protection for human life before birth and only by such an amendment can we be certain that the existing ban on abortion will not be removed as a result of action in the courts....  However, a change in the law could come through the courts without the people or their elected representatives being consulted in any way.  Abortion could become legal as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court.  As we know, sometimes to our cost, there need not be a unanimous decision of the court.  Three out of five judges would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>At that time Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made the argument that the 1983 amendment would ensure that no court action would ever allow abortion.  How wrong she was.  On the same date, column 469, Deputy O'Hanlon said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe the wording we put forward is correct and nothing that has been said has convinced us that we should alter that view.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 470 he exhorted the Taoiseach to gather his courage, honour his commitment, hold the referendum <Col N="47" /> on the wording presented and give the people an opportunity, in the most democratic way, to enshrine protection for the unborn child in our Constitution. How hollow those words now sound.  On 9 February Deputy Woods, the then Minister for Health, said that the thorough consultations that took place before the wording was finalised made it a model for constitutional change for the future.  What a model.  Deputy Woods gave the impression at the time that there had been such widespread consultation there was no danger the wording would do what Fine Gael warned against.  On 27 April &mdash; column 2219 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Justice Deputy Noonan, said:</P>
    <P>There is nothing available to me, in the documentation that came from the Department of Health, to show that any analysis of the wording proposed was done.  I wonder was an analysis done in the Department of Health.  If there was, why is it not on file there? If it is not on file there why is Deputy Woods not able to inform us of that analysis here in the House today?</P>
    <P>It is important to remind ourselves, by quoting those excerpts from 1983, how certain Fianna Fáil were at that time that what they were doing was right.  It has been proved that there are no absolutes in this case.  Let us not have the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, drawing himself up to his full height of six foot four inches and telling us that he now has it right, that he can now play God and present the country with a set of wordings which will not have any side effects.</P>
    <P>It is clear that 92 per cent of the membership of this House, particularly the Minister for Justice, will never have to face the trauma of an ectopic pregnancy; they will never have to face a decision, with their doctor, as to whether their uteri should be removed because of cancer, which means facing the loss of one's womanhood and the growing baby inside.  The Minister will never have to face a decision, with his doctor, in that regard or lie on a bed dangerously ill <Col N="48" /> while two doctors argue whether the treatment needed is to save his health or his life.</P>
    <P>There is more confusion and obfuscation on the part of the Government. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in her speech said: &ldquo;Putting it more bluntly, pregnant women will not be denied medical or surgical treatment necessary&rdquo;&mdash; one would expect the next words to be &ldquo;save their lives&rdquo;&mdash; but she says &ldquo;necessary to protect their health&rdquo;.  I thought the whole point of Minister Flynn's speech yesterday was that they were not writing into our Constitution anything that was only being done to protect women's health. However, we now have the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, trying to confuse the issue by pretending to women that that protection for their health is included in the wording before the House.  Again, we have more obfuscation on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>An examination of the wording in the Bill published today on the three ballot papers shows that the wording at the top of the white ballot paper will read, &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo;.  That is a gross distortion, a travesty, and a manipulation of the public by the Fianna Fáil element of the Government &mdash; I assume they wrote those words.  Of course the substantive wording has an element of right to life and an element of saving life in it but use of the terminology &ldquo;right to life&rdquo; is clearly a Government effort to pretend to the people whom they know are criticising them that the amendment does not allow for direct termination if a woman's life is at risk.  What is it about Fianna Fáil spokespeople that they find their throats seizing up, that they are not able to answer a simple question when put to them.  Does this Amendment allow a doctor to terminate a pregnancy if a woman's life is at risk?  We never get a straight answer to that question because for some reason Fianna Fáil Members cannot say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the amendment allowing termination in such circumstances. The Government are afraid that if they answer yes to that question they will not then be able to argue the <Col N="49" /> correctness of allowing a mother's life to be saved by terminating her pregnancy. That is another way in which the Government are trying to fool the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the process adopted in the past ten days.  I have something to say to the Taoiseach on this.  He offered the Opposition leaders a very short time to examine wording which had taken six months to prepare.  It is said that despite the fact that a subcommittee had been set up little or no work was done for many of those months.  The effect of the words produced gives truth to the rumour that there was a rush in the end to produce a wording.</P>
    <P>There was a thread of consensus running through the submissions presented to the Taoiseach by the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats.  That thread of consensus was based on the deletion of the phrase, &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;. The Taoiseach made an offer of openness; he said that his door was open so that consensus between party leaders might be reached.  Why did the Taoiseach not at the very least take up that thread of consensus and delete those words?  It strikes me that the Taoiseach refused to listen not only to the people he had invited into his office but also to the many interest groups, particularly women's groups, that had been voicing such concern and had found the words proposed to be insulting and offensive.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Taoiseach that the lives of Irish women are not for sale, abuse or use by him and his unscrupulous party.  The cavalier way that the Government decided to treat Irish girls and women is objectionable.  The Government seem to have taken the attitude that our women should kneel down and thank the Taoiseach very much for all he has done for Irish women, that women should be very grateful and should allow the Government to make life and death decisions on their behalf.  That theme has run through speeches by Government Members.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, spent most of his time outlining <Col N="50" /> what the Government has done for women &mdash; almost as if to say, &ldquo;Are you not very glad that we have done all of this for you and, why are you now complaining about this issue?&rdquo;.  There is an attitude creeping into the debate that women should be grateful for what the Government has done for them and that if the Government could do anything else women would be very grateful.</P>
    <P>Irish women are part and parcel of our society; they represent more than 50 per cent of the population, and they do not have to feel guilty or selfish in insisting on their right to full medical treatment if their lives are at risk or if there is some danger to them and their future health and life during a pregnancy.  The Government asks us to pat them on the back because they are doing an &ldquo;OK job&rdquo;.  The Government are not doing &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anyone who has analysed the past ten days in Irish politics that the Taoiseach's invitation to the Opposition party leaders was no more than a cynical exercise in pretence.  That is evidenced by the unrealistic deadlines set&mdash;48 hours at first and then a few more days after that. It is clear that the Taoiseach was hellbent on proceeding along his own path; all the evidence is there to support that. Now the Minister for Justice, and the Taoiseach, have compounded their lack of respect for the Irish people by announcing in a threatening way &mdash; and it does not matter how much they try to sanitise the manner in which the anouncement was made, it was made in a threatening way &mdash; that legislation is being prepared to implement the X case judgment and that such legislation will be published during the campaign.</P>
    <P>That announcement begs the question: if it will be possible to produce legislation during the campaign why is it not possible for the Taoiseach to accede to the request of Fine Gael that he produce legislation on the current wording before it is put to the House and the people?  If it is possible, as the Taoiseach seemed to imply, to produce legislation on the X case &mdash; a line of action the Taoiseach seemed to favour six months ago &mdash; without bringing in abortion on demand, and I am <Col N="51" /> perfectly willing to accept that the Taoiseach does not want to do that &mdash; why did he not take that action on the substantive issue rather than make provision for a referendum?  If it was possible to use the production of legislation as a type of threat before we vote on 3 December, why was the Taoiseach not able to present to the Opposition parties and the people a formula that tightened up on the X case judgment, if that is what he wanted to do, and then use that to phrase a constitutional wording that could be put to the people?  That issue begs the question about the Taoiseach's bona fides in asking the Opposition parties to talk to him.</P>
    <P>All are agreed that the travel and information elements of the X case have to be handled by way of constitutional referenda but the Taoiseach, in announcing the legislation he intends to publish during the campaign, has thrown doubt on whether the referendum on the substantive issue is needed.  I wish to say to the Taoiseach &mdash; I hope he is listening to this debate because it is important he hears what is being said &mdash; that this is not some kind of childish game we are engaged in.  We are not dealing with a group of children who can be warned that the bogey man will take them away if they do not eat their vegetables.  We are dealing with a serious life and death issue, and to use the big stick of threatening legislation is nothing but a deeply offensive and cynical exercise that will cause further confusion.</P>
    <P>I now wish to make a very serious allegation.  The Taoiseach, by his unwillingness to accept and give consideration to realistic suggestions made by Fine Gael &mdash; and, indeed, other Opposition parties &mdash; to produce legislation before the vote on 3 December to clarify what we are voting for, runs the risk of subverting the Irish people's well-known call that there be no abortion on demand because another Supreme Court decision could have that effect.  Is the Taoiseach willing to run that risk?  It seems he is.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the people who demanded, in good faith &mdash; I am not <Col N="52" /> about to recognise their good faith now &mdash; a referendum in 1983 are the self-same people who have to take the blame for what happened in the X case.  They opened up the possibility of putting into our Constitution an amendment that clearly will not cover all contingencies. They did not listen in 1983.  It took a great deal of courage on the part of Deputy Garret FitzGerald &mdash; anybody who listened to the Deputy in the debate last night would have heard him admit this &mdash; to admit that he rushed into accepting the 1982 wording from Fianna Fáil but as soon as he recognised the dangers in it he pulled back.  It took a lot of courage to do that.  I can guarantee that Fianna Fáil would not have that courage but why can they not learn from such courage?  It is important to put again on the record of the House what Deputy Shatter said on 17 February 1983, column 533 of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
    <P>The irony is that I have no doubt, not merely from the interpretation the Attorney General has given but from the other interpretations that can be validly taken from the amendment, that if it in its present form becomes part of our Constitution it will essentially secure a constitutional judgment in the not too distant future requiring the House to enact legislation to permit women to have abortions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon commented on 17 February 1983 column No. 466 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>From my own experience as a medical practitioner, from what I have read in literature and from what I know from my colleagues.  I do not believe it is necessary to introduce abortion for the medical cases which are quoted by those who are against the amendment because they want abortion legalised.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O'Hanlon referred to in that extract are the very things that the Government are now saying, at least we hope they are saying it &mdash; that women will be allowed to have a termination if <Col N="53" /> their lives are threatened by those medical conditions.  It was Deputy O'Hanlon, a medical doctor, who said he did not believe it was necessary to introduce abortion.  He is now a member of a Government party that is doing precisely that, again, it highlights the weakness of the arguments in 1983.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer further to what Deputy Shatter said.  At that time I suppose Deputy Shatter was the nearest we had got to a prophet because it was as if he was able to foresee what happened in 1992.  He stated column 580 of the Official Report of 17 February 1983:</P>
    <P>If the intention of the article is to protect the equal right to life of the mother, one must ask what that means. Does it mean that if a mother's life is seriously endangered by a pregnancy, we would allow the pregnancy to go through a full term and possibly keep the mother alive on a life support machine; or does it mean something more than just preserving a physical existence?  Has the quality of life some relevance to this argument?  If it does, if included in the Constitution, would this Article permit abortions to take place where not only a woman's physical health but her mental health was endangered?</P>
    <P>Shades of the X case.</P>
    <P>Could it not equally be argued that the right of the mother to life requires a right to a proper and viable life in mental good health?  Is that not valid argument?  If that were the final judicial interpretation of this amendment, then this amendment would permit abortions to be carried out where a mother's mental health was said by psychiatrists to be endangered as a result of her becoming pregnant. I do not believe that that is an intent on the part of the drafters of this Article.  The interpretations to which the Attorney General has referred, the worries which the Minister has expressed and the additional possible interpretations of this Article in the area of abortion which I have given all <Col N="54" /> have validity.  There is not a Member of this House who can categorically state that if this matter were dealt with before our courts this year, next year, or in 20 years time, one of these interpretations to permit, and indeed constitutionally require, abortion would not be accepted.  It is not something that could be constitutionally required under the existing Constitution, without this Article.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter foresaw precisely what was going to happen sometime in the future &mdash; the future happens to be 1992. Almost word for word Deputy Shatter's comments at that time have come to pass. I want those words to remain in the minds of Fianna Fáil so that they can recognise that standing up here and being absolutist about anything is not the case to make on this issue.</P>
    <P>May I have an indication of the time remaining at my disposal?</P>

      <P>I should like to deal very quickly with the phrase that has caused such anger and anguish as distinct from the health issue.  The speech of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, is littered with inconsistencies and <i>non sequiturs.</i> He tries to make the argument &mdash; and again he thinks he is taking the middle ground &mdash; to those who say that the words &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo; should be omitted, that somehow by removing those words, open abortion would be allowed totally on health grounds.  I do not know how he can say that.  It is clear from reading the amendment, with the exception of those words, that only in the case of substantial risk to the mother's life would termination be available.  I should like to quote from the speech of the Minister for Justice as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The suggestion that the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; should be omitted from the proposed amendment really boils down to this &mdash; that it should be possible to terminate the life of an unborn child where there is no risk to the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>I still have not managed, even after a night's sleep, to understand how he arrived at that interpretation.  It is clear from the discussions I and other Fine Gael colleagues have had with both the medical and the legal professions that those words, at the very least, are superfluous and supernumerary and are unnecessary in this amendment.  No matter what any Minister may say I believe these words were put in as a sop, as a way of saying to people that the decisions doctors will make will be made only on the issue of life.  Doctors will say that is what they are making their decisions on, that they are making their decisions on the span of a woman's life, that they do not stand over her bed saying &mdash; though they may have to do so if this legislation is passed &mdash;&ldquo;this woman has breast cancer, she has undergone a mastectomy&rdquo;, while another doctor might say: &ldquo;she must have chemotherapy but there is a risk to the baby&rdquo;, and yet another doctor might say: &ldquo;we have saved her life by performing the operation and she does not need the chemotherapy until after the baby is safely born&rdquo;.  But within two or three years' time, the woman may get the cancer back again, and die.  The problem is that maternal statistics cease a short time after the baby is born and therefore, will not indicate if, three or five years down the road, the mother may be dead because of not having been given the treatment, during her pregnancy, that could have saved her life.  These are the real issues at stake in this debate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to the information issue as referred to by the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Connell, last night.  In his contribution he began to give us some idea as to what would be involved in the matter of information but that is as far as he went.  We are still in <Col N="56" /> the dark.  His words appear to differ from those of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn.  We need to know who will provide the advice and what resources will be made available.  We have only to look at the Rape Crisis Centre to see how little money the Government give them and how they have to fight for it each year. What arrangements will be made for pregnant suicidal girls who need urgent and immediate attention?  A number of issues are still unclear in regard to the legislation and the sooner the Minister puts it before the House the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the men who do.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Higgins, will agree with me that the reason we are having a debate on this overwhelming and oppressive kind of constitutional amendment, is because we do not have a fair representation as between men and women Members. Before focusing on the legislation before us I should like to put a few matters in context, one of which is the history of abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask again a question to which no satisfactory answer has yet been given. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, has assured us that a referendum on divorce will receive adequate discussion and debate.  Despite the fact that legislation was put in place after the referendum on divorce, that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown produced a very full report and that there are models in other countries which have worked, we have been assured by the Minister for Justice that he could not, in conscience, put a referendum on divorce to the people until all the legislation is in place, even if that took two years, which I am sure it will.  Am I to take it that it is <Col N="57" /> not seen fit in the case of this referendum, which will have a fundamental effect on the life and health of women and which arises as a result of the earlier botched referendum to put all the legislation in place before it is put to the people?  What does this say about the attitude of the Minister and the Government to women? They believe that this issue can be rushed through.</P>
    <P>I am sure my colleagues will agree with me that the ironical offer made by our caring and family-centred Taoiseach this morning, when we protested yet again at the lack of time being made available for this debate, that we could sit on Saturday and Sunday, showed a lack of insight and sensitivity to women and men and the protection of life and family values, which the debate is all about.  Politicians and everyone who is privileged to be in employment look forward to spending Saturday and Sunday with their families. It is a matter of regret to my colleagues and to me that the reform of this Dáil is so slow that this House sits the most anti-family hours ever.  We were told we could sit on Saturday and Sunday, the time we spend with our families, to discuss this important family-centred issue.  The Taoiseach should be indicted for making that derisory offer.  It is an indication of the insight he has into family values and the kind of support needed for women in the home.</P>
    <P>At least during this debate we are able to say the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; out loud.  If we mentioned the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; during the 1983 debate &mdash; I am sure my colleagues will remember this &mdash; we were threatened physically and immediately labelled as abortionists.</P>
    <P>The debate on the complex issue of abortion in Ireland did not start yesterday. The history of abortion and the attempts to deal with it prove the complexity of this area and highlight the desperation experienced by women about the way they have been treated in regard to this issue.  All civilisations and cultures record that women, driven to distraction, have sought abortions or have attempted abortions on themselves, very often with horrifying results.  Indeed great numbers <Col N="58" /> of women have died both from childbirth and attempted abortions.  Either way, this has been a high risk and painful process for countless generations of women. Even though it was risky, dangerous and life-threatening, women still had babies. The greatest insult to women is that in some way men have to control our murderous intent towards our unborn.</P>
    <P>The legalising of abortion in restricted circumstances has led to a dramatic decrease in the number of women who have died or suffered as a result of this process.  The present debate is not a conspiracy by fanatical feminists, the World Health Organisation and the International Family Planning Association. Indeed in some countries where contraception and family planning clinics are not allowed there are still horrifying stories about very young women who, because of tribal or community pressure, are mutilated or who mutilate themselves in attempting to get rid of unwanted pregnancies. Some of these young women die and many of those who live are rendered infertile, suffer life-time health problems and have to endure social stigma.  I do not think the background to this issue has been taken into consideration by the Government, who have decided blithely to remove the sentence which referred to self-destruction.  This shows how little they know about the desperation felt by some women.</P>
    <P>Despite the complexity of this issue, the lack of support services for women, the fact that women have the main responsibility for child rearing and the painful experience of the 1983 referendum and its outcome, the Government still insists on repeating the same mistakes and proposing amendments which will end up in both Irish and European courts.  There is not much we can be sure of during this debate but we can be sure of that.</P>
    <P>Intrusion into the professional relationship between doctors and their women patients will be but one of the effects of this ill-sponsored and rushed referendum.  It is shameful that the referenda on the right to travel and the right to information have to be put to the electorate <Col N="59" /> in order to restore to citizens two of their most basic freedoms.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, had the audacity to refer to Albania.  He should look nearer home first.</P>
    <P>Not alone are women very much in the minority in the Oireachtas but the overriding voices of professional and anti-abortion campaigners have attempted to drown out the voices of women and men outside this House.  I believe the Irish electorate have grown and matured since the deadly divisive debate of 1983 and will speak out on behalf of women and the groups they represent.  I encourage them to stand up and fight for women's right to life.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, referred to such groups.  I wish to tell them, and Members on the other side of the House, that criticising this wording is not extreme and is not about advocating abortion on demand.  Rather we do not want to add insult to the injury already heaped upon women.</P>
    <P>The wording on the substantive issue will not ensure women their integrity. During this debate and the 1983 debate &mdash; this is one of the abiding memories of women &mdash; women have been disembodied, divided and dehumanised.  As has been said by Deputy Shatter and others on this side of the House, if it was attempted constitutionally and legislatively to distinguish between the life and health of men there would be an outcry; they would have justifiable grounds for rejecting such an attempt. However, because this issue relates to women this charade and farce can take place.</P>
    <P>It is significant that other moral areas affecting life and death can be given flexibility and justification by men.  For example, self-defence, the death penalty and, above all, just wars, are not only justified but at times eulogised.  What about the loss of life in such cases?  Yet, in the 1983 debate, and again in this one, the underlying thrust of the legislation <Col N="60" /> and the debates surrounding it is that women cannot be trusted.  An environment is created which would lead people to believe that women would seek abortions frivolously and thoughtlessly &mdash; unless male legislators and Constitutions control women, they would queue up to abort their babies.</P>
    <P>The X case, which began the second stage of this tragic run of referenda, has been pushed aside and covered up.  The position of a 14-year old girl being made pregnant in circumstances which led her to see suicide as the only alternative is now not even up for debate.  In fact, the Supreme Court judgment arising from these tragic circumstances, which recognised the real and substantial risk to her life by her suicidal state of mind, is now to be ruled out, is to be denied acceptance if such tragic circumstances are repeated. The X case is not an isolated and solitary one.  The rising figures of reported rapes and cases of incest clearly illustrate that other young girls and women will be violated and expected to carry not just the trauma of that desperate experience, but a pregnancy that may ensue from a terrible act inflicted on them through violence and hatred instead of the loving intimate experience it should be.  In the face of all this Government speaker after speaker stood up during this debate and have had the insensitivity and callousness to call this wording &ldquo;pro-woman&rdquo; and to accuse women who put their head above the parapet to protest as extremists and lobbyists for abortion on demand.  I am amazed at some of the coverage which was given to yesterday's debate which portrayed the speches from the other side of the House as being clever or compassionate. That shows the chasm which exists outside this House with regard to the integrity of women.  Women have to sit inside and outside this House and hear their biological and physical bodies taken apart, as rules are drawn up and decisions made about the uterus, ectopic pregnancies and breast cancer.  I wonder how men would feel if they were taken apart in this way, if legal and professional decisions about their intimate parts and <Col N="61" /> health were made public and devalued in this way.</P>
    <P>This debate is taking place in a vacuum with regard to the real lives and experiences of women.  It is taken in isolation from the reasons and desperation that force women to seek abortion.  If we really care about the moral dilemma of abortion and the concerted action of all of us to reduce circumstances in which abortion takes place at all levels, there should be a platform of support, services and caring to allow that to happen. Indeed, the Minister for Justice, and other Ministers, should ensure that that is in place before we go to the country with referenda.</P>
    <P>In countries such as the Netherlands where there is a mature, honest, open sex education programme highlighting the responsibility of valuing women's and men's sexuality, teaching young people the long term implications of unplanned pregnancies, there is a low level of abortion. The people of that country are informed and trusted, which is something that the politicians opposite consider unacceptable here.  What support services do we have here?  In a survey published this week by the US Population Crisis Centre in Washington, Ireland ranks last among the world's 29 developed countries with access to birth control.  The Republic of Ireland scored 40 out of a possible 100 points awarded on a range of birth control options &mdash; even Romania and Poland preceded Ireland with a score of 51 points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern was expressed that many women are being denied access to a full range of family planning options with serious consequences for their physical health and well-being.  I join Deputy Owens in asking the Minister for Health to return to this Chamber and give us open information and funding for <Col N="62" /> support services which will be necessary if we are to take a moral high stand and exclude women from the right to make decisions about their own bodies.</P>
      <P>Do we support lone parents or unmarried mothers with regard to housing and adequate allowances for themselves and their children?  Where is the recognition and the financial reward for a family who take in the child of one of their children? Lone parents &mdash; usually women &mdash; are denied access to adult education, to training and the VTOS scheme, and we value life, the unborn and woman who, through all those incredible disadvantages and difficulties, bring babies into this world.</P>
      <P>Finally, why do we trust our women so little?  Why do we trust the moral fibre of our society so little?  When will individual members in our society be allowed to judge for themselves, to refer to their own consciences and have open access to information and counselling to allow them to do that?  During this debate there must be some acknowledgement of the sacrifices, unstinting generosity, life-long commitment and input of women to their families and children, particularly the mothering role of Irish women which has even ended up as a joke about the &ldquo;Irish mammy&rdquo;.  The Government should heed our views and those of people both inside and outside this House and have somne conscience about putting a confused and dangerous wording to the people again.  Not alone is it undemocratic, it is an an offence against women.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago, at the outset of the current phase of the debate on how to deal with the complex, emotive and deeply divisive matter of the correct balance to be struck between the rights of pregnant women and the unborn, I <Col N="63" /> made a plea that the issue be pursued on a political consensus basis.  Furthermore, I made clear my own preference, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that the fundamental issues arising in relation to this matter be dealt with by legislation rather than by a further constitutional amendment.  I did this because of the sheer complexities of the issues involved, and also because I believe that most people do not want to have to make such a sensitive and complicated decision in this way.  Finally, I made this appeal in the context of the deep national, social and economic problems facing the country. Most notably, there is the underlying unemployment crisis; the exacerbation of this problem by the sudden international monetary crisis and the devaluation of sterling; the attendant pressure on family budgets arising in particular from the serious jump in mortgage interest rates and, last, but not least, the delicate situation reached in the Northern Ireland talks against a background of continuing violence.</P>
      <P>Without minimising in any way the importance of the issues that arise when considering abortion, I sincerely believe that the great majority of the Irish people want to see their politicians and their Government get on with tackling, unimpeded, those problems I have just listed.</P>
      <P>Members of the Oireachtas should not be afraid to legislate in a difficult area like abortion, because it is simply impossible to reduce the matter in all its complexities down to a single black or white proposition to put to the people for inclusion in the Constitution on a yes or no basis.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret, therefore, that it has not been possible to maintain the politicial consensus which did exist at the time of the Maastricht referendum and which extended to the less contentious aspects of the matters now before this House.  Namely, the need to restore by way of referendum an unequivocal right to travel and the right also to obtain here in Ireland non-directive and supportive counselling and information concerning services that are legal in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Turning to the so-called substantive issue, I have to say that it is anything but black and white.  One has only to take into acount the exchanges already arising in the current debate, and the evidence of many medical practitioners, to realise that various medical problems can arise &mdash; and do arise &mdash; for a small minority of pregnant women which are not only deeply upsetting and traumatic in their own right, because of the threats they pose to the health and lives of the women concerned, but also because of the heartrending implications they can have for the unborn child which those women are carrying.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that in these exceptional cases, which can derive from various medical conditions associated with cancer, blood diseases or heart problems, or which could be of the outcome of a serious accident, the decision facing such pregnant women and the implications for their unborn, are matters which should be resolved by the unfortunate women affected, with their immediate and closest family members, and their medical consultants.</P>
    <P>The traumatic personal decisions and choices when they have to make, should not be made in the context of any country's constitution.  I believe too that medical experts have a daunting task in deciding in all conscience and good faith what is the best course of action to take when they are directed principally by a general constitutional statement that is hard to interpret in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is why I have urged that these are matters best dealt with by legislation.  It is simply impossible to reduce the complexities of the matters before us to a single black and white proposition to be enshrined as a basic principle of constitutional law in this State.  On the contrary, we hear, day after day, further cogent argument and examples which demonstrate clearly that this issue should be tackled by way of legislation, thereby allowing some degree of guidance and compassion which cannot be achieved in a single constitutional statement.</P>
    <P>There is much in the debate of the last <Col N="65" /> few weeks which is deeply offensive and insulting not only to women who have faced, or might face, traumatic choices relating to their life and health when pregnant, but which has also been very offensive and unfeeling to women in general. In this context I was touched by the comments last week of the chairperson of the Council for the Status of Women, Ms Frances Fitzgerald, when she said that women were angry listening to lingustic contortions on the question of abortion in a debate that frequently did not respect women's own judgment.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, this nation displayed a very real sense of compassion and concern when the High Court granted an injunction to the Attorney General preventing a 14 year old girl, who had been raped and was pregnant, travelling to England to have her pregnancy terminated. That concern stemmed in part from the unacceptable consequences of the 1983 constitutional amendment, which resulted in a legal intrusion into the private and painful trauma of the child and her family in those most awful of circumstances.  The High Court decision was based on an interpretation quite different from the solemn assurances given us in 1983 by the proponents of the Eighth Amendment.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in this instance managed to extricate us as a people from this dreadful situation by deciding that the danger of suicide by this girl was such as to pose a real and substantial threat to her life and, because of this, the court decided to lift the injunction against her. It is of particular relevance that while the Attorney General took the action the State funded the appeal to the Supreme Court by the girl.  This surely demonstrates the very difficult position that arises when exceptional cases happen which do not fit a particular formulation contained in the Constitution.  We should ask ourselves whether our real concern and our subsequent relief about this girl was related to whether she would commit suicide, or was it an acknowledgment that we as a society were uncomfortable with forcing this girl to <Col N="66" /> go through a full-term pregnancy in the particular circumstances of that case, especially given the fact that she was only 14 and her plight stemmed from being raped?</P>
    <P>Clearly, while the vast majority of the Irish people strongly believe that abortion should be illegal, they were willing to entertain an exception in the X case. This was, of course, especially true when it was due to happen in England. However, other types of cases have also been highlighted in the current debate where the mother's health or life can be severely threatened, and where medical intervention necessitates either a direct or indirect termination.  Each such case tears at our conscience and forces us into examining the issue in a manner which is no longer black and white, but obliges us to consider the overall balance of rights in each such case.</P>
    <P>In the 1983 40.3.3º Amendment the people were attempting to strike a balance between the rights of the mother and the unborn.  This balance in turn has to be considered in conjunction with Articles 40.3.1º and 40.3.2º which impose an obligation on the State to vindicate the life and personal rights of its citizens, including, of course, pregnant women.</P>
    <P>In the X case the Supreme Court adjudicated on this balance of rights. They decided that where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, she had a right to have an abortion.  They did not confer the right to an abortion on any other basis.  They did not grant the right to an abortion in cases of rape or incest.  They did not grant the right to an abortion where the mother was a minor.  They restricted the right to an abortion to cases where, on the evidence, there was a real and substantial risk to her life.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of lessons to be learned from the X case.  One is that the only interpretation of words in the Constitution that counts is the view formed by the Supreme Court.  Ministers, Deputies, doctors, clerics and lawyers can in all good faith give their view of what certain words mean, but their interpretation <Col N="67" /> has no standing whatever. Words can be interpreted in an unexpected way.  If they are, if a mistake is made it can be conveniently corrected if it is in legislation.  It is extremely difficult to correct if it is in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the most fundamental lesson to be learned from the X case is that hard case exceptions do occur. Surely this should cause us to pause and ponder the wisdom of our actions in trying to reduce the whole complex question of the balance of rights between a pregnant woman and her unborn to a single constitutional statement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, of course, if we examine the proposed wording in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution, it is clear that some form of limited abortion is still envisaged.  Stating that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of the unborn, unless certain conditions exist, implies that it will be lawful to terminate the life of the unborn if particular conditions do exist.</P>
      <P>It is my strongly held view, and that of the Progressive Democrats, that inserting a new provision in the Constitution of Ireland is not the proper mechanism to attempt to regulate such exceptional situations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Indeed, looking back on the Dáil debate leading up to the introduction of our Constitution we can see that Eamon de Valera had a clear view as to what should or should not be in the proposed Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As President of the Executive Council he stated on 11 May 1937, at columns 62 and 63 of the Official Reort, in relation to that part of the Constitution which deals with fundamental rights, Article 40 which is the subject of these proposed referenda, and I quote, that &ldquo;You have the natural conflict between the rights of the individual and the rights of the <Col N="68" /> community as a whole&rdquo;.  He went on to elaborate:</P>
    <P>You cannot, however, state those things absolutely.  All you can do is to give the fundamental principles; to state them clearly and correctly, and leave it to the sense of justice, the goodwill of the community, to work in accordance with the spirit of the declarations.</P>
    <P>I share this view of the Constitution.  It is wrong to seek to burden our basic law with detailed controls which ought to be the responsibility of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of the Constitution covering fundamental rights should confine itself to a positive affirmation of basic rights of the individual, with the necessary regulations controlling or limiting such rights demarcated by legislation.  In that context let us look at what happened in 1983.  The 1983 Amendment to Article 40 inserted a requirement that the life of the unborn be protected.  This was a laudable aspiration. But it was a right qualified in its formulation by the necessity to have and I quote: &ldquo;due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Government is not taking the job crisis seriously, given that it was only four months ago that it first recognised that such a crisis existed and that since then all it has managed to do is establish one partnership board yesterday in Galway?  Could the Minister explain in detail to the House how finance will be provided, given that £50 million is to be provided from the debt management fund?  Since that announcement there has been quite a change in the economy, particularly in regard to interest rates.  Will the Minister explain how the £50 million will now be available from the debt management fund?  When will the Government apply for the £50 million which they claim will be provided by the EC?</P>

      <P>There will be ample funds available for this initiative.  As I said, £50 million is being made available by way of public funds.  We have had negotiations with the European Community and they have agreed the structure we have put in position.  The global grant employment initiative that the Community has taken is based on the new structure.  We have a commitment under the EFTA fund and we are negotiating on structural funding.  We are absolutely certain that the funds are available and that there will be a major contribution for the first time in the history of the State to small indigenous industry, which the Government have indicated will be handled by the enterprise partnership boards.  This is a departure from the position heretofore where there was a vagueness about who should handle small industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer.  In 1965 the Government took a decision to create county development teams in the 12 western counties under what is known as the western development fund initiative.  The eastern counties never had such an <Col N="71" /> initiative and never had such funding. However, during the seventies the local authorities in the western part of the country decided to have an in-house county development team of their own, without State support.  Acknowledging what has been done in the western development area and the arrangements which existed in the eastern area, we have put into position a new structure involving the community, the private sector, the commercial sector, the semi-State sector and the public sector.  The European Commission and the European Community support that initiative and will back it up with funds.  The Government have taken the decision.  We are proceeding.</P>

As this initiative evolves I am confident all parties will give it their full support.

Will the Minister acknowledge that if one was to have any regard for value for money, it would not be possible to devise a more wasteful structure?

Deputy Rabbitte should not talk too loudly about that.  He should be careful when he talks about funds.  We all know what happened to the funds in his party recently when they changed their name very quickly.  The way they did their transfers, was not very ethical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in the incidence of tuberculosis throughout the world including western countries such as Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have instructed the Chief Medical Officer of my Department to conduct a thorough review of the issue.  He is, at present, consulting various experts in the field and will report to me at an early date.</P>
      <P>Care should be taken when comparing the absolute prevalence of the disease in this country with that of other countries or indeed with Northern Ireland.  There are diverging methods between countries of compiling statistical data on this disease. What is significant is that a number of countries are reporting an increase in the incidence of the disease.</P>
      <P>The numbers of cases reported to my Department in 1990 was 624, while in 1991, 630 cases were reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the challenge that my new portfolio offers <Col N="79" /> here this afternoon for the first time on Priority Questions.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the extreme concern that has been expressed in recent times at the increase in tuberculosis which the Minister will recall was tackled by the first interparliamentary Government in this country under Deputy Noel Browne?  Is he aware that it has been referred to as the greatest killer on earth with one thousand million beings in two centuries dying from this disease?  Arising from the statistics the Minister has given us, would he tell us how many deaths occurred in 1990 and 1991 and what are the trends for 1992 showing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me publicly congratulate Deputy Nora Owen.  I look forward to having her bombard me with questions.</P>
      <P>We have no figures on the deaths from TB, I must confess.  I am very conscious of tuberculosis and the scourge it has been. I suffered in my own family and was a victim of it myself.  I am very conscious of it and the problems that would be created by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new cases of TB occurring each year fell from 1,933 in 1965 to 534 in 1988 but then it increased to 624 in 1990.  This gives an overall incidence of it of 17 per 100,000 of which over 80 per cent or 14.6 per 100,000 is pulmonary tuberculosis. The incidence rate of pulmonary tuberculosis in other countries such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Denmark ranges between six and ten per 100,000 and Spain has a rate of 20 per 100,000.  There are countries such as Turkey and other countries in eastern Europe which have much higher rates.  The issues requiring attention in relation to tuberculosis are the role of BCG in the prevention and control of it &mdash; unfortunately there has been quite a lapse in the uptake by parents of immunisation of children with BCG; the refining of the system of reporting and the surveillance of TB under the infectious diseases regulations; and the determination of the most appropriate service structure to deal with TB cases as <Col N="80" /> between hospital and primary care service. There is also the problem of contact tracing and the administration of prophylaxis and of course the emerging problem of HIV and Aids and its relationship to TB.  There was a recently published survey in the Eastern Health Board showing that 7 per cent of patients reported as having tuberculosis in 1990 were known to be HIV positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that long reply.  Is the Minister telling me that he does not know how many people have died from tuberculosis in the last few years in this country?  I find that hard to understand.  Perhaps if he has not got the information today he could undertake to let me have it.  Is the Minister proposing, in running a campaign, to encourage an increase in BCG vaccinations lest this be found to be one of the reasons for the increased incidence of TB?  Finally, can the Minister give this House any explanation for the increases since 1988?  Would he perhaps agree with me that it has something to do with bad housing, lack of good housing for our people and also perhaps, as we see from the Land Registry office, some of the building materials and the type of building structures where people have to work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know, and indeed many countries do not know, why the disease suddenly increases.  We have a higher standard of living now than we had in the forties and fifties.  I have been seeking the chief medical officer's views on this and, in the case of the Land Registry, it occurred to me that there are old files down there with which people with tuberculosis have worked for many years. It is difficult to know the reason for the sudden increase in the last two years.  I have asked them to look at this whole issue very urgently.  I understand that there was a meeting between the Department of Health and the health boards' medical officers of health and a further meeting is to be held in two days time on it to make further progress towards developing a coherent national strategy <Col N="81" /> to deal with that problem.  I will be glad to let the Deputy have a report on it as soon as it becomes available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 8, 70, 137 and 138 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the GMS Review commenced in March of this year <Col N="82" /> with the participation of the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Departments of Health and Finance and the health boards.  Meetings of the Review are continuing on a regular basis and constructive dialogue has taken place on a range of issues.  As the negotiations are at a delicate stage, I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment in detail on the nature of the discussions other than to say that both sides are committed to the review process.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful, therefore, that it will be possible to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion and avoid a withdrawal of general practitioners from the scheme.</P>
    <P>However, if the discussions reach a stage where it becomes clear that a withdrawal is inevitable, alternative arrangements will be put in place to ensure that medical card patients continue to receive GP services as well as necessary drugs and medicines.  I wish to emphasise, however, that every effort is being made to resolve the current difficulties in the GMS through the process of the current review discussions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the amswer he has given today and the statements made in recent weeks do nothing but increase the anxiety particularly of thousands of elderly people dependent on the GMS system for their medical care?  Will the Minister accept that it would be impossible for him or the health boards to put into place any comparable service should there be mass resignations of general practitioners? Would he accept the fact that hospital-based consultations amounted to 1.4 million last year while GP consultations amounted to 13 million and it is a nonsense to suggest that adequate and comprehensive cover could be provided for all patients currently dependent on the GMS scheme?  Will the Minister end the confrontation now and enter into meaningful dicussions with the medical authorities and bring this dreadful situation to a conclusion rather than preparing <Col N="83" /> contingency plans which will certainly be inadequate and will only further heighten the fears of thousands of unemployed and elderly people dependent on medical services.</P>

      <P>I am not pessimistic yet and I believe we can reach an agreement.  We will examine all aspects of the matter.

      <P>Let me ask the Minister a straightforward question.  Would he agree that the GMS scheme is grossly underfunded and that if he was prepared <Col N="85" /> to provide extra funding for the scheme there would be no resignations and the 1.2 million people who are covered by the scheme would be able to rest easy in their beds and homes during the next two months knowing that the service will not be withdrawn?  Is the Minister honestly trying to tell this House that he wants to revert to the two-tier medical system where those who are not in a position to pay for their health care will have to queue at the old dispensaries?  At least under the GMS scheme they can maintain some dignity.  Would the Minister discuss the matter with the doctors realistically?  As he is probably aware, it was reported in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> this week that the GPs committee expressed anger at him.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>the reason an applicant (details supplied) in County Mayo who was told in a letter dated 6th April, 1992, that he would be called for admission for a hip replacement operation within six months of that date has now been notified that it will be approximately 18 months before he can be called for surgery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 15 together.  The patient in question was notified in April last that he would be called for a hip replacement operation within six months.  Unfortunately, the consultant in charge of the patient's case died in May.  Despite every effort, it has not been possible for the Western Health Board to obtain the sevices of a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon in the interim.</P>
      <P>The vacant post of consultant orthopaedic surgeon was advertised by the Local Appointment's Commission in August last with a closing date of 17 September 1992.  It is expected that interviews will be held shortly and the successful candidates appointed without delay.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the waiting list for hip replacement operations has grown since the untimely death of one of the consultant orthopaedic surgeons at the hospital last May.  The position is that the three remaining orthopaedic surgeons are concentrating on emegency cases. Should any patients feel that this condition has deteriorated, they should contact their general practitoner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of their case to the hospital directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as of 30 September there were 1,738 patients awaiting hip replacement operations in this hospital?  Would he agree that by any standards this is a primitive service and one would have to go a long way in the underdeveloped world to find anything as bad?  Is he aware that one will have to wait for about four and a half years on the waiting list before gaining entry to the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When one provides a <Col N="89" /> service one creates a demand.  Whereas some years ago people were content to endure their arthritic hips, unfortunately the increased demand cannot be met from within the resources that are available. This is normal in the case of most operative procedures but especially this one as it allows a person to return to full mobility within a short time.  I recognise that there is a great demand for certain procedures and as soon as new medical technology is available there will be a massive increase in a number on the waiting lists for other procedures.  No country in the civilised world at present can cope with the financial implications of new medical technology for a health service; it is increasing at a phenomenal pace. This should be borne in mind.  We have to recognise also that we do not have the required number of surgeons trained, or available at short notice to cope with the increased demand in this field alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the situation has been exacerbated given his failure to take action?  There are three new clean air theatres in this hospital which are funded by the Minister's Department and which have been completed since 1990 but because no extra funding has been provided for extra staff during the past two years the position in relation to the waiting lists at this hospital and health board area has been greatly exacerbated.</P>

      <P>I am so aware.  When I became Minister for Health in February the allocation for 1992 had been made. This matter is being considered in the context of the Estimates for 1993, taking into account that there is a number of competing demands on the 1993 budget. However, I will bear in mind what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the position in Galway is not unique, that there is a national crisis in the whole area of orthopaedic surgery?  Will he carry out a comprehensive assessment of the problem with regard to hip implants? In some health board areas there is a <Col N="90" /> four-year waiting list for a first appointment and thereafter it can take two to three years before surgery takes place. Would the Minister accept that a person with £6,000 can have the operation straight away whereas people with medical cards and public patients have to wait for up to six years for the operation? Would the Minister investigate the position whereby hip implants provided by health boards are being used for private patients?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy bears with me I will exlain the matter.  There is a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons and even if we had sufficient resources we would still have difficulty in providing the number of orthopaedic surgeons required to carry out all the operations necessary.  I visited Galway and I am very conscious of the needs there.  I do not think an investigation of this matter is required on a national basis.  There is a problem in this area, as there is in the areas of cardiac surgery and renal dialysis, and we must address them as best we can.  My job as Minister for <Col N="91" /> Health is to consider the priorities with a view to allocating funds to the greatest needs in an area, and I will continue to do that.  I realise there is a problem in the area mentioned by the Deputy.  In the next three years the number on the waiting lists will have doubled or trebled because these services are very successful in restoring mobility.  This service is a great boon in modern medicine. However, funds are limited and no matter who is in power the problem will exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister responded to the recent request from the Western Health Board for the filling of 12 consultant positions in Merlin Park Hospital and University Hospital, Galway?  Is he aware that since one of the orthopaedic consultants died in May, this post has not been filled?  Would the Minister make available the grant for the clean air clinic which would enable those operations to be carried out in the summer months.  We were informed at the last health board meeting that people have to wait four or five years for hip, knee and other orthopaedic operations as a result of the Department's failure to fill the 12 consultant posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with a number of these matters but the question does not relate to the filling of posts. In May 1992 the consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Merlin Park Regional Hospital passed away and the Western Health Board sought and obtained approval from my Department in June to fill that post.  On 3 July 1992 Comhairle na nOspidéal formally approved the filling of the post and on 16 July the Western Health Board requested the Local Appointment Commission to advertise the post.  The advertisement was placed on 27 August with a closing date of 17 September and interviews will take place shortly.  The Western Health Board endeavoured to recruit a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon but were unsuccessful.  As the existing three orthopaedic surgeons have to concentrate on <Col N="92" /> emergencies, the waiting lists have increased.  We hope that the interviews will result in the appointment of a consultant.</P>

      <P>The people in the west owe a great debt of graditude to the late Mr. Ronan Gorczak who provided a tremendous service over the years.  I would put it to the Minister that there seems to be some inconsistency in relation to the whole question of waiting lists.  Yesterday the Minister said that there are 886 people on the waiting list for heart by-pass surgery and the estimated annual throughput in 700; for hip replacement operations, there is a waiting list of 1,658 and an estimated annual throughput of 2,300.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to an appeals system for unsuccessful applicants for disabled persons maintenance allowance and other cash allowances administered by the health boards.  I believe that the introduction of an independent appeals system in such cases would be a desirable development.  I am having the matter examined in the context of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to introduce a statutory appeals system for the medical card scheme.</P>

      <P>I am in a position to do something about it and I have examined the matter with a view to setting up an appeals system.  There should be a uniform system throughout the country.  It is very unfair that while a person in one health board area may qualify for an allowance, in the adjoining health board area a person will fail to qualify.  I have told them that I want an appeals system in operation for the medical cards scheme as soon as possible.  The same will apply to the others.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister recognises the need for an appeals board.  However, will he agree that restricting it to medical card holders is not the right way to go about it?  Will he also agree that rent supplements, mortgage allowances, medical cards, DPMA, discretionary payments and exceptional need payments are administered by the health boards which have caused confusion to applicants, politicians and officials of the various health boards?  We need a board very similar to that of the very succesful appeals board which is administered by the Department of Social Welfare, which would encompass all the various payment schemes.</P>

Will he ensure that health boards do not make up the laws as they go along?  The Minister is aware, from other questions, that under the Infectious Diseases Act, health boards are now referring people with TB to community welfare officers for supplementary welfare allowances, which is contrary to the regulations.  Will the Minister instruct the programme managers of community care programmes to ensure that they operate the regulations uniformly?</P>

      <P>We will have to implement an appeals system because, no matter how the other scheme is operated, there will be different opinions on it. Maybe the Department of Social Welfare appeals system is the ideal one but certainly a proper appeals system would ensure that everyone is given a fair chance.  The present arbitrary system is most unjust and I do not condone it.  I hope to have an appeals system in operation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we must have community rating.  In the legislation I will try to put a levy on companies coming in here offering special rates to younger people because that would adversely affect elderly people.  We will do everything possible to ensure that there is a community rated system in operation because it is the only fair one. I assure the Deputy that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board have got away with murder in regard to private and semi-private beds in public hospoitals and they have not paid the full rate for these beds.  Any money taken by the State from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was merely a fraction of what they would have had to pay for these beds.  In many hospitals the Voluntary Health Insurance ensured the patients were admitted to children's hospitals where there were no private beds.  The families were insured and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board did not have to pay.  If anything, money would be due to the Department of Health from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</P>

Does he intend to grant an <Col N="98" /> increase in rates to the VHI as he refused to sanction the 7 per cent increase for which they had asked?  Has that matter been brought to a conclusion?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm to Deputy Byrne my decision not to proceed with the proposal <Col N="99" /> for a central clinical waste incinerator at St. James's Hospital.</P>
    <P>The information requested by Deputy Garland in relation to hospital waste disposal arrangements around the country, is not available in my Department.  I have recently initiated a survey which it is hoped will provide this and other information relevant to hospital waste disposal practices.</P>
    <P>The current general policy on hospital waste is to segregate it into clinical and non-clinical components, the clinical waste being incinerated and the nonclinical or domestic waste being sent to landfill.  My Department are currently carrying out a study of the options for clinical waste disposal.  These options include incineration at a number of locations throughout the country as well as a number of alternative methods to incineration.  It is intended that this study will lead to a waste management plan for clinical waste in keeping with modern requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the fact that the central clinical waste disposal incinerator is not going ahead at St. James's Hospital.  In the meantime, what does the Minister intend to do about the pollution that is being caused not just by the existing incinerator at St. James's Hospital but also by other incinerators at hospitals throughout our city&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which are polluting the atmosphere and are in breach of the Air Pollution Act.  Will the Minister close down the incinerators that are at present in breach of the Air Pollution Act?  Is he aware that St. James's Hospital, using the existing incinerators, have been taken to court by the health board itself and have been fined for causing air pollution? What timescale does the Minister have in mind for arriving at an alternative?  Will he agree to close down those incinerators that are causing pollution at the moment, while he is awaiting an alternative proposal from his officials?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne would love to have it every way.  When there was a proposal to go ahead with a new incinerator he was marching throughout the city and now that we have decided not to go ahead with that proposal he wants to go marching again.  The whole question is being examined so that when a proper form of disposal of clinical waste is proposed it will be the perfect form of disposal.  There is no magic wand and we cannot rush up to St. James's Hospital and immediately put in place a new form of clinical waste disposal.  Deputy Byrne is annoyed that I gave an assurance to Deputy Gregory that nothing would take place.  Deputy Gregory was in the group with me.</P>

I want to ensure that the form of clinical waste disposal that is put in place is the proper form of disposal.  I am also taking into consideration the position in Cork and in a few other places. The whole question is being examined <Col N="101" /> and it is my hope that an answer will be found very soon.</P>

      <P>I am most disappointed at the Minister's response to my question. He is still talking about methods of waste disposal.  I ask the Minister whether we might not get beyond this stage of disposal. Surely what we want to do is reduce and segregate the waste.  Waste should be reduced at source.  In particular, we should try to find some way of phasing out PVC, as has been done in Denmark.  PVC is a very lethal refuse, and whether it is incinerated or landfilled there is a serious problem.  Would the Minister undertake to address this issue in a more fundamental, radical way than he has done up to now?</P>

      <P>I suppose that the new incinerator would have been operational had the Deputy not protested but such new incinerator would not have met the standards laid down.  The matter is under examination.  We must consider all options.  I asked the engineer in my Department to examine what was being done in Britain in a city of comparable size to Dublin in relation to the disposal of such waste.  It is intended to make a comparison of a few different cities.  It is important to come up with the right answer because a considerable investment is involved.  The Government want to be sure that when a new facility is put into operation it is the correct one and that there will not be marches around the city by Deputy Byrne and his cohorts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 13, 36, 39, 55, 63, 66, 69, 73 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>For the past few years the Government have made available a special allocation specifically for the development of the adult dental services and the provision of orthodontic treatments.  A sum of £3 million was provided by the Government in 1990 and a further £3 million was provided in 1991.  The special allocation has enabled health boards to bring an additional 2,500 orthodontic cases into specialist treatment in 1990 and a similar number onto specialist treatment in 1991 and at the end of that year over 12,000 children were receiving treatment. About another 4,000 receive treatment at primary care level.  The allocations made available to health boards in 1992 include a repeat of the special provisions of 1990 and 1991.  At current levels of treatment health boards are completing over 5,000 cases annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> A post of counsultant orthodontist for each health board had been approved by my Department but health boards had difficulty in filling them because those orthodontists with the qualifications necessary for appointment found private practice more attractive.</P>
    <P>However, following a review, the pay and conditions attached to the post were significantly improved by my Department and vacancies were re-advertised by the Local Appointments Commission in 1991.  As a result a number of health boards have now successfully made appointments.</P>
    <P>The position in each health board is as follows:</P>
    <P>Eastern:&mdash; The board proposes to make shared appointments with the Dublin Dental Hospital and interviews of candidates are due to be held this month.</P>
    <P>Midland:&mdash; The board were unsuccessful in the Local Appointments Commission competition and have made alternative arrangements with private specialists to provide services.  The board will again endeavour to fill the vacant post of consultant orthodontist in the near future.</P>
    <P>Mid-Western:&mdash; A consultant is in post since 1985.</P>
    <P>North-Eastern:&mdash; The board was unsuccessful in the Local Appointments Commission competition and have made alternative arrangements with private specialists to provide services.  The board will again endeavour to fill the vacant post of consultant orthodontist in the near future.</P>
    <P>North-Western:&mdash; A consultant took up duty in February, 1992.</P>
    <P>South-Eastern:&mdash; A consultant took up duty in September, 1992.</P>
    <P>Southern:&mdash; A consultant took up duty in January 1992.</P>
    <P>Western:&mdash; A consultant has been appointed this month.</P>
    <P>Five health boards, out of a total of eight, have orthodontic surgeons.  The successful recruitment by health boards of consultant orthodontists will considerably improve the services provided by the boards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" /> At present, average waiting times for children seeking orthodontic treatment vary considerably throughout the country, but with the recruitment of the consultant orthodontists it can be expected that there will be considerable improvements in the waiting times.  In this regard a primary task of the consultant orthodontist is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to specialist and sub-specialist levels for health board dental staff to enable health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service. The level of service now being provided has generated an increased expectation and consequently demand.</P>
    <P>The provision of fixed appliance orthodontic treatment is very expensive.  It is important therefore that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected or handicapped. Accordingly my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the classification of cases awaiting treatment in descending order of severity or handicap. Children have been assessed for treatment by health boards in accordance with these guidelines and, where appropriate, placed on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>According to information supplied to my Department by the health boards the current waiting lists are as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that on a quick calculation the figures he has read out amount to approximately 15,000 people waiting for orthodontic treatment? Is he further aware that some of these are children who had been assessed when they were nine or ten years old and that they will be parents or, perhaps, grandparents before they will receive treatment?  Is he really telling us that the appointments list he has given today is a sufficient effort to remove and cut down on these lists?  The figures are appalling and he must have been embarrassed to announce them today in the Chamber.</P>

      <P>It is arbitrary because one consultant orthodontist may say that treatment is not necessary whereas his colleague may say it is absolutely essential.

      <P>If the Deputy bears with me for a moment I will tell him.  The first constructive step in that direction was to have orthodontic surgeons appointed to each health board.  That was a major move in the right direction.  Many dental surgeons can be trained in orthodontics as a sub-specialty.</P>

      <P>It would be my intention that we would have a compulsory vocational year for newly qualified dentists to bring them into the public dental service.  I am also very anxious to have more dental hygienists so that the dental surgeons can do much more sophisticated work and in turn that there would be in-house training in the health boards for the training of dental surgeons.  I am speaking as a non-dental person but I would say they can be trained in orthodontic work.  I think we will make inroads on that in the years ahead.  Expectations rise as people are aware that orthodontic treatment is available.  It is part of increased technology and everybody wants to avail of it.</P>

Can the Minister give the number of people who would be on the list had the guidelines not been changed?  In areas where the Local Appointment Commission had failed to make an appointment of an orthodontist would he consider making funds available to the affected health boards on a fee per patient basis so that the people on the waiting list could be treted by private orthodontists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the different categories.  I thought the categories which were established, categories A, B and C, were very good.  In terms of priority, we all agree that those with a handicap, cleft palate and other congenital malformations of the jaw should be given priority.  Category B refers to a number of other conditions which would not warrant immediate priority but which would be considered. People are placed in categories according to their need.  I thought this was the fairest way to operate the system.  In other cases a person's teeth may not be very straight and may have to be wired. This is not a life-saving operation, an emergency or an immediate requirement. Those people were put in other categories.  The employment of orthodontic surgeons on a private basis is expensive and I thought it would be better to provide in-house training for them so they could be placed in the public dental service where they are needed. With the other measures I am planning to introduce we will get a good dental service which will operate in the best interests of patients.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was saying that the 1983 <Col N="179" /> Amendment had inserted a requirement in the Constitution that the life of the unborn be protected.  I said that this was a laudable aspiration.  I went on to say that it was a right qualified in its forumlation by the necessity to have &ldquo;due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;.  It was, and it remains, the responsibility of this House to provide the detailed legislation which is necessary to strike the balance between such rights. This fact was envisaged in the 1983 Eight Amendment where the State guaranteed &ldquo;in its laws to respect, and, as far as practical, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right&rdquo;.  As the recently tragically deceased Mr. Justice Neil McCarthy pointed out in his judgment in the X case, we in this House have been remiss in our duty by failing to provide such legislation which, as I said, is specifically required by the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, dealing with the question of information, which is also before us, is consistent with this requirement.  It inserts a right in the Constitution and leaves to legislation its detailed control.  The Minister for Health has given the House an outline of the likely terms of such possible legislation. That is why, no matter what the people of Ireland decide in December regarding the Twelfth Amendment on the so-called substantive issue, the Progressive Democrats believe that legislation will be essential to guide doctors in dealing with the real life cases that simply will not readily comply with the formal constitutional text now proposed.  To do otherwise would force the Supreme Court to continue to have to make the law on a case by case basis.  Given the reality of the Supreme Court judgment, and irrespective of the outcome of the constitutional referenda on 3 December, medical terminations will be lawful in Ireland in certain limited circumstances. Are we now to allow this situation to apply without any legislative control? How are our doctors to decide on the hard cases, the border line cases and the emergency cases?  Will they have to <Col N="180" /> endure a threat of having their judgment challenged after the fact in some criminal suit?  Will the woman's life be put at risk otherwise because they are unsure of their position?  How are doctors to define the elusive dividing line between life-threatening and life-shortening situations? It should be clear to everyone, therefore, that a legislative framework will be required, irrespective of the decision of the people on the Twelfth Amendment on 3 December.</P>
    <P>In this context too it is important to remember that there is little point in asserting that such and such a medical procedure will not be affected by the proposed constitutional amendment.  I repeat that the reality is that when the constitutional provision is subject to interpretation by the Supreme Court, the judges can only adjudicate on the basis of the words in the Constitution and not by reference to any other words or documents, no matter how well-intentioned such clarifications may now seek to be.</P>
    <P>A particular concern about the wording before the House is the proposal to totally exclude the danger of self-destruction or suicide from any consideration in a possible medical termination of pregnancy. I am aware of the arguments for such a provision and certainly it would be unacceptable to allow a mere plea of suicidal intent as a general basis for seeking a termination, but I believe that the particular proposal before us is too absolutist a position.</P>
    <P>First, suicidal disposition was the basis on which the X case was decided.  Had we such an exclusion in the first place, at that time, the Supreme Court would not have been able to reverse the Costello judgment, and the injunction against the 14 year old travelling would have remained.  People must ask themselves would they really have supported the continuation of such a situation?  Do they believe that the Supreme Court judges were correct in lifting the injunction?</P>
    <P>Second, I believe that the real danger of suicide as a basis for termination could be adequately controlled by legislation so as to prevent it becoming an abused pretext for the availability of abortion in <Col N="181" /> Ireland.  Article 40.3.3º already provides the basis for such legislation.  Whether or not we like it, there will be some genuine cases of intended suicide, however few.</P>
    <P>Since the Supreme Court decision in the X case there has been no sudden rush to the courts by women looking for an abortion on the basis that they are suicidal. This is not a particular problem now, and there is no pressing reason to exclude it constitutionally as a basis for a termination in every case in the future. We must be willing to consider the fact that some very unusual suicide case may arise where the woman cannot for some reason or another leave the jurisdiction, and where a real and unavoidable risk of self-destruction exists.  For example, a young pregnant girl may become severely anorexic after a multiple rape.  Such a girl, with her unborn, could be condemned by this Amendment, with the hands of the Supreme Court tied, thus preventing any sensible intervention to save her life.  I would seriously question the basis for putting such an absolute ban in our Constitution.  I believe that it is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Another major concern about the proposed Amendment wording is the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;health&rdquo;.  This could take away from doctors, from the courts and from this House any right to deal with those hard cases which will arise.</P>
    <P>No one can really know whether a pregnancy which will, as a matter of probability, drastically shorten and devastate a woman's life, will be permitted to be terminated under this proposal.  It seems to me that the wording is calculated to try to distinguish between life shortening and life threatening pregnancies and to exclude completely &ldquo;life shortening&rdquo; risks as a ground for termination.</P>
    <P>This provision scarcely reflects reality and fails any objective analysis.  Furthermore, it is not easily interpreted.  The distinction between life threatening and life shortening is clearly problematical. Are we as a people to say to some women: because this pregnancy will not kill you now but will only leave you <Col N="182" /> immobilised, maybe a physical or mental wreck, and perhaps with a dramatically reduced life expectancy, you may not have a particular treatment?</P>
    <P>We should also recognise the fact that the proposed Amendment will put at risk the position of the existing Article 40.3.3º in so far as it removes the protection of Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty by modifying the Article which the Protocol protects.  Furthermore, it is accepted by all that any new insertion will not be protected from scrutiny by the European Court of Justice.  It is somewhat doubtful whether or not our European partners would agree to change the Protocol to protect the proposed Twelfth Amendment if passed.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn briefly to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution Bills.  These honour the commitment given by the four party leaders at the time of the Maastricht Referendum to provide travel and information rights.  The Progressive Democrats have no hesitation in supporting the passage of these two Bills in this House and in recommending them to the people for endorsement.  We support them because we believe that travel and information are basic human rights, which should not be limited by the State except for the most pressing and exceptional of public policy reasons.</P>
    <P>It is, I believe, unacceptable to attempt to restrict travel to avail of services legally available in other states and similarly wrong in practice, and in principle, to ban absolutely all information about such services.  By denying information to women about abortion in England, we are also ruling out the possibility that comprehensive, non-directive information could lead to some women rejecting that option.</P>
    <P>If such information becomes available only when a women arrives at the clinic in England, after she has undergone the trauma of deciding on an abortion; put together the money necessary for the treatment and, perhaps, contrived a pretext for her travel, she may simply not even want to consider any alternative course of action, such as keeping the <Col N="183" /> child or having it adopted.  We therefore support the passage of these two Bills in this House.  We welcome the cross-party support for them and invite the people to support them in the forthcoming referenda.</P>
    <P>The three measures before the House arise out of decisions of the Government made after consideration of the issues involved by a sub-committee of the Cabinet, of which I was a member.  Because they are Government Bills, and because the Government meet and act as a collective authority, or ought to do, their members, including myself, are bound to carry through their decisions or else resign from the Government.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, therefore, I consider that it would be inconsistent with membership of the Government for us now to vote against any of these Bills in the Oireachtas.  That, in turn, presents any member of Government who disagrees with the substance of any of these measures with a choice, to allow the proposal to go before the people who are the sovereign authority in our constitutional scheme of things for their decision, or to resign from Government and precipitate a general election.</P>
    <P>The latter course of action would also prevent me and the other party leaders from honouring the pledge we gave during the Maastricht referendum campaign that a referendum would be held this year to restore rights of travel and information.  The passage of the Bills will give all the people, including Irish women, the opportunity to pass judgment on these proposals.  The Progressive Democrats as a party will collectively publish their analysis and advice on the measures proposed and I have no doubt that, as a political party, we will advise the electorate and our own supporters in clear terms during the course of the campaign.</P>
    <P>The issue now before this House is as to whether the matter should be put before the people for their consideration. We are enacting nothing here in our consideration of these Bills.  Unfortunately, the debate up to 3 December is <Col N="184" /> likely to be divisive and will damage the cohesion of our society.  A foretaste of the debate has already alarmed many, but to plunge the country now into an abortion election as it would undoubtedly be dubbed, would be unforgivable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this debate began yesterday, approximately 25 Irish women have travelled to Britain for an abortion.  Since the X case last February, approximately 3,000 women have gone to Britain for an abortion and last year more than 4,100 Irish girls, according to official statistics, had abortions in Britain or Wales.  These are conservative figures and this is the real and substantive issue in this debate. Unfortunately, nothing that is said in this debate will alleviate the plight of those women.  Nothing said in this debate will save one single woman from travelling that lonely and isolated road for an abortion.</P>
      <P>During the past few months many of us have been challenged to reconsider our view about certain matters.  That does not come easy.  Most people do not like the notion of abortion; in fact most people do not like to use the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; is often used instead.  However, for many it is the lesser of two evils.  It is the lesser of two evils where a woman's life is at risk, where her health is seriously at risk, or if somebody has been raped or the subject of a sexual crime such as incest.  It is also the lesser of two evils where somebody may take her own life. In these limited circumstances &mdash; and they are limited &mdash; the option of terminating a pregnancy should be available to Irish women in Ireland.  In this debate, as in many others, we will continue to export our problem to Britain.  Once again, Britain, will provide a solution to an Irish problem.  However, if this country was geographically located 2,500 miles into the mid-Atlantic, if we were much further from Britain than we are and if it cost a few hundred pounds to get there, we might take a different approach to the issue we are discussing today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> When the X case arose I saw in this House, as I did in the country, a new awakening, understanding and sympathy in relation to the plight of that young girl and her family.  I doubt if many people, particularly in this House, would not have chosen a similar route if faced with the same circumstances.  That family were trying to do the best they could for their young rape victim, but instead of getting support and help they were confronted by the arms of Government and stopped from taking her to Britian for an abortion.  Many people felt disgusted that the insertion of Article 40.3.3º into the Constitution in 1983 could have had that kind of consequence and, as a result, many of us have had to reconsider our approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the new awakening and sympathy at the time of the X case has slowly ebbed and we have now adopted more polarised views.  That is regrettable and it is particularly regrettable that over the past few weeks on many radio and television programmes &mdash; and, indeed, in the media generally &mdash; we have had to listen to men discuss the female anatomy in a clinical and cold manner, almost as if they were discussing an aircraft or something of that kind.  I know many women found it offensive and many men also found it offensive.  I would find it equally offensive if men were being discussed in the same fashion.  I have not heard any of these men discuss the plight of the 4,190 girls who went to Britain last year for abortions.  I have not heard them express the view that the men who impregnated these women should be more responsible for their actions because, unfortunately, while we do not have any statistics in Ireland as to why these women travel, we generally know that many of them make that choice because they believe there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>It is a lonely, isolated, difficult decision and if we, as a country, really care and want to be compassionate then we must obtain the statistics.  We need to find out who they are and why they go.  I believe some of them go because they have been deserted and abandoned by the men who <Col N="186" /> made them pregnant.  They feel they have nowhere to turn, that there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>I wish we had better support and caring services for those who find themselves in this position.  It is interesting to note, for example, that in a study published in 1990 by Dr Stanley Henshaw it was found that the rate of abortion among Dutch women per 1,000 women in the child bearing years of 15 to 44 was 3.6 per cent, whereas the rate in Ireland for the same year was 4.8 per cent.  These were Irish women going to Britain for abortions.  We have a 1.2 per cent rate higher than they have in the Netherlands where abortion is freely available.  The reason the rate is so low in the Netherlands is because they have a proper system of sex education. They have widespread access to family planning, 80 different counselling centres for people with sexual problems, or who need crisis pregnancy advice and so on. That is the reason the figure is so low and if we really want to make a dent in the high numbers of Irish women seeking abortions abroad, we need to establish a similar programme here.  We need proper pregnancy counselling, widespread availability of family planning services, proper sex education and greater support and care services for those who find themselves pregnant.  There is no other way of decreasing the level of abortions among Irish women abroad.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that this debate is taking place almost as if there was an emergency.  Midnight sittings of this House tend to occur around budget time, or perhaps towards the summer as we approach the recess, or on other occasions when emergency legislation has to be rushed through the Oireachtas. I do not believe the legislation we are discussing at the moment can in any way be described as emergency legislation. There is no demand in this country for a referendum on this issue, on what is called the substantive issue of abortion. In 1983 most people thought they were voting for legislation that would not allow abortion in most circumstances.  They felt that they were fooled then and I do not believe they want to be fooled now.  Most <Col N="187" /> people are saying, &ldquo;We elected you the legislators; it is up to you to make and take decision on our behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many speakers in this debate and many outside the House have advanced the theory that it is right to let the people decide.  I have no principled objection to letting the people decide but we do not let the people decide how much tax they would like to pay.  If we are closing down a hospital or restricting health services we do not consult the people in that way. We are elected to make tough and difficult decisions and there is no way that the complex issue of abortion can be dealt with in four or five lines in our Constitution. My voting Yes or No on 3 December will not adequately deal with the complex issue of abortion.  That is why I regret very much that it is being approached in this manner.</P>
    <P>During the Maastricht debate the leaders of the main parties came together and most people applauded that.  They felt it was a sign of maturity on the part of the Oireachtas and politics generally. The progress that was made then towards achieving a consensus has been shattered in recent days and the kind of new departure that most people felt was emanating from Leinster House unfortunately has gone.  I regret that very much.  I also regret that a moral issue such as this is dealt with in a rigid Whip way in this Oireachtas.  We are one of the few Parliaments in the civilised, developed world that treats these issues in this way.  Most civilised Parliaments allow free votes on what are regarded as moral issues.  This is a moral issue.  People have very different views and they should be allowed to express them freely in the way they vote in this House.</P>
    <P>Those who say we must have a referendum because the Legislature cannot be trusted is offensive to Deputies and Senators and it is an insult that we ourselves are compounding by agreeing to go down this route.  The recent Family Planning Bill passed in this House certainly would not give any indication that the Legislature is about to open the floodgates.  It was a welcome development <Col N="188" /> in some respects but certainly could not be regarded as being extremely liberal. There are those who say that if we do not adopt this approach and have a referendum, and if we do not accept these words, that in some way we will have abortion on demand.  It is not a choice between these words or abortion on demand and I and many other people find it insulting to be accused of wanting abortion on demand.  Nobody in this House, to the best of my knowledge, wants abortion on demand or believes that abortion should be used as a form of family planning.  People genuinely want to see it available only in the hard cases that I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>My problem with these words is twofold. I find it very difficult to accept that we can distinguish between health and life.  Recently I was made aware of a case by the extended family of the woman involved, a woman from the west who gave birth to a child three and a half years ago.  During the course of her pregnancy she developed toxaemia.  As a result of that the woman has been in a coma ever since.  In a situation like that, the choice of terminating the pregnancy would not be available under these words to that woman, or to somebody in similar circumstances, and I regret that very much. It is heartbreaking for her family and her friends to see the condition that woman is in as a result of developing an illness during her pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I wonder who will decide whether the life of the woman is threatened.  Will it be the obstetrician?  Will it be the cardiologist if the problem is cardiac hypertension? Will it be an oncologist or perhaps a combination of all three?  I believe that after this legislation is introduced many doctors will be afraid to carry out any termination.  They will be afraid they will leave themselves open to litigation by, perhaps, the husband or some other interested party, because no doctor can ever say with certainty that somebody is going to die in one month, six months or nine months.  These words seem to introduce a degree of certainty that is just not possible.  It is not medically possible ever to say if somebody is <Col N="189" /> definitely going to die or when that might happen.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that we have approached the issue in this way and I believe many women are deeply disturbed. I regret that the Council for the Status of Women, which is an umbrella body representing 80 different women's organisations, and the Commission for the Status of Women, appointed by the Government two years ago to examine the inequities that still remaim in our society as far as women are concerned, were not adequately consulted.  If this was an issue that affected the construction industry, or the farming community, or the vintners, for example, would we be approaching it in the same way?  Would there not be widespread consultation?  Would people not be going out of their way to ensure the lobby was looked after?  Why should women be singled out and treated differently?</P>

      <P>If there were more women in this House we would obviously make a bigger impact.  We have 13 women but, unfortunately, as 13 women we do not seem to matter when it comes to dealing with issues of this kind.  I believe that around this country the approach being adopted on this issue is not widely supported, even by those who do not wish to see abortion in Ireland.  Most people realise that it is not a political issue, should not be dealt with in a political way and that nobody wins votes on this kind of issue.  People see it for the personalised, difficult issue that it is.  It is a moral issue and one that personally affects people in a very special way.  It is only when people are affected or know of somebody who is personally affected that they begin to think out the issue for themselves.  Many people do not even want to have to think about it.  I believe we have let women down but we have also let ourselves down and we have let society down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the vote.  I am one of the few people in this House who on one occasion actually <Col N="190" /> voted against my party and I did so because I felt very strongly about the issue that was involved.  I did not do it lightly and it is not an easy thing to do. Obviously, as someone who is very concerned about this issue, I contemplated doing the same on this occasion and I asked myself what would be the consequences of doing that.  Would it do any good?  Would it cause a general election? It is not that I do not think the issue is not important enough because I believe it is, it is important for women and for the kind of society we are, but I believe an election on this issue would be extremely divisive, it would turn back the clock, to use a well quoted phrase and it would achieve nothing.  It would be an abortion election and people would be branded as abortionists if they wanted to provide a sympathetic and caring response in particular circumstances.  For that reason in particular, and because no good could be achieved, I do not believe it is the kind of issue in which people should vote against the approach being adopted by the Government.  The consequences of doing so obviously is a general election.  That might suit some people; perhaps that is what some people would like.  Some people are cynical enough to want to win votes on the issue of abortion, which affects families and women in a special way.</P>
    <P>It is a shame in 1992 that we are still approaching these issues in the way we are.  It is a shame that we do not have proper family planning, proper pregnancy counselling or any research on the women who go to Britain for abortion. We live in a country where only two weeks ago somebody who was convicted of raping an 18-month-old stepsister was given a suspended sentence.  What kind of society is that?  We need to make many changes.  We need to get more women in key, decision-making positions and we need more women in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the role that my two party colleagues played in Cabinet. Both tried very hard, the Leader of my party, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at the Cabinet sub-committee and both my colleagues in Cabinet.  I regret <Col N="191" /> they were not successful.  A mistake was made.  We made a mistake in 1983 and we are making another one now.  It is only a question of when the issue will be before the courts again and we will be expecting them to make a decision for us.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court let this House off the hook last February by allowing that girl to go to Britain.  The irony is that if they had prevented her from going this issue would probably have been properly sorted out last March.  We probably would have had a referendum on travel and information and we would not be dealing with what is called the substantive issue.  There was a great sigh of relief everywhere when they made the decision to let that girl go.</P>
    <P>I detect among members of all parties no great interest in getting involved in this campaign.  Politicians want to stay out of it.  They were sickened the last time and they do not want a repeat of what happened then.  In the last campaign there was division in almost every group in society &mdash; teachers for and teachers against, doctors for and doctors against, the handicapped for and the handicapped against.  It was bad for the country and it was bad for politics.  The road we are travelling now is equally bad for the country and bad for politics.  That is why I hope many politicians will adopt a sensible approach, unlike the approach adopted on the last occasion.  I appeal to those politicians who take a different view from those of us who want to deal sympathetically with rape and incest victims, and with those who we could commit suicide and whose health and life was at risk, not to brand us abortionists. We are not abortionists.  We are trying to become passionate and caring people, understanding the very difficult plight in which so many women, particularly young women, find themselves.</P>
    <P>We recognise the real possibility of people committing suicide.  That is why our psychiatric institutions have so many patients who have been committed against their will.  They have been sent in because they are a danger to themselves. <Col N="192" /> For an under-age girl who has been the victim of rape or incest there is a real possibility that she will commit suicide.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has been lauded in this House.  The words of Mr. Justice Finlay are the words which will be put before the people in the referendum, yet we are trying to restrict in this referendum the good decision made by Mr. Justice Finlay and the other judges.  On the one hand we are praising his words and using them as giving authoritative guidance in this area, but on the other hand we are trying to restict the consequences of the decision made by the Supreme Court.  I do not see the logic in that approach.</P>
    <P>Voting as I intend will be a very painful and difficult thing for me to do.  I do not say that lightly.  I regret very much that we are placed in this position and that it is a choice between an election or voting this way.  That is not the way a modern parliament in a developed country should approach this issue.  I long for the day when these kind of moral issues will be the subject of a free vote in all parties. That will be good for democracy and good for politics and it will be particularly good for those in all parties who often find themselves having to vote in away they would not wish.  We should not be afraid to allow people freely to express their conscientious view in a vote of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this very important debate and to indicate my support for the Bills on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution and my very deep concern about the implications contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I will confine most of my remarks to the Twelfth Amendment because I am extremely concerned that this removes <Col N="193" /> the Supreme Court protection of the lives of women.  Women in Ireland stand protected by the Supreme Court decision in the X case which clearly states that a woman's life is protected in all cases of real risk.  Unbelievably, if the substantive amendment is passed by this House and then by the country, that clear protection will be diminished in two substantial ways.</P>
      <P>In March this year I awaited with anxiety the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme Court.  I remember leaving Leinster House and being accosted by a journalist who had the information that the Supreme Court had decided, on the basis of the right to life of the woman, that the young victim in the X case could travel and have an abortion.  Apart from sharing the general feeling of relief that her tragedy was being resolved to the degree that she and her family considered appropriate or possible, I also felt a general sense of relief, perhaps because of the threat of which I was not overly conscious. I felt very clearly a general threat to women and I welcomed the Supreme Court's statement that where the lives of women, particularly women of child bearing age, were at risk, their lives would be protected by the State.  I had three pregnancies in the previous nine years so it was a very real reassurance for me and one which I would not lightly let go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I watched with interest political developments following that decision and the effects to reach consensus.  I hoped that consensus could be reached between all the parties.  We waited throughout the summer, following the first series of meetings with the leadership, for the proposals of the Government. When they emerged in the past few weeks I was particularly concerned that the amendments proposed by the Government rowed back so far the protection given to women as a result of the Supreme Court decision.  The extraordinarily inept frightening inclusion of the qualification regarding a woman's health thrust ambiguity and uncertainty back into the area of medical treatment. The Minister would like us to believe that <Col N="194" /> this is not so, but speaker after speaker inside and outside the House has reiterated that view.</P>
    <P>We must remember that pro-life groups will be policing this change if it comes about.  They reassured us in 1983 that certain things would not happen, that young women would not be stopped from travelling abroad and that books would not be removed from our libraries. We have learned that the worst scenarios do become reality.  The Minister has tried to reassure us.  I find his reassurances as hollow and worthless as in 1983.  It is incomprehensible that the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; and they stand on their own in this &mdash; can with such certainty recommend a wording when on all sides of this House and outside voices are raised, including the voices of their partners in Government, questioning seriously the consequences of the approach they are suggesting.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that some Fianna Fáil women have paraded in this House to defend the indefensible.  I listened with dismay, with some anger and with a great sense of disappointment this morning to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who disparaged the contribution of our spokesman, Deputy Shatter, who, last night, spoke very courageously and lucidly about the possible consequences of the wording proposed.  The same Deputies, and, indeed, perhaps Deputies O'Malley and Harney, who were part of the Government in 1983, disparaged then the arguments put up by the Deputy they are disparaging today, but every one of his arguments proved to be right.  Deputies would do a great deal more justice to Deputy Shatter by listening to his contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning also questioned the description of the substantive issue.  It is a very substantive issue &mdash; a matter of life and death &mdash; I am concerned that she could be so certain that future life threatening experiences will not be more difficult to resolve as a result of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in his speech yesterday, was full of contradictions and <Col N="195" /> inconsistencies.  In referring to the Supreme Court judgment he said that the effect of it was:</P>
    <P>to permit termination of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother which can only be avoided by such termination and that a risk of self-destruction may constitute a real and substantial risk.</P>
    <P>The earlier part is doing all the Minister seeks to achieve.  In his reference to the Supreme Court decision he says that it achieves all he sets out to achieve in his amendment.  It already allows interventions to protect the life of the woman but not protect the health of the woman. Why fix it, if it is not wrong?  The words suggested make a difficult situation worse.  I and many of my colleagues in the House know how difficult it has been for women to get the kind of treatment they need on occasions under existing law.  There is no doubt that the Minister's proposal worsens the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in his speech said that the distinction to be drawn in the Constitution between life and health is another major concern which would take away from doctors, from the country and from the House any right to deal with hard cases which will arise.  The Minister referred to there being a spectrum of concern, a spectrum of gravity at the point where the danger moves from one of health to one of life and he said that his concern had been expressed to him by doctors.  The Minister dismissed all that and reassured doctors that they will be able to do all they want.</P>
    <P>An eminent obstetrician in this country told me of a case which occurred under the old wording in which a woman with cancer of the uterus presented to a rural obstetrician who identified that she would need an operation and he then consulted his lawyer to see how he stood in relation to the existing pro-life amendment to the Constitution.  He was advised that he had serious difficulties and did not provide the treatment for the woman. <Col N="196" /> The woman then went to Britain and had an abortion and came back and had her treatment.  However, we do not know what further risk there was to her life in having an abortion which was not directly related to the treatment or what impact that had on the progress of her disease or on whether it might have presented a very real risk to her life.  These areas are extremely difficult as they are.  Inserting the additional amendment adds confusion. I would urge that it be removed. The amendment should be withdrawn and put aside or at least postponed.</P>
    <P>The other major amendment to the Supreme Court decision is the elimination of the possibility of medical intervention in the case of suicide.  I accept that the reasons given for this amendment are more substantial, in the context that none of us wishes to see anything done which would treat life lightly and we wish to the maximum reasonable extent possible to protect the life of the unborn and create a society that values, cherishes and protects life.  That is the kind of society I wish to create, but it does not mean that I have to turn my back on very real situations.  If we accept the Minister's proposal we will have turned our backs on the X case which led to all of this.  We have also turned our backs on not just one Lovett sister but on two Lovett sisters. The hard cases of which the Minister talked have occurred.  In the early part of his speech in relation to the entitlement of women to have medical intervention when necessary, he said:</P>
    <P>If there were to be only one case in one million, or even ten or more million, we would have to take account of it.</P>
    <P>I welcomed that affirmation of life but the theme did not remain central to the Minister's contribution.  There were very serious contradictions in the case put forward by the Minister yesterday.  In the past few years we have had public cases amounting to more than one in a million. How could the Minister say that, and then turn his back on the consequences of confusion as a result, due to doctors having to make sure that they only <Col N="197" /> treated women at the point where gravity had moved to life threatening rather than life shortening.  It is asking too much and doctors will inevitably err on the side of being cautious.</P>
    <P>The Minister now seems to believe that this general right to life excludes women dying from delayed medical treatment or suicide, and therefore the general concern which the Minister expressed at the beginning of his speech and which most of us welcomed rings very hollow indeed.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the outline of the PD position on the issue I do not want to make political capital as they are obviously finding this very difficult.  One has to admire the frankness with which Deputy Harney has shown how difficult they find this but I do not know how they can stand over the extraordinary political gyrations when they can identify such fundamental flaws in the proposed amendments.  I cannot understand how they can risk the passage of such unsafe wording by putting such a flawed wording to the public.  Deputy O'Malley was part of the Government responsible for the amendment in 1983 and I welcome the fact that on this occasion, unlike the Minister, he has learned that this area is one where there can be no absolutes.  This is a fundamentally complex area where there are two interconnected lives, it is never going to be simple and it is uniquely female.  Anybody who tries to ascribe certainties to it is not learning from previous mistakes and is playing the most serious games with the lives of women.</P>
    <P>I share the view of Minister Harney that the appropriate way to deal with this is to forget this amendment and proceed with the amendments on travel and information on which there is substantial agreement in this House.  We should then look to see how we can make this a genuinely pro-life society.  We must look to see why, with our high moral tone, with our strong commitment to religion we still have such large numbers of women of all ages going abroad to seek abortions. We must see what we can do to change that and support women in such crises so that more of them can carry on <Col N="198" /> with their pregnancies.  That would be far more valuable work.</P>
    <P>While there is a variety of views in Fine Gael, we all believe that this amendment is so flawed that some say it should be postponed, many others say that it should be dropped, and that we should proceed with legislation alone or legislation prior to a referendum as a far more appropriate way of dealing with this complex issue.  I urge the Government to consider these appeals.  The view on all sides of the House, including the Government side is that their approach to the Twelfth Amendment is completly wrong, that they should seriously think again and withdraw the current proposal.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a very brief statement on this legislation.  I am totally opposed to holding a referendum especially at this time. I am opposed to it on the grounds that this is being rushed through the Dáil as can be seen by the number of Deputies on my side of the House who are anxious to make a contribution.  They have a perfect right to do so and to be given ample time to put their point of view, but they are not being given that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the manner in which this is being foisted on the people and the manner in which it has been presented. They are not being given a clear choice about whether they are for abortion or not.  The proposal being put before the people is a choice between limited and liberal abortion.  That is an insult to people who are totally opposed to this and who have a perfect right to that viewpoint. I am opposed to abortion in any shape or form.  It is wrong and cannot be condoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be something radically wrong in a society where 4,000 women and young girls found it necessary last year to leave this country for an abortion. A pregnancy outside marriage can happen in any family.  It can happen quite naturally when a couple are keeping company. That is when the family's strength counts and that girl is supported by the family through that difficult circumstance. Obviously people are <Col N="199" /> reneging on their responsibilities to educate and advise young people.  Far be it from me to preach or lay down any doctrine but I think the Churches, all of them, have been sadly lacking in their duty in that regard.  There is a trend towards social liberation in this country now as witnessed on our television screens every night at an early hour when young people are watching.  Young people believe that this is the way of life. They get into these difficulties and then they are abandoned.  It is sad, but abortion is not the solution.  That only adds to the problems.  Abortion is not the way to deal with the problem.  If abortion is wrong in this country it is wrong outside it.  In that regard, I take on board the contributions of the Progressive Democrats. I am amazed that they are being browbeaten into standing behind the Government with regard to these proposals. Deputy Quill stated at the weekend that she will be voting No on this issue in her polling booth in Cork.  I say to Deputy Quill that if it is wrong in Cork it is wrong in Leinster House and let her come and explain that to the people in this country.</P>
    <P>I am also annoyed at the Government's attitude to this referendum which is only being put to the people to create confusion and distract them from other issues that are affecting people and causing the effects that led to the need for this referendum. I mean the loss of jobs, the problems young couples have meeting their commitments and the problems of families with children in third level education who cannot come up with the necessary finance to support them.  These young people are at third level institutions with hardly any money in their pockets, hardly enough to pay for their digs and their upkeep.  This can only lead to difficulties.</P>
    <P>I must also ask the Minister of State why this referendum is being held on a Thursday.  Why not give the young people who will have to live with this legislation an opportunity of saying Yes or No to these proposals?  Many of them will be at third level institutions away <Col N="200" /> from their homes and will not be able to travel home between the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.  Why is the referendum not being held on a Friday, or preferably on a Saturday, when all those young people will be at home in their constituencies and able to give their opinion through the ballot box as they are entitled to do? They are being denied that opportunity. They are being denied it for some particular reason that Fianna Fáil are afraid of.  It is wrong.  That is not democracy in operation.  It is not too late yet.  Everybody is opposed to 3 December as being too soon.  Let it be left over until the spring and choose a date at a weekend when those young people are at home.</P>
    <P>It may be all right for me to pronounce on it.  My time rearing a family is over, thank God.  The people who will be pronouncing on this will not be personally affected.  They will be legislating on something that will affect coming generations and young people are not being given an opportunity to have a say.</P>
    <P>There are a number of flaws in this.  I do not want to take from the time of Deputies Belton and Harte so I will conclude by saying that this is wrong, that it is not too late to step back.  It is doing untold damage.  I am saying to my supporters and the people who come to me that they should vote No on this issue, rebuke the Government and show them for what they are trying to do.  This referendum is an insult to the intelligence of the people.  It is not acceptable and we as an elected body must reject it if we are to show any example to the people out there who are obviously looking for leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This referendum was proposed as a result of the X case.  Up to that time quite a few politicians in this House were satisfied with the Constitution as it stood.  Listening to the Progressive Democrats speak about the difficult situation they now find themselves in, I wonder do they think about the difficult situation in which politicians found themselves in 1983.  I was not there at that time but I have heard that politicians in this House were branded as <Col N="201" /> being soft on abortion.  As a result of all that, Fianna Fáil now find themselves in a very awkward political situation.  They were very certain in 1983 and were very accommodating to groups that they thought would be of political benefit to them.  Now they find themselves in Government and, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in a very difficult situation.  They had no choice but to put this issue forward out of political expedience, just as they have done in the past.</P>
      <P>My party have advocated that more time be made available to discuss the substantive issue.  I do not think anyone would quarrel with the suggestion that there should be the right to travel and that provision should be made for this in the Constitution of any civilised society or democracy.  I also welcome the amendment dealing with the right to information. It would be a step in the right direction if a woman who finds herself in stressful circumstances or in a crisis could avail of an opportunity to have consultations and receive advice.</P>
      <P>Some people dread what this referendum could mean in relation to the health of a woman.  Women are entitled to feel this way.  Indeed, I would feel the same way if a provision was to be written into the Constitution which would dictate what should be done in relation to my health in a given situation.  I believe the Government have been too political, too slap-dash and in too much of a hurry to get the issue out of the way.  We cannot deal with these matters in that way because there is too much at stake &mdash; women's health and the wellbeing of society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything that has to be said in this debate has been said at this stage.  However I would like to ask the Government, <i>quo vadis</i>, where they are going.  In 1983, when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they had all the answers and they made life hell for Deputies like myself who were conscientiously trying to find a solution to prevent abortions being carried out on the island of Ireland. Unless people lined up with those who had lost their heads and had become <Col N="202" /> highly emotional in some way they were considered suspect.  I should say that the Fine Gael Party which I was born into, which I supported as a young man and have spent half my life serving as a Dail Deputy are not now, never have been and never will be an abortionist party.  I have absolute confidence in the present leadership and membership of the party that I have the honour to represent.</P>
      <P>This debate is not about who is in favour of abortion.  I recognise that members of the Fianna Fáil Party are as anti-abortion as I am and that the same is true of members of other parties in this House.  What we are trying to do is prevent abortions being carried out in this country because abortion is wrong and cannot be defended.  It is not right to take the life of an unborn; that is wrong in all its forms.  However it is equally wrong that a mother should die because her only crime was to have become pregnant. It makes little or no difference whether that woman is the mother of a young family or a teenager if her life is threatened and that is the dilemma we are faced with.  How do we find laws to protect a woman in that situation?</P>
      <P>The argument that is being made outside the House and which has influenced the Fianna Fáil Party, but not the other parties, is that the best way to deal with this matter is to hold a referendum.  There appears to be an argument, however, over whether we are right to proceed by way of a referendum rather than by way of legislation in this House.</P>
      <P>During the past few months I have had many friendly conversations with people who hold the view that the abortion issue has to be settled by way of referendum. I could only conclude, however, that they were so obsessed with the argument as to whether the matter should be dealt with by way of a referendum rather than by way of legislation that they lost sight of the real issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider not what may happen in the future but what happened in the past.  In 1861, the Offences Against the Persons Act was introduced in Westminster. This was the law which prohibited abortion on the island of Ireland and it is <Col N="203" /> still on our Statute Book.  For some reason or other there were people in 1983 who got the idea that a referendum should be held to copperfasten the position and they were not prepared to trust the people they had elected to Dáil Éireann.  In 1861, Westminster was anything but Catholic and was certainly not influenced by Irish thinking but it had Christians of denominations other then Roman Catholic who found a wording that would prohibit abortion for 130 years on the island of Ireland or, as happened, until the law was called into question as a result of the wording of the 1983 referendum.  The Supreme Court passed its judgment on that wording in the context of the X case and it now seems that it made the wrong judgment rather than that the people made the wrong law.</P>
    <P>I have heard some of the finest speeches that I have heard in my 30 odd years in this House during the course of this debate.  I congratulate the members of my own party who have spoken and, I congratulate Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Harney in particular.  I would also like to congratulate Deputy Howlin of the Labour Party and Deputy De Rossa, Leader of Democratic Left.  While I would not agree with everything they said it is clear that they had given deep thought to this issue and were sincere and sympathetic.  I am sure there are many in Fianna Fáil who could articulate the same thoughts and feelings but for some reason they have refrained from doing so because they are more influenced by popular opinion and by extremists who believe that the answer lies only in a referendum.</P>
    <P>There is no talk in the North of Ireland about abortion: the law that was enacted in Westminster in 1861 is still on the Statute Book in that part of the island. Neither was there any talk about abortion here until 1983 but since then everything has gone wrong.  I am sure that some lawyer in the future will drill holes in the proposed amendments to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Let me ask a few pertinent questions. What kind of society would we have if <Col N="204" /> Great Britain decided that abortion should only be available to citizens of Great Britain?  What kind of society would we have if the 5,000 young women who go to Great Britain each year for abortions wanted to have abortions here? How would we cope with such a problem? My own view as I have stated already is that abortion is wrong.</P>
    <P>Long before it became a major issue of debate on this part of the island I counselled a young woman who was pregnant and talking of abortion.  Having advised her that abortion was wrong I suggested that she see her doctor.  After speaking to her doctor she went to a nursing home in Belfast and had her baby which was adopted.  Everything was done as all of us would have wished.</P>
    <P>However, I often wondered how I would have felt if that girl had died as a result of continuing with her pregnancy, having taken the advice of the doctor and myself.  What right have I to tell a girl she should not have an abortion?  If a young pregnant lady comes to me I will counsel against abortion and advise her to see her obstetrician.  If she still has a problem she should consult her spiritual director and then make up her mind in the privacy of her home.  At that stage it is not my business or that of anybody else other than the members of her family, and if the decision taken is the wrong one it is they who will have to answer for it.</P>
    <P>On 5 January 1973 we had a referendum to remove from the Constitution the privileged position of the Catholic Church.  This was recommended by Cardinal William Conway and the entire Catholic Hierarchy.  It was also recommended by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, and by the leaders of every political party.  I would like to ask a very sobering question, have we really removed from our Constitution the privileged position of the Catholic Church? Have we really got it out of our system? If Irish unity is our ultimate desire, if we want to create a society in which all Irish people &mdash; Catholic, Protestant and dissenters &mdash; have equal citizenship, we must abide by civil laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> On many occasions I have listened to debates on radio and television and read statements in the press by well-intentioned people, including the clergy, who are continually confused as between the moral law and the civil law on abortion. Morally abortion is wrong, and I do not believe that my thinking in that regard will change.  However, the civil law must also be taken into account.  Regardless of the laws of the country in which I live, be it England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the USA or any part of Europe, my moral thinking will not change.  The clergy and people in high positions in the pro-life movement have unfortunately confused moral thinking on abortion with civil law, which is the responsibility of legislators. We have an obligation to prevent abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>I am convinced by the arguments in favour of legislation.  As Deputy Lenihan will appreciate, if Members from different parties disagree on any matter, the longer we talk about it the better chance there is of finding a solution.  That does not happen when people are asked to make a decision by way of referendum. No matter what the issue, a referendum is divisive.  Politicians are inclined to listen to the strongest lobby and to find the answers to placate that lobby.  They decide what is the safest way to travel.</P>
    <P>As well as being divisive, referenda can be very emotional, and in divisive and emotional situations the right answers can never be found.  Usually you end up destroying the very thing you set out to protect.  Deputy Lenihan knows that what I am saying is true, that the proper way to handle this matter is by way of legislation.  The proper way to proceed is to say to everyone who wants to prevent abortion let us all row in the one direction; let us stop the argument as to whether a referendum is the right way of dealing with the issue or whether it should be dealt with by way of legislation. That should not be the point of the argument. The real issue is how we introduce or strengthen laws that will prevent abortion on demand.  The Government is not facing that challenge.  Unfortunately the courageous speeches to which I have <Col N="206" /> referred are not being matched by courageous speeches from Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had all the answers in 1983. We could say to them now, you made life hell for us in 1983; you did everything but throw the kitchen sink at us and you did so to placate a popular vote, purely for political expediency.  We could accuse the Government of all those things and make life hell for them, but we are trying to be responsible.  The Government should listen to the voice of reason and postpone this referendum.  It will be divisive and will not solve the problem.  At the end of the day common sense should prevail and we could then face the challenge by bringing in proper and strong legislation.</P>
    <P>Between 1861 and 1992 &mdash; for 131 years &mdash; it was believed that abortion was illegal here.  However, we had the 1983 referendum and abortion became legal in 1992.  We talk about the privileged position of the Catholic Church, the ethos of the Catholic Church and the people in the pro-life movement &mdash; I do not say this in a critical way &mdash; who are all prominent, good living, Catholic people, but it is strange that laws introduced by a parliament that was not Catholic or Irish, which kept abortion off the streets of Dublin and out of Irish society for 131 years, were changed by a Catholic Parliament and a Catholic people.  The referendum was held to prevent abortion but we destroyed what we set out to protect.  That was a strange conclusion, but I suppose fact is stranger than fiction.</P>
    <P>In a final plea to the Government I would ask them to listen to the voice of reason from the Opposition benches and proceed by way of legislation rather than referendum.  We will then explain the decision to those people who desire a referendum rather than legislation.</P>

      <P>The amendment dealing <Col N="207" /> with the right to travel reiterates a basic human right and the wording puts this matter beyond any about which may have arisen because of the Supreme Court decision in the X case.  The amendment relating to freedom of information on services lawfully available in another State is another freedom which can be regulated by domestic law.  For these reasons this House &mdash; and the people &mdash; should not have any difficulty in approving Amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</P>
      <P>The real debate arises on Amendment No. 12 which proposes to amend Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution which guarantees an equality of life to the unborn child and the mother.  Amendment No. 12 is designed to make lawful the termination of pregnancy &ldquo;where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction&rdquo;.  As the Minister for Justice said yesterday: &ldquo;the only acceptable test is whether the action is necessary to save the life of the mother&rdquo;.  This is a clear, straightforward proposition, which should be written into the Constitution in plain, unambiguous terms.  I support the Government on the principle of putting it into the Constitution rather than engaging in the tortuous exercise of complex legislation.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the exclusion of the risk of self-destruction because of the obvious abuse of this threat being widely used as an excuse for abortion.  In the X case, with which we are all familiar, the Supreme Court could, on the evidence, have found in favour of the appellant on the basis of the right to travel without getting into the straitjacket of stretching the evidence to give judgment on the basis of threatened suicide.  I cannot understand why the Supreme Court did not make their decision solely on the basis of the right to travel; to date I have not heard a satisfactory explanation as to why they did not find on that simple basis, which would have avoided the arguments since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commonsense should be the currency of law makers like ourselves seeking to ask the people to incorporate a practical <Col N="208" /> principle into their Constitution.  We are really talking about the risk to the life of the mother and the only people who can decide that matter are the medical practitioners in the particular case, on its merits, and in the circumstances of each situation as it presents itself to the medical practitioner involved.  That is the way it has always worked, the way it works now and the way, I hope, it will always work.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact of life that variations in regard to illness and disorder arising from a pregnancy are infinite and personal to each case.  The risks are relative and differ in nature and scale from person to person and from day to day.  There are not any absolutes and it is wrong to import absolute judgments into this area. The only real absolute &mdash; if you want to use one &mdash; is the application of high integrity and compassion by the medical profession in dealing with each individual case, on which we are reliant.  We have always relied on the medical practitioner's adherence to a principled and compassionate approach and that is the way it should be in future.  We are politicians, not theologians or medical experts.  In this amendment, having established the humane principle of termination of pregnancy on risk to the life of the mother, we should then leave the matter to be decided by the doctors within the framework of medical ethics.  For this reason &mdash; I hope I have explained my position &mdash; I have grave doubts about the inclusion in the Amendment of the five words: &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; because it sets up a contra distinction between health and life which is confusing to lawyers and doctors and unworthy as far as women are concerned.  The words do not serve any useful purpose and are superfluous in the Amendment which is concerned only with risk to life.  It adds an unnecessary and confusing dimension to an otherwise almost perfect wording.</P>
    <P>The contra distinction between health and life is already causing bewilderment to doctors who will have to interpret it, sometimes in emergencies and in an environment which is becoming increasingly litigious as far as the medical profession <Col N="209" /> are concerned.  One has only to think about it for a few minutes to appreciate the incongruities, contradictions and paradoxes.  What is the difference between life and health?  Life is health and health is life.  Where is the line between one and the other?  Where does the risk to health end and the risk to life begin?  In any medical condition there is a spectrum of gravity and it is impossible to identify a precise point at which the risk changes from a risk to health to a risk to life.  In situations of that kind one must rely on the integrity, compassion and professionalism of the the medical practitioners involved in the case.</P>
    <P>I agree with the medical opinion which has been expressed by eminent medical people in recent days that the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could have the effect of restricting a certain flexibility which exists under current medical practice where doctors are permitted to exercise it in the best interests of their patients.  Potentially, this phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; could result in a regression from the present medical practice in regard to the treatment of women in pregnancy.  I am sure that nobody in this House wants that to happen.</P>
    <P>In the general debate loose phrases like &ldquo;direct&rdquo; or &ldquo;indirect abortion&rdquo; have been used and there have been questions in relation to whether termination is intentional or unintentional, advertent or inadvertent.  However, none of these phrases is consistent as they mean various things to different people.  None of those phrases mean anything in law or in fact. They are meaningless also in a constitutional sense, yet they are being tossed around by various people in this debate like snuff at a wake.</P>
    <P>The only reality in the whole issue is the risk to the life of the mother.  Where that is endangered the amendment proposes in a general sense that the pregnancy can be terminated.  The phraseology should be kept simple and addressed just to that reality.  We propose to permit termination in circumstances in which there is a risk to life.  The medical profession on medical criteria should be <Col N="210" /> the sole judges, in consultation with the mother, as to whether a termination should take place on that basis.  That does not make the issue complicated for us as legislators.  It enables us to put a straightforward, unambiguous amendment to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment we seek to deal in a humane way with the risk to the life of the mother and allow for a termination in those circumstances if it is so decided by the doctor.  That is simplicity itself. It will be completely understood by the people and, in my view, it will secure an overwhelming majority.</P>
    <P>I therefore suggest to the Minister that at the conclusion of the passage of the Bill he consider the deletion from the amendment before the House of the five words I have mentioned, &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;.  I am supporting the Amendment in principle.  I agree with the principle involved in the holding of a referendum but I would much prefer a clear and more concise formulation that is only concerned with the risk to life and the assessment of that risk by the medical profession.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Justice was faced with a mammoth task in trying to balance the conflicting opinions of the contending <Col N="211" /> parties on the most serious question of abortion.  Those views vary from the outright demand for abortion of Democratic Left to the extreme pro-life contenders on the other side of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>Following the decision in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case the Government had no option but to put the issues, namely, the right to travel, the right to information on abortion and the substantive issue of abortion, before the Irish people for decision.  The holding of referenda is the correct course of action because under our Constitution the people are the final arbiters on all questions of national importance.  The issues involved are of the utmost national importance for our people and for future generations.</P>
    <P>The question of the right to travel is not in contention.  We all accept that no self-respecting democracy could deny that right.  The right to information is a little more contentious and will be carefully monitored by all.  Some of the contention concerns the substantive issue of abortion and whether it should be available as a remedy for any malady that might occur in a pregnant woman.</P>
    <P>Since the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case made termination of the foetal human life available without limit within the jurisdiction the law of the land has been at variance with the wishes of a great majority of the people as expressed in the 1983 referendum.  It is necessary, therefore, to correct that variance and restore the <i>status quo</i> ante the X case decision.</P>
    <P>The achievement of that result involves a problem of profound magnitude and complexity.  On the one hand the life of the unborn must be protected by law and, on the other, the life of the mother must be equally protected.  Those two positions must be reconciled.  Several points come into play in that regard, of which, it is clear, the Government have taken due note.  The four leading professors of gynaecology here signed a statement which declares that there is no know situation in which only abortion can be used as a remedy to treat a pregnant woman. Other means are available which in the <Col N="212" /> long run achieve a better result for women because although a woman's ailment may be healed after an abortion it is better to avoid the psychological trauma and scars associated with abortion.</P>
    <P>All are agreed that circumstances arise when a pregnancy, if it continued, would definitely put the life of a woman at risk. Ectopic pregnancy and cancer of the cervix are two examples of conditions which may give rise to such circumstances. Those two conditions, and a handful of other conditions similar to them, require treatment for a woman &mdash; that is, treatment necessary to save her life &mdash; that will invariably result in the loss of the life of the foetus.  Better that one should be saved than both should perish.  So far as I am aware, there is no objection on any grounds to the provison of that treatment.  The distinction clearly drawn between life and health in the wording of the Amendment is based on the soundest and most up to date medical knowledge available.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I call on all who have the welfare of future generations of Irish people at heart to support the proposed wording and allow the right to life of the unborn to flourish in this land.  This would correct a position at variance with the Ireland with which Fianna Fáil, and the majority of Irish people, feel comfortable. I again appeal to all men and women of good will to support the referenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a person of good will but I would not agree with the previous speaker because at this stage of the debate most people outside the House are sick and tired of the torrents of words. They will certainly be very confused after we have all spoken.</P>
      <P>I am a little upset that a small, powerful and influential group of people have been able to hijack and debase the words &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo;. Those people are a very small, unrepresentative sector of our community but politicians have run scared from them in the past &mdash; more is the pity.  I have no intention of running scared today, no more than I did not ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> In 1983 Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were railroaded into holding a referendum. That was rather foolish.  The late Frank Cluskey, then leader of the Labour Party, told them he would not agree to that but he was the only one of the three party leaders who did not cave in to the blackmail. It was a great pity to have that divisive referendum in 1983, which did nothing for our country.  That referendum was a big mistake in that it follows a most narrow, divisive and abstract debate which did nothing to cast any reason or light on this complex issue.</P>
    <P>The same thing is happening now.  A small group of people have an obsession with unborn life but, as far as I can tell, show no concern for those who have been born and the quality of life of the living. People who are genuinely pro-life are concerned about issues such as unemployment, poverty, emigration and Third World countries.  They are concerned with the fact that as we speak women are dying in childbirth in Third World countries.  Far too many women die in childbirth there and nobody in this part of the world seems to worry unduly about that.  Quality of life is as important as life itself.  Famine and starvation throughout the world are on all sides of us and people do not seem to worry about that.  That type of life does not seem to bother people; neither does the fact that we have young people sleeping rough in Dublin, London and New York.</P>
    <P>We have heard much in this debate about protecting the family and much sanctimonious hypocrisy and claptrap were used about this also.  My mother came from County Clare.  She was one of 15 children, 14 of whom emigrated to America.  I do not see much evidence of protection for the family or family life and for those who had to emigrate.  I know something about emigration and unemployment as I have experienced both.</P>
    <P>How does one qualify to be regarded as pro-life in our society?  Is it by talking constantly and using the words &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo;? Does that qualify one to be called a &ldquo;pro-lifer&rdquo;?  Is it by working in areas with people who are unemployed, who <Col N="214" /> are under-privileged and who are badly off?  I would regard people who have a track record, working for people and trying to improve the quality of their lives as pro-life.  They are not just proclaiming they are pro-life: actions speak louder than words in this and other areas.  People show concern for people by their work, activities and by their track record rather than just speaking about pro-life in an abstract, artificial way.  We must try to help the weaker sections of our society to lead a decent life and to have a decent quality of life.</P>
    <P>Too many of the so called pro-life people have a negative rather than a positive attitude to this whole question.  They pray for peace with words and formulae rather than life itself.  We have heard words and various terms being used in this debate but nothing has been done to solve the problem of abortion in our society or in other societies.  Words in themselves will solve nothing whatsoever. In this debate words are being used to evade and skirt around the real issues rather than tackle those issues. People inside and outside this House are deluding themselves into believing that the issue of abortion can be solved if they put a hypocritical and deficient form of words before this House and if these words are carried by a majority of the Members of this House.  This belief is an evasion of truth and an evasion of reality. Passing this formula of words in this House will do nothing whatsoever to stop Irish women from having abortions if they wish to have them and could, in fact, do considerable damage and harm if interpreted in a very narrow way, as is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>The exercise we are engaging in now will solve nothing and is an evasion of the hard cases, as they have been so called. No amount of hammering or pious platitudes, inside or outside this House, can tackle this situation.  The hard cases I have described will not go away and we cannot run away from them.  If we are honest with ourselves as public representatives we must confront those hard cases and other cases as well.  Our party and the Labour Party have a united <Col N="215" /> approach to this issue.  We have tried to confront the issue in an open, honest way and put forward a form of words that will improve, rather than hinder, the present situation.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by many speakers the Consititution is an imprecise, imperfect way of dealing with this issue.  The Constitution is a framework, a guide to life and it guarantees rights for our people.  It was never designed to deal with this complex matter before the House.  It cannot be dealt with as though it were black or white, as has been presented here today.  We politicians have been presented as if we were somewhat like national gate people controlling sluice gates keeping certain things out of our society.  That is a wrong way of looking at our job.</P>
    <P>Our job is to legislate for people here and now and to improve the quality of life in our country; we are not a kind of moral gate people as some people think. In any case, life is not like that.  We live in a different world now, a world of communications, where people have rights to travel and rights to information. We cannot turn the clock back 20, 30 or 50 years.  Ireland is not the world.  We are a very small country with a very small population.  The Bills before the House will not change anything in the big world outside and neither will they change much in this country.  Fianna Fáil are trying to have it both ways.  They are as cute as they have always been and they are too cute by half on this occasion by kicking to touch on a most complex and difficult issue.</P>
    <P>The referendum is a mistake and should not be held.  The wording of the Twelfth Amendment is flawed.  It can only be a matter of time before this issue and the wording of the Amendment will be challenged in the courts and will come before this House once again.  I believe we have wasted an opportunity to do some good for our people.  As it stands, the words in the Twelfth Amendment are illegal and a medical minefield.  You will find that my words will come to pass. Next time around &mdash; there certainly will <Col N="216" /> be a next time &mdash; let us hope we will do better.</P>
    <P>I regard this debate as a lost opportunity, a lost chance for us to have done better by far.  I have listened carefully to many people who have contributed to the debate, including the Progressive Democrats, who should not be let off the hook. They have the opportunity to challenge this in a positive way by voting against it. They have wasted that opportunity and have dodged and funked it.  So far as I am concerned, this whole debate has been a waste of time and money.  It is nothing more than a monument of bogus punditary and more is the pity.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole issue in relation to the life and health of pregnant women falls into a number of different areas.  It has a moral dimension, a civil rights dimension and a health dimension. The first question that arises is whether a woman has a civil right to life and health and, indeed, in the context of public morality she has a moral right to her life and health.  Law must concern itself with the balance between the rights of the individual and the common good.  In the context of the life and health of the woman, what constitutes the common good?  Central to this issue is how the life and health of women relate to the common good. There appears to be virtual unanimity in this House on the matter of the civil rights of the woman to her life where there is a real and substantial risk to her life during pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medical procedures necessary to save her life would be lawful if the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution is made by the people.  However, the Labour Party have difficulties in regard to the inclusion of the word &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  The Labour Party would submit that the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;save&rdquo;.  The protection of the life of a woman, as distinct from saving her life, must surely be the superior concept in relation to the civil and moral right to life of the pregnant woman.  The word &ldquo;save&rdquo; has the connotation of dealing <Col N="217" /> with an imminent crisis while the word &ldquo;protect&rdquo; would allow for the appropriate treatment at an earlier stage which would, is some instances at least, prevent possible long-term damage to the health of the woman.  This raises the distinction between what exactly is meant by health as distinct from the life of the mother.  Where is the cut-off point between what the Amendment contemplates as the life of the mother and the health of the mother?  What are the specific guidelines in relation to this?  Is such a distinction either possible or desirable?</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that there are no certainties in medical matters.  Whether the life or the health of the mother is at risk in particular circumstances is very much a matter of opinion.  Therefore, should the pregnant woman in a civilised society be exposed to this type of danger? The Labour Party are a pro-life party in all the many manifestations of that concept.  Unfortunately, for all legislators the issue which we are discussing brings us to making judgments and decisions where the options are all, to some extent, distasteful.  This should not deter us from taking the right decisions without fear or favour bearing in mind the human and civil rights factors involved.  When the options are all undesirable then the integrity and value of Dáil Éireann is tested. If we do not act effectively to protect the life and health of pregnant women, we will have betrayed the mandate given us by the people who elected us and, in particular, by women.</P>
    <P>With regard to the protection of the life and health of pregnant women, the medical treatment to be carried out must at the end of the day, following medical advice, be the choice of the woman.  She should be supported by comprehensive counselling and medical advice on the one hand and her partner on the other. The key word is &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;, and this compassion must be free from doctrinaire positions of whatever hue.</P>
    <P>When there is a real and substantial risk to the life or health of the mother, then the necessary protective treatment should not be withheld.  This is an area <Col N="218" /> which requires legislation as distinct from constitutional amendments.  The Constitution is a document which essentially states principles.  An issue as complex and individual as abortion requires different and more comprehensive treatment.  No two cases are the same, and we need legislation which is comprehensive enough to embrace all contingencies where there is a real and substantial risk to the life or health of the mother.  There are those who say that politicians cannot be trusted on this issue.  I find such remarks offensive.  The people gave us a mandate and entrusted us with putting in place legislation which essentially protects individual rights and promotes the common good.</P>
    <P>Whereas the Labour Party have problems with the amendments in relation to travel and information and will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage, there is widespread agreement on these issues in the House.  The issue of information is very basic.  With regard to women who travel abroad to have an abortion, there is an enormous obligation on all of us.  I am referring to the Members of his House, the Members of the Seanad, public representatives of whatever hue and all the organisations who campaign on this issue from whatever point of view.  We must create a caring environment which provides all the supports necessary, including easy access to the very best counselling and medical advice.  This would lead to a reduction in the number of women travelling abroad to have abortions.  How many of the women who travel abroad to have abortions do so feeling abandoned and alone and are acting out of panic?</P>
    <P>We must adopt a caring attitude and look at the problems surrounding this issue.  As I said earlier, the options in this area are distasteful; there is no option which will get us out of difficulty.  We must have the courage and compassion to ensure that the civil rights of women are protected.</P>
    <P>I believe the protection of a woman's health and life should be the central issue. This issue is not properly addressed in these amendments: in fact, the health <Col N="219" /> aspect is not catered for at all.  This is an unfortunate line to follow and one which I believe we will regret taking.  Because of the way they are drafted, these amendments will very shortly be back before the courts of the land and this issue could very well return to this House at a later stage.  Like Deputy Kemmy, I believe that in many ways this debate has been a waste of time.  As I said, we should introduce legislation. This is the only appropriate way to deal with such a sensitive, comprehensive and difficult issue.</P>

      <P>I thank my Labour Party colleagues for sharing their time with Deputy Gilmore and me.  In the immediate wake of the X case in February of this year it was apparent that there was a collective and resolute will among all Members of this House to deal with the issues and problems thrown up by that unfortunate case.  I think there was almost an expectancy among all of us that the Government were going to take speedy and decisive action to legislate so that that type of case could never happen again during our time.  It is greatly regretted that that vast potential and the real consensus which was emerging has been squandered and thwarted by the Government through their actions over the past few days in respect of the legislation before the House.  What the Government are now proposing has, if we listen to the Progressive Democrats <Col N="220" /> Deputies and to what Deputy Lenihan had to say, left many Deputies on that side of the House and on this side of the House in very great difficulties.  I will deal with these briefly.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that a pregnancy can only be terminated to save the life as distinct from the health of the mother. Apart from the huge uncertainty for women and doctors in trying to understand and interpret that concept, the very thinking behind it is offensive and anti-life. The right to life as we understand it in our Constitution is not just a right to survive; it involves a right to a healthy and vibrant life.  It seeks to guarantee a living person the means and capacity to enjoy life and actively participate in it. In the X case in the Supreme Court Mr. Justice O'Flaherty put the matter extremely well in his judgment and I quote:</P>
      <P>Can it be that a Constitution which requires the State to look to the economic needs of mothers is unconcerned for the health and welfare and happiness of mothers?  I am certain that reading the Constitution as a whole, as I believe one must do, then the answer is clearly not.  A broad dimension must be given to the Constitution and a narrow or pedantic approach to its provisions has to be put aside.</P>
      <P>This judge, who is often regarded as conservative in his view and interpretation of the Constitution recognises the essential ingredient of happiness, of people's right not just to life but also the right to be able to actively enjoy that life.  Attempting to define a difference between the life as opposed to the health of a woman is divisive and unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where medical opinion is that a woman's life or health is at a substantial risk from a continued pregnancy, then abortion &mdash; and I say this unequivocally &mdash; should be an option available to her. In this context of health, I have no hesitancy in including the concept of a threat to health as presented by suicide.  I utterly and totally fail to accept the Government's line of thinking that in dealing with the health of a woman one can <Col N="221" /> exclude the threat of suicide as a health concept.  It defies all reasoning to say we are legislating to protect the health of a woman while saying that suicide cannot be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating abortion on demand as other Deputies and myself on this side have been accused of when we have sought the reasoning behind the Government proposals.  To suggest that what we are talking about is abortion on demand is both offensive to women and to the medical profession generally.  It suggests that women here cannot be trusted to respect their motherhood or, indeed, that beautiful capacity of bearing children to full term.</P>
    <P>The Government are insulting women and the medical profession by suggesting the right to consider a threat to women's health amounts to seeking abortion on demand.  That insult, for what it is worth, is also an insult to women and the medical profession in England.  We must not forget that more than 4,000 women &mdash; I believe the figure is much closer to 5,000 &mdash; travel to Britain each year to terminate unwanted pregnancies.  The regime in that country is subject to the same Hippocratic oath and constraints in legislation which apply elsewhere to regulate circumstances in which abortion is available. To suggest that that amounts to abortion on demand is devoid of any reasoning and is insulting to the medical profession and to the women of that country, as it would be to those at home who seek to deal with a very difficult problem here.</P>
    <P>The facilities which we, as legislators, and the people are asked to endorse by the proposals in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution do not go far enough.  When we speak of the right to life and to enjoyment of that life, are we not also obliged to have consideration for the lives and rights of existing children in families?  Have they not got a right to the enjoyment of a healthy mother?  What good is a mother to her children if she is in a coma?  Equally, what good is it if as in the case of Mrs. Hodgers, who survivied the pregnancy for two days but inevitably died.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> In regard to the Supreme Court decision in the X case, the tragic circumstances which led to that decision must not be forgotten.  Those facts have been well rehearsed in this House over the past two days.  It must be put clearly on the record that every Member in the House was relieved when the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court which sought to restrain and imprison a 14-year old girl in this country until her child was delivered.  That 14-year old girl who was raped and impregnated was ordered by the High Court to stay for the full nine months within the confinement of her home, if not of the State, until she delivered her child.  I am waiting to hear one Member of this House say publicly that is what he or she would have wished.  We were all relieved when the Supreme Court reversed the decision.  That court delivered a judgment which was well reasoned and basically fair in its conclusions.  It said that the girl whose life was threatened was entitled to have that pregnancy terminated; she was entitled to an abortion and the court did not interfere with her right to travel to England.  One may ask why she did not have the abortion here.  One wonders if she did.</P>
    <P>I was particularly annoyed, therefore, in the days leading up to this debate and during it, to hear Members in some way criticising the Supreme Court for their ruling and suggesting that they took us by surprise by delivering an incomprehensible decision.  Anyone who argues that the ruling was unacceptable is being grossly dishonest because we were all relieved at the fair decision.  The judgment stated that in circumstances where the life of a woman is threatened by a pregnancy there should be available to the woman the right to opt to end that pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court also said that as long as we have a Constitution which recognises the right to life of a woman there can never be an absolute ban on abortion in our law.  To the extent that the Minister for Justice has accepted that proposition, challenged the so-called pro-life camp on this gross misstatement <Col N="223" /> and centred on the propaganda which they would like to see permeating this debate, he must be congratulated.  The Minister has recognised that there cannot be an absolute ban on abortion in our administration or in our law.  He recognises the fact that where a Constitution is charged with protecting the life of a woman in certain circumstances an occasion may arise when that act of protection must necessarily involve the termination of the foetus.  Therefore, I am disappointed that having accepted the basic principle laid down in the Supreme Court judgment the Minister abandoned the final conclusion of the court's ruling in that case, namely, when one came to deal with the health issue, suicide was a factor to be considered.</P>
    <P>The question of the right to travel is being glossed over.  Most Deputies consider the wording to be perfectly acceptable in the way it is couched and in what it purports to do.  Its overall role is ludicrous because it is the vehicle whereby we as legislators are saying to pregnant women who wish to terminate their pregnancy that they cannot do it at home but may go elsewhere to do so provided they have the money.  That provision is not everything it sets out to be when it is taken in context with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution &mdash; on the substantive issue &mdash; that a woman may become pregnant against her will and her health is not threatened by that pregnancy.  If she confides in her husband or her boyfriend that she intends to travel to England to terminate the pregnancy and the father seeks an injunction through the courts, the issue will be determined by the courts on balancing the right to life of the foetus and the right to parentage by the father against the woman's right to travel.  In regard to the manner in which our courts set rights in hierarchy and balance one against the other, I believe that the right and the duty of the court to protect the right to life of the foetus will prevail.  Indeed, I believe there is a strong argument to suggest that the right of a parent, of the husband or father, will also prevail over <Col N="224" /> the right of the woman to travel.  I am not satisfied that the writing into the Constitution of this provision, in the context of what is provided under the substantive issue, deals with the issue as absolutely as we believe or are led to believe it will.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters that clearly need to be adressed, dealt with and teased out.  I have absolutely no hesitation in saying, in this Chamber and elsewhere, that where a woman is raped or subjected to incest &mdash; which is rape in itself &mdash; and is impregnated, she must have the absolute right to terminate that pregnancy within a reasonable period of time.  It is an obscenity in the extreme to suggest to a woman, who is set upon against her will, impregnated by whatever blackguard and forced to carry an unwanted foetus, that she cannot have the option in her own right, and subject to consultation with her medical advisers, to terminate that offensive pregnancy.  I cannot understand how we, as legislators, cannot in all humanity provide for even that restricted situation.</P>
    <P>The answer, we are told, is that this right will open the door to abortion on demand.  I do not accept that concept; I am not an advocate of it, but I feel we have certainly no ground for arguing against it in the circumstances where we do not provide reasonable access to contraceptive devices and advice on contraception, where we do not provide any adequate or proper sex education in our curricula in schools, where we provide no public education programme through thd Departmennts of Health or Education in regard to fertility and family reproductive control, and particularly where we provide absolutely no State funded counselling or support services for women carrying an unwanted foetus. In those circumstances we have a total gall to say to women that they have no right to consider the option of abortion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is a total contradiction that we are providing this legislation for those women who have the means and the ability to travel abroad to terminate their unwanted pregnancies.  It is an incredible contradiction heaped upon <Col N="225" /> contradiction.  Those contradictions have destroyed a very real potential for consensus to act on this matter that was present in this House in February of this year.  The opportunity was not seized upon by the Government and has now, in fact, been destroyed by what the Government have produced over the last few days.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputies McCartan, Kemmy and O'Shea for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>Underlying this whole debate is a deep distrust of women, which I find repugnant, and which I think needs to be faced. There are two issues.  Should a woman be permitted to obtain in Ireland an abortion if her health is at risk?  Should she be permitted to obtain an abortion if her life is at risk from suicide?</P>
      <P>The Government says &ldquo;no&rdquo; to both of these questions because they claim that to allow women the freedom of choice in these circumstances, is to open the door to what they call &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What is meant by &ldquo;abortion on demand&rdquo;?  It is a term which will be used like a bludgeon between now and 3 December to down the arguments of those who oppose the Government's wording.  It has already been used by Government Ministers and even by the Taoiseach to castigate the proposals which were put forward by Democratic Left on this subject.  So what does the term mean?</P>
      <P>It is being suggested that Irish women will walk into hospitals like they would ramble into a hairdressers and order an abortion?  Do the Government really think that Irish women care so little about maternity and childbirth that their freedom must be restricted not only by legislation, but by force of the Constitution and even by the Treaty on European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the Government think that women will be claiming to have been raped, that they are suicidal?  Do they not realise that women think very seriously about the option of abortion, including women who ultimately decide to proceed with it?  Do they not know that women think very <Col N="226" /> seriously about abortion before they decide on that option?  What kind of attitude to women lies behind the thinking that such special laws must be made to govern one of the most personal and complex aspects of their human condition?</P>
    <P>It is argued that what is at issue here is fundamental &mdash; that this is an issue of life or death.</P>
    <P>I think Fintan O'Toole put this argument very well in his article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Wednesday, 14 October 1992:</P>
    <P>There is another characteristic sound of the pronouncements on abortion in the last few days.  It is the sound of air bubbles breaking the surface, of waves gently lapping over balding heads, of flailing arms thrashing the waters.  It is the sound of men who have wandered in past their depth, wearing the hob-nailed boots of political expediency that make them now too clumsy and heavy to turn around and come back again.  Men who can't deal with the things that are supposed to be their business, such as jobs and houses and hospitals, suddenly decided that they were up to dealing with nothing less than Life and Death.  They discovered their hidden depths and plunged straight into them.</P>
    <P>Why is it that the issue of life and death evokes such passion only when it relates to women and pregnancy?  Why is there no constitutional provision to protect the lives of travellers' children, whose lives are, if I may use the phrase, indirectly terminated by their appalling housing and living conditions?  Why is that the issue of direct or indirect killing is never raised in this context or in the context of war?  Did the refuelling of American planes at Shannon during the Gulf War lead to the indirect killing of babies in Baghdad?</P>
    <P>What I am questioning here is why it is that &ldquo;the right of life&rdquo; has become an issue only in relation to women?  What the Government are really saying in these measures is that they do not trust women. They do not trust women to make the judgment whether their health or lives are at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Human reproduction, fertilisation, pregnancy and childbirth are extremely complex interpersonal issues which do not readily lend themselves to constitutional definitions or regulations. They are sensitive matters which evoke all the range of human emotions, personal differences and diversity which exist between people.  It is difficult to envisage a less suitable subject for legalism or constitutional disputation.  Indeed it is extraordinary that someone or some group in our society have sought to deal with such a complex human question by way of constitutional provision or by a clumsy legalistic intrusion into the deeply personal world of human relationships.</P>
    <P>Since the inclusion in 1983 of Article 40.3.3 in our Constitution we have had considerable fear, shame and misery for pregnant Irish women and collective hypocrisy within Irish society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The courts have sought to abide by that constitutional provision with extraordinary consequences for many women, children and families.  It has made criminals of thousands of Irish women, has aggravated the dilemmas facing couples with unwanted pregnancies, disrupted the intimate doctor-patient relationship and generated a series of unnecessary legal disputes.  It has distorted natural human responses to pregnancy and overlaid them with taboos, recriminations and fear.  It has made sexual refugees of Irish women, made spies of patients in family planning clinics and revised the medical preoccupations of middle-aged power-brokers with sex and sexuality exerting control over women's bodies and rights. It has proven to be the most persistent source of intolerance and right wing reaction in the Irish Republic in recent years.</P>
    <P>Now we have a proposal from the Government to add new subsections to Article 40.3.3º in an effort to deal with perceived &ldquo;unacceptable circumstances&rdquo; arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the X case.  We are to have subsections on travel and information and the substantive issue of abortion. Each of these measures was a reaction to the one which went before and arose <Col N="228" /> from a refusal to go to the root of the problem and pull back from a misuse of constitutional law.  The new subsections seek not only to roll back the Supreme Court decision but to roll back the meaning of Article 40.3.3º itself on women's equal right to life.  It will open the door to even more litigation and fail to deal openly and honestly with the real and continuous problems of Irish women.</P>
    <P>The Constitution should not be used to superimpose a dogmatic principle on the health of women.  What is being done here is an insult to the integrity of women.  Some of the words which are used in these Bills are unique in this situation.  The term &ldquo;it shall be unlawful&rdquo; appears nowhere else in the Constitution except in the proposed wording of this Amendment.  The distinction between the life and health of the mother is unique not only in our Constitution but, I would suggest, in legislative provisions elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I take up the point raised by Deputy De Rossa this morning in connection with the way the ballot paper is to be titled.  It is proposed that the ballot papers will be in different colours and that each will have a separate title.  The ballot paper dealing with what is known as the substantive issue will be entitled &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo;.  It is an extraordinary decision to use that title since that term does not appear in the text of the proposed change to the Constitution.  The introduction of a title to the ballot paper, which will require an amendment to the 1963 Electoral Act, is an underhand attempt by the Government to introduce a bias in the ballot paper itself.  It is a form of political cuteness that should have no place in this entire issue.  There is general acceptance that the issue of abortion is politically sensitive because many people in our society hold different but genuine and deeply held views about it.  Those views should be respected.  What I think we are getting here is an attempt to sacrifice the health of women on the high altar of political cuteness.  It is, I submit, politically cute to title the ballot paper in a way which introduces a form of bias into the referendum process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Political cuteness is not entirely confined to the Government benches on this issue.  For several weeks I have been hearing people on all sides of the political divide stating that they want this issue dealt with by way of legislation, but I have heard very little about what would be in that legislation.  It is time for people who have been calling for legislation on this issue to state what they propose should be in that legislation.  It is time for this House, for politicians and people outside this House to stop being politically cute on the question of the health of women.</P>

      <P>It is not surprising that I should congratulate the Government on having fulfilled the commitment to hold a referendum on travel and information and to put forward a solution on the substantive issue.  The sceptics who predicted that this would not be possible or who doubted the Government's good faith have once again been confounded. The travel and information referenda have been broadly welcomed.  They also arise from the X case.  Interference with the freedom to travel is not acceptable in a modern democratic State.  There is also wide consensus that anyone who wishes to seek an abortion abroad should at least be given all the alternative options and non-directive counselling.  It would be ridiculous, however, if the people were to be consulted about these matters and not about the main issue of abortion. Such a strategy would run the risk of having a negative impact on the chances of success, particularly in regard to the information referendum.  The principle underlying the 1983 referendum was that the people would be consulted again if there was any question of legalising abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has arisen unexpectedly as a result of the Supreme Court judgment <Col N="230" /> in the X case and therefore it has to be addressed.  It would be a denial of democracy to allow the legalisation of abortion without consulting the people again.  We gave a very firm commitment before the vote on the Maastricht Treaty and we are now taking the correct and proper action.</P>
    <P>There are those on the Opposition benches who say that dealing with this matter by way of referendum has demonstrably failed.  I reject that argument. Abortion as a public policy issue was bound to have arisen in some form in the past ten years.  It has been deeply controversial and divisive in America, Britain, Germany and Italy.  Perhaps the best example is Belgium, where the King abdicated temporarily for 24 hours rather than sign the legislation passed in the Belgian Parliament.  We have to be able to grasp the nettle.  This the Government are doing in putting forward pragmatic and realistic proposals.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael should not be allowed to forget the key role they played in 1981 in the decision to have this issue dealt with originally by way of referendum.  Deputy Garret FitzGerald and the then Senator Gemma Hussey met members of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign on 30 April 1981 and gave them an instant pledge, without proper reflection as to whether this was the proper way to proceed.  It left us in Fianna Fáil with little choice but to give a similar commitment a few weeks later.  Unlike Fine Gael who had a cynical attitude to election pledges, considering that they could be forgotten or watered down once they had achieved their purpose, Fianna Fáil, back in Government in 1982, proceeded conscientiously to find a suitable wording in accordance with their pledge.</P>
    <P>When the first wording was published in November 1982 Deputy FitzGerald had it legally examined and made a public commitment to put it before the people before 31 March 1983.  Once again trying to go one better then us in Fianna Fáil, Deputy FitzGerald wrote to PLAC on 6 November as follows:</P>
    <P>The referendum will not be delayed <Col N="231" /> by any other consideration.  This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next election. </P>
    <P>A couple of months later Deputy FitzGerald, safely back in Government, backed away from this solemn commitment, with some legal cover provided by the then Attorney General, whose objections were dismissed by the late Deputy John Kelly, one of the country's foremost constitutional lawyers.  Legal queries are, of course, possible in relation to any law or constitutional provision that is subject to interpretation by the courts. Deputy FitzGerald's gross breach of faith with the electorate could not be stomached by several of his back benchers or by nearly half of the Labour Party who voted to ensure that the original 1982 wording chosen by Fianna Fáil was put to the people.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision in the X case has been very controversial.  It has not been accepted as being valid by many lawyers and it was not reasonably foreseeable. The question of suicide was not raised by the Attorney General or by anybody else in 1982-83.  The 1983 Amendment was based on the excellent principle of the equal right to life of the mother and of the unborn.  Few people, other than those who were openly looking for liberal abortion law, had challenged that principle.  The Supreme Court judgment in the X case requires us to further clarify this principle.  The Government have done that in a way that should be reassuring to mothers and pregnant women, removing any worries as to how the equal right to life principle should be interpreted in practice.</P>
    <P>The additional principle which is set out ensures that any pregnant woman who has a life-threatening condition will be given all the necessary treatment and that will be the case whatever the condition and whatever the recommended treatment.  Obviously, the doctor has an obligation, where possible, to ensure that a live child is born but there is no sense <Col N="232" /> in allowing both mother and the foetus to die for want of treatment.  While medical opinion is divided, there is sufficient weight of evidence to suggest that a termination may occasionally be required to save a woman's life.  This cuts across the direct-indirect distinction which is not a medical or legal distinction.  It could interfere with existing medical practice and introduce a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty for doctors, patients and the courts.  As the chairman of the Institute of Gynaecologists said in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 October, there is no consensus on the matter among the medical profession and this is not a black and white area.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I note a rather striking contradiction between the position of SPUC in Britain &mdash; who supplied most of the literature for the Irish Pro-Life Movement during the Maastricht campaign, as set out in last Saturday's <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; and SPUC here.  SPUC in Britain acknowledge that abortion to save the mother's life was legal before the Act and they do not dispute that it should be.  It seems that there is a serious difference of view between SPUC in Britain and the Irish branch as to what is realistically the right position to take. There is a folklore that goes back a long way with regard to women with cancer being told by priests or doctors that they may not be treated and that by implication they will be left to die.  Leaving people to die when they could be saved is not a great pro-life position.  Indeed, it is the opposite.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their proposal clearly repudiate that kind of inhumanity to the extent that it still persists.  The substance of the proposal is very pro-woman and represents a significant advance in terms of clarification of the position.  We have not bowed to pressures to use ideological language in this debate or in the proposal we will put to the people.  If this referendum is defeated we will not hold another with a different tougher wording. Either the referendum is passed or abortion will remain legal in cases where the woman claims to be suicidal with the backing of a psychiatric report.  All the <Col N="233" /> international evidence suggests that this would create a very dangerous loophole.</P>
    <P>While supporting the referendum, Fine Gael are asking for legislation.  I vigorously disagree with them.  There is no case for the legislators to come between the medical profession and the patient, and I detect little demand for legislation from the medical profession. Legislators cannot foresee all possible medical circumstances.  It is far better to leave it between the doctor and patient in accordance with clear general principles, than to establish or attempt to establish a maze of regulations.  Irish maternity hospitals have adequately dealt with this rather complex legal matter for many years in a realistic and intelligent way.</P>
    <P>If the Supreme Court, barring the question of suicide in Deputy FitzGerald's words, removed the ambiguity in the original wording, what possible objection could we have to incorporating the key passage in the Supreme Court judgment word for word into the Constitution?</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the distinction drawn with regard to health.  The distinction is drawn directly from the Supreme Court judgment which parties opposite appeared to approve.  If the clause is left out we could be faced with a Y case where the meaning of the term &ldquo;life&rdquo; is extended to include the quality of life, which is a nebulous concept which would require us in the future to hold yet another referendum on the subject.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Fine Gael, Labour or most representative groups are demanding that a health risk should be sufficient for termination of a pregnancy.  Are they familiar with the language of the 1967 aborton laws in England which permits termination if the continuation of a pregnancy would involve risk of injury to either the physical or mental health of woman?  That is what has led to abortion on demand.  The language is very plausible but it leads to results different from what may be intended.  Are those who are saying that they do not like the distinction saying that in order to save the health of the mother termination should be allowed?  Have they any proposals as to <Col N="234" /> how such a clause could be implemented without risk of further abuse?</P>
    <P>People have objected to the exclusion of suicide, although with the exception of Deputy Nuala Fennell, it has been supported by Fine Gael.  It is being excluded because it is obviously open to abuse.  It is very difficult to determine conclusively another person's intention even if one is a trained psychiatrist.  It is therefore inadvisable to legislate for it. Studies have shown that, for instance, in Minnesota between 1950 and 1965 when suicide was an allowable grounds for therapeutic abortion, over 60 per cent of all abortions took place on that grounds, yet figures for actual suicides were negligible. During the seventies in the National Maternity Hospital in Dublin there was not a single case of suicide reported.  Anyone genuinely suicidal, with the persons caring for her, will have the option to travel, if that is the only solution they see, even though I am sure excellent counselling will be available.</P>
    <P>There have been some criticisms from the Church of Ireland.  We in Fianna Fáil ensured in 1983 and today that sectarian language was not put into our Constitution. The substances of the Government's proposal is very close to the criteria of the Church of Ireland, that strict and undeniable medical necessity is the only justification for the termination of pregnancy.  While respecting the preference for legislation, it would not be the proper democratic process.  The general principle can work and our proposal is better than legislation because it leaves the responsibility with the medical profession who will have no serious difficulty working with the wording, as the president of the IMO confirmed.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a wide responsibility to society.  Our personal religious convictions, while important, cannot be our sole guide to sensitive and controversial social issues.  The Churches will respect, as they have in the past, their different role in setting out their moral teaching and our role as legislators who must have regard to our proposals workability and defensibility in terms of public policy.  As a country we are faced with <Col N="235" /> many pressing economic and other problems. There is no case for prolonging the debate.  The vast majority of people want the proposition to be put to them so that they can decide on it, so that we can all move to other business as quickly as possible.  It is certainly not the Government who wish to prolong this unavoidable diversion of public attention from other important issues.  Fianna Fáil had the courage to take up a clear position on this most difficult of issues.  The Democratic Left Party, to be fair to them, have done likewise.  I look forward to hearing more of the substantive thinking of Fine Gael and Labour as opposed to their procedure of drafting points.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that Fine Gael both on this issue, and on the Green Paper on Education last Friday, suggested that the time for making submissions on these issues was too short.  We have had the Supreme Court judgment, the wording, and our commitment during the referendum on the Masstricht Treaty but when the crunch came after the Cabinet sub-committee concluded their work and produced recommendations for the three referenda they are still asking for more time.</P>

I have no doubt that the maternity <Col N="237" /> hospitals will be capable of reflecting the general wishes of the Irish people that abortion is not acceptable or legal here but that the pregnant woman will take priority.  That is an intelligent, objective way of dealing with a very complex matter.  I look forward to a Yes victory in the three referenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the Twelfth Amendment Bill.  I have been concerned about various aspects of the substantive issue during the past few months and I have written about these concerns on two or three occasions.  Like most Members, the last thing I want to see here is the type of widescale abortion which has become so common in other countries.  It disturbs me, and I abhor the carrying out of abortions for no better reason than as a method of birth control, especially at a time when thousands of childless couples find it impossible to find a child for adoption.</P>
      <P>I have also referred to the awful dilemma we find ourselves in when, in very rare cases, a woman is virtually sentenced to death as a result of her pregnancy. I mentioned a list of possible conditions which could give rise to this situation, even though it is acknowledged that medical science can deal adequately with the great majority of these cases. There is always the exceptional case and I cannot understand how eminent professional colleagues of mine can say that these exceptional cases cannot arise, that no woman will ever be faced with such a dilemma, that they can be 100 per cent sure that this will not arise.  Those who make such statements are acting as gods.</P>
      <P>My recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> has been quoted in this House.  In it I said that even if there was only one exceptional case in ten years or more we would be very wrong to have a total ban in the Constitution against any procedures which would save that woman's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real purpose of any debate is to listen to a variety of views and to be prepared to act accordingly if necessary. Many of the fears I expressed have been allayed in recent days by the Ministers for Justice and Health.  I congratulate <Col N="238" /> them on the attitude they have adopted to this highly emotive and complex issue. I am heartened by the fact that the Minister referred specifically to many of the fears which I, among others, expressed and he has convinced me that they have been taken into account.  I am not a legal person but the Minister obviously has had the benefit of the best expertise available. The explanatory document given to the leaders of the Opposition parties was drawn up by professional people, legal and probably, medical people, and I had no problem with the interpretation in that document.  Some confusion appears to have arisen with regard to the interpretation of the interpretation.</P>
    <P>However, I would be less than honest if I did not say that I am still worried about the insertion of the words &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo;.  The Minister acknowledges that these words may give offence to many women but clearly he has been advised that to omit them might leave the way open to a more liberal approach to abortion.  If this were proven to be inevitable then I could understand his concern.  However, he states that the risk to life need not be immediate.  There seems to be a contradiction here.  If this is the case, why insert the words &ldquo;as distinct from health&rdquo;?  I have always been under the impression, as a medical man, that health is the determining factor where life is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the experience in Great Britain and elsewhere.  The difference is that these countries do not have a written constitution which sets limits on what Parliament can do.  If some people are afraid that the omission of a reference to health may lead to spurious decisions being made by some doctors who see nothing wrong with an extreme liberal view, surely these fears are adequately dealt with by the main wording in the amendment.  Such doctors would be dealt with appropriately by the medical council, not to mention by the courts.</P>
    <P>I have also mentioned that for the guidance of doctors certain legislation may be necessary.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> The question has also been raised whether legislation should be introduced which would supplement the amendment if passed.  It seems to me that the test proposed in the amendment is a straightforward one based on whether or not termination of pregnancy is necessary to save the life of the mother and should not give rise to difficulty in practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment does not disturb or change the finding in any way and does not require an immediate risk to life.</P>
    <P>Many examples have been given in this House and quite a number of anatomical lessons have perhaps been learned.  Let me give one example of a 45 year old woman who has had quite a number of children, who is hypertensive or who has angina.  If that person did not want to go ahead with the pregnancy and was able to find some &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; doctor, for want of a better word, could it not be said that he could accommodate her on the basis that the wording does not require an immediate risk to life?  If that woman were to die within two to three years would her parents and relatives not have the right to say to me, if I refused to perform the termination, that she would still be alive if I had agreed to the termination? That could form the basis of a Y case.  It is for this reason that I believe that there are not enough words in the Oxford English Dictionary capable of being inserted in the Constitution to satisfy everybody in this instance.  I also believe, given that medical guidelines are required, that subsequent legislation, in addition to the amendment, may be required and I am heartened by the fact that the Minister stated in his speech in that same paragraph: &ldquo;we will of course listen carefully to any views expressed on this matter during the course of this debate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Last weekend I said that I was concerned about the decision to publish the outlines of the legislation that would be necessary in the event of the amendment <Col N="240" /> not being passed.  I made a point of discussing this matter with the Taoiseach and as a result of this conversation and on hearing the Minister's speech I am now satisfied that it would have been irresponsible of the Government, were the occasion to arise, to thrust this legislation on the people without prior warning at this stage of the debate.  The Taoiseach is right when he states that society at this time is not prepared to tolerate either of the two extremes in this case and he is to be commended for insisting that the constitutional imperative of a mother's right to life must be borne in mind at all times.  It goes without saying no matter what procedure is adopted in medical practice that every effort must be made to save the lives of both mother and child.</P>
    <P>This is by far the most complex issue to come before the House in a long time. Not one of us can claim to have all the right answers.  Conflicting arguments are being made from all sides but at the end of the day the Government must act with commonsense and realism.  The Taoiseach has kept his word by bringing in these referenda within the timescale that he promised.  I trust therefore that as a result we may arrive at the most sensible decisions possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When the referendum on the right to travel and information was first mooted it was my hope that we would also have a referendum on the substantive issue.  I am therefore supportive of the Government's action.  I have had the opportunity to have a number of discussions with the Minister for Justice and the Attorney General on the matter and I am reassured by their caring and practical approach.  It has been the responsibility of the Government to draw up the parameters of the provisions to amend the Constitution.  This has not been an easy task and it has taken many months of consultations and deliberation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there has been some sincere contributions in the House during the debate there has also been a cynical attempt by some who have deliberately tried to <Col N="241" /> create a climate of fear among women by saying that the wording of the proposed amendment on the substantive issue would put the lives of women at risk. The truth is the complete reverse; the amendment sets out deliberately to save the life of the mother where her life is in danger.  The proposed referendum seeks to restore the concept of the equal rights of the mother and the child.</P>
    <P>I have been nauseated by a number of speakers on the Opposition benches.  All through this debate they have been looking for more time to discuss this issue but neither they nor their respective parties have made any positive contributions or supplied a wording to the Government in the hope that there would be consensus on this issue.  This can be put down to one of two reasons:&mdash; either the Opposition were incapable of putting forward such a wording or else they did not have sufficient interest or commitment.</P>
    <P>It is easy to speak here in such debates but it is much more difficult and takes more time and effort to put forward concrete proposals for consideration.  These have not been forthcoming from the Opposition parties to date.  Therefore I can describe much of what has been said by members of the Opposition parties as bluster.  While this may be an unfortunate hazard of political life from time to time, it should not be so evident on such a fundamental question as the one under discussion here today.</P>
    <P>There is much resistance in this House to the proposal that a referendum should be held.  Let me ask the following questions. Why do so many Deputies on the opposite side of the House fear a referendum and why should they be so apprehensive about the decision of the people?  Do they believe that the people are incapable of making the right decision or are they implying in some way that the people outside this House are less capable of making a decision than the legislators within it?  The people in my constituency who have spoken to me directly about this matter want to be given the opportunity to express their view on such a personal and fundamental <Col N="242" /> matter.  The Opposition parties should not attempt to thwart this basic right.</P>

      <P>It is now nine years since an amendment was introduced in the House to insert a clause in the Constitution.  In 1983, we on this side of the House opposed that amendment but, unfortunately, Fianna Fáil, in a cynical political exercise, supported it and pushed it through the House to gain a short term political advantage.  This amendment was subsequently carried in the referendum by the people.</P>
      <P>Since then there has been litigation which culminated in the X case.  During the debate in this House sight has been lost of the terms of that case and the relief that was provided following the final decision in that sad and tragic case. Today we are discussing proposed amendments to the Constitution dealing with the right to travel and information and the issue of abortion itself.</P>
      <P>The Government have said that they have sought to achieve consensus but I believe that the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and his party have acted in a cynical manner and have disregarded the women of Ireland primarily for party political considerations.  They have shown no consideration for the women of Ireland and this is evident from the manner in which they have sought this famous consensus &mdash; all they want to do is to ram these Bills through the House to gain political advantage.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision earlier this year provided the country with an opportunity to address the issue once again but, unfortunately, we are going through the same experience.  The Taoiseach has put his own party's interests first while the purpose of the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution is to cause the maximum amount of political embarrassment for all other parties.  An attempt is being made to classify as proor anti-abortion certain Deputies and parties in this House who are attempting to adopt a responsible and thoughtful position on this extremely sensitive issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar exercise was carried out in 1983.  I was a member of the Fine Gael <Col N="243" /> Party in Government at that time and I remember the divisiveness and the appalling attitudes which were adopted at the instigation of Fianna Fáil.  Here again an attempt is being made by that party to proceed down the same road.  The intention of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice is particularly apparent and crude because obviously their first target in this campaign was their partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats. They decided they would push the Progressive Democrats into a corner and because of the manner in which Fianna Fáil were handling the matter they would be forced to leave Government.  That crude and despicable tactic was adopted by the Taoiseach for a specific reason, to avoid presenting himself to give evidence at the Beef Tribunal.  He avoided attending that tribunal on two previous occasions and he hoped to call a general election before he was next due to appear before the tribunal, which is next week.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats were forced to make a decision in regard to the position they would take and, as outlined by their Leader here today, they made their decision.  In one sense I sympathise with the dilemma of the Leader of the Progressive Democrats but I am gravely disappointed that he put the lives of the women of Ireland in a secondary place to an impending general election.  That is unfortunate for the women of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's attitude towards reaching a consensus on this issue is worth examining.  He failed to differentiate between his position as Leader of Fianna Fáil and his constitutional position as Taoiseach of a Coalition Government, <Col N="244" /> which carries with it an obligation to take on board the views of his Coalition partners; but he failed to do that.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach sought consensus among the Opposition parties on this side of the House; but that was just a charade, an attempt to convince the public that he was serious about the matter.  However, the public are not convinced of this.  It was nothing but a bogus exercise on the part of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The referendum of 1983 was not just a pro-life referendum.  As we realised in the following years it was about frightening and controlling women.  The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution that is before the House this week is similar to the 1983 Amendment.  That Amendment was anti-women in its origin and its implementation and the wording of the Twelfth Amendment is also profoundly anti-women.  It is unfortunate that the Government are not prepared to examine in detail the circumstances in which pregnant women should be treated medically.  None of these issues has been argued in detail.</P>
      <P>I was particularly disappointed with the contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and I am very concerned at some of the statements she made.  She said that the concerns of women mirror the concerns of doctors and that the Amendment is not seeking from doctors a greater degree of certainty about the risk to a mother's life before providing treatment.  She went on to say that pregnant women will receive all treatment necessary to protect their health.  At no stage has a Government Minister outlined in detail how treatment will be provided, in what circumstances it will be provided and who will make the decisions.  There are many questions in relation to that aspect that have not been elaborated on in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications said that if the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; were <Col N="245" /> omitted from the proposed Amendment, any future hard case which is not related to a life-threatening condition could be the ground for abortion.  That is scaremongering. The Minister did not elaborate on this matter.  She mentioned the Bourne case of 1938, but she failed to say that no legislation was introduced in Britain subsequent to that case.  When they attempted to introduce legislation in 1968, 30 years later, the whole question of abortion had blown up in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that a pregnancy may be terminated if doctors form the view that even after recovering from childbirth other treatment for whatever illness the mother was suffering from during the pregnancy would be ineffective to save her life.  I would ask the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs who is present in the House, what direction is being given to the medical profession in taking these decisions?  Is it not true that medical practitioners will find themselves in a serious dilemma as regards the course of action to take in particular instances?  For example, if a pregnant women is suffering from breast cancer it has been stated that she will receive the treatment she requires.  We all know that a variety of treatments may be provided for breast cancer, some more effective than others. For instance, some doses of chemotherapy and radium treatment are more effective than others, and doctors will have to decide the strength of treatment to be applied.</P>
    <P>In this regard a serious question arises in relation to the life of the woman. Cancer is life-threatening, but it could also be regarded as a danger to health. Therefore on one hand a decision will have to be made in relation to the health of the woman while on the other hand a decision will have to be made in relation to her life.  We must remember that the life we live is determined by the health we enjoy, and in certain instances it will be impossible for a medical practitioner to make a decision.  The Government have a responsibility to examine in detail those instances and to set down in legislation guidelines for medical practitioners <Col N="246" /> as to how they should act in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are women who are concerned and confused about this matter and they do not know whether to vote for or against the wording of the amendments. They are particularly concerned at the statement by the Taoiseach that if the wording in the Twelfth Amendment is not carried he will bring in legislation based on the X case.  Such a statement is highly irresponsible and emotional and is scaremongering.  The Taoiseach has a responsibility to introduce legislation that will be determined in detail by the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Exchange Rate Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> on Tuesday, 20 October 1992.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the adverse effect on certain businesses which the devaluation of Sterling has caused and conscious of the heavy burden which recent interest rate increases have imposed on borrowers, particularly those with high mortgages, calls on the Government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;To reduce employers' PRSI payments in respect of those businesses most adversely affected,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to cover the exchange rate risk of those firms which borrow abroad for the purposes of expansion and job creation,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to moderate the distortions in cross-border trade with Northern Ireland by reducing the standard rate of VAT and the incidence of Excise Duty,</P>
    <P>&mdash;to introduce measures to protect mortgage holders, both in respect of the tenure of their homes and the level of their repayments, either by <Col N="247" /> adopting credible economic policies which will quickly reduce interest rates or by restoring full mortgage relief and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to state its exchange rate policy and explain how all its recent actions are consistent with this policy.   </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the firm exchange rate policy of the Government and the response of the Government to the recent turbulence in financial markets and welcomes, in particular, the measures taken by the Government to alleviate the adverse effects on Irish businesses of the sharp and sudden depreciation of Sterling within a framework of continuing budgetary discipline&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Rourke.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, suggested that there was a possibility &mdash; and, indeed, an opportunity &mdash; available to the Minister for Finance in this area as it related to the devastation caused to mortgage holders. He said that in the promised Finance Bill there is an opportunity to introduce a mini-budget, particularly relating to home owners, to protect them from massive increases in their mortgage payments. I am sure that not many Members are exempt from mortgage payments. Indeed, many Members are already involved with families who are suffering the hardship caused by increased mortgage repayments, particularly when there is such a high rate of unemployment.  On a weekly basis Members must negotiate with and make representations to the housing section of the local authorities which deal with mortgages in varying degrees, from low rise mortgage repayments to ordinary secured loans, those who are not included in the fixed income schemes and other areas.  We also have <Col N="248" /> problems with banks and building societies on a regular basis, which is understandable, with 300,000 people out of work.  These people have now been notified by the various agencies of the 3 per cent increase in mortgage repayments which puts an additional burden on them.</P>
      <P>We suggested an instrument which the Minister could use to give 100 per cent relief to people in their taxation payments, up to a figure of £5,000, compared to the existing figure of 80 per cent on a maximum of £4,000.  We suggested this because the Minister stated categorically that the crisis would be short term.  If so, the solution will also be short term and will not cost the Exchequer much. However, it would be an indication that the Government are concerned about the area of mortgage repayments and interest increases.</P>
      <P>The Government made another suggestion in relation to the market development fund and the sum of £50 million.  In principle we would all welcome that and it is obvious, from reading the guidelines in this document &mdash; we are not yet sure how bureaucratic the allocation of the fund will be &mdash; that it could bring relief to certain areas of industry, particularly those involved in exporting.  However, having looked at this and at the guidelines laid down in the document, it is clear that the agriculture and food industry in particular, for which I have responsibility in my party, are excluded to a large extent because of the concept of the 10 per cent corporation tax clause which is included as one of the conditions.  The vast majority of that part of the industry in agriculture and food are exempt from corporation tax and are involved only directly in the payment of income tax.  The same applies to the sheepmeat and pigmeat trade which are excluded because of the employment content of the clause of 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that, the agricultural sector and the sheep farmers in particular found it necessary to come to the streets of the capital city yesterday to reinforce their case because of what happened to the payments for ewes and lambs, amounting to about £6 per head.  Those people had <Col N="249" /> much more important things to do than protesting in their thousands in Moles-worth Street.  Their incomes have been depleted a week after the Minister said they would be increased.  I met their leaders yesterday and I know that they do not want to be coming to Dublin to protest. However, they feel they have to because of the lethargic response from the Commissioner &mdash; who is about to retire &mdash; and the Minister for Agriculture and Food who keeps promising that he will attend the meeting of the Council of Ministers in Brussels to restate their case for the continuation of proper payments. I sincerely hope the Minister will do so and will be successful in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee will be discussing in detail tomorrow morning the issues referred to, the implications for Ireland of the recent events in the financial markets, particularly as they relate to the exchange rate mechanism.  I do not want to prejudge what the committee will come up with by way of findings, which I hope will be debated in the House but, having read some of the independent views which have been made available to us &mdash; and of which the committee are aware &mdash; it is clear that there are stark realities facing this country arising from the exchange rate control mechanism, <Col N="250" /> the implications for sterling and the fall in its value.</P>
      <P>A recent document in relation to the implications for Ireland of recent events in the financial markets states:</P>
      <P>If one abstracts initially from the possible consequences for output and employment, sterling's fall has two effects on the Irish economy.  Firstly, it reduces the Irish pound's equivalent price of Irish exports to the UK and, secondly, it reduces the Irish pound's equivalent price of imports from the UK.</P>
      <P>It also says that both these effects create the potential for the profit margins of Irish firms who compete with UK producers, whether on the home market, the UK market or, indeed, in any other market, to be significantly reduced and in some cases for these profit margins to become losses.  This, in turn, creates the potential for output to be cut back and for jobs to be lost.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his defence of the Government's efforts to ensure that the exchange rate mechanism &mdash; of which we are part and out of which Britain has opted &mdash; said he prided himself on the fact that this country has managed to weather the storm.  It is quite obvious that an independent economist examining the situation in the market-place would know that the value of our exports to the UK and the mechanism which has affected sterling because of its removal from the ERM means that we will have much greater difficulty in trying to remain competitive in the UK and to survive in the other markets which we have been trying to support within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to <Col N="251" /> have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is very obvious that due to the consistent attitude and outlook for the national economy of the Government since 1987, despite a world-ravaging recession and very unstable international currency conditions, we have made very solid decisions with which the markets, the investors and the public are pleased. Due to the solid and prudent management of the economy by us in Government since 1987 the punt has withstood international currency pressures and will continue to do so.  Correspondingly, the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government and along with his colleagues, has put in place a series of remedial measures for exporting companies, measures which are designed to assist those companies in their efforts to maintain a competitive position in the international market-place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already outlined to the House the steps taken by the Government to assist firms adversely affected by the currency turmoil.  An Bord Tráchtála took several urgent actions with a view to helping firms assess their position and discussing options for further action.  The report of the working group established by the Government to examine and make recommendations on the problems facing firms as a result of the currency fluctuations was considered by the Government with maximum speed and an announcement on the matter was made on 6 October last.  The market development fund was established and was in operation within days.  The fund was initially put together and announced on behalf of the Government by the Minister for Finance and is being implemented by the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  The Supplementary Estimate for the provision of funds for the current year was, as Deputies know, passed by the House on Thursday, 5 October.  The general financial and trading criteria being applied by the team have been designed to focus support on firms that have been most seriously <Col N="252" /> affected by the recent currency turmoil. Firms must demonstrate an action plan that shows the way in which they propose to maintain and improve their competitiveness in ajusting to the significant changes that have taken place in the market-place.</P>

      <P>We are all very committed to the EMS, which has served this country well and which has been much to our benefit in past years.  Obviously, the overall long term goal of Ireland, the Government and the member states of the Community must be to create a common currency.  It is necessary for the Community and the member states to ensure that the mechanisms are put in <Col N="253" /> place and that there will not be vast unnecessary movements of capital such as those experienced some weeks ago which created the international currency turmoil.</P>
      <P>The management of the economy by our Government meant that we had low inflation, we were competitive, our interest rates were steady, our balance of payments position was right and our budget stability was assured.  That achievement put us in the position in which, even though Ireland is a very small, open economy &mdash; a small island in a big trading group &mdash; we were able to sustain the pressure on currency.  Tribute and credit must go to the present Government and the Government since 1987. The present Minister for Finance, saddled with addressing the current exchange rate fluctuations, has done an excellent job.  Previous to him, the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, ensured that our economy, interest rates, inflation rate and competitiveness were in a proper state.</P>
      <P>Last week the summit in Birmingham reassured us of the total commitment to the EMS.  It is my opinion that that reassurance will help to stabilise the currency crisis.  I am confident that the Government, with our careful management, will be able to secure and to support firms that are dependent on exports and are victims of the present conditions.  The mechanism is in position, the commitment is there, the Government have the ability to deal with this matter and consensus political support is needed in the interests in those who are trying to create growth in our country, make a contribution to our balance of payments position and make a contribution to our economic development. In the interests of all those companies and everyone involved in them it is vital that the Government have unanimous support for the measures being taken in the overall interests of our country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> First I should like to apologise to Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> for not being in the Chamber last night during his speech.  I assure the Deputy that I was listening to him and saw his full contribution on the monitors.  I would not like the Deputy to feel I was not taking heed of his statement.  I disagree with Deputy Noonan on some of the comments he made last night but at the outset I should like to thank him for the responsible comments and statements he made during what was a particularly difficult ten days.  Deputy Noonan's statements were in the national interest and they were extremely helpful and positive.</P>
    <P>The Government's consistent policy in relation to our currency has been to maintain a firm exchange rate within the European Monetary System.  That policy and the other domestic policies required to underpin it have yielded considerable benefits to us in terms of inflation, competitiveness, interest rates, balance of payments and budgetary stability.  I do not propose to dwell on all these matters but I would like to emphasise our achievements as regards prices and interest rates.  Our inflation is now one of the lowest in the Community and, in the period from March 1987 to the end of August this year, the differential between German and Irish interest rates fell from over nine percentage points to about one percentage point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is changing almost by the day.  I think we would probably be back about three to four percentage points on last week's differential. Ten or 11 days ago it stood at about seven percentage points.  The differential has fluctuated greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMS has served us well, as it has served the Community well, in creating a zone of stability in Europe.  Last month, however, the system was put under severe strain, so much so that we witnessed something that had never happened to it since its inception.  That <Col N="255" /> sobering experience was the decision by two members to suspend the participation of their currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism.  Such drastic action was a reflection of the strength of the forces of speculation which assailed the system.</P>
    <P>It is, to my mind, a matter of great regret that this action was taken, because I am convinced that it could have been avoided if the ERM had been used as flexibly as it had been in the 1980s.  This, however, is no time for an analysis of what might have been.  The fact is that these events have occurred and we all have to live with the consequences.  For us, the most immediate of these consequences was the sharp and sudden depreciation of the pound sterling, the currency of our single largest trading partner in the Community.  another, more insidious, result is the volatility of sterling since it was allowed to float. Hopefully, however, this factor will diminish in importance as the foreign exchange markets settle down after the recent bout of turbulence.</P>
    <P>In this context I am glad that last week's special European Council endorsed the view of the ECOFIN Council that the recent financial turbulence called for reflection and analysis in the light of developments in the capital markets and in the European and world monetary systems.  To this end, the ECOFIN Council this week formally requested the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors to carry forward that work.  I look forward to the results of these studies, which, I hope, will address the problem represented by daily volumes of foreign exchange transactions which exceed the combined reserves of industrialised countries. As we have seen such capital movements can threaten the stability of currencies which, on the basis of all accepted economic criteria, should be rock-solid.  Means will have to be found to discourage such speculative excesses without, however, prejudicing the principle of freedom of capital movements.</P>
    <P>The Government were, of course, <Col N="256" /> faced with a cruel dilemma in the face of recent exchange rate disturbances.  But, to us, the answer was abundantly clear, namely, that under no circumstances were we going to opt for a course of action which would endanger the longer term interests of the economy.  Devaluation, either within or outside the ERM, would have been such a course.</P>
    <P>If we had taken the devaluation option we would have been running enormous risks, a few of which deserve specific mention.  One is the danger of reviving the inflationary psychology which did so much damage to our interests in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Another is the fact that our hard won credibility as a prime location for foreign portfolio investment would be dashed and with it would go such benefits as the reduced interest rates which we enjoyed over the past few years.  Moreover, such is the size and distribution of our foreign debt that a devaluation would seriously unbalance the public finances.  If any of these risks materialised, it would put paid to any hopes we have of being a founder-member of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may contend that the higher interest rates we are now temporarily experiencing are too high a price to pay for our firm currency policy.  To that, I would respond that the recent regrettable but necessary increase in Irish interest rates was not due to the fact that we have maintained our firm currency policy.  It was, in fact, because investors and others are afraid that we will not do so.  Devaluation of the Irish pound in the EMS would only confirm the worst fears of international investors &mdash; their perceptions of the value of investment in Irish pounds would be seriously undermined. As a result, Irish investments would need to offer a higher return so as to attract funds.  Therefore, the effect of a devaluation would be to sharply increase the interest rate differential with Germany and other narrow-band ERM countries for many years to come, compared with what it was before the current period of turmoil.</P>
    <P>Devaluation of the Irish pound has not <Col N="257" /> been successful in bringing interest rates down in the past.  We tried that route in August 1986 when the Irish pound was devalued by 8 per cent in the EMS.  At that time, the improvement in the interest rate position which resulted from the weakening of the Irish pound <i>vis á vis</i> sterling, in so far as there was any, lasted only a matter of weeks.  Wholesale interest rates soared in the last quarter of 1986.  In October of that year there were increases in retail lending rates of between 2 and 4.5 percentage points, as a result.  Building societies also announced increases of 3 percentage points in mortgage rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The August 1986 devaluation of the Irish pound was also followed by sharply higher gilt yields &mdash; which meant higher Exchequer debt service costs.  This was despite the fact that the Irish gilt market at that time was much less internationally oriented than is now the case, a fact evidenced by the range of capital controls which was in operation at the time.</P>
      <P>These considerations are clinching arguments in favour of maintaining our firm exchange rate policy within the ERM and I am glad to note that the Government's position in this is endorsed by the two main Opposition parties and the overwhelming mass of business and academic opinion.  In fact, that policy is the only one which will ensure that, when the present temporary period of market turbulence comes to an end, we can move back to interest rates close to those of Germany, and retail interest rates and mortgage rates can fall.  In this, I am pleased to be able to inform this House that there are already signs of an easing in wholesale interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In adopting our strategy, we were acutely conscious of the immediate problems caused to some Irish businesses by the depreciation of sterling.  We recognised that they would have difficulty in maintaining their positions in competition with UK firms and that a serious threat <Col N="258" /> to jobs existed in that situation.  With this prospect in view the Government on 6 October last announced the setting-up of a market development fund of £50 million for the period up to the end of March next.  This will assist firms which have been seriously affected by recent exchange rate movements and will thus help to maintain the stability necessary to sustain Ireland's position in the ERM.  My colleague, the Minister of State responsible for trade and marketing has already given the House details of the scheme and the other initiatives taken by the Government.  I shall not elaborate further upon them.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the specific recommendations made by Deputy Noonan.  The type of policy response to the current difficulties recommended by the Deputy would be a prescription for economic disaster and disorder.  Deputy Noonan has been extremely constructive during the past number of weeks and I can only take issue with some of the points he made last night.  He has taken a very strong and supportive line on this policy.  I am not going to get into a shouting match across the floor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it is our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy is supporting me on it.  To put forward, as a policy approach which would best serve the national interest, a wish-list of measures to alleviate every adverse aspect of the currency shock and its knock-on effect is disingenuous.  Indeed, to suggest that the budget should be used in this way is simply irresponsible.  The combined cost of all the measures sought would be such as to drive borrowing up sharply &mdash; reversing the whole thrust of policy in recent years.  Moreover, the effect would merely be to put upward pressure on taxation over the next few years, thus reversing the process of tax reform on which so much progress has been made.  At a time when we need to sharpen our competitiveness further, this is hardly a course that could be recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take, as a specific example, <Col N="259" /> the proposal that mortgage interest relief should be fully restored.  The fact is that mortgage interest tax relief already provides very significant assistance to borrowers. The estimated cost of the relief in terms of tax forgone, before the recent increase in interest rates, was put at £184 million in the 1992-1993 tax year, and the recent increase in interest rates will automatically push up this cost, even without any increase in the relief ceiling. The Revenue Commissioners calculate that restoration of the relief to 100 per cent of the present £4,000 ceiling would cost £50 million in the current tax year. If concessions of that magnitude were to be made in addition to existing costs of the scheme as it stands, they would have to be funded by either increased taxation, generally, expenditure cuts, over and above those already required, or increased borrowing, The first course would be totally against Government policy, the second would be very difficult to achieve and the third could affect investor confidence to the extent of delaying a return to lower interest rates which is the outcome most vital to borrowers at this stage.  I do not see how any of these three possible consequences would serve the national interest.</P>
    <P>I must, however, commend mortgage lenders for responding to the immediate problems created by the increase in mortgage rates by providing the option, to people who wish to avail of it, of deferring collection of the increase for a period of at least three months with the deferred payment being added on to the amount of the loan outstanding.  This is a practical response which is consistent with the short term nature of the increase and the fact that it would be totally unacceptable to further increase the demands on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The suggestion to reduce employer PRSI payments in respect of certain business betrays a misunderstanding of our PRSI system.  That system is a universal one which is concerned with the contributions in respect of individual workers and the resulting eligibility for benefits.  It is not suited to differentiation <Col N="260" /> by reference to either individual firms or sectors.  Besides being inequitable and inefficient, as a means of targeting relief, a sectoral differentiation would be extremely difficult to administer on any kind of a stable basis.  Firm by firm differentiation would require the use of information and criteria which are entirely outside the scope of social welfare legislation and administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, said last night the Minister would still consider it as an option and that he might do it if the crisis continued between now and Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke said that if the crisis continued in the long term that would be considered but that is the Government position.  The necessary legislative and administrative changes could not be brought in easily or quickly and the resultant system could only apply on an inflexible basis with no guarantee of effective targeting.  Such differentiation would thus be an inappropriate use of the PRSI system.  Moreover, even if it were easy to accomplish, any such differentiation would lead to demands for its extention to other sectors and an across the board reduction of 1 percentage point in employers' PRSI would cost no less than £85 million.  Clearly, therefore, no responsible Government could go down the road suggested by the Deputy in this respect.</P>
      <P>The question of covering the exchange risk of firms which borrow abroad does not arise because the rationale of our firm exchange rate policy is that there should be little or no exchange rate risk in commercial or financial dealings with countries which are members of the narrow-band of the ERM.  The situation in relation to non-Community currencies, such as the US dollar, remains the same as it was before, that is there is and will be no cover for exchange risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to any incentive to increased cross-Border shopping induced by the depreciation of sterling, it is essential <Col N="261" /> to keep a sense of proportion.  I certainly am not going to be forced into panic measures, such as costly VAT or excise duty reductions outside of the normal budgetary process, especially when there is no clear evidence that there has been anything more than a modest resumption of cross-Border shopping. Notwithstanding the strengthening of our currency in the intervening period, the scale of movement is a mere fraction of that experienced in the mid-eighties.  I realise, of course, that this is a time of great uncertainty and I am aware of the potential damage to trade that large scale currency fluctuations can bring.  For this reason, I shall be monitoring the situation carefully.</P>
    <P>In sum, it would be all too easy in the short term to take soft options and compensate everybody for the costs of the recent currency shock.  That was the approach taken to other crises in the past, particularly the oil-price shocks.  With hindsight, it is now clear that choosing the soft option in response to these crises was a serious mistake.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that considerable benefits will flow from the depreciation of sterling.  Many inputs to industrial processes will be cheaper, as will finished goods imported from the UK.  It is vital that all those involved in the production and distribution chains who benefit in this way should pass on these lower prices.  By so doing, they will shorten the interval and ease the burden of adjustment of our economy to its new exchange situation in relation to sterling.</P>
    <P>We are well geared to making that adjustment because our ability to maintain the macroeconomic and exchange rate policies which have laid the foundations for strong sutainable growth in the long term has been tested and proved. But we must continue to deepen these policies.  A sustainable budgetary policy, responsible wage and cost developments, the enhancement of restructuring and growth potential in key sectors and the effective utilisation of assistance from the Community's Structual Funds are central elements to our continued success.</P>
    <P>The factors have increased domestic <Col N="262" /> and foreign confidence in Irish economic performance and, as I have already said, helped lower interest rates.  This has underpinned the significent progress in investment, growth and relative incomes achieved since the mid-eighties.  For example, between 1986 and 1990 fixed investment increased by 22 per cent in volume terms.  At 6 per cent, our annual average growth in real GDP was well ahead of our EC competitors.  Improved competitiveness meant that Irish exports increased their share of external markets leading to a trade surplus of over 10 per cent of GNP this year.  Our rate of inflation of 2.8 per cent is one of the lowest in the EC and well below the current level in Germany.  Most satisfying of all, is that total non-agricultural employment increased by 54,000 between 1986 and 1991.</P>
    <P>Whiler recording these advances, we have, since 1988, consistently kept the Exchequer borrowing requirement to less than 2.5 per cent of GNP each year, and that will be the case again this year.  As a consequence, the debt-GNP ratio fell to under 105 per cent by end-1991 and it will continue its decline this year.</P>
    <P>These are commendable achievements which have been applauded by other member states.  Indeed, as I have already informed this House on other occasions, the Council of Finance Ministers concluded in Feburary last that Ireland already complied with the objective criteria for the move to the third stage of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Despite external recession, our impressive economic progress is being maintained this year.  My Department's <i>Economic Review and Outlook 1992</i>, published in the middle of August, forecast growth in real GDP of the order of 2½ per cent this year, compared with the EC Commission's forecast of 2¼ per cent. Recent forecast by other agencies have been more optimistic.  In September, the Central Bank and the ESRI forecast GDP growth of 3½ per cent and 4 per cent respectively &mdash; well ahead of both the EC Commission's forecast of average growth in the Community of 1¾ per cent growth and the OECD's forecast of average <Col N="263" /> growth of the same order in the OECD area.  Clearly, we are continuing to perform better than our competitors.</P>
    <P>Consumer spending is growing broadly in line with the rise in real disposable incomes allowed for in the 1992 budget. To date retail sales are about 3 per cent higher compared with the corresponding period of 1991.  Car sales have been very weak in the early part of the year but have improved in recent months.  Merchandise exports increased by about 12 per cent in the first seven months of the year and output in manufacturing is up by 10 per cent.  These factors indicate the remarkable resilience of the Irish economy in the face of external turmoil.</P>
    <P>The bottom line for most people is employment and here again we appear to be maintaining our position.  The <i>Economic Review and Outlook 1992</i> projected growth in non-agricultural employment of about 5,000.  Leading indicators suggest employment is indeed continuing to rise.  Training and employment levy receipts show a year-to-year rise of 7½ per cent up to September, which is a good indicator of rising employment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that a strong currency must be based on strong economic fundamentals.  Our fundamentals are strong.  The conclusions of the February ECOFIN Council explicitly recognised this.  Our ability to sustain our position in the EMS is widely and justifiably acknowledged. Our present prudent economic and budgetary policies, backed by a firm exchange rate policy, have proved sucsessful in sustaining our performance. We have consistently been able to adjust quickly and decisively where necessary to changing external developments.  We have demonstrated that capacity again in response to the recent currency turbulence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised the issue of the exchange rate formula used in determining the customs value of imported goods for the purpose of calculating VAT at the point of entry.  He specifically asked if an approach had been made to the EC Commission to allow us to ignore <Col N="264" /> the requirements of Community law which provides for a fixed monthly rate subject to a weekly review and to establish instead a system which would be based on daily exchange rates.  There is no provision in the governing EC regulations whereby one member state can operate, or even apply to the Commission to operate, a unilateral derogation in relation to the exchange rate system which has been fixed.  Any change to the existing system of calculation would have to be approved by all 12 member states.  It was recently pointed out to this House that VAT at the point of entry is reclaimable by registered traders. Any disadvantage arising from this can only be a temporary cash flow problem. I also said that the formula was being used at the behest of the users of this system.  I commend the Government's amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate if for no other reason than I believe it is important for us to signal to members of the community &mdash; mortgage holders and consumers, those who are suffering as a result of the current financial crisis &mdash; that we are not immune to their problems and that as legislators we are doing our best to find ways and means of offsetting the worst effects of these problems on them at present.  With regard to mortgage holders, I do not suppose there is ever a good time for a 3 per cent increase in mortgage repayments, but there could hardly have been a worse time to announce this increase than after the summer holidays when thousands of families were trying to put up the money to send their children back to school or fund third level college fees.  This increase could not have hit mortgage holders at a worse time.</P>

      <P>It was crucial for the Government to take important measures to help industries, especially those dependent on the British market. Important and very welcome measures were taken by the Government to help those industries and save jobs.  It is equally important that we monitor measures which will enable people to hold on to their homes: the two most important things to any family are the family home and jobs.  I am satisfied that the Government have taken realistic measures to help industry.  I say to the Minister that as matters stand householders expect interest rates to be reduced within the next three months.  If this happens, mortgage holders will be able to cope as a result of the action taken by the building societies.  I say to the Minister that this issue has been monitored very carefully on a month-to-month and week-to-week basis.  If the building societies continue their present policy everything will be right.  However, if this is not the case, the Minister will have to adopt a sensitive approach to these matters and keep the predicament of mortgage holders at the top of his agenda at all times.</P>

    <P>In relation to the price reductions that ought to be passed on and about which the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Rourke, spoke last night, I want to draw attention to the fact that from my experience as a shopper and from the experience of a number of consumers I have met, these reductions have not been passed on.  I ask the Minister to monitor <Col N="266" /> that matter on a daily basis.  If we have to pay the price at one level, surely in all justice we should reap the benefits at another level.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, appears yet again to be following the path adopted by his claimed friend the Prime Minister of the UK, John Major.  Just as the British Government's economic policy has fallen apart, the Taoiseach and this Government have done likewise in an equally spectacular style.</P>
      <P>We have heard this Government complain that everyone else is to blame for our economic crisis.  The Taoiseach accuses businesses exporting to the UK of whining.  Anonymous speculators are conjured up in the imagination as some great ogre to be tackled.  The German Bundesbank, that convenient whipping boy, is accused of not taking sufficient account of Ireland's special problems.</P>
      <P>In so doing the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are like Don Quixote and Sancho Panchez tilting at windmills. They fail to see what everyone knows &mdash; Ireland has no exchange rate policy and little direction left to its economic policy. The only policy operated by this Government is shallow and glib, rooted in narrow political terms and put into operation regardless of its impact on the country.</P>
      <P>The country is in a serious economic crisis.  Our main market and competitor, the United Kingdom, has effectively devalued its currency against the Irish pound.  One third of our goods are exported to the UK and more than 40 per cent of manufactured exports from indigenous firms go to that country.  It is also a supplier against whom businesses here must compete on the home and export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> The Government rushed to set up the market development fund.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, was somewhat petty tonight because, in fairness to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, it was he who was responsible for the setting up of this fund. He answered questions in the Dáil about a fortnight ago in that regard.  It is indicative of the tension within the Government that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, could not bring himself to give credit to the Minister for that. What has been heard of that fund since the EC Commissioner was belatedly informed by the Government of their intention to implement the scheme?  Did the Taoiseach raise the matter at the EC Summit in Birmingham to obtain EC clearance for the fund?  Was clearance given to the Minister for Finance at the ECOFIN Council for this fund?</P>
    <P>The first payments from the fund are due this week, but will the Minister say if these will be paid or are we dependent on EC <i>imprimatur</i> before the money can be paid?  If payment is made prior to EC approval will the EC require repayment? The sad thing about this Government is that they are consumed by public relations and I hope the market development fund is not just another part of that exercise.  The Government are only interested in announcing schemes and cares little whether the scheme gets off the ground and even less about whether it achieves its objectives.  The market development fund is not a substitute for a clear statement of economic policy and a clear exchange rate policy.  It is a sticking plaster approach which cannot hope to offset the full impact on the economy and on business of the fall in the value of sterling.</P>
    <P>Many service firms supplying the United Kingdom or competing with firms there are not covered by the fund because the application form refers to the manufacture of goods.  No definition is given of this.  Does it refer to the tax definition of manufacturing?  That must be clarified. In everything the Government have done in regard to the present job strategy or <Col N="268" /> in relation to this fund over the past three months no mention is made of tourism, one of our major industries.  Tourism is not catered for in this fund despite the disastrous prospects for the tourism industry next year.</P>
    <P>Combined with high interest rates, depressed demand and higher business costs being imposed by the Government, the ability of many businesses, especially indigenous businesses, to survive is under severe threat.  A survey of 2,000 businesses published earlier this week indicated that only 8 per cent of the respondents believed that the Government's job creation strategy was on the right track &mdash; an overwhelming 76 per cent believed it to be incorrect.  This is in spite of the list read out by the Minister for Finance today.  This is a massive thumbs down to the Government, their job creation strategy and their economic policy.  It is time the policy and the Government were changed.</P>
    <P>This Government do not realise how their actions are fuelling uncertainty and further undermining confidence.  In the midst of this crisis the Taoiseach, with the narrow aim of wrongfooting other parties, chose to put forward an approach to the abortion issue which showed scant regard for the immediate economic problems facing people or for the sensitivity and complexity of the issue itself.  Instead of seeking to distract people's attention from the economic crisis, it would have been better if the Taoiseach had concentrated his own focus on the economy. Is there no end to the damage the Taoiseach is prepared to risk on serious issues merely to avoid being caught in the public glare as the Government's economic policy crumbles?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is no better. He introduced a disastrous Finance Bill earlier this year &mdash; anyone involved in business will agree with that.  I believe he has been informed on more than one occasion officially, by both individuals in business and organisations representing business, that it has damaged confidence in business.  One would have thought that the Minister would have tried to undo the damage of that Finance Act; instead <Col N="269" /> he appears to be more concerned about somebody taking over as Minister for Finance than about the effects of the Finance Act, 1992, on businesses here. How could any investor in this country draw comfort from this appalling mess? How could any business person feel confident that the Government understand the huge fears and concerns that stalk many firms?  With respect to the Minister and his officials, I believe that I have more daily contact with business people than they and I am not exaggerating in what I am saying here tonight.  There is great fear among business people in regard to the future.</P>
    <P>How will people, with their mortgages rising so dramatically, taking the last of their remaining discretionary spending away, feel when they realise that the Taoiseach is more anxious about political scraps with opponents and supposed partners in Government than in coming to grips with the problems of our economy? The ability of businesses to survive is not as strong as the Government state. Quoting overall aggregates and macro economic forecasts is no comfort to people who look at their declining order books and their rising bank borrowing. This Government must be brought back to their senses.  People are faced with real problems whether they own businesses, work in a business or have a mortgage. The Government are shelving these problems while they get on with the unedifying sight of tearing themselves asunder.</P>
    <P>In looking at the soundbite rhetoric the Taoiseach chooses to use as he tried to smooth away people's problems rather than tackle them, one is reminded of Nero fiddling while Rome burnt.  The Government must wake up and listen to the realistic proposals being put to them in order to solve these problems.  People's livelihoods are being put at risk while Ministers blandly re-echo jargon they pick up from officials on fundamentals and so on.  At the end of the day there is nothing more fundamental for a business than getting and fulfiling orders and providing employment.  Rising interest rates and falling demand are putting jobs in <Col N="270" /> those businesses at risk and the Government appear neither to notice nor to care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Border Deputy, I am disappointed that the efforts being made by the Government do not take into consideration the traders in what Deputy Cotter described last night as the Border corridor.  Many people there are living in fear, not knowing what will happen next week and dreading the coming of Christmas when they should be looking forward to it.  I listened to the debates last night and this evening and my conclusion is that this is all about money and about currency.  If sterling had remained at 90 pence to our punt we would not be in the trouble we are in today.  Therefore, I call into question the decision to break with sterling in 1979.  I do that because I was the only Deputy in the House to protest at the time, not taking into consideration future economic arguments &mdash; and I could only disprove them having experienced the future which would be very presumptuous of me listening to the learned Members on the Government benches in those days &mdash; but I argued that it was wrong to make Irish money a foreign currency in six Irish counties.  If we made sterling a foreign currency in the Republic, we were making our money foreign currency in the six Northern counties.  That was anathema to my thinking.  As I asked Deputy Roche last night, how do you unscramble scrambled eggs?  The answer is it cannot be done. However, there is no reason we should not look to the past to see where we are today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That decision was wrong and I believe the present economic climate has been influenced very much by what has happened.  The break with sterling influenced the austerity of the eighties and now for the opposite reason, having had a weaker currency during the eighties, we will now have a stronger currency in the nineties and we will go through the same morass again.  The people who will suffer most are those living in Border areas and there is no account being taken of that fact by the present Government. The reason I argue so strongly is that <Col N="271" /> enonomic policies have further reaching; implications than economics itself.  Economics and politics are intertwined, and it is preposterous to talk about political unity in advance of economic unity and to talk about political unity without addressing the issue of economics.</P>
    <P>Unless we create a society on this island where people on both sides of the Border can trade with each other without the interference of Governments we will never have a united Ireland, whatever form that unity may take.  That is very basic and is so fundamental to achieving a United Ireland that it puzzles me why educated men cannot grasp it.  If we cannot understand the meaning of the money in our pockets, how can we grasp the more difficult abstract issues?  If we cannot understand the economic issues that affect Northern Ireland, that calls into question all the major decisions taken by parties in this House concerning our relationship with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the traders in Border areas.  I would have discussed this privately with the Minister earlier this evening but for the fact that I had to speak in this House.  I have spoken to a number of Border traders, one of whom told me that his turnover for the week ending last Saturday week dropped from £9,000 to a little over £1,000.  What hope is there for a man who is relatively new in business to stand up against that situation?  All his customers are going to Northern Ireland to buy goods, not because they are cheaper there but because their money will buy more.  If we could believe that the end to our problems was in sight and we could now look towards our future, that would give hope but we are not convinced that that is the case.  Our pound might be so strong that it would cost £1.10 sterling to buy it and in such a calamitous situation how can people in Border areas continue in business?</P>
    <P>I want a decision on this from the Minister now; tomorrow will be too late for these people who have been in family businesses for generations.  They battled through the eighties, used their life savings <Col N="272" /> as reserves to bail them out of their troubles, and having survived that and adjusted to the value of their money against sterling &mdash; one can live with any change in exchange rates if one has time to adjust &mdash; something then happens that reverses the whole position, resulting in total despair.  I am pleading on behalf of people in Border areas, the hoteliers, the owners of licensed premises, the grocers, the owners of filling stations, every person in business in Border areas but particularly those in my own constituency and my own home town, Lifford, the towns of Moville, Buncrana and Letterkenny, which is the fastest growing town in the country.  There are people there who are in business for the first time who are wondering what will happen next week if the value of the punt is equal to £1.10 or £1.15 sterling.  This is a frightening situation and I am sure those of them who are having difficulties with their bank managers cannot sleep at night.</P>
    <P>The Government have ignored the land frontier between us and Great Britain, namely Northern Ireland.  If the decisions taken in this House applied to the 32 countries I would not be as emotional as I am at the moment in pleading for the people who are in the frontline in relation to this issue and who are being ignored by the present Government. To be fair to the Minister, I do not know what he is going to do to resolve the problem but he must do something because we have to show these people that there is some light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of this House for 30 years, 20 of those trying to understand the problems of Northern Ireland, the reasons for all the violence on the island of Ireland and why we cannot have better relations with Great Britain.  I have argued time and again on this issue and I thought I had got my message through to my own party but for some reason or other there is always a blinkered approach to dealing with economic issues.  When considering economic issues in this House we are independent and we think independently.  When we discuss politics we are talking about <Col N="273" /> unity.  If we are sincere about Irish unity and if we want to make a contribution towards bringing peace and normality to Northern Ireland and creating a society there of which we can all be proud, then every item of legislation that comes into this House, particularly those dealing with the economics of the island of Ireland, will have to take account of our relationship with Northern Ireland. Otherwise, we are not thinking out our course towards Irish unity correctly.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a problem and I do not envy him his task.  Previous Ministers have made major mistakes.  They convinced us that joining the EMS and breaking with sterling was the right way forward, and there are people today who will say that it has made no difference.  I know it has made a difference and the people in the Border areas know this also.  To the people who say we should not be linked to the British economy because it is a weak economy, let me ask this question.  How many young people left this island, North and South, to find a job, build a home, marry and settle down in Great Britain and how many of them returned successful young people having availed of opportunities that this island could not give them during the past ten or 12 years since breaking the link with sterling?  Surely that is the acid test in answering the question whether we should maintain the economic link with Britain or with Europe.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I always believed that Irish unity was a very high priority in Fianna Fáil but since we began to discuss the European Economic Community, the unity of Europe has become a higher priority, an absolute obsession.  The unity of Europe is to them paramount and of far more importance than the unity of Ireland, but I believe the Government have got that in reverse and that should be the other way around.  We will have to pay a certain price, our pride, but the sooner we discuss economics with Westminster and find a solution so that we can establish a common trade, free market, equality of currency and political separation, which Grattan talked about <Col N="274" /> 200 years ago, and which remains the answer to our problems on this island.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister has to deal with this difficult problem and I wish him well but I think he will have to acknowledge that Deputy Noonan and the Fine Gael Party have been more than responsible in regard to this issue.  I ask the Minister to think very seriously about my plea on behalf of the Border traders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion, which certainly has much more relevance to people in the real world than the issue which has taken up so much time in the House recently.  Ordinary people will be looking to the response of the Minister to this motion rather than to the other issues debated today.</P>
      <P>Every householder is facing financial problems as a result of interest rate rises which could have been avoided if the Government had accepted the Fine Gael strategy.  Two days before interest rates were increased by 3 per cent, Deputy John Bruton made three solid proposals to avoid the increase in interest rates and to save jobs.  These proposals were rejected by the Government even before they were read.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that thousands of householders are facing a 3 per cent increase in mortgage repayments, the Government have not reacted in a positive way to their plight.  The hard-pressed houseowner is effectively paying £80 a month extra on a £40,000 mortgage as a result of these increases.  If the Government are prepared to assist exporters by providing £50 million in market development grants, in breach of EC rules, I cannot see any reason why a similar Government commitment cannot be given to the financial institutions to protect the livelihood of exposed mortgage-holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the contribution of Deputy Quill.  One would think that her party were not in Government.  She castigated the behaviour of building societies and financial institutions on behalf of mortgage-holders.  She spoke about the <Col N="275" /> ineffectiveness of the Government in reducing prices as a result of the turbulence in the money market.  This is the type of double think people have to listen to from the Progressive Democrats. It will be exposed between now and the general election.</P>
    <P>Mortgage-holders and small businesses bear testimony to the fundamentals that are wrong in the economy.  Even before the current turbulence in the currency markets there was effectively a huge strain on personal finances due to the attitude of financial institutions who were squeezing scarce resurces out of businesses and reducing their credit terms, particularly to larger companies.  This percolated down to constitute a credit squeeze on smaller business and all other sectors of the economy.  The only Government response was to wait and see, hoping that a rising tide would lift all boats.</P>
    <P>The only response from the Minister for the Environment in respect of the problems of mortgage-holders was to meet the building societies and plead with them to do the best they could.  Decisive action is now required and I support the call by Deputy Noonan, who has detailed the necessary measures to assist small businesses and mortgage-holders by reducing interest rates.  I have not heard anybody contradict the line of action proposed in this motion.  There has been some talk about events in the past but people are concerned about what is happening in the present and what will happen in the future.  They are worried about their repayments schedule and whether they will have a job after Christmas if the present economic decline continues.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister for Finance will be in a position in the forthcoming Finance Bill to reverse many of the disturbing provisions introduced in the Finance Act earlier this year.  Serious anti-employment measures are contained in that Act. The Minister had to engage in a considerable whispering campaign, even within his own party, to withstand some of the pressure from business people on <Col N="276" /> Fianna Fáil Deputies.  He had to take on an extra employee, a public relations consultant, to withstand the pressure from the media and his own backbenchers in respect of the anti-employment measures in the 1992 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>We have been lectured day after day by the Minister of Finance that this turbulence is temporary.  If he accepts that this is true, he should have no difficulty in putting the money where his mouth is and supporting home owners and small businesses on the same temporary basis in overcoming these so called temporary problems.</P>
    <P>As a member of the South Eastern Health Board I can vouch for the huge increase in mortgage subsidies paid to mortgage-holders.  The Minister for Social Welfare is tightening the noose around those people by restricting the payments which can be made on subsidies.  That is not a helpful sign when people are hard pressed to make ends meet.  The failure by the Government to take action immediately will result in deterioration in the financial problems of many people. This will put further strain on local authorities to rehouse people and on health boards to pay mortgage subsidies.  The Department of Social Welfare will have to make further payments of supplementary welfare allowance to enable people to cope with financial hardships.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to stop talking about the problems of ordinary people and to take decisive action to assist the many people who are falling into the category of the new poor.  Fine Gael are not prepared to allow a situation to continue whereby people whose income is just over the ceiling for a third level grant or for health care under the GMS system get nothing at all. Mortgage-holders are basically in the same category.  They are largely PAYE workers who are unable to qualify for many benefits due to the sharpness of the income criteria assigned to the various schemes.  It is time to give those people a chance to live in decency.  They have not been a burden on the State.  They have been the creators of employment opportunities for thousands of people <Col N="277" /> and they have been the engine of economic development.</P>
    <P>It is a typical Fianna Fáil response that they are prepared to grant £50 million to shelter our exporters from the winds of currency turbulence and totally dismiss the financial hardships being encountered by home owners.  I appeal to the Minister to be mindful of the adverse effects on businesses and home owners. He will give a dissertation on what he is trying to achieve, but the reality in the wider world is that people are very worried. We have an opportunity and an obligation to put many of their worries to rest and to give clear and concise indication about how temporary is temporary in the currency market.  The Minister will not be able to give a satisfactory answer. This is what motivates Deputy Noonan and the Fine Gael Party to table this motion and to spell out our philosophy on how these matters should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I hope in coming weeks in deliberations on the Estimates and the forthcoming Finance Bill that we will be able to find the resources to assist the various categories of people who find themselves under pressure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to this motion.  It is regrettable that the devaluation of sterling should come at a time when the Government had achieved a reduction in borrowing and low inflation.  There was a general air of confidence in the country and abroad and our EC rating was at the highest possible level.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the Government's positive approach in setting up the market development fund and providing £50 million.  They acted quickly and positively. They brought in the development agencies in order to get the best possible advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent one of the worst hit constituencies. We depend on food processing, on poultry and dairy products, on mushrooms, furniture, textiles and so on.  In all those areas a large part of the product goes directly to our nearest neighbour, England.  The development <Col N="278" /> fund will help but there was a doubt last week about how it would apply to the mushroom growers.  The criteria is being re-examined.  I understand the committee are deliberating on it this week.  I hope the criteria used will be the labour content, in order to ensure tht mushroom growers get the allowance to which they are entitled.  The mushroom industry is very important to my region.  It is worth £50 million nationally, mainly in exports, and in my county it is worth well in excess of £30 million.  One large company in my area manufactures compost and processes and exports mushrooms.  They have a turnover of over £30 million, a wage bill of £4 million to £5 million, a workforce of 400 with 200 satellite growers and 900 part-time growers.  Now that the Dutch and Danes are pulling out of the British market we have an opportunity to expand into that market.</P>
    <P>The motion before us calls on the Government to reduce employers' PRSI payments in respect of those businesses most adversely affected.  Employers along Border areas if asked, will tell us that that is not the answer.  The motion also calls on the Government to moderate distortions in cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland by reducing the standard rate of VAT and the incidence of excise duty.  When Deputy Noonan was composing that, his tongue must have been in his cheek.  The Deputy should have reflected back on 1983 when the Deputy's party devastated that area with their 1983 budget and with subsequent budgets.  The Government then, would not give any assistance to that area although we spent years pleading with the Government.  The Government devastated that area and closed down many businesses.  I agree with Deputy Harte in what he said about Border traders now, but because of Fine Gael actions at that time we had the golden mile of supermarkets set up a couple of hundred yards from the Border.  They have been only ticking over in the last year or two due to the actions of the then Deputy, Ray MacSharry, in 1982 and our present Taoiseach in 1989, when they took remedial action to bring trade back from <Col N="279" /> across the Border.  Those supermarkets are in a great position to avail of that trade again and it is regrettable.  The contribution of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, when he stood at the Diamond in Clones, when the people pleaded with him and told him that their businesses were being devastated, was that they should go over the Border and buy the cheap goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan. I know history is very difficult along the Border and that not all Deputies remember it as it happened.  I have sympathy for what Deputy Leonard said about the immediate impact of the exchange rate with the pound sterling.  Deputy Harte earlier referred to it at some length. However, I cannot draw the same conclusion as Deputy Harte.  This economy does not have a future in seeking to restore the link with the pound sterling. The British economy is inherently in decline.  In the immediate future it is likely to worsen.  That is not the kind of economy to which we should hitch our economic fortunes.</P>
      <P>The alternative of seeking to maintain the link with the Deutschmark is probably the only realistic alternative open to the Government but it will probably inescapably result in a negotiated realignment within the ERM.  My major criticism of the Government is that they have not sought to bring sufficient influence to bear over the markets in the recent turmoil.  That can be done at European level only and through Governments acting in concert.  If we are to maintain that link there is a price to be paid in the short term <i>vis-à-vis</i> those people who are trading into Britain.  That task is an exceptionally difficult one because whereas the package of subsidies announced are worthwhile, they are by definition only a temporary solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues and I have an amendment to Deputy Noonan's motion on the Order Paper and its main purpose is to underline the difference I have with Deputy Noonan on one aspect, that is his proposition that a reduction in employers' PRSI should be part of the solution to the problems undoubtedly faced by companies selling into the UK. <Col N="281" /> The Irish version of the welfare state, such as it is, would be undermined if we started to tamper with the PRSI system which, unfortunately, the Government have done to some extent.  The claims that our PRSI rates are exceptionally high and put Irish employers at a competitive disadvantage are not borne out by the evidence.  Official figures given by the Minister for Social Welfare to a Dáil question ten days ago show that the level of employers' PRSI is not excessive compared to many of our competitors and it is well below the levels within many OECD countries.  It is 12.2 per cent here, 15.4 per cent in Norway, 17.8 per cent in Germany, 30.3 per cent in Spain, 33.2 per cent in Sweden and 38 per cent in France.  Whereas I accept that companies in the vulnerable sector face difficulties, the package of subsidies announced by the Government are far more generous than any reduction in or abolition of the PRSI system, if we accept that the average wage is quite low in many of these companies.  I do not agree with tampering with the PRSI system and I do not accept that it is exceptionally high.</P>
    <P>On the question of the impact of the interest rates on mortgage holders, especially the severe impact these interest rates will have on recent mortgage holders in particular, who also happen to be people with young families, it is worth pointing out that these increases will more than wipe out the full benefit of the increases under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> over the past two years.  A worker on the average industrial wage would have benefited by about £16.70 per week from the combined 7 per cent <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> increase over the past two years, but if the same worker has a mortgage of about £40,000 he or she will see the income drop by £21 a week.  Any reduction in the price of some goods arising from exchange rate fluctuations are unlikely to go any way towards compensating people for that also.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention a number of other points but I do not wish to encroach unduly on Deputy Noonan's generosity.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Minister did not read out the full script supplied by his civil servants and that was very wise because it is common practice at this time of year for civil servants to arrange &ldquo;offside traps&rdquo; for Ministers to get them to make commitments on the record of the House so that policy options which the civil servants do not agree with are taken off the pitch before budgetary discussions take place.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We know now that the Progressive Democrats are fully in favour of the mortgage-holders after Deputy Quill's contribution tonight and it is the big bad wolf, Fianna Fáil, that is trying to devour the mortgage-holders of Ireland and not the Progressive Democrats' tax policy.  We must accept the bona fides of the Progressive Democrats.  We have seen them on three occasions today standing up in an anguished fashion, in a crisis of emotion and conscience, explaining the principles on which they stand and then reluctantly informing the House that they have to vote against those principles.  One has to be impressed by that and we have had another example of it this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They put two questions to the Minister last night and he really did not answer either.  One was specific and the other general.  I asked him why in the last days of August this year the Government and the Central Bank which had maintained an exchange rate policy for almost five and a half years of keeping the value of the IR£1 within a whisker of 2.68DM allowed it to drift back by five pfennigs before the currency crisis.  Certainly that was the wrong signal to send to the <Col N="283" /> markets with £4.5 billion invested here. German individuals, German fund managers and German businesses got their fingers burnt and I suspect that it was a bit of sharp practice by the people in charge of exchange rate policy who were sending a signal to German investors that if they were to move money out of the Irish economy, as they were tending to do at the end of August, they were going to be burnt on the exchange rate risk, so the exchange rate was allowed drift back by five pfennigs.  That was a disastrous decision expecially when it took place just three weeks before the great currency crisis.  It has caused many problems for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about uncertainty being engendered.  He said that capital movements can threaten the stability of currencies and that it is fear of an exchange rate risk that causes foreign individuals and institutions to move money out.  I suggest to the Minister &mdash; and I put the question to him last night &mdash; that in the absence of any other explanation we must accept that it was a disastrous mistake by the Central Bank and the Department of Finance which they are embarrassed even to talk about at the moment.</P>
    <P>The second question I put to the Minister was phrased differently.  The effect of the overall devaluation across Europe, of sterling and the lire and the peseta and so on is that the punt has, in effect, been revalued by 4½ per cent.  Those of us with secure jobs &mdash; if our jobs are secure here or anywhere else in the economy &mdash; or indeed people on social welfare, on average and speaking in general terms, now find that the value of the punt in their pocket is worth 4½ per cent more than it was a couple of weeks ago.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Finance what there is in the fundamentals of the Irish economy to justify our paying ourselves a 4½ per cent increase right across the economy at this time.  I do not believe there is anything.  I agree with the Minister that the fundamentals of the Irish economy justified the exchange rate as it was but the Minister has to take <Col N="284" /> steps now to change the fundamentals to justify the new revalued rate.  The Minister knows precisely what I am talking about because the fundamentals are changing under the stress of the policy now.  The differential between ourselves and Germany now must be somewhere between four and five points on interest rates.  The Minister was very careful tonight to talk about the differential dropping from seven points five years ago to less than one point at the end of August but this is not the end of August, this is the end of October and the differential has gone up again.  There is a matrix of interest rates but certainly at different points on the scale there must be a differential again of up against five points now.  That is very disturbing, and that is one of the fundamentals.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental is the fact that there are 300,000 or more people unemployed. The stress the Border county Deputies are talking about is going to increase that figure because, despite the sticking plaster proposal brought in last week which will give some comfort in the short term, in the longer term the competitive position of industries here exporting to the UK has been eroded and, in the absence of any change in the fundamentals of the competitive position, jobs will be lost.  Everybody knows that from their own constituencies.  It is seen more clearly in the Border counties but it is true right around the country. That is another fundamental of the economy and the Minister should have dealt with these questions tonight.</P>
    <P>On the question of cross-Border trade I want to put a simple concept to the Minister.  Deputies on all sides have, for years, extolled, the value of the Single Market for 360 million people.  I have yet to hear anybody getting up and spelling out the advantages of an all-Ireland market for the five million people that live on this island.  There are huge inhibitions to trading across the Border; there are huge distortions.  Why not make it a principle of economic policy that apart from whatever talks are going on in Dublin Castle, in Stormont or in London that on the economic side we would have <Col N="285" /> an all-Ireland single economy and we would take the necessary steps to make sure that it is an integrated market.  It is not at the moment; it is subject to gross distortions especially on VAT, excise and, indeed, things like the treatment of residences for income tax purposes.  I am sure many Deputies do not know that if one lives south of the Border and works north of the Border one cannot get the PRSI allowance or the PAYE allowance. If one lives in Dundalk and works in Newry one cannot get the PAYE or the PRSI allowances &mdash; and we are talking about a United Ireland.  I could enumerate, if I had the time, a series of things that distort the situation between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six.  Yet we take up exaggerated positions about the unity of Europe and we make no attempt to create a single all-Ireland economic zone on this island.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, has responsibility for trade and marketing and her only contribution last night was to lay great emphasis on her new scheme.  I hope it works and it will give a temporary cushion to certain exporters.  However, it will not change the competitive position and when the scheme runs out if the competitive position means trading at a loss at the new relative values then they will close down. The competitive position will have to be changed.  The Minister knows precisely what I am talking about because I am sure he is running the numbers already for next year.</P>
    <P>I was astounded at Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke.  First, she did not seem to be four square behind what the Minister is saying tonight.  She said the Government had considered the PRSI <Col N="286" /> proposal, that they took it seriously, that they throught it was a possible way forward and that if her pet scheme does not work they will come back to the PRSI proposal again.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> What she said was that she rejected it for the moment.  The Minister tonight &mdash; and I think he has more credibility &mdash; rejected it out of hand.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke, has taken to scolding the importers who are not passing on the benefits of a strong punt to businessmen and householders.  However, there is no point in lecturing people.  There are importers who are profiteering from the weakness of sterling at the moment.  The Minister has a duty to act.  She has the powers in her Department.  Actions speak louder than words.  What really gets to me is Ministers going on radio and television lecturing the people when they have the powers and will not implement them.  We must get the full benefits of the weaker sterling in terms of imports.  Of course we are losing on the swings but we must gain on the roundabouts.  Otherwise it is a disaster.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I expressed concern at statements made by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications during the course of the debate in the House today.  I am particularly concerned that, as the only woman Cabinet member, she expressed questionable opinions on this amendment. She said that any wording which provokes the extremes of an argument into such vehement antipathy requires courage. I suggest that any wording that raises so many arguments from so many reasonable people must be seriously flawed. Rather than saying that it requires courage the Minister should seriously question the flaws in the wording.  A common theme throughout the debate from the Fianna Fáil side of the House is that anybody who does not agree with the Fianna Fáil view is an extremist, a political opportunist or indeed an abortionist, or has some hidden agenda.  That type of contribution to this debate is extremely unfortunate because what we are attempting to address is a very serious and sensitive issue.</P>
      <P>On 17 February 1983 in volume 340, column 494 of the Official Report, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said:</P>
      <P>... can we be certain that the existing ban on abortion will not be removed as a result of action in the courts?  The referendum will give the people rather than the courts ultimate control over policy in this area.  Abortion could become legal as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn went on to say in column 496 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>It must be clear that the only way to make certain that abortion does not become legal in Ireland in the coming years is to write into the Constitution an amendment which reinforces the existing law against abortion.</P>
    <P>We now know that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was wrong then.  Is there any reason to believe that her contribution in this House today is right?  The wording of the amendment is extremely flawed and deserves much examination.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this House is pro-life.  I find abortion difficult to deal with and I am opposed to it; but as a publicly elected representative I have a responsibility, as does every other Member of the House, to adequately and properly address the difficult and tragic situations which arise every day for a minority of women and for the unborn.  In these minority of cases difficult choices have to be made.  The Taoiseach and the Government have a responsibility not to put this greviously flawed amendment to the people for a decision.  It would be more opportune for the Taoiseach to enter into genuine dialogue with all the political parties to resolve this complex question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for sharing her time with me and giving me an opportunity to speak on this matter.  Like most people in this House, when I reflect on my political past there are some things that I regret.  I can honestly say that what I regret most in 11½ years in this House was that in the autumn of 1982 I did not do enough to oppose the nonsensical idea that we needed to write into our Constitution a pro-life amendment, as it was called.  I remember that time very well.  Perhaps it would not have made much difference, but I regret, as perhaps do other people in this House, that we did not speak out much more clearly and forcefully against the utter futility of that whole campaign, which was demonstrated to us very <Col N="292" /> clearly this year and which is the reason we are having this debate again.  There may well be people on all sides of the House today who, looking back on this debate in a few years' time, will regret they did not on this occasion speak out more clearly against the futility of what is being attempted in these three amendments before us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps some people will reflect upon that between now and 3 December, or indeed between now and the conclusion of these debates, and learn a lesson from it.  I remember very clearly the occasion in the autumn of 1982 when we had a meeting with representatives from the group who proposed the amendment &mdash; I will say nothing against those people personally or about their motivation &mdash; and I regret that more people did not say how unwise the amendment was.  We regret that now that we find ourselves in a mess.  We are having this debate as a result of that attempt to do an impossible constitutional thing at the time.</P>
      <P>The campaign at that time was based on the proposition that neither politicians nor the courts can be trusted, a very mistaken proposition.  A wording was presented to us as being an infallible way of preventing abortion.  The people who recommended that wording &mdash; the pro-life campaign, Fianna Fáil and a great many other groups, a member of one of which spoke this evening &mdash; gave, in spite of advice to the contrary, what they believed to be categoric assurances that it would have the result they wanted; but it had precisely the opposite result.  That has vindicated the advice given at the time by the then Taoiseach, the Attorney General and others, including a great number of people who made clear their reservations and were branded as abortionists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason for this debate relates to the most appalling mess made by the Government of the infamous Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty.  We still do not <Col N="293" /> know where that came from, why the Government believed it should be inserted in the Treaty and what its function was to be.  If it ever had a function, that has been totally distorted, perverted, and turned upside down since, to the point where yesterday neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Justice could tell us what the implications of these three proposals for referenda will be. Today we have to hold this debate because of gross misjudgments by a self-appointed lobby and by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that another Bill which we will debate next week &mdash; the Referendum (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill &mdash; which prescribes a title for the guidance of voters in each of the three referenda, describes the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution on the ballot paper under the heading &ldquo;Right to Life&rdquo;, which is a cyncial distortion of what it is about.  If the ballot paper should have any heading it should be in the full sense of the Bill before us &ldquo;Termination of Pregnancy&rdquo; and nothing else.</P>
    <P>It is also outrageous that members of the Government should accuse anyone in this House of wishing to sow confusion in this debate.  If I may be personal, I was disappointed to find among members of the Government making that accusation the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, a person for whom I have considerable respect as a politician and a colleague.  It is perverse and bizarre for members of the Government to accuse the Opposition of sowing seeds of confusion.  The Taoiseach said different things on different occasions about what the words in these amendments mean. The night after the Taoiseach made his pronouncement the Minister for Health said that the words mean something different; the Minister for Justice said that the words meant something different again.  If anyone in the House is sowing confusion in regard to the meaning of the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution, it is the Government.  They do not know what it means and they cannot credibly give us any guarantees about what it means.  Ministers are confused and the worst part is that they are confused about <Col N="294" /> different things at different times.  There is only one thing about which we can be absolutely sure in this debate, that we have every reason to be deeply suspicious and sceptical about any assurances given to us by the Taoiseach or by any of his Ministers on what the words in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution mean.  The experience of 1983 should clearly show that.</P>
    <P>Of course the Government are deeply divided on the issue.  I listened attentively to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I also read his circulated text with considerable interest.  There is a great deal of common ground in regard to the issues between the Minister and myself and I share many of the concerns which he set out clearly in his contribution. I find it almost incredible that Minister O'Malley should hold such views and still decide to act, as he and his colleagues in the progressive Democrats apparently intend to act, when we come to vote on these issues.  I said I found it almost incredible.  I use the word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; advisedly because his position would be utterly incredible if there had not already been a series of Cabinet disagreements on very important issues where, in each case, the Progressive Democrats decided that the issue was not important enough to force their resignation from Government.</P>
    <P>Given all that happened since the election in 1989 &mdash; and the multiplicity of undertakings in Mark I and Mark II of the Programme for Government which have not been lived up to &mdash; I wonder what kind of political cataclysm would be required for the Progressive Democrats to take their courage in their hands and decide that it was time to withdraw.  At present they remind me of a party of Arctic explorers marooned on an ice floe of their own making.  They know that if they stay there it will melt and they will be submerged and if they jump off they will probably be drowned.</P>
    <P>The proposed Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution deserves to be rejected, even if only on the grounds that it contains those fatal words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; when it speaks about <Col N="295" /> mothers.  I have heard all the reasons the Government gave for the inclusion of those words and I have also heard the medical and legal advice which lies behind the decision to include them. However, I must emphasise that this issue &mdash; as in the case of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution &mdash; requires Members of the Oireachtas to decide the form of the words to be put before the people and whether any words should be put to them.  It is not a matter for decision by any lobby groups, no matter how well intentioned; neither is it a matter for decision by lawyers or medical experts.  By all means let us take the advice of people who have <i>locus standi</i> in regard to this issue but, at the end of the day, the issues must be decided in this House, using the advice available to us according to our lights.</P>
    <P>The advice on the health issue &mdash; as indeed in regard to all the other issues &mdash; is not unanimous.  Doctors and lawyers differ but politicians still must decide. Our experience of the Eighth Amendment should surely show us that if we are given conflicting, well-founded advice on any part of the issue it is prudent to assume that some of the advice which warns us of possible unintended effect, to borrow a word from another part of this debate, should be taken very seriously, even if the possibility of those unintended effects seem remote.  That is the central lesson of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration; having listened to all the medical and legal advice I return to my politician's perception of what modern medical practice seems to tell us about how we should treat the individual.  The lesson surely is that we must take a holistic view of the interaction of all aspects of the health and life of the individual.  I was very impressed a few moments ago to hear Deputy McDaid say that, he found that our experience of life is determined by our health and we cannot separate the two.  It is good medical practice to treat the person as a whole, as a physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual <Col N="296" /> being.  Good medical practice in any branch of medicine requires that we have regard for each component of the individual personality and being.  To separate issues of health from issues of life seems to be utterly artificial.  The inspiration for the inclusion of the words in the proposed Amendment seems to come from what I can only regard as a totally unfathomable distinction drawn by the Attorney General between life threatening and life shortening conditions or events.</P>
    <P>We do not have access to the Attorney General in this House.  However, I should like to ask him what that distinction means.  If any Member of the House was walking down Kildare Street and was set on by a mugger who held a knife to his or her ribs, would we regard that as life threatening or life shortening? Would we give a damn about the difference between the two?  I do not know how the Attorney General can use this kind of artificial distinction as a basis for putting words into our Constitution.  How can any sane person base a constitutional provision on that kind of nonsensical distinction? It is surely the kind of approach to medical practice which, for years, attempted to resolve the problem of physical and mental health experienced by women in our society and in other societies by the prescription of Librium and Valium in the hope that mild sedation, physical and mental, would help a woman to deal with her problems by ignoring them instead of having them resolved.  That view is, in turn, part of a view of women which is peculiar to a particular blinkered male point of view which holds that women are different and, therefore, inferior.  It is a view which regards motherhood as a function or duty rather than as a fundamental, personal, emotional and physical choice which should be entered into only after great deliberation.  I reject that view of women and I will have no hand, act or part in putting through a constitutional provision which treats any women that way &mdash; a wife, mother, sister, aunt, friend, neighbour, a colleague or even an opponent.  We should not revert to that nonsensical, inimical and life threatening <Col N="297" /> view of woman's place in our society from which I had hoped we had begun to move away.</P>
    <P>Taking that view on these issues, I have to reject utterly any assurance given to us by the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Health or any other Minister about what that particular exclusion in the text of the amendment means for women.  None of them is in a position to give us any assurances as to what that exclusion means for the treatment of women in Ireland if that referendum is passed.  I am prepared to go as far as to believe that those Ministers may very well mean that the assurances they give reflect their own personal and true intentions, but they cannot expect us to believe, in the light of what happened with the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, that they can guarantee that those words will actually mean what those Ministers say they mean and only that.  When any doubt or challenge arises the only body that can tell us what the words mean is the Supreme Court.  It is a gross error to introduce into our Constitution a distinction between threats to life and threats to health based on this insane lawyer's artificial distinction &mdash; and it is the distinction that I say is insane, not the lawyer &mdash; between life threatening and life shortening, which, as far as I have been able to find out, has no basis whatsoever in medical doctrine, practice or fact.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment also contains a reference to self destruction that excludes the risk of self destruction from being a justification for termination of a pregnancy.  Conventional wisdom as we have heard it in the past few weeks and the weight of legal and medical advice seems to indicate that if we were to allow the risk of self-destruction as a grounds for abortion what we would be doing in effect is providing for open abortion, abortion on demand.  The Government say they want to avoid making abortion available on demand, and the way they choose to do so is by excluding the risk of self destruction from the terms of the proposed amendment.  Incidentally, the Government tell us that that is the only <Col N="298" /> way to avoid making abortion available on demand.  The same Government tell us that if the proposed amendment is not carried they will introduce legislation that will have the effect of ensuring that the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the X case cannot and will not be used as a justification for widespread abortion, abortion on demand.  The logic of that seems to me to be that the Government are saying that the Supreme Court decision means abortion on demand, and they are going to legislate.  The Government say that they do not want to have abortion on demand.  If the Government are going to legislate they must therefore intend to propose to us &mdash; however much <i>in terrorem</i> it may be &mdash; something that would limit, circumvent or restrict the grounds for abortion in some way.  Unless the Government are being completely cynical in this, with the intention of producing words only to terrorise the people who might have the temerity to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum, the Government must believe that there is some way of restricting the scope of application of the Eighth Amendment as it now stands.  If the Government believe that it would be possible to do that in the event that the Twelfth Amendment were not carried they must also, if they are even half-way honest, believe that that could be done even if a modified version of the Twelfth Amendment were put before the people and passed.</P>
    <P>I have heard the legal and medical advice and I have listened to what conventional wisdom says, and I do not have anything to put in its place, I readily admit that, but I have to confess that that conventional wisdom and legal and medical advice leave me sceptical.  Simplistic argument from alleged cause to possible effect leaves me unsatisfied, whether that argument comes from a legal expert, a medical expert or a constitutional commentator.</P>
    <P>Even more than that, one thought keeps coming back to me as I listen to all this debate: how will we react and what will our consciences say to us when the day comes &mdash; as it most surely will &mdash;<Col N="299" /> when it is found that a woman, by reason of being pregnant, has taken her life, notwithstanding a supportive family, social and community environment?  For the relatives of any such woman and for anybody who cares, the current conventional wisdom and all of the legal and medical advice will disappear like a puff of smoke and those of us who will know about it will be left with a huge question mark.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of that aspect because my party have proposed in the Seanad a Bill to decriminalise suicide.  I think many people in the House would support that measure.  That Bill sets out to achieve a certain number of objectives. We want to decriminalise suicide in order that coroners can bring in verdicts of suicide so that it will be possible to investigate, if we can, what the causes of the suicide were.  We all know that there are many suicides in this country that are not recorded as suicide for all the reasons with which I shall not bore the House tonight.  What if we were to succeed in decriminalising suicide and were then to find out that in this country every year some women &mdash; I do not know how many, the figure is not ascertainable &mdash; take their own lives, are driven to that extremity, because they are pregnant and feel that their circumstances would not allow them, for one reason or another, to carry a baby to term and to raise that child?  I do not know how many such cases there are; all I know is that there are some.</P>
    <P>There might very well be cases in which, though the family of such a woman, her extended family, her neighbours and her friends would have had among them people who could have been relied on to support the woman both morally and materially in the raising of a family, she decided that suicide was the only way out for her.  What does conventional wisdom say to us about a case of that kind?  What do the legal experts and the medical experts tell us about such a case?  They cannot tell us anything.  Yet this Government say they are confident they have every good reason for excluding the ground of suicide as a basis for <Col N="300" /> even considering a termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Not all of the advice goes in the same direction.  I shall not bore the House by going into detail.  I shall only make reference to the advice.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday last two eminent practitioners produced a report on their review of the literature.  Also last week the Psychological Society of Ireland produced their own statement and a review of the research.  It makes very interesting reading and there is a great deal more to be examined and debated.  Those reflections about the health issue and about the suicide issue should surely be reflections that at the very least would cause the Government to pause in their gallop towards holding the referenda on 3 December.</P>
    <P>There are apparently three reasons the Government are anxious to go ahead with these amendments.  The House heard the Taoiseach on that subject today.  He says he has given his word.  It is very honourable to keep one's word, but the Taoiseach expects the Opposition parties and this House to help him keep his word on this issue, when he is not too worried about others, when his Government and a Cabinet subcommittee have spent six or seven months combing out the issues &mdash; and they are still confused, they still think the words mean different things &mdash; but expect the House in the space of a few days to come to conclusions on that.  The second reason the Taoiseach apparently gave was that he wants to get the show on the road, whatever that means.  If that is part of the Taoiseach's motive I would have to question his seriousness.  The third reason, which the Taoiseach apparently gave in public on RTE one day last week, is that if the referenda are delayed for any time after 3 December the referenda and Christmas shopping will get in each other's way.  If that is what the Taoiseach has in his mind then I have to conclude that he has no real conception &mdash; to use a malapropism &mdash; of what he is at and the importance of the issue he is trying to rush through the House.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach is thin on philosophy, <Col N="301" /> but that is absolutely threadbare. If the Taoiseach and the Government are really serious about a proper potitical evaluation of all these issues then they have to give more time to this.  I do not think even the Government have had a proper political evaluation, or else why would the two parties in Government be totally at odds on the issue and why would Ministers in the same Government be running related briefs telling us that the words mean different things at different times to different people?</P>
    <P>I conclude where I started.  Frankly, I would be unable to live with my conscience if we repeated the same mistake that we made in 1983 and allow ourselves to be pushed into a fundamental and unnecessary, but certainly ill considered, set of referenda without the political, human and moral dimensions having been properly debated, whatever about the medical and legal implications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Roche.  I understand we have 45 minutes.  First of all, I would like to state that I do not question the intention and the bona fides of the Government and the manner in which they address this very complex and difficult issue.  When the courts interpret what we do here they will not look at what was said by any Minister as being his intention; they will look at what we insert into the Constitution or into the legislation.  They have made it very clear that is no part of their function to look behind what is written either in the Constitution or in the legislation.  They would see it as an obligation to implement that intention through the appropriate legal formula.  Second, in relation to intention, there is some precedent where intention has clearly not been realised.  Perhaps the most significant precedent is that of the intention of David Steel when he introduced the Medical (Termination of Pregnancy) Bill in the House of Commons on 22 July 1966.  When introducing that legislation he said, and I quote from column 1075 of <i>Hansard</i> of 22 July 1966:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to stamp out back-street <Col N="302" /> abortions, but it is not the intention of the Promoters of the Bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on request.</P>
    <P>Clearly that was his position and that of those who promoted the Bill at that time. In the event it is a matter of fact that what has resulted in England, despite the intentions and the bona fides of David Steel and his co-promoters, has been without any doubt abortion on request.  Therefore we have clear indications that intentions alone will not bring about the result we want to achieve to regulate order in our society in the manner in which we feel obliged to do it.  At that time he also said there were various estimates of the number of abortions taking place in England, that these were somewhere in the region of 40,000, but some people said the number could be as high as 200,000 per annum.  By any objective judgment at this point, whatever about the accuracy of the estimate of between 40,000 and 200,000, we also know as a fact &mdash; and facts speak for themselves &mdash; that the number of abortions in England now is a vast multiple of the higher number of 200,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to make my case and then he can make his.  If the Deputy wishes to question those figures, fair enough.  Incidentally, David Steel also said, and I quote from column 1070 of the same debate:</P>
      <P>Therefore we find that whereas at one end of the country &mdash; in Aberdeen, under the wider ambit of Scots law and under the practice of Professor Sir Dugald Baird and his colleagues &mdash; a fairly large proportion of those desiring medical terminations of their pregnancies are able to achieve this, in some other parts of the country it is almost impossible.</P>
      <P>The other three means are all illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, Britain has changed <Col N="303" /> dramatically from the time that that legislation was introduced, the purpose of which was not to introduce abortion on demand.  For that reason it is a very deep and complex issue.</P>
    <P>Like many others in Ireland, I have a deep abhorrence of abortion.  Equally &mdash; and I hope I share this view with the vast majority of Irish people &mdash; I want to ensure that all necessary medical treatment at all times is available to save the life of the mother in any circumstance of the kind we are dealing with here.  I have to acknowledge I am dealing with a matter in which I do not have either competence or professional experience.  I should like to quote from one of a number of consultants who wrote to me:</P>
    <P>My experience over forty one years, and I have seen a few maternal deaths, has been that there are no indications for direct abortion to save the woman's life.  To suggest otherwise is not true. This is not to say that women who require treatment of any illness in pregnancy should not receive it, even if this should place the baby at risk.  It is possible that, occasionally, the risk may result in the loss of the baby, but this is not the intended effect of the treatment which is to cure the mother.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state:</P>
    <P>If there was a case for carrying out abortions in pregnancy to save a mother's life, surely this would have been reported in the maternity hospital statistics from Dublin, which have been published for fifty years or more. In these reports all abnormal maternity cases are analysed in detail, including any maternal deaths that may have occurred.</P>
    <P>That is one man's view and I acknowledge, as the Minister has said, that there are different views on this.  But it does appear that these reports, which are there to inform and update the consultants involved, are consistent in that direction. As a consequence of what has happened since 1983 it is fair to say that the public at <Col N="304" /> this point, even in conservative Ireland, would wish that we their representatives could be addressing our minds to something more pressing for them, even those who reject and abhor abortion.</P>
    <P>There has been a sorry sequence of events since 1983.  I think I am free to say &mdash; and I will allow myself to put it on the record because it is well known within our party &mdash; that when it was originally proposed in 1983 that I strongly advised against the introduction of the pro-life amendment as it was called.  I saw no need either because of the constitutional position or the legal position.  I found myself on one occasion even in the position of taking an action based on the Civil Liability Act, 1961, in which the unborn had acquired a right through what we did here to an action after birth in respect of a trauma to the mother before birth.  To me at that point the line was consistent and clear, but in the event we had a referendum.  My concern then was that the words that were being imported would be capable of interpretation of the kind we have now had and therefore we have had the reference to the Supreme Court.  I might have a view on that too but I do not propose to offer it here.  The Supreme Court gave their interpretation of the formula of wording used based on the criterion of real and substantial risk to the life of the mother and the risk of suicide.  The Amendments being put forward now are a consequence of that decision.</P>
    <P>The constitutional Amendments relate to three elements: the right to travel, the right to information and the substantive issue.  I have said consistently &mdash; I hold this view more strongly now than when I first expressed it at a Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting held some months ago &mdash; that it is a nonsense in a democratic country to hold a referendum on the right to travel.  It should be pointed out that totalitarian states such as the Soviet Union, Albania and China only survived by preventing their people from travelling.  If any of those countries had decided to introduce a referendum to change their constitution so that people would have the right to travel it would <Col N="305" /> have been regarded as a significant move. As I said, thousands of Irish people have exercised their democratic right to travel and it is a nonsense to try to introduce into our Constitution a right which already exists.</P>
    <P>I have reread the judgments given by the Supreme Court judges in the X case.  I obtained copies of these judgments from the Library.  Unless there has been some change in the meantime and those judgments have been somehow changed or qualified, I cannot agree with the Minister's statement, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decided by a three to two majority that while an injunction would not be given to restrain a woman from travelling abroad, such an injunction can be given to restrain travel abroad to obtain an abortion where there is no such risk.</P>
    <P>I cannot find such a statement in my copies of the judgments.  I have read the judgments delivered by Mr. Justice O'Flaherty, the late Mr. Justice McCarthy and Mr. Justice Hederman.  The Chief Justice makes it quite clear that having dealt with the substantive issue, the other matters come within the category &mdash; this term is well known to lawyers &mdash; of <i>obiter dictum.</i>  He offered views in relation to the right to travel.  As I said, I have read the Supreme Court judgments and I cannot find any reference to the need to limit the right to travel.  Of course, this is not the major issue.  Therefore, I do not think it is necessary to introduce a constitutional amendment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the right to information. Many views have been expressed about the Supreme Court decision, whether they were right or wrong and whether they correctly interpreted the views of the people.  It is a principle of the Supreme Court that they bind themselves by existing decisions unless they change them.  I am referring to the principle of <i>stare decisis</i>, stand by your decision.  As recently as 16 March 1988 in the Attorney General and Open Door Counselling <Col N="306" /> Limited case the Supreme Court held, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Court doth declare that the activities of the Defendants, their servants or agents in assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel abroad to obtain abortions by referral to a clinic; by the making of their travel arrangements, or by informing them of the identity and location of and method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics are unlawful, having regard to the provisions of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is the law as it stands.  The Minister said that the issue of information and counselling did not come before the Supreme Court in the X case but in previous cases the court decided that the dissemination of information on abortion was unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3.º  This is correct.  However, he went on to say that one effect of the decision in the X case appears to be that it is not unlawful to communicate information. I am not going to argue this point; I am simply saying that that is simply an interpretation of what would appear to be the effect when the law and the Supreme Court decision make it clear and do not need an interpretation. However, these are not the crucial issues in this debate.</P>
    <P>A number of issues arose out of the Supreme Court decision in the X case, one of which was the suicide issue.  The Government have decided to vary the Supreme Court decision in regard to the provision of information.  I agree with them in this respect.  I do not question the right of the Government or this Legislature to do that.  To a certain extent they are also varying the Supreme Court <i>obiter dictum</i> in regard to the right to travel. This is not of major importance.  As I said from the beginning, this is not even an issue at this point; we are asking the people to vote on what I regard as a characteristic of democracy.</P>
    <P>If we are varying the Supreme Court in those areas, I do not understand why we should feel totally bound not to vary their decision in regard to the substantive <Col N="307" /> issue.  During the course of the X case the State argued at all times that the test to be applied was one of immediate or inevitable risk to the life of the mother. The Supreme Court held, as they are entitled to do, that it would be more appropriate to have regard to real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. This is where I have major problems.  It is open to the Government to make it clear that they believe &mdash; I believe this view is shared by the vast majority of Irish people &mdash; the test should be of immediate and inevitable risk to the life of the mother as distinct from a real and substantial risk to her life.  However, this is not being done.  I have serious concern in this area.  The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill states:</P>
    <P>It shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving rise to a real and substantial risk to her life, not being a risk of self-destruction.</P>
    <P>The use of such phraseology invites interpretation. Whether we agree or disagree &mdash; I respect the view of those people who disagree &mdash; about the provision restricting divorce, at least it clearly states that no law shall be enacted to provide for the dissolution of marriage.  Some say that this provision should not be there while others say it should be, but at least it is clear.  If we use phraseology such as &ldquo;save the life, as distinct from the health, of the mother where there is an illness or disorder of the mother giving risk to a real and substantial risk to her life&rdquo; we run the risk &mdash; I agree with the intention of the Government in this area &mdash; of a new range of interpretations which quite frankly I do not think is desirable.  The intentions of the Government in this area could be effectively met by saying &ldquo;it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother&rdquo;. The provision in regard to the rights of the mother will not in any event replace <Col N="308" /> the original Amendment; it is an addition to it and the courts can interpret it.  I am very worried about this wording.  A cogent case can be made for the introduction of legislation to clarify and regulate the Government's intention in this area.</P>

      <P>I think it is fair to say that the majority of doctors in professional practice who will push out the limits are not those who adhere to the standards of the General Medical Council. They were not the people who pushed out the limits in the United Kingdom.  It was others who took a different interpretation, one not supported by the majority of their colleagues, not to mention the Medical Council.  They pushed out the limits and the 40,000 or 200,000 abortions, depending on the figure one took, became millions.  I am aware that some of those are Irish women but that is not a major factor in the huge increase in the abortion rate in England.  For that reason, it is desirable that we leave open the prospect of introducing legislation to regulate the application of this referendum. I am glad the Minister has not closed his mind to this prospect.</P>
      <P>This is a very complex issue and I acknowledge that the Government have inherited it.  I accept that the Government of which I was a member, in a sense, passed this problem on but that is history.  I hope that what we are about to do now will not give rise to further complications which will mean that we will be constantly bedevilled by discussion on this and, at the end of the day, not protect the life of the mother or the unborn one whit more than in 1983.  This wording concerns me but the position arising from the Supreme Court decision requires certain adjustments, otherwise a threatened suicide could be put forward as a case for abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that what we do now will mean that we will have finality, clarity and protection for the life of the unborn and the mother.  Having regard to the practice <Col N="309" /> over the years I do not see why there is any reason one should be put at risk to protect the other; 50 years of practice proved that not to be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very complex and stark issue.  There are few issues which could be of more fundamental importance than it.  I am pleased that the debate tonight has been conducted in a somewhat calmer tone than some of the contributions last night.</P>
      <P>There is a great tradition in Ireland of sticking our heads in the sand in the hope that issues will resolve themselves, of hoping that further discussion, another report or reconsideration of the issue will push decision day to the point where the problem resolves itself.  However, that is not the worst characteristic of public debate in Ireland.  The worst characteristic is that our tradition has been to tear ourselves asunder in debate, not simply to prove one's point but to destroy the other's viewpoint.  Some of the epithets that were slung around last night had that venal underpinning in them. This latter characteristic of Irish debate was well dealt with in the beef tribunal last week when a former Taoiseach quoted a stanza from W.B. Yeats's poem &ldquo;Leaders of the Crowd&rdquo;.  He stated:</P>
      <P>They must to keep their certainty accuse</P>
      <P>all that are different of a base intent pull down established honour; hawk for news,</P>
      <P>whatever their loose fantasy invent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That characteristic of debate simply adds to the confusion, distaste and dismay that <Col N="310" /> must exist up and down the country with regard to this issue presenting itself again.</P>
    <P>Another characteristic of Irish debate is to descend to humbug and hypocrisy and to focus on the past rather than the future.  There has been a great deal of rewriting of history, of focusing on the past and wondering who was more venal than whom in 1982.  That does not matter. All that should matter is that we are faced with the reality of the problem and we must make decisions in that regard. Those distressing elements have existed in this debate.</P>
    <P>I have my certainties on this issue and I hope I can express them without accusing anyone.  I know there are diametrically opposing views in this House, I have always taken the view that abortion is abhorrent.  That is a deeply felt personal conviction but if we try meddling in this issue and take on board some of the lunatic suggestions that have been put forward, we would end up with a more horrific situation than we found ourselves in earlier this year.  I hope I can express my views without being accused.</P>
    <P>Three parties in this House have a very clear view on this issue.  The Democratic Left Party hold a view which I do not share but they have expressed that view very honestly.  They are a pro-choice party although Deputy Byrne might take issue with the use of words &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo;. I do not say that they are pro-choice in an accusatory manner.  They believe abortion is a right which, subject to certain conditions &mdash; they have spelled them out &mdash; should be available.  I do not agree with Democratic Left but I admire their candour.  They are not afraid to express their views and we should acknowledge courage where we see it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that this whole area should be dealt with in legislation. It is clear that this view also exists in other quarters of this House.  They realise that this would mean legislating in regard to the decision in the X case which would mean going beyond the common interpretation of the people's judgment as recorded in the 1983 referendum. Deputy Ferris gave his interpretation of <Col N="311" /> what the people did in 1983 with which I am in accord.  I do not agree with the view of the Labour Party.  If one wishes to protect a fundamental right the only appropriate place to do so is in a constitution. However, I respect the fact that they have a view and their willingness to put it forward with clarity.  I also laud their consistency because as far back as 1982 they argued that all that was needed in this regard was legislation.  I differed from them at that time.  I was not a participant in the debate in 1983 simply because I was not here, not because I was not involved in politics.  I had grave doubts about that whole matter at that time.  In Government, the Labour Party argued that legislation could achieve what most Irish people wanted.</P>
    <P>The view of the Fianna Fáil Party was elaborated on by the Minister for Justice last night.  I do not intend to add or detract from that view because it was made clearly.  Some of the epithets from other spokespersons distressed me.  For example, some of the language used by Deputy Shatter was objectionable, unnecessarily vitriolic and personalised. I do not know what can be achieved by that in this debate.  There will be enough bitterness in the weeks running up to the referenda without adding to it.  The wording the Minister put before us has been the subject of a great deal of parsing and analysis and will be the subject of a great deal more.  The two parties I mentioned have indicated their outright opposition to it.  I accept the sincerity of their arguments but I do not find them persuasive.  I find it impossible to accept some of the philosophical underpinnings of their arguments but at least I know where they stand.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition's party's response to this issue is another matter. They object to the starkness of the wording.  After the wording was published I admit that I was stunned by what appeared to be a very stark set of words, the reality of course is that this is a very stark issue and whatever about the starkness of the words, they at least go to the <Col N="312" /> heart of the issue.  The fact that there are people on both extremes of this argument, I do not mean extremes in this House but extremes outside this House, who have found almost as much equally to condemn, suggests to me that the Minister has found middle ground.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand, for example, why Fine Gael are making such an issue out of the reference to health.  I realise it is a stark set of words.  I cannot understand why people, who object to those words but at the same time understand the reason for their inclusion, cannot produce an alternative set of words.  The arguments put forward by the Minister for the use of that particular phrase seem to be cogent and clear.  They at least give us choices with which we can agree or disagree.  If we remove that phrase, which I understand many Members have found objectionable, we will create a situation which would not be favoured by the vast majority of Deputies and we would be misleading the people in that they might have to bear the impact of another referendum for another change in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Irish people and many supporters of the main Opposition party and the majority of the backbenchers I have spoken to, would seem to be at variance with some of the views of the party's Front Bench spokespersons.  Though I have tried to understand exactly where Fine Gael stand on this issue I have failed to do so.  From the speeches made here over the last two days the party appear to be facing at least three different directions. They want to extend the debate. Their spokesman who regularly comes into this Chamber to rail against the Government for failing to bring forward proposals on different issues argues that the timetable put forward by the Minister for this issue is too short.  Even though we are going to tear ourselves apart again on this issue over the next seven weeks, there seems to be a suggestion that if we prolong the agony it would in some way be a good thing.  I contest that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Their spokesman tells us that he has had discussions with members of the <Col N="313" /> medical profession who shared his views in regard to the danger of incorporating the reference to health.  I have had discussions with members of the medical profession as well.  There are copious references signed by people in authority in the IMO, by gynaecologists, obstetricians and psychologists.  In all the specialties there are people on both sides of the argument.  We all know that there are medical doctors on both sides of the argument.  It has been suggested by the leading Opposition party particularly, that there is a view in regard to the psychiatry aspect.  I read Dr. Anthony Clare's paper with interest.  It was a very absorbing and timely paper and it has been referred to a good deal in this debate in relation to the suicide issue.  Dr. Anthony Clare is not the only psychiatrist with a view on this.  Professor Patricia Casey's article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 18 March portrays a contrary view.  I will deal with the suicide issue later.</P>
    <P>We would have little difficulty in finding lawyers and barristers who differ &mdash; verbal battles and dextrous differentiation are the lawyers' trade &mdash; and Deputy Shatter knows that better than most.</P>
    <P>This matter is of such a fundamental nature and opinions on it are so polarised that it is futile to suggest that if we wait another week, another month or another year that some commonly acceptable set of words, which encompass all the various aspirations, will emerge.  We know that that is not the case.  It is better to face that now and to bring the issues, stark as they are, to the electorate at an early date, rather than prevaricate endlessly on this issue.  Further prevarication on this issue would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects of the contributions from Fine Gael which I find extraordinary.  One was the manner in which they dealt with the suicide issue. My understanding was, with the exception of one or two conscientious objections from that party, that in general the party accepted that the suicide issue had to be addressed and, in fact, there was agreement with the Government that it <Col N="314" /> should be excluded as a reason for allowing abortion.  Yet tonight that does not appear to be the line taken by Deputy Dukes and by other speakers.  I am amazed at what seems to be a change of direction in the party's policy &mdash; if they have a policy on this &mdash; during the course of the contributions over the last 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been paid to a very timely produced paper by Dr. Anthony Clare and a colleague last weekend.  That paper provided a service in that it gave an analysis of some of the material that has been published on the issue and the relationship between suicide and abortion. I read that paper and many other papers with interest and I have some of them here.  The only area in which there appears to be any common agreement in all of these papers is a surprising one. There is a conclusion in a paper by Louis Appleby on which there seems to be general agreement.  The paper gives the conclusion that motherhood seems to protect against suicide.  Concern for dependants may be an important focus for suicide prevention in clinical practice. However, the point may be made that it is not those who move in this direction that we should be considering, but those who are tempted or pressured to go in that direction.  I believe the proper and appropriate method of dealing with threatened suicide is not abortion, the forcing of one trauma on top of another trauma for a woman.  I believe that care, attention and nursing, and if necessary an expansion of psychiatric care, even in-house care, is what is required in that particular case.  I am not a doctor and I am not qualified to give an opinion.  The only answer I can get from an earnest and honest search in existing literature that I can produce from one of the universities is that there is great confusion and no general conclusion among the psychiatrists in either this city or on the international front.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the contribution from Fine Gael which I had hoped to deal with at length but which I will now deal with briefly is the continuous reference back to 1982.  I do not believe that <Col N="315" /> references back in history will serve any purpose.  If there was culpability at that time it was shared.  It is, after all, a historical fact that it was Deputy FitzGerald and the then Senator Hussey who first met the pro-life movement in April 1981. They gave an instant pledge without any proper consultation as to precisely where such a measure would lead.  Deputy FitzGerald suggested last night that it is politically acceptable to move in one direction because your opponent is moving in that direction, but it was Deputy FitzGerald who initiated the movement in that direction.  I do not say that Deputy FitzGerald was wrong.  If there were cogent arguments which suggested there was going to be a constitutional threat to the life of unborn children he was probably right and he would be on the same side as I on that issue.</P>

      <P>I will conclude on this point.  We should move away from this writing and rewriting of history.  The reality is that it has nothing to do with this debate.  We cannot change history, but we can learn from it.  The debate in 1983 &mdash; during which there were many attempts by Deputies to tar each other &mdash; was one of the most disgraceful episodes in our democracy.  I would hope that whatever views Deputies have, and I feel very strongly on one side of this issue, that they will not descend to the levels that were descended to at that time.  For every argument about what happened in 1982 and 1983 that can be put forward by Fine Gael we could put forward a separate set of arguments.  That is an amateurish and childish way of conducting debate and it has nothing to do <Col N="316" /> with the issue.  I would hope in the balance of contributions from Fine Gael that they will address the issue and clarify where they stand.  I believe Fine Gael are a very strong pro-life party and that there is a diversity of view within that party, as there is in Fianna Fáil.  We should acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>I believe that at the end of the day the proposition being put to the people in this referendum is probably the best and the only way we can achieve what the people sought to achieve in 1983.  At least we owe it to the people to offer them the choice of re-establishing where they stand on this issue by way of referendum.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Roche for sharing time.  The abortion debate is a test of how we do things in the Dáil and how we address the many and complex issues we are trying to deal with in the very short space of four days.  The abortion issue inevitably raises questions as to what extent, if at all, matters of this nature should be enshrined in our Consituation. What is the purpose of a Constitution? As I see it, the purpose of a Constitution is to enshrine the basic structure as to how we govern ourselves. It should deal with the courts and fundamental rights, and by and large our Constitution does this.  The principle of having a written Constitution which cannot be altered by legislation but must be submitted to the people for approval is as it should be &mdash; the more we can involve the people the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask ourselves what we in Dáil Éireann should do to address the consequences of the Supreme Court decision on the X case.  It is no understatement to say that this judgment came as a bombshell to those people who supported the referendum in 1983.  In spite of expert legal advice which the supporters of this Amendment obtained, it did not stand up in the Supreme Court. There is no certainty that the Government's proposed Amendment or any Amendment thereof will pass the court's scrutiny.  Therefore, I conclude that matters of this nature should not be put into the Constitution.  This matter has <Col N="317" /> been further exacerbated by the decision of the Government to put a Protocol into the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government are insisting in railroading this extremely complex and sensitive matter through the Dáil in four days is absolutely scandalous. The fact that the Report Stage of the Bill will be taken immediatley after the Committee Stage is extremely unsatisfactory. The style of the present Government is akin to a bull rushing at a gate.  We saw exactly the same phenomenon when the Taoiseach insisted on holding the Maastricht Referendum to ratify a treaty which his own Minister for Foreign Affairs admitted to me in Dáil Éireann did not exist.  This referendum was conducted at a huge cost to the people.</P>
    <P>There are people on both sides of this debate who maintain that the issues are very clear cut.  I certainly do not subscribe to this simplistic attitude.  This whole issue is extremely complex and quite unsuited to being dealt with in a few lines in our Constitution.  I would remind the House that what the Government are trying to do in these Bills is to amend Article 40.3.3º.  It can be argued that there are already adequate safeguards in our Constitution dealing with the right to life of the unborn.  Surely we should now have another look at Article 40.3.3º.  I do not think sufficient thought has been given to this matter.</P>
    <P>I had hoped at the beginning of this session that we could arrive at a consensus on this issue but this has not proved possible.  I do not think we tried hard enough.  As far as I can see, there is consensus in the House on the travel issue and near consensus on the information issue.  There is a large measure of agreement throughout the country on these two issues and I will be supporting the wording in the two relevant Bills.  However, on the substantive issue there is no consensus even on how the matter should be approached. I wish the Minister had accepted Deputy John Bruton's suggestion to postpone the debate on the substantive issue.  This matter should be dealt with by legislation <Col N="318" /> followed by a referendum so that the people can have the last word.  That is the exact opposite to what we are doing. I would argue that a strong case can be made to restore the citizens' initiative to our Constitution which was taken away from the people in 1937.</P>
    <P>I would have to argue that any form of yes or no answer to a question as complex as this is a very blunt instrument.  The Green Party have always favoured the use of a preferendum, that is, a proposition given a number of different choices rather than a referendum, which by its nature has a simple yes or no answer.  Indeed, this matter was adverted to in the correspondence columns of the newspapers recently when it was suggested that people be given four different proposals upon which legislation would be based.  This again would be a considerable improvement on the confrontational politics that we are engaged in this week.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to make it quite clear that it is the policy of the Green Party that when the life of the mother is threatened, then the mother must have full access to all necessary medical treatment.</P>
    <P>To summarise my views on the way forward, this is such an important and complex issue that we just cannot afford to make a mistake by rushing at it.  We cannot afford another inadequate, inaccurate constitutional Amendment and must take proper care to ensure that what we do in this House will stand the test of time and the scrutiny of the Supreme Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is widespread agreement on the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, so I will be addressing myself to the Twelfth Amendment.  I have believed since I first gave serious consideration to the issue of abortion that the Constitution is not the best vehicle for legislation in respect of abortion.  The prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act prevented unlawful abortion in this country for 120 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1983 pro-life amendment, which <Col N="319" /> according to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, &ldquo;was designed to preserve the prohibition on unlawful abortion contained in the 1861 Act&rdquo;, fell at the first fence in the first legal challenge on the substantive issue in the X case earlier this year.  It seems that the statutory prohibition in the 1861 Act was more effective than the constitutional prohibition introduced in 1983.</P>
    <P>The Constitution means whatever the Supreme Court decides it means at any time, so clearly we can never be absolutely certain what any Amendment to the Constitution means when framed, debated, passed by this House and endorsed by the people.  This is particularly so as the Supreme Court, especially since the sixties, has regarded the Constitution as an organic document which must be interpreted in its totality. They also expect it to be interpreted in the light of the circumstances of the times in which the interpretation is made.  It must also be interpreted in accordance with the preamble to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the course of his judgment in McGee <i>v.</i>  The Attorney General, 1974, Mr. Justice Walsh stated as follows:</P>
    <P>In this country, it falls finally upon the judges to interpret the Constitution and in doing so to determine, where necessary, the rights which are superior or antecedent to positive law or which are imprescriptible or inalienable. In the performance of this difficult duty there are certain guidelines laid down in the Constitution for a judge.  The very structure and content of the Articles dealing with fundamental rights clearly indicate that justice is not subordinate to the law.  In particular, the terms of Section 3 in Article 40 expressly subordinate the law to justice.  Both Aristotle and the Christian philosophers have regarded justice as the highest human virtue. The virtue of prudence was also esteemed by Aristotle, as by the philosophers of the Christian world.  But the great additional virtue introduced by Christianity was that of charity &mdash;<Col N="320" /> not the charity which consists of giving to the deserving for that is justice, but the charity which is also called mercy. According to the Preamble, the People gave themselves the Constitution to promote the common good, with due observance to prudence, justice and charity so that the dignity and freedom of the individual might be assured.  The judges must, therefore, as best they can from their training and experience, interpret these rights in accordance with their ideas of prudence, justice and charity.  It is but natural that from time to time the prevailing ideas of these virtues may be conditioned by the passage of time; no interpetation of the Constitution is intended to be final for all time.  It is given in the light of prevailing ideas and concepts.</P>
    <P>It is worth asking, how a Minister for Justice can give such guarantees to this House as to the certainty of how words can be interpreted when one of the principle advocates of the type of constitutional interpretation we now have, has spoken as I have quoted?</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in the course of his judgment in the State (Healy) <i>v.</i>  O'Donoghue in 1976 in the Irish Reports at page 374, Chief Justice O'Higgins spoke as follows:</P>
    <P>The Preamble to the Constitution records that the People seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of prudence, justice and charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored and concord established with other nations, do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.</P>
    <P>In my view, this Preamble makes it clear that rights given by the Constitution must be considered in accordance with concepts of prudence, justice and charity, which may gradually change or develop as society changes and develops, and which fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with prevailing ideas.  The Preamble envisages a Constitution <Col N="321" /> which can absorb or be adapted to such changes.  In other words, the Constitution did not seek to impose for all time the ideas prevalent or accepted with regard to these virtues at the time of its enactment.</P>
    <P>That is worth repeating.  Justice O'Higgins the former Chief Justice talks about interpreting the Constitution in accordance with the virtues of prudence, justice and charity which are laid out in the Preamble, but then he says that this interpretation may gradually change and develop as society changes and develops and will fall to be interpreted from time to time in accordance with the prevailing ideas.  After reading that quotation it is worth asking how the present Minister for Justice can give guarantees in this House as to what any form of words inserted in the Constitution will mean, when it is up to the Supreme Court to decide in accordance with the Preamble to the Constitution in a changing society what the words mean at any time in any test case.  If Deputies and members of the public would only take on board the clearly stated views of several Supreme Court judges, they would find no difficulty in explaining the dichotomy between what the people thought they were voting for in 1983 and what the judges decided in the X case almost ten years later, because that is the way constitutional interpretations are made, and that is the way they have to be made, according to these eminent jurists, to be consistent with the organic nature of the Constitution and arising from the Preamble to the Constitution itself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Chief Justice Finlay referred with approval to those quotations and actually incorporated them in the X judgment when he made it clear that he was following the same approach.  It is quite clear therefore that it is not possible to pin down the Supreme Court in advance to a particular interpretation of words in the Constitution, and to attempt to do so is futile because our Supreme Court since the late sixties has exactly the same notion of their interpreting function with regard to the Constitution as the <Col N="322" /> Supreme Court in the US has, and they will interpret it as society changes in the light of prevailing circumstances against the background of the Preamble and in the light of the virtues of prudence, justice and charity.  They thought it was just to lift the injunction on Miss X and they thought it was the charitable thing to do. That is why they made the decision.  I put it to the Minister for Justice that it is not possible to give the kind of guarantees which the Minister gave in this House and which he gave from these Opposition benches in 1983, or to say with any certitude what way words in the Constitution may be interpreted in two years' time, in ten years' time or in thirty years' time.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact the Supreme Court adjudicated on Articles 40.3.3º on three separate occasions, and with respect to the honourable members of the court their judgments have not been consistent. The earlier judgments were closer to the view of those who proposed the 1983 amendment.  The judgment in respect of the provision of information was nearer to the stated position in the 1983 judgment than the judgment in the X case.  The underlying attitude of the same judges changed over a very short period when faced with the harrowing circumstances of the Miss X case.  In accordance with the concepts of prudcence, justice and charity they lifted the injunction placed by the High Court on Miss X.</P>
    <P>This change of position by the learned judges adds further force to the argument that those who believe that words in the Constitution will give certainty on abortion are suffering from a dangerous form of self-delusion.  A constitutional amendment can set out the basic principle on which law should be founded; it takes detailed legislation to give certainty to the law.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Justice in 1983, I listened to the views of many Deputies still in this House in the course of the debate on the amendment which became Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution. I recall in particular, Deputies Woods, Geoghegan-Quinn and Flynn who were <Col N="323" /> the leading lights of Fianna Fáil in that debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn expounded with absolute certainty on both constitutional law and medical practice, and gave assurances to all and sundry that neither a future Oireachtas, nor a future Supreme Court could possibly allow abortion in this jurisdiction, once the then amendment was passed.  He was wrong on both counts.  The Supreme Court earlier this year decided that abortion was permitted in certain circumstances, and now the Minister, Deputy Flynn, is introducing an amendment on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats which, on his own admission, will permit abortion to save a mother's life.</P>
    <P>The Minister's assurances were so wrong in 1983 that one must regard similar assurances given by the Minister for Justice yesterday with awe and a mixture of fear and wonder.  Only a man with the ego of the Minister could give the kind of assurances the Minister gave yesterday after being so wrong in 1983.  It is not possible for the Minister to give such assurances.  The Minister is once more proposing to put a riddle into the Constitution and the Supreme Court will answer the riddle some time in the future and the Minister has no certainty as to what the answer will be any more than he did in 1983.  To put it bluntly, the form of words that has been proposed in respect of the substantive issue is ambiguous and unless the Government introduce legislation to give a statutory framework to their constitutional intentions, neither the medical profession, the mothers of Ireland nor anyone else will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>It is a striking contradiction that the Minister for Justice will not proceed to a constitutional amendment on divorce until he has published legislation setting out the detailed grounds for his proposal. Yet he believes he should amend the Constitution in respect of abortion without publishing any legislation; and he shamelessly maintains that no such legislation will be necessary in the future, despite the explicit advice of the <Col N="324" /> Attorney General that such legislation is necessary.  That is an astounding contradiction compounded by the fact that it goes in the face of the Attorney General's advice.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to the wording of the Twelfth Amendment.  The Government's intention seems to be to enshrine in the Constitution the judgment of the Supreme Court in so far as it dealt with the circumstances in which it would be lawful to terminate the life of an unborn child where the mother's life is at real and substantial risk from causes other than an intention to commit suicide. That, I think, is a fair presentation of the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>A judgment of the Supreme Court in a constitutional case quite clearly has a constitutional effect.  In simple terms the judgment explains or amplifies a part of the Constitution and it has the same force in law as if it was actually part of the Constitution.  Article 40.3.3º was ambiguous. It was not clear how the right to life of a mother and the right to life of an unborn child should be balanced when those two rights were in conflict.  The judgment in the X case adjudicated on this matter and the constitutional position now is that abortion is lawful when it is necessary to save the life of the mother when there is a real and substantial risk to her life, including a risk of self destruction.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention of the Government to maintain that position but to rule out the grounds of suicide, why does the Minister think it necessary to introduce several lines of ambiguous language into the Constitution when the Supreme Court had already adjudicated on the matter and cleared up the ambiguity? Would the Government's purpose not have been better served if their amendment simply excluded suicide as a ground for abortion and allowed the Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 40.3.3º to stand where they had adjudicated between the conflicting rights of a mother and an unborn child?  By proposing the form of words now before us the Government are proposing to restore the ambiguity which the Supreme Court had taken <Col N="325" /> out of the Constitution in their judgment in the X case and we will not now know what the position is until a future case comes before the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the reasons given by the Minister for Justice for including the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the amendment.  In essence he claims that if this phrase were not included abortion would be available on broad health grounds as well as on life grounds and that this would lead inevitably to widespread abortion in Ireland. Again I do not think I am misstating his case.  That is exactly his position.  It is worth repeating.  He claims that if the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; is not included abortion would be available on broad health grounds as well as on life grounds and that this would lead inevitably to widespread abortion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that he sees parallels with the Bourne <i>v.</i>  R case in the United Kingdom in 1938 and expressed a fear that if the phrase is not included the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; will be interpreted as the quality of life and that this will lead to abortion on demand.  I do not believe the Minister is correct in this interpretation. First of all, on parallels he sees with the Bourne case, which were commented on by other speakers tonight, it is worth pointing out that there is no written constitution in the United Kingdom.  In our Constitution the unenumerated right to life of the unborn gave protection to the unborn even before Article 40.3.3º was inserted in the Constitution.  It was the view expressed to me by Supreme Court judges in 1983 that the legal position, the constitutional position, was not changed by Article 40.3.3º but that simply what was an unenumerated right in Article 40, the right to life of the unborn, was made an explicit right by its insertion in the Constitution.  Mr. Justice Flaherty, in his judgment on the X case, stated clearly that Article 40.3.3º would prevent abortion on demand and that any Act of this Parliament to introduce anything that came near abortion on demand would fall on constitutional grounds because of Article 40.3.3º.  Therefore I do not see the parallels with the Bourne case.  They <Col N="326" /> do not have a written constitution in the United Kingdom and the particular law had such strong force in precedent that it led in a direction that we all know about now.</P>
    <P>That is not the position here.  I believe that the phrase in question adds nothing to the meaning of the words.  If, for example, I were to say that it was the Ceann Comhairle as distinct from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who made a decision, the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle&rdquo; would merely clarify the main statement but would add nothing to the substance.  If I say it was Deputy Byrne as distinct from Deputy De Rossa who made the fine speech in the House, the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from Deputy De Rossa&rdquo; is only a clarifier.  It certainly makes it easier to understand the substantive point in the principal statement, but it does not change the meaning of the substantive point in the principal statement.  It adds nothing of substance, in my view.  Likewise, the test in the amendment, without that phrase being inserted, that termination be necessary to save the life of the mother whose life is at real and substantial risk is a sufficiently rigid test to confine termination to life grounds rather than health grounds.  The inclusion of the phrase &mdash; and this, to answer Deputy Roche's point, is the net point of our objection &mdash; puts the medical profession in a very difficult position.  I believe it was a difficulty that was clearly understood by the people who drafted the speech of the Minister for Justice because I think it was as clear as crystal from the explanations they gave that they understood the difficulty and were worried about it.  There is no absolute frontier over which one crosses from a health threatening situation to a life threatening situation.  A doctor must make the best possible judgment he can in the interests of his patients, but it is naive to believe that he can apply some kind of measuring scale to say &ldquo;The threat is now to health, so I cannot&rdquo; and then to say &ldquo;The threat is now to life, so I can&rdquo;.  There is no yardstick, there is no ruler, there is no set of logarithm tables one can apply to say that <Col N="327" /> at a precise point in the course of an illness a patient has passed from a situation where the condition is health threatening into a situation where it is life threatening.  By including &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; in the wording the Minister establishes a false criterion for doctors and introduces the fear of litigation into what is essentially a medical decision.  If we set up a false standard with no basis in reality, a doctor making a decision is on the one hand, open to litigation from the next of kin of a patient who dies, on the grounds that he did not intervene in time as the illness progressed; but on the other hand if he intervenes too soon and the life of a foetus is lost, he again faces the possibility of litigation from, say, a mother or a husband who wanted a live and well child.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche asked me to explain precisely what our difficulty was.  I cannot do better than to give back to him what Deputy Lenihan said earlier in the House, because I think he put it very well indeed.  He said that when illnesses are grave &mdash; and we have all heard the expression that somebody is gravely ill &mdash; there is a spectrum of gravity and it is not possible to say in that spectrum of gravity at what point one crosses from a health threatening situation into a life threatening situation.  That was the point Deputy Lenihan made so well this afternoon and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party should think about it.</P>
    <P>The amendment which is being proposed would have wide support if the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; was omitted.  Even if the Minister is correct, it is possible to envisage a future Supreme Court deciding that life means something more than biological life.  Some jurisdictions allow abortion because the adverse economic and social circumstances of a mother justify it under their Statutes.  In those circumstances abortion is allowed on grounds related to the quality of life but the adverse quality of the mother's life does not arise from ill-health and if we take the Minister at his word the only thing that he is pinning down is the question of ill-health.  Other <Col N="328" /> quality of life interpretations do not arise from the question of health but rather from general economic and social conditions. In other jurisdictions abortion is permissible on those grounds.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a future Supreme Court would interpret this phrase in that way.  The phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; does not meet this problem.</P>
    <P>The Roe <i>v.</i> Wade case in the United States &mdash; this test case led to widespread abortion in that jurisdiction &mdash; did not rely on health grounds but rather on concepts of privacy of the individual and the bodily integrity of the mother.  It is not too far fetched to believe that at some future date such concepts could be imported into a Supreme Court judgment which sought to unravel the ambiguous wording now being proposed for inclusion in the Constitution.  The Minister should introduce a Bill to prevent widespread abortion and he should not duck his responsibilities and transfer what is properly the function of the Oireachtas to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The stated intention of the Government to introduce legislation to enshrine the totality of the Supreme Court judgment in law if their amendment is defeated is the most extraordinary aspect of the affair.  The Government are opposed to abortion except in limited circumstances to save the life of the mother.  Yet, the same Government, if they do not get their way, are committed to introducing legislation which, according to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, will provide for abortion on demand.  That is the most outrageous proposal in this process.  It is an immoral and amoral position and it is spectacular in its rashness.  It is also an idle threat because the Government know that they have no hope of getting that type of legislation through this House or the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I find the position of the Progressive Democrats in this debate beyond comprehension. The right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights and the constitutional amendment on the substantive issue is founded directly on the right to life even if it qualifies that right <Col N="329" /> in respect of the unborn child of a mother whose life is at real and substantial risk. On this most fundamental of issues the Progressive Democrats have two contradictory positions &mdash; they will support the amendment in the Dáil and will oppose it in the referendum.  This approach surely raises expediency to the level of an art form.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the right to life of the unborn but believe that there are limited circumstances in which that right is in conflict with the right to life of the mother and in those circumstances a doctor must be in a position to make a decision in favour of the mother.  I do not believe that a constitutional amendment alone with all its ambiguity will achieve this end.  Only legislation will give the certainty to the law which is necessary to protect the life of the unborn child; only legislation will give certainty to the law which is necessary to protect the life of the mother and only legislation will give protection to members of the medical profession who have to make a decision when the right to life of the mother and child are in direct conflict.</P>
    <P>Constitutional amendments are blunt instruments and in the absence of Statute law they will not achieve what their proposers intend.  The Minister should withdraw this Bill until he has published appropriate accompanying legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances in which the termination of pregnancy is permissible is an inherently complex issue not susceptible to a single sentence formula.  By concentrating their efforts during the past six months on an attmept to find a single magical legal sentence the Government have embarked upon a search which is doomed to failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The single sentence solution, compressing all the complications of the issue into just 50 words or so, simply does not exist.  The experience of the 1983 amendment, if it teaches us anything, shows that we cannot depend on a single sentence solution because every single sentence solution is likely to carry within it the seeds of uncertainty, the need for <Col N="330" /> further judicial interpretation and critical terms left undefined.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy of the Government's approach is that it is unnecessary to force the electorate as this amendment does, if it goes through in its present form, to guess, guesstimate or take a chance on what the sentence will actually mean when the Supreme Court Court comes to interpret it.  It is unnecessary to force the electorate, unfairly, to select between competing and conflicting legal assertions in this House as to what the actual effect or real meaning of the Government's formula will be.  The very existence in this House of doubt and debate about the meaning of the various words shows that we should stop this process now and choose a different course.</P>
    <P>Do the Government seriously think that the debate about the wording, its meaning and effect which has gone on inside and outside the House during the past 15 days or so is going to stop next week?  The inescapable truth of this matter is that this debate is certain to be taken up again but this time in a court of law and the outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted with confidence by anyone, including the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The proffering of a formula involving that level of uncertainty represents a grave failure of leadership.  The effect of the Bill is to offer a choice between two bad options.  Neither a Yes nor a No vote will resolve this issue definitively and none of this is necessary.  Instead the solution is to start with comprehensive legislation which spells out at whatever length is necessary the solution to the issue leaving nothing to guesswork or to the uncertainty of future judicial interpretation. The constitutional provision should then be founded on that detailed legislation.  The Government should introduce such legislation before attempting to enact their constitutional amendment setting out the circumstances in which a termination of a pregnancy will be lawful in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are dealing here with matters of life and death.  It does not seem to make any sense to deal exclusively with matters <Col N="331" /> of that gravity in 55 words in a Constitution or in any other document.  To rely solely on 55 words to encompass all the complexities of conflicting rights to life is imprudent to say the least.  We should not forget that at a practical level those 55 words are the basis on which, unfortunately, patients may go to law against their doctors and even children may go to law against their parents.</P>
    <P>Let me give a practical example of this. Let us suppose that a pregnant woman is treated for cancer by chemotherapy and that in the course of treatment her child is damaged seriously but is born alive. We could then have a situation in which the child might sue either its mother or, more likely, its mother's doctor on the claim that the chemotherapy in this circumstance was only necessary to protect the health and not necessarily to protect the life of the mother.  How and on what basis would liability be decided in this case?  Obviously, it would be decided on the basis of an interpretation by the court in this civil action of the precise meaning of the words that the Government now want to put into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I know it will be argued that such an action is highly unlikely but if one thinks about it it is not all that unlikely.  Given the substantial costs involved in maintaining a child whose health has been severely damaged because of chemotherapy applied to his mother while still in the womb an action for compensatory damages is not at all unlikely.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to say that it is a matter for the doctors to work out the legal liabilities in that situation.  Doctors may have experience of making split second clinical decisions based on an understanding of their legal liabilities in regard to existing medical practice based on well established codes of ethics and case law but they are not used to and have no experience of making split second clinical decisions on the basis of an interpretation as yet uncertain of a new and totally untested constitution provision of 55 words which the Government want to insert.</P>
    <P>This problem for doctors which, ultimately, <Col N="332" /> will affect the way women are treated because uncertainty will either lead to over-treatment, postponed treatment or treatment that is not necessarily the best for the mother and her child could be avoided if we were to first enact legislation which would clarify all the procedures for determining liability in cases like this before we put any words into the Constitution.  It might well emerge in the course of preparing such legislation that certain alterations in the proposed consitutional wording would remove many of the practical difficulties to which I have referred.  However, if we put the words into the Constitution first before we discuss the practical legislation it will be too late to make any adjustments afterwards without having another referendum.</P>
    <P>Let me give another example of why we should have the legislation before a referendum.  This constitutional provision will create a constitutional right, in certain circumstances, to a termination of a pregnancy.  There may well be, and I am sure there are, some doctors who would have a conscientious objection to performing a termination even in these limited circumstances.  Given the gravity of the issues involved, this is to be expected.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, when in 1979 it was enacting legislation to legalise contraception, which does not raise ethical issues of the same gravity, inserted a clause to cater for such conscientious objectors.  A similar clause is needed in this case to cater for conscientious objectors who may not wish to provide a service for which this provision will create a constitutional right.  Yet there is no such clause in the Constitution and the Taoiseach says we need no legislation to provide for it.  In my view we should first have the legislation to deal with conscientious objectors. In discussing that legislation we would throw light on what the appropriate words should be that would ultimately be inserted in the Constitution. In other words, we should put the horse before the cart.  Any difficult issues that came up in the course of discussion of the question of conscientious objectors could then be taken into account in the choice <Col N="333" /> of the precise words to be used in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is another very telling argument for having legislation first.  This is to be found in the excellent judgment of the late Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy in the X case.  He was referring to the decision of Dáil Éireann to allow the original 1983 amendment to be a full and final statement of the legal position in regard to abortion here, without any supplementary legislation to explain or underpin its real meaning.  He said: &ldquo;In the context of the eight years that have passed since the amendment was adopted the failure of the Legislature to enact the appropriate legislation is no longer just unfortunate, it is inexcusable&rdquo;.  There has never been as trenchant a condemnation of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the courts as that uttered by Mr. Justice Niall McCarthy on that occasion.  Yet it seems that we will probably have to wait another eight years for another Supreme Court judge to make exactly the same condemnation of our failure to enact legislation in regard to the interpretation and implementation of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCarthy went on to ask the question in regard to the statement in the 1983 amendment that the State by its laws would, as far as practicable, vindicate the right to life of the unborn, as to how in practice the State would do this.  He drew the conclusion that if the State was in fact to vindicate the right to life of the unborn, it had no option but to do so by positive legislation.  He said:</P>
    <P>Legislation may be both negative and positive.  Negative in prohibiting abortion, absolutely, or at a given time or without meeting stringent tests.</P>
    <P>Positive by requiring positive action. The State may fulfil its positive role by providing the necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman. </P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCarthy thus made it abundantly clear that it was his view that the State had two obligations.  Certainly it had an obligation to prohibit abortion, but it also had an obligation to prevent the cause of abortion arising by providing <Col N="334" /> the necessary help for women who became pregnant.  He made it abundantly clear that he believed that this positive role was one that should be met by legislation. The Government plan no such legislation.  This is a very important matter that should be addressed by legislation before we amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There is yet another area which needs to be dealt with by legislation before we consider the constitutional amendment proposed by the Government.  The Government's amendment says that termination of pregnancy is lawful in stated circumstances, but it does not say how late in the pregnancy such termination is permissible.  It seems that this is a matter that should be addressed by legislation before we enact any such constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to yet another reason for having legislation first.  The Government have chosen, in my view mistakenly, to use the words &ldquo;life, as distinct from health&rdquo; in the wording they are putting forward.  Almost all the medical people I have spoken to regard the addition of the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; as adding nothing to either the meaning or the clarity of the remaining wording in the amendment.  It is quite clear from the remaining wording that it shall be unlawful to terminate the life of an unborn unless such termination is necessary to save the life of the mother.  The remaining words have a clear, simple, meaning regardless of whether we add the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; as well.</P>
    <P>I have found nobody in either medical or legal circles who agrees with the truly amazing and scaremongering assertion of the Minister for Justice that if the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; are omitted, this might eventually lead to abortion on demand.  The only argument the Minister advanced for this assertion was by reference to the Bourne case in England in 1938.  I submit that this is an argument that has no foundation.  The Bourne case was decided in a country where there is no written constitution, and where there is no constitutional guarantee of any kind of the right to life of the unborn.  To <Col N="335" /> suggest that the Irish Supreme Court would make an interpretation along the lines of the Bourne case runs counter to the entire trend of constitutional interpretation in this State.  In any event, if the Minister cared to read the Bourne judgment carefully he would find that the test applied in that case was not one that concerned health grounds alone.  Mr. Justice McNaughton said in his judgment that the question that had to be decided was whether the jury was satisfied that the termination was performed in good faith for the purposes of preserving the life of the girl &mdash; I emphasise that Mr. Justice McNaughton used the word &ldquo;life&rdquo;, not the word &ldquo;health&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In any event if the Minister has doubts about the practical interpretation of the amendment in the Constitution without the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo;, surely the sensible thing for him to do would be to introduce legislation first, setting out in detail what shall be the criteria used and how these will be applied in practice, and have them approved in the House before enacting a constitutional provision.  The doubt the Minister was trying to sow as to what would happen if these words were left out is in itself an argument for having legislation first, to clear up doubts of that kind.  By putting the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; into the Constitution the Minister is creating an entirely needless and indeterminable area of legal doubt which will cotinue for years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Constitution is not just a legal document, it is a document for our people.  A reference of this kind which seems to place the health of women in a subordinate position, quite unnecessarily in my view, means that many women will feel that the Constitution does not speak for them.  That undermines the respect for the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would like to elborate on the doubt that is being created.  Let us assume that a medical team is involved in the performance of an operation on a pregnant woman and one member of the team feels that the woman's condition is life-threatening <Col N="336" /> but another feels that it is only health-threatening.  Let us assume that the member of the medical team who feels it is health-threatening discusses it casually with a third party and this third party feels it is his or her duty to report this dilemma to the Attorney General. Will we have a situation where the Attorney General will feel obliged to seek an injunction on the grounds that the courts &mdash; not the medical team &mdash; should determine whether a condition is &ldquo;health threatening&rdquo; or &ldquo;life threatening&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I will hardly finish my speech in that time.</P>
      <P>If we had legislation first, the procedures for deciding such cases of conflict could be worked out in detail in advance. The area of doubt and argument could be greatly reduced.  The likelihood of recourse to the courts could be reduced or eliminated.</P>
      <P>Let me advance a further argument for having legislation first.  Ireland is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights.  It does not matter what is in our Constitution, the European Court of Human Rights can overturn it. The European Court of Human Rights takes the view that the fundamental rights and freedoms contained in the convention are superior to the written Constitution of any signatory State.  If the European Court of European Rights decides that a provision in the Constitution of a signatory State is repugnant to the Convention, any citizen of that State who feels that their rights have been infringed by it, can sue their Government to have their rights vindicated, and will succeed in that action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that it is much less likely that Ireland's law on this subject could be successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights if our law is set out in detail in legislation, not solely in the Constitution.  If we want to have a law in this country that endures, and is <Col N="337" /> not set aside in Europe, then we should have legislation first to underpin our ultimate constitutional provision and not rely solely on it.</P>
    <P>Having said all this, I do not go along with those who argue that the right to life of the unborn should not be guaranteed in the Constitution.  Whether we like it or not, our Constitution is one that guarantees all sorts of rights to all sorts of people.  For example, our Constitution guarantees a right to the Government to absolute confidentiality of their proceedings, a bizarre concept &mdash; but one which apparently is founded on a particular interpretation of our Constitution. Our Constitution has also been the basis upon which our tax law as between spouses has been changed.  These are all very important matters, but so also is the right to life of an unborn child.  If tax law and Cabinet confidentiality is dealt with in the Constitution, then I cannot see why, after proper preparation, the other should not also be dealt with in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>However, if we are to provide constitutional rights for the unborn, it is my contention that we should do so on the basis of proper preparation based on having detailed legislation first.</P>
    <P>We also have a practical situation that arises in regard to the present issue.  In the X case, the Supreme Court decided that there was a right to abortion on the basis of intention to commit suicide. Admittedly, it decided this in a very extreme case of a 14 year old who had been raped, but the general principle is one that could be extended in subsequent case law, to encompass other less traumatic circumstances.  Given that the Supreme Court made that decision on the basis of an interpretation of the existing Constitution, it seems to me that it is not possible to alter that interpretation, other than by an Amendment to the Constitution itself.  Any such Amendment to the Constitution should be carefully prepared on the basis of legislation that has first been debated, and not made solely by insertion of a brief phrase of six words inserted in the Constitution, without any accompanying legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> It is my strong view that allowing suicide as a general ground for abortion would lead gradually to fairly widespread abortion.  Some believe that one can avoid this by legislating, within the Supreme Court decision, to limit the suicide exception so that it will only apply to very extreme cases.  While this may be the intention of the framers of such legislation, it is not necessarily what would turn out in practice when such legislation had been in force for a few years.  Presumably, any such legislation introduced would provide that psychiatrists and/or psychologists would have to verify that the suicidal intention was genuine.  The only psychiatrist I had the opportunity to consult expressed the view that a psychiatrist would have immense difficulty in certifying in such a case.  It is quite difficult to envisage the type of evidence that could be produced to justify denial of a claim that a person was suicidal.  If a particular psychiatrist decided to take a risk, and certify that a person was not suicidal, and if in one case out of a 100 their judgment proved incorrect, pressure on them would be quite considerable.</P>
    <P>Doctor Paul O'Mahony argued in <i>The Irish Times</i> today:</P>
    <P>The ethics of professional practice would dictate that one would always err on the side of caution, finding that the woman was at real risk of suicide, even when the underlying evidence could not fully support this...The role envisaged for psychiatrists and psychologists if the amendment is rejected is, then inherently conflicted. It both invests them with powers of diagnosis and assessment that they do not have, and places an intolerable burden of responsibility on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>I know that other psychiatrists have taken a different view.  I have read a study by Professor Anthony Clare and Dr. Tyrrell on this subject.  They cite a study undertaken at the University of Rochester in New York State during the period 1963-69 when, of 108 women referred to for <Col N="339" /> psychiatric evaluation for abortion, 60 were refused.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this evidence is correct but I believe that the psychiatric evaluation in this case did not relate to a direct threat of suicide, but to a much less fraught decision in regard to general mental health.  The same pressure to err on the side of caution, in the words of Dr. O'Mahony, would not have applied in that case, as it would if one was judging suicidal intention.</P>
    <P>There are broad ethical questions to be considered about the nature of a decision to commit suicide, and the degree of responsibility involved in such a decision.  It seems there is divergence of opinion on this subject and I recognise that there are others who do not agree with my view on it.  This divergence underlines yet again the need to have legislation first, before we attempt a constitutional amendment.  I am confident that the discussion of the legislation would convince people that there is a need for a constitutional amendment to alter that aspect of the Supreme Court decision.  I am confident that such a constitutional amendment would be introduced with much greater ease, sense of assurance and mutual tolerance if it had followed a proper debate on legislation than if it is rushed through in six words as the Government wish to do today.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of people will not have an opportunity to fully research and assess the complexities of the issue before us.  Many are dependent on a clear debate to assist them with their comprehension of the issue.  I am concerned that, in many respects, there has not been clarity of debate; we have a duty to try to give that to the people because it is a very complex issue, as we are all aware.  It is unfortunate and unfair to attempt &mdash; as some speakers from the Opposition have &mdash; to enter the realms of scaremongering.  I am surprised at some of the sentiments expressed and the issues raised because the debate is very important and relates to people's concerns and worries.  People do not need <Col N="340" /> scaremongering tactics or the Opposition to approach this debate as just another discussion and decide to be negative.</P>

      <P>I have been very surprised at some of the things I heard today. For example, Deputy Owen, who I know has sincerely and deeply felt convictions about these amendments &mdash; which I respect &mdash; raised unacceptable issues. She accused Fianna Fáil and their representatives of deliberately seeking to undermine the rights of Irish women and of knowingly seeking to endanger their health.  She also said that we were an unscrupulous party who have a lack of respect for Irish people and that we seemed to be engaged in a childish game. We cannot accept that.  As a member of Fianna Fáil, a supporter of the Government and a woman, I could not accept the kind of allegations flung across the Floor of the House.  I am disappointed because I thought we would have a fair and honest debate, which we owe to the people.  Some speakers were not fair or balanced in their remarks.  I reject the allegations, particularly suggestions that I, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, would be engaged in trying to undermine my own rights.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government for the effort made initially to try to keep the debate on a non-partisan level.  Unfortunately, these efforts seem to have come to nought.  It is regrettable that the Opposition resorted to the tactics which they used on this issue.  Such tactics would be reasonable in relation to other issues &mdash; it is reasonable to attack the Government, that is what Opposition is about &mdash; but it was wrong in regard to the issue under debate.  The Government were attacked in regard to their good faith and integrity, which did not do a service to the people. Interestingly, when I speak to people in my constituency I find that they want clarity in the wording and as regards what they will specifically be voting for on 3 December.  They do not need any additional confusion, they need clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> Deputy John Bruton was anxious that legislation should be enacted before a referendum.  I am opposed to that.  I am very pleased that it is being referred to the people, particularly on the substantive issue.  I believe that the wording presented in the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution Bill is the best wording available.  If there were better wording available I certainly would be one of the Members on this side of the House most anxious to examine all available wording in relation to the issue before us.  I am very strongly in support of the Government's decision to refer this issue to the people, particularly in relation to the substantive issue.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that abortion is too divisive a topic to be suitable for a referendum and that only by legislation could the issue be dealt with reasonably. I unequivocally believe that this is one of those fundamental issues on which not only do we have a duty to consult the people but also the people have the right to be consulted.  Further, I point out that abortion is no less divisive an issue in America or in Germany as a result of the Legislature and the Judiciary in these countries making all of their laws in relation to abortion.  If we are to live up to the principle that the people are sovereign and have the right to be consulted on determining the basic laws of this State we must refer this issue, above all issues, to the people and I am glad that we are doing so.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is right to reaffirm the principle that unborn children should be afforded definite protection and that abortion on demand is wrong.  It has been an experience of other countries that the original intent of legislation has been distorted, opening the door to abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>I also believe that every woman should be guaranteed that she can receive in Ireland whatever treatment is necessary to resolve life-threatening medical conditions. A large part of the debate in the House and in the country as a whole has focussed on the phrase that is meant to address that aspect, the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health of.&rdquo;  I recognise <Col N="342" /> the way in which that phrase could be thought of as being very bald.  Indeed, when initially giving consideration to the wording myself, I felt that the phrase was very bald.  However, to date I have heard no satisfactory alternative that would ensure that abortion on demand could not come into Ireland.  That is why the phrase is there.</P>
    <P>Having studied closely the various opinions advanced on the amendment, I am satisfied that should I become pregnant or should I develop a medical condition that posed a risk to my life, I would not be denied any necessary treatment because of the words contained in this amendment &mdash; and that is a very important feature for women.  There should be no attempt to confuse that issue.  The intent in that connection is very clear.  In essence, as I understand it, the Government wording endeavours to close the door to abortion on demand in Ireland while ensuring that all treatments necessary to save the life of the mother will be allowed.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I support the referral of the proposed amendment to the people and I hope that they will vote for it. Further, I hope that every Member of the House will endeavour to make sure that the debate between now and polling day will not become marred in vitriolic, simplistic or partisan argument because the issue is much too serious for that.</P>

      <P>I am very much in touch with the people of Donegal.  It is my business to be in touch with them and to listen to what they have to say.  In the past months I have been hearing a very clear message &mdash; the people of Donegal want a referendum on this issue.  I do not think that the people of Donegal are any aberration either, many people in many parts of the country want a referendum.  I believe that it is not just the people who are taking a narrow pro-life stance who want an opportunity to voice their opinion on this issue.  It is my belief that the bulk of people do not want abortion in this country and that any measure introduced by any Government that looked as if it would introduce abortion to this country would cause the people grave concern. This means that the public do not want left in place the present position, whereby Ireland has one of the most liberal abortion regimes in Europe.  Not only that, there is also the potential of expansion to include increasingly wider grounds, especially if some of the Members of the Opposition parties ever got into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituents, therefore, want the Government to do something about this scenario.  They want an approach that is effective and humane and that clearly indicates respect for women and a concern for women.  Outside the House people are happy that Fianna Fáil are striking a compassionate balance between a position in which we have or could have a broad-based abortion regime and a position in which only the most rigid absolutist moral stance was enshrined in the Constitution.  The Fianna Fáil amendment presents the people of Ireland with an approach that is humane, compassionate and protective <Col N="344" /> of women but is also protective of the values of the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>Before moving on to the substantive issue, I should like to speak to the amendment in relation to travel.  For many of us the memories of 1983, although mentioned often in the House &mdash; and even just a few minutes ago &mdash; are not as vivid as they are for others.  However, for all of us in the House and outside it, we never want a repeat of the memories of last spring, when we found this christian, humane country branded internationally as an island which imprisoned its women. We made headlines throughout the world because we were denying a fundamental human right to one of our young citizens, the right to travel.  I am happy that the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution should and will be passed by the Irish people, because none of us wishes to restrict the free movement of people within or outside our country.</P>
    <P>As far as the right to information is concerned, as the Minister pointed out to the House earlier, there is a case before the European Court of Human Rights at present and the decision of the court will be before us in a number of weeks.  However, that decision should not affect the amendment, in relation to the provision of information, that the Government are putting before the people on 3 December.  That amendment would enshrine in the Constitution the right to receive and to give information, subject to conditions laid down by law. Directive counselling would not be allowed, whereas non-directive counselling would be allowed.  Inevitably, it will be very difficult to draw absolutely clear guidelines between directive and non-directive counselling but certainly the intention of the amendment is to rule out systematic guidance, advice and, ultimately, abortion referral.</P>
    <P>In this country we have a wonderful tradition of committed medical care, with the skills and the knowledge to ensure that that care grows in sophistication with every passing year.  Quite frankly, however, it is dangerous to assume that current medical practice in every single part of Ireland, in every single hospital, <Col N="345" /> reassures women in circumstances in which they have a concern about a risk to their lives that every medical procedure would be taken in their interests and at a time that would most protect their lives. I know that the amendment before us will ensure that women have those absolute rights.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment inside and outside the House that many of those speaking on this issue are men.  That is a very fair point.  Most of those talking on the issue in the House have been men and there has also been an age element. It is my generation of Irish women who will be most affected by the passage of this amendment.  It is my generation who will face the choices, the terrors, the hopes and the challenges.  The women of my generation have the right to believe that their lives are valued and that that value is expressed in the Constitution in a clear and unequivocal way.  For me personally I want that protection which will be provided by the amendment.  I want the entitlement to full and proper treatment which this amendment gives me.  I want the freedom to travel and to have access to whatever information I want.  As a citizen of this country, I have the right to all of those things.  I have the right to something else also; I have the right to know that we expressly protect the right to life of the unborn child.  I know that the amendment in no way diminishes the protection afforded the unborn child by our Constitution.  All of that is very clear because the Government have provided wording and an unambiguous public interpretation of that wording which can provide for all of those rights.</P>
    <P>In the past two days the Opposition have engaged in cheap shots on a life and death issue.  They have called for the weirdest assortment of changes, postponements and tinkerings because they could not make up their own minds. Anyone who reads the contributions of the last day can be in no doubt that we have a national Parliament where the Government are prepared to take a stand to be honest with the people, to deal in a straightforward way with a hugely <Col N="346" /> sensitive issue and not to indulge in useless point scoring.  Anyone who reads the contributions of the last day can also be in no doubt that we have an Opposition short on ideas, short on contributions and very short on vision, but with an infinite supply of vicious and emotive one-liners. Deputy Bruton spoke about single sentence solutions.  I would not like to be waiting for him to come up with a single sentence solution.  It is the same Members of the Opposition who are saying we should accomplish this task by legislation.  You have got to be kidding &mdash; subjecting ourselves and our constituents to any more of this spectacle of people running away as fast as their little legs can carry them from any solution that addresses the substantive issue with courage and conviction.  The people will decide on 3 December.  I am confident that, in the interests of my own and future generations of women and in the interests of generations of children yet to be born, they will vote for the proposed wording.</P>

    <P>Sadly, even to discuss the question of the termination of pregnancies, is for many Irish women today a most difficult and painful task.  There is still a sizeable minority of people who, through shame, embarrassment or ignorance, find sex and sexual matters distasteful to talk about, let alone to address in an unemotional and clearheaded manner. We are a society which is still largely a <Col N="347" /> victim of a religious and of a Victorian ethos which viewed sex as something dirty.  We are a society struggling to emerge into the real world of the 20th century, a world which many find far from perfect and far removed from the ideals and standards which many of us have tried to inculcate in others and in our own lifestyle.  For many our society seems to be missing the essential core qualities such as respect, love, neighbourliness, understanding and forgiveness. Sadly, there are still a sizeable minority who would wish reproductive organs were confined to animals and that we did not possess them.  If only it were true that children could be found, as in olden days, under cabbage heads, that they could really be delivered by the stork into a family, and that all births could be the result of a union other than by intercourse, then we would not have to address all these legal and medical complications which must be addressed when dealing with the sad realities of life in 1992 &mdash; for example, the sad reality of 5,000 of our citizens going to England to terminate their pregnancies.</P>
    <P>As legislators we cannot put our heads in the sand and ignore the reality of life in Ireland in the nineties.  Legislators cannot be divorced from the real world.  Legislators must make laws in the light of their own experiences and by recognising the complex nature of society as it is today. We must legislate not only for the few votes &mdash; that seems to be the Fianna Fáil approach to these referenda &mdash; or for the majority, but we must legislate for minorities or practices which we ourselves may not wish to avail of.  We cannot and should not be selfish.</P>
    <P>If democracy means anything it must mean that as a society we must be egalitarian enough to live alongside and among people whose religious and moral standards and sexual lifestyles are different from our own.  I cannot help but think how this charade in the House is being viewed by the religious minorities, not only in the Republic but particularly &mdash; in the light of the talks taking place to bring about a peaceful solution to the <Col N="348" /> murderous conflict in Northern Ireland &mdash; by the Protestant majority there.  On the one hand we have the Government willing to trade away Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in order to appease and bring about a peaceful solution to the Northern Ireland problem.  On the other hand, we have in the proposed wording to the amendment to our Constitution yet another slap in the face to the religious minorities, such as the Methodists.</P>
    <P>On 28 May 1992 I read into the Official Report a quotation from <i>The Irish Times</i> in which the Methodist viewpoint on abortion was outlined.  Needless to say the Protestant community have already outlined their extremely strong objections to our using the Constitution as a means of addressing this delicate issue.  I should like to take this opportunity to read into the record again the stated viewpoint of the Methodist Church.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 March 1992 in the Methodist notes entitled &ldquo;Church supports limited abortion&rdquo; states that termination of pregnancy is permissible:</P>
    <P> 1.  When the mother's life is at risk. Our first concern will be for the mother and her first concern may be one of commitment through her own continuing life to her family responsibilities...</P>
    <P>2.  Where there is risk of grave injury to the physical and mental health of the mother, especially if she has family responsibilities....</P>
    <P>3.  In cases of rape or incest....</P>
    <P>4.  In cases of gross abnormality of the foetus e.g. where reliable investigation [by amnios synthesis testing] indicates that the foetus would be born without a brain or would not long survive birth.  In cases of lesser abnormality each decision should be made with extreme caution.  </P>
    <P>Whatever about European Union, how can we address the problem and explain ourselves to one million Protestants living on the other side of the Border in view of the manner in which the Government have abused the Constitution <Col N="349" /> in this House?  How can we assure them that the ethos would be protected if there was a unitary State?  I ask the Minister directly to rise to the challenge and show them and the rest of us that he does not believe in the extension of the confessional state into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies from all sides have privately congratulated Members of Democratic Left for their &ldquo;sincerity&rdquo; and &ldquo;political bravery&rdquo;.  Some of the compliments may well be genuine, or some may be quite cynical.  However, we should now have addressed the issue and, depending on what answers were arrived at, should have decided our position on the termination of pregnancies.  The acid test is how would we as parents respond if our daughter of 14 years of age had been raped, was clearly distraught because of a resulting pregnancy and had threatened suicide &mdash; and this has been proven by psychologists to be potentially possible. Women who have been victims of rape or incest and pregnant women whose health is endangered cannot become the innocent victims of a cowardly Government and be sacrificed for political expediency.</P>
    <P>Comparisons have been drawn between Great Britain and Ireland by various Ministers.  There is the argument that if we were to protect the lives of those who were about to commit suicide and allow them to terminate a pregnancy, we would open the floodgates, as has happened in Great Britain.  Since we are all members of the European Community, I would ask the Minister whether the Government see the English formula for termination of pregnancy as the only formula that exists in the world.  There are others in Spain and Italy &mdash; two Catholic countries &mdash; as well as in Portugal, France and Germany which are not equated with the practice that exist in Great Britain.  How is it that Catholics, Protestants and Bishops of both persuasions in Northern Ireland do not seem to have any difficulty with the fact that 800 abortions were carried out there last year under Northern Ireland law?</P>

      <P>Over the past few days we have had a very detailed and wide ranging debate on the Second Stage of these three Bills to amend the Constitution.  I have followed the debate very closely and I want now to respond as fully as I can in the time available to as many as possible of the main points that were raised during the debate.  I hope that individual Deputies will bear with me if I do not cover some points they have mentioned during the debate.  In a debate as comprehensive as this has been on a topic as important as this, it is simply not possible at this point to respond to every single point that has been raised during the debate.  There will, of course, be an opportunity on Committee Stage to go into some detail on many of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two basic and central themes have run through the whole debate &mdash; concern to protect the lives and health of pregnant women and concern to protect the right to life of the unborn child.  Widely divergent views have been expressed on the issues raised by the Bills, ranging from those who regard the Government's proposals on the substantive issue as not being restrictive enough and who oppose information being made available on abortion services abroad, to those who would in effect like to see abortion on <Col N="351" /> demand available in the State and directive as well as non-directive counselling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the more important points that have been raised in relation to each of the Bills individually, beginning with the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which deals with the substantive right to life issue.  Three proposed amendments to the motion for a second reading of this Bill have been put down.  Two of them, one in the name of Deputy Brendan Howlin and the other in the names of the Deputies of the Democratic Left, propose that the House should decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill.  The third proposed amendment, in the name of Deputy John Bruton, proposes that the Bill should be given a Second Reading only after the Dáil has first discussed, up to and including Committee State, legislation designed to elaborate on the practical implementation of the provision of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's proposal that a Second Reading of the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill should follow the publication and debate of legislation to supplement the amendment is not acceptable to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Since the amendment would, in effect, negative the suicide aspect of the Supreme Court's test for a termination of pregnancy, any legislation to supplement the amendment would have to take that chance in the law into account.  It would be objectionable, from a legal and more general point of view, to put legislation through the House, albeit short of completion of Final Stage, which sought to anticipate the outcome of a decision by the people in a referendum on the subject matter of that legislation.  In my opening contribution on this debate I made clear the Government's position on legislation to supplement the amendment.  If the Government are persuaded of the need for that legislation they will consider the matter further.  We are not, however, at the present time convinced about the need for such legislation.</P>
    <P>Two reasons are given for Deputy Howlin's proposed amendment.  The first is that the Bill poses dangers to the life and other fundamental rights of Irish women.  In my speech opening this debate I went to considerable lengths to refute this suggestion and to spell out why the proposed amendment to the Constitution in fact affords full protection to the life and health of a pregnant woman.  A number of other speakers on this side of the House, including the Minister for Health, have also pointed out the way in which the proposed amendment affords such protection.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons for the Labour Party in this debate have tried to pick holes in the wording used in the amendment.  They have objected to the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; on the basis that it implies that terminations would take place only where they are absolutely unavoidable and that in practice this could lead to situations where necessary terminations are delayed until a medical emergency has occurred.  This objection has been raised despite the fact that the Supreme Court judgment itself uses the expression &ldquo;which can only be avoided by such termination.&rdquo;  They have referred to the &ldquo;innate offensiveness&rdquo; of the phrase &ldquo;as distinct from the health&rdquo; and have claimed the use of that term could also <Col N="353" /> rule out operations that would be perfectly legal now if they were necessary to save the health as distinct from the life of a woman.  While I can well appreciate the strength of feeling on this matter, many of the comments made suggesting that the inclusion of the phrase could have adverse and unintended effects are without foundation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a line cannot be unambiguously drawn between life and health and that this will give rise to difficulties.  But the Supreme Court has already drawn that line and had no difficulty in doing so.  The essence of the Supreme Court judgment is that such a line must be drawn on the proper interpretation of Article 40.3.3º because that Article on its true interpretation will allow the right to life of the unborn to be superseded only where that is necessary to save the life of the mother in the sense that otherwise she will die.  The Twelfth Amendment would not make any change in the Supreme Court's test on this point except to establish that test as something which could not be changed at any time in the future without the consent of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter is of the view apparently that the test laid down by the Supreme Court cannot be read as including the words &ldquo;as distinct from the health.&rdquo;  The fact is that all five of the members of the Supreme Court spoke specifically in terms of the life of the mother and in no instance was health unrelated to a risk to life contemplated as a ground.  The distinction between life and health was included in the general test laid down by the Chief Justice and it is clear that that distinction was accepted by the other judges and was inherent in what they had to say.  The quotations from the judgments referred to by Deputy Shatter in fact support what I am saying.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that a test of whether action is necessary to save the life of the mother is straightforward and should not give rise to difficulty in practice.  This test has existed explicitly since the decision was given in the X case and, prior to publication of the Twelfth Amendment <Col N="354" /> of the Constitution Bill, I heard no suggestions about any possible difficulties in the operation of that test.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in my opening remarks with suggestions that doctors may feel that in some way the inclusion of the phrase in the amendment will inhibit them from acting until there is a degree of certainty in relation to the existence of a risk to life which would be wholly impracticable in medical practice which can only proceed on the basis of probability. I have explained that the Supreme Court decision requires only that the existence of a real and substantial risk to life be established on the balance of probabilities and that there is nothing in the amendment which would change that.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the amendment will render unlawful medical treatment for mothers where that treatment is for the benefit of their health as opposed to saving their lives.  I wish again to make the point that the amendment is not changing the law in this respect &mdash; it adopts the existing law as set out by the Supreme Court.  So far as I know, nobody has ever suggested that the Supreme Court decision has given rise to the consequences that it is now claimed would flow from the amendment.</P>
    <P>My understanding of current medical practice is that medical treatment for a health condition which is not life-threatening is not permitted if the foreseen result of that treatment is the death of the foetus but that medical treatment is permitted where the life of the mother is at risk and the loss of the life of the foetus from such treatment is foreseen.  It may, of course, also occasionally happen that a drug or other therapy given for some condition causes an entirely unforeseen adverse response and leads to the loss of life of the foetus.  I am advised that the wording proposed could not be held to imply a breach of the law in circumstances where the life of the foetus is lost as an unforeseen and unintended consequence of treatment carried out in good faith.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring made the point that the phrase &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; means <Col N="355" /> that the risk to life must be imminent, before action to terminate the pregnancy would be permitted.  He mentioned cases of cardiac conditions or treatment involving chemotherapy in the early stages of pregnancy.</P>

      <P>I dealt with this matter in my opening remarks.  I pointed out that the test enuncicated by the Supreme Court does not require that the risk of life must be immediate &mdash; as I mentioned, the court specifically rejected that proposition &mdash; and neither does the wording of the proposed amendment require that the risk of life should be immediate.  I mentioned that I am advised that the phrase &ldquo;necessary to save the life&rdquo; means that a pregnancy could be terminated if the doctors were able to form the view that even after childbirth and recovery of the mother therefrom, other treatments for whatever condition she was suffering from would be ineffective to protect her life.</P>

      <P>There have been criticisms of the proposed amendment on the basis that it does not provide for termination of pregnancy in cases of rape or incest.  It has also been suggested that termination should be allowed where the foetus is damaged or deformed or where an anencephalic foetus has been identified in the womb.  There have also been complaints that the amendment does not deal with such matters as the morning after pill, IUDs and so on.</P>
      <P>Can I emphasise again the extremely specific nature of the amendment being proposed?  What we are doing is adopting the test for termination of pregnancy where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, as set out by the Supreme Court with the difference only that we are not providing that a risk of self destruction should be a ground for termination of pregnancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from providing more <Col N="358" /> grounds on which a pregnancy can be terminated we are, in fact, restricting the grounds that have existed in our law since the Supreme Court gave its decision in the X case.</P>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the depth and genuineness of feelings aroused by the matters I have mentioned &mdash; particularly rape and incest &mdash; I also appreciate and must take account of the deep feeling against abortion that exists throughout this country and which was given explicit expression some years ago when a majority of the people voted to include Article 40.3.3º in our Constitution.  All of these matters which I have just mentioned are outside the scope of the very specific measure we are proposing. However strongly some people may feel about these matters, I doubt very much that there would be widespread support for the changes suggested which would be seen, I have no doubt, as paving the way for widescale abortions.  The amendment proposed does not deal with these issues.  The position under law in relation to them will be the same after the amendment is passed as it is today.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that the proper way to approach the problems we are dealing with is simply to repeal Article 40.3.3º.  Some people who advocate that course see Article 40.3.3º as the factor that has given rise to the controversial and troubling questions that now concern us.  I do not think we need spend much time on this suggestion.  Is it being seriously suggested by any Deputy that the people of this country who voted by a large majority to include Article 40.3.3º in the Constitution would be likely now, nine years later, to reverse their view and vote to remove Article 40.3.3º from the Constitution?  I do not believe such a prospect is likely and because of that I regard this suggestion as academic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of Deputy Shatter's contribution seemed to amount to little more than a plea for more time to consider the issues involved.  His case would have been better made had he not decided to use a substantial amount of the time available to him to make a series of baseless <Col N="359" /> allegations about the Government's approach to these complex matters.</P>
    <P>In my opening contribution to the debate I stated that the Government recognise the genuineness and the depth of people's feelings and concerns about this whole subject &mdash; whether from a pro-life, a pro-choice or other point of view. I also placed on the record of the House the Government's appreciation of the willingness of the other parties to endeavour to achieve a consensus on how best to approach this matter.</P>
    <P>Given these remarks and the nature of the difficult issues we are all here trying to deal with, it is a pity that Deputy Shatter, having given a highly selective account of the debate on the 1983 amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the other hand, it seems to be the case that the Deputy's party accept the need for a constitutional amendment.  That, in logic, can only arise because they find some aspects of the Supreme Court's judgment in the X case unacceptable.  I have no idea from the Deputy's contribution what aspects of the judgment they have a problem with.  The Government's approach has been clear.</P>

I am afraid it is difficult to avoid concluding that remarks of this kind by the Deputy, combined with a call which amounts to saying that the best approach to take for the present is to procrastinate in relation to the issues dealt with in the Bills before the House, reveal a reluctance to actually deal with &mdash; and take a position on &mdash; the real issues involved.</P>

I would remind the House, however, that the Party Leader's statement last June indicated that legislative and/or constitutional changes arising from the Supreme Court decision would be placed before the Dáil by the Government as soon as is practicable and, in any case, by the autumn.  The Government have delivered on that.  We have honoured the commitment which was made to the people.  The Leaders' statement also referred to a referendum on the issues of travel and information being held in the autumn.  I think most people would have concluded from that statement that if the Government decided that the substantive issue should be dealt with by way of an amendment to the Constitution that this referendum would be held at the same time as the other referenda.  The people <Col N="362" /> in accepting the Maastricht Treaty no doubt were influenced by the commitment given to deal with the issues arising from the decision in the X case.  I think that it would be utterly unreasonable now to expect them to deal with the issues on travel and information not knowing what is going to be done on the substantive issue.  Indeed I believe that such an approach could have implications for the likelihood of the amendment on travel and information succeeding.</P>
    <P>In response to the point made by a number of Deputies opposed to excluding suicide as a ground for termination of pregnancy, I refer the House to the contribution which the Minister for Health made to the debate last evening when he dealt with that matter thoroughly.  I would just like to reiterate one point he made: if it is very difficult to predict accurately in an individual case, accepting suicidal tendencies as a ground for termination would be likely to lead to the certain loss of many unborn children, without any certainty that even one suicide had been averted.</P>

      <P>I turn now to the Thirteenth Amendment Bill on freedom to travel between the State and other states.  There has been general support in the debate for the aim and general effect of this proposed amendment to the Constitution. Some reservations have been expressed, however, about the form of the amendment and about whether it achieves the effect it is desired to achieve. I am satisfied that the reservations are not well founded.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring suggested that the wording provided for in the amendment on travel seemed to assume that there is a general right to travel under the Constitution even though, he says, such a general right is not referred to in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to agree with the Deputy that there is no such existing constitutional right to travel.  On the reading of the judgments of each of the five <Col N="363" /> judges of the Supreme Court in the X case it is clear that such a right exists.  For example, the Chief Justice spoke of &ldquo;the very fundamental nature of the right to travel and its particular importance in relation to the characteristics of a free society&rdquo; and he did so in a context in which he made it clear he was talking about a constitutional right.  Judge Hederman referred to the &ldquo;exercise of the Constitutional right to travel.&rdquo;  Judge McCarthy referred to the right to travel having been identified as one of the unenumerated rights guaranteed under Article 40 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring seems to suggest that the proposed Thirteenth Amendment as it stands means that the Oireachtas could at some future time prohibit a pregnant woman from travelling abroad for an abortion because the amendment simply says that Article 40.3.3º shall not limit freedom to travel.  It seems to me to be straining things a bit to suggest that an explicit provision of the Constitution to the effect that considerations arising by virtue of Article 40.3.3º shall not limit freedom of travel could be circumvented by ordinary legislation saying that considerations of a similar kind could be invoked to restrict that freedom.  That is apart altogether from the inherent improbability of the Oireachtas ever attempting to enact such a law, given the unqualified support there is from all parties and the virtually universal support there is from the general public for freedom to travel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring has referred also to the fact that, before the enactment of Article 40.3.3º, the courts indicated that the unborn is implicitly protected by other provisions of the Constitution apart from Article 40.3.3º, so that those other provisions could be relied on in a travel injunction case, since the proposed amendment relates only to limiting the scope of Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>The right to life of the unborn is now explicitly recognised and guaranteed by Article 40.3.3º.  That explicit guarantee has been held to take precedence over the right of the mother to travel where she <Col N="364" /> intends to leave the State to have an abortion and there is not a real or substantial risk to her life.  If the people by referendum now decides that that express guarantee is not to limit freedom to travel out of the State, surely it is fanciful to suggest that the courts would circumvent that expression of the will of the people by reverting to a possible implicit guarantee of the right to life of the unborn that had been referred to in a case prior to the creation of the express guarantee in Article 40.3.3º?  I am advised that a reference to Article 40.3.3º in the proposed Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is sufficient to achieve the aims of that Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring also stated that the amendment should seek to protect the right to receive a service lawfully available elsewhere in addition, as he says, to simply establishing the right to travel to receive such a service.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the amendment as it stands will ensure that a woman who wishes to travel abroad to avail of a service in another jurisdiction that is unlawful here but lawful in the other jurisdiction will have the right to do so in the knowledge that an injunction may not be taken against her to stop her travelling. There is no good basis for any suggestion that, even though a woman is by virtue of an express provision of the Constitution not to be injuncted from travelling abroad, she could still be injuncted from having an abortion after she travels abroad.  Of the three Supreme Court judges who in the X case found that a general injunction against travel abroad could lie where there was no real and substantial risk to the mother's life, two explicitly rejected the idea of an injunction confined to restricting a woman from leaving the jurisdiction for the purpose of having an abortion outside the State &mdash; on the basis that such an injunction would not be effective to protect the right of the unborn to life.</P>
    <P>While I do not accept the need for Deputy Spring's amendments to the Bill on freedom to travel, they are all at least well and truly constructively motivated.  I cannot say the same for Deputy Shatter's <Col N="365" /> contribution on this issue which amounted to no more than some cheap shots at the bona fides of having the constitutional amendment proposed in the Thirteenth Amendment Bill side by side with that proposed in the Twelfth Amendment Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that something is prohibited in the State is no reason to prevent a person travelling out of the State to avail of it in another state where it is lawful.  This is not a phenomenon peculiar to this country.  Nor should the fact that something is lawful in another state and some Irish people travel there to avail of it mean that it should be made legal here.  We have our own value system about how the public interest and the private interest should be balanced with regard to what should or should not be lawful in the State.</P>
      <P>The substance of the Fourteenth Amendment Bill, on freedom to obtain or make available information, has also received general support in the course of this debate, though again there have been some reservations expressed about its form and about the fact that the legislation on this matter had not been published. To take the latter point first, my colleague the Minister for Health has, of course, now indicated to the House what the contents of the Government's legislative proposals on the information issue will be.  The draft legislative proposals on the information issue will be.  The draft legislative proposals themselves will be published shortly so that when the people vote on the proposed amendments to the Constitution they will have a clear picture of what the conditions that are to be laid down by law will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In outlining the proposed legislation, the Minister for Health explained that the information of a general nature will be permitted to be made available through certain media, provided that it is factual and does not seek to promote abortion in preference to alternative courses of action.  However, where a <Col N="366" /> pregnant woman seeks advice concerning her own specific circumstances from, for example, a doctor or an advice agency, it will only be permissible to supply information concerning abortion services in the context of full non-directive counselling on all of the options open to the person concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If, having considered all of these options, the woman decides that she wishes to seek an abortion outside the country, the doctor or advice agency will be free to provide whatever further information she may need.  However, abortion referral will not be permitted, since this goes beyond the provision of information.</P>
      <P>My brief reference to this matter in the course of my earlier speech was, of course, entirely consistent with this, but I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify it further for Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring has objected that the wording of the proposed amendment is negative rather than affirmative, that it does not create a right to give or receive information and that it does not prohibit the Oireachtas from banning information. The purpose of the proposed amendment is quite specific.  It is to address the fact that the dissemination in the State of information on abortion which is unlawful in the State but lawful elsewhere is prohibited by virtue of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  The intent of the amendment is to remove that restriction on the freedom there would otherwise be to provide and receive such information and to make that freedom subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law.</P>
      <P>I want to conclude by shifting the focus from the individual Bills for a moment and looking at the overall thrust and balance of what the Government are proposing. I would ask that I might be given time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the main Opposition party.  The positive affirmation of the right to life of the unborn, with due regard to the right to life of the mother, which was adopted by the people in 1983 and is contained in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, is being retained.  The essence of the test laid down by the Supreme Court in interpreting that provision is also being retained, except that a risk of self-destruction will not be a ground for termination of pregnancy.  The proposed amendment on the substantive issue will protect the right to life of the unborn child whole at the same time ensuring that the mother will receive all treatment that is necessary to resolve any life-threatening medical condition she suffers from, even if that treatment results in the loss of the unborn child's life.  The amendment is pro-life, affording as it does the maximum practicable protection to he life of both the mother and the unborn child.  It is also designed to avoid the possibility that abortion as that term is understood in everyday usage &mdash; in other words termination of pregnancy which is not for the sole purpose of saving the life of the mother &mdash; might become available in this country.  That is why it excludes health unrelated to a risk to the mother's life as a ground for termination of pregnancy.</P>
      <P>The right of pregnant women to travel between this country and other countries, whatever the purpose of their journey, which was freely exercised before the X case, is being restored.  The one point on which there was a virtually unanimous groundswell of public opinion after that case was that there should be no restriction on freedom to travel by reason of Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Important new rights to receive information, including non-directive conselling, about abortion services available <Col N="368" /> in other countries are being conferred on women.  Again, there was a widespread feeling among the general public after the X case that information of this kind should be accessible to pregnant women, especially those in crisis pregnancies, who should be free to make an informed decision in awareness of the full range of alternative options available.  As my colleague, the Minister for Health, has made clear, directive counselling, or the actual advocacy of abortion, will not be permitted in the proposed legislation on this subject.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the right to life raises the most profound and delicate issues, moral, medical and legal.  Harmonising competing or conflicting rights to life, in particular, creates problems of a most difficult, not to say intractable, kind.  The X case and the public debate in its aftermath gave rise to a series of complex and difficult issues.  I think that any fair-minded and impartial observer would be prepared to acknowledge that the proposals in the three Bills to amend the Constitution that are now before the House represent a conscientious, reasonable and balanced response to those issues and one that is in the public interest.  The Government are satisfied that these proposals are the correct response to the problems arising and are happy to commend these amendments of the Constitution to the people in the forthcoming referenda on 3 December.</P>
    <P>I propose to the House that the motion to give the three Bills in question a Second Reading should now be adopted.</P>

      <P>What is clear in the teeth of the crisis at Aer Lingus is that neither the Minister nor the Government have any detailed air transport policy to deal with the problem.  The development of an aviation policy is now of critical importance not only for the 7,500 people employed by Aer Lingus but for the jobs throughout the State.  Aer Lingus will not survive without a Government policy. The Minister must bear in mind that the loss of 1,500 jobs at Aer Lingus would have the same devastating effect as the proposed loss of 30,000 jobs in the coal mining industry in Britain.</P>
      <P>Recent packages, however laudable, agreed between management and unions have not been sufficient to solve the problem. It must be patently obvious to the Minister and to everybody else that Aer Lingus will not survive without a detailed plan of positive action.  Our geographical location renders it essential that Ireland be assured of a regular scheduled air service on the main routes to the United States, and Europe while air access must form a fundamental part of regional policy.</P>
      <P>In this regard consideration must be given by the Government towards the injection of EC Structural funds to assist our national airline.  As the Minister will be aware, the European Community have already approved schemes of investment for the airlines of France and Belgium.  As sole shareholder, the Minister has a national responsibility to protect the jobs at Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem, as the Minister must concede, has been compounded by five years continuous neglect on the part of the Government.  Fleet renewal for the next three years will cost £200 million.  What plans has the Minister in this regard? What does the shareholder propose to do?  It is simply outrageous for the Government's response to be a shrugging of shoulders, insisting that the present budgetary position does not allow for action.  As one of the Government backbenchers <Col N="377" /> announced this evening, we are in a doomsday situation.  Capital requirement for the next five years will exceed £700 million and, with continuing annual losses of almost £40 million per year, this should be sufficient to trigger the necessary alarm bells on the Minister's desk.  The importance of State assistance for indigenous Irish companies is underlined in all the major reports of recent years &mdash; the Culliton report, NESC reports and the Government's most recent report, the first report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment. The Minister must act immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time with me and I shall be brief as I am anxious to allow Deputy Owen to contribute also.  Aer Lingus employ 7,600 persons, of whom I represent at least 2,000, ranging from management and the highly technically skilled to the lowest paid worker.  These employees have provided a marvellous service to the people.  However, they tell me that ludicrous travelling arrangements exist whereby Americans must fly into London, Glasgow and Manchester before travelling to Dublin and Canadians and west coast travellers must fly into Amsterdam before travelling to Dublin.  The increased cost of such travel arrangements puts Aer Lingus out of the tourist and charter business.  Holidays from America are keenly priced and because of these flight arrangements Aer Lingus are losing out heavily on the North Atlantic route.  The Government should carry out an independent study to ensure the continued existence of Shannon Airport and that it will continue to provide the same level of employment as is the case today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company will have to discuss their future, hopefully by way of joint venture with other airlines in Europe.  However, the workers' interest will have to be protected and this should be done by way of a golden share.  In the B &amp; I episode the Government refused to allow a golden share and the rights of the workers in B &amp; I were sold off.  We do not want that <Col N="378" /> to happen with Aer Lingus.  The Government should retain a golden share, thereby protecting employment and the interests of the employees.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta could contribute to the retention of jobs, especially at Dublin Airport, by reducing landing fees.  Aer Lingus management must be congratulated for recently purchasing the latest and most modern fuel efficient aircraft. However, if they continue to lose passengers on the north Atlantic route, those highly technical purchases will be of little value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are the chief shareholder in Aer Lingus and therefore they will be responsible for the resulting loss of jobs and damage to the company.  Aer Lingus are responsible for bringing into this country 40 per cent of our tourists through their own marketing strategy.  Without these tourists the tourism industry would be very lean indeed. In their 56 years of existence Aer Lingus have received £68 million in Government equity as against £100 million a year to CIE.  The EC have allowed Air France and Sabena to be subvented by their Governments.  The Minister should not allow our national airline to go to the wall.  If it does, she will be held responsible.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt faoi chomhlacht Stáit Aer Lingus ar an ócáid seo.  The air transport division of Aer Lingus suffered a loss before tax of £38 million in the year 1991-92.  This followed on a loss of £42.5 million in the previous year.  It is no secret that the division is facing major losses again this year.  I have been deeply concerned for some time at the continuing deterioration in the financial performance of Aer Lingus, particularly in their core air transport business.  Both I and my Department have repeatedly made this concern known to the Chairman and management of the airline, especially over the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the world aviation <Col N="379" /> industry is going through a difficult period.  Despite this, there are many factors within the airline's control which must be addressed.  Like all businesses, it is the task of Aer Lingus to ensure that they have a realistic strategy for dealing with the commercial environment in which they operate.  This strategy must be constantly evaluated by reference to its primary objective which, in the case of Aer Lingus, is the return of the air transportation division to profitability at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is the responsibility of the board of Aer Lingus to determine and have implemented the appropriate commercial, financial and operational policies to ensure the ongoing viability of the company.  I expect the board to spare no effort to fulfil their obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>Because of the urgent need for significant improvement, as first step towards bringing the air transport business out of losses to a position of profitability, the company have put in place a plan to carry out a fundamental and wideranging appraisal of their air transport business.  Based on this appraisal, the board of Aer Lingus will be taking decisions on the appropriate measures necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective.  Such decisions are a matter, in the first instance, for the board.</P>
    <P>I am, however, keeping in close touch with the situation on behalf of the shareholder. Both I and my Department have had discussions with the company on the situation on an almost weekly basis.  I will be meeting with the board tomorrow morning at their regular monthly meeting. I must stress that as the board have not yet made any submission to me on a package of remedial measures I am not prepared to comment in advance of receiving and considering such a submission. I am certainly not prepared to comment on rumours or media speculation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Michael Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the serious loss of water through leakage of the reservoir at Castletroy, County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter.  I would also like to thank the Minister of State for coming into the House so late after such a long and traumtic day.  It is very late to be conducting business, even though it is important to our consituencies.</P>
      <P>The reservoir at Newcastle, Castletroy, County Limerick, which was built 100 years ago, is now porous and is leaking 1.3 million gallons of water per day. This is the main reservoir for the city and its environs and if it were to be subject to a break or collapse that whole area would be without water for an indefinite period.  This would cause a major emergency. To put the matter in context, the reservoir supplies water to 100,000 people and it also supplies all the factories and businesses in the greater city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give the go ahead immediately to the building of a new reservoir and water tower for Limerick city in or around the same location. The leakage at present costs Limerick Corporation £120,000 annually and there are frequent disruptions in water supplies for lengthy periods.  The Minister's Department are well aware of the difficulty. The contract for a new reservoir was put to tender in early 1991 and contractors were selected by Limerick Corporation. These contractors were recommended by the Minister for the Environment in 1992 for appointment, but as yet the Minister has made no decision on the matter.  The contract would cost about £3.5 million and it would take about two years to complete the work, but the project would be eligible <Col N="381" /> for EC funding, I presume, at a rate of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this matter.  The system is sustainable at present even though there is a leakage of 1.3 million gallons a day but if there is a serious break or collapse the whole area will be without water and it will not be possible to remedy the situation for a very long period.  I would ask the Minister to give the go ahead for the construction of a new reservoir.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say to Deputy Noonan that I am not glad he raised this matter at 12.45 a.m. although my script states that I am glad he raised the matter.  Of course I am glad he raised it but I am sure he will acknowledge that it is very late.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister who is away on official Government business. I understand that there are problems with the existing reservoir in Limerick and that tenders for the approval of a new covered reservoir are in my Department.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the Government's environment action programme in 1990, over £100 million has been invested in the provision of adequate supplies of good quality drinking water.  A further £200 million will be spent on these services up to the end of the decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This investment in the provision of new and improved water supply schemes throughout the country will ensure compliance with the exacting standards required under the European Communities Drinking Water Regulations.  In 1990 the first national report on drinking water quality was published.  This report confirmed the fundamental good quality of supplies throughout the country.  It is intended that a further report based on sampling in 1990 will be published shortly.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment local authorities, who are the responsible bodies in this area, for their achievements to date. Over the last five years some £16 million has been provided by this Government towards the cost of water and sanitary <Col N="382" /> services facilities in the Limerick area. Major sewerage scheme at Rathkeale and Castletroy which involve a total investment of £23.6 million are under construction and are likely to be completed in 1994.</P>
    <P>The problems with the existing reservoir, which have been well documented, provide adequate justification for the provision of a new reservoir to serve Limerick city.  The proposal has, therefore, been included in the sanitary services programme.  The existing reservoir, which has a capacity of 26,000 cubic metres, was constructed at the end of the last century and has inadequate capacity to cater for present demand. Water losses through leakage of over one million gallons a day are quite unsatisfactory and a worrying drain on the Limerick Corporation's resources.  I understand that an extensive survey of the reservoir has been carried out by Limerick Corporation.  I am most anxious that my Department be advised of the results of this survey and also of the corporation's proposals for interim remedial works so that some control can be applied to these losses pending the construction of the new reservoir.</P>
    <P>A tender recommendation has been submitted to my Department by Limerick Corporation for the construction of a 50,000 cubic metre reservoir and a 900 cubic metre water tower to cater for consumers in the more elevated parts of the city.  This proposal will involve an investment in excess of £4 million and will take two years to complete.</P>
    <P>The level of capital commitments on the water and sanitary services programme is exceptionally high at present. As a result, it has not yet been possible to approve this major scheme.  While I cannot give a definite commitment at this stage, I can, however, assure Deputy Noonan that the Minister will endeavour to bring urgent schemes such as Limerick city reservoir, to construction as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the <Col N="383" /> opportunity to raise this matter in the House.  I appreciate that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is absent on important business and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach for coming to hear the few points I wish to raise in the context of this matter.  I should also like to advise the House &mdash; and you, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash; that since I requested an opportunity to deal with this matter the m.v. <i>Solo</i> has been released from detention by the Russians at Murmansk and is now safely on its way to a port in Norway.</P>
      <P>I should like to place on record my appreciation, as a constituency representative for the Irish citizen, Susan Foreman, who was on that boat, to the consular section of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the work they undertook in maintaining contact through diplomatic representatives at Murmansk with the ship and the people on board.  I have no doubt that Greenpeace and Miss Foreman's family appreciate the work that was done.  I am sure the same applies to Miss Foreman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a number of matters remain outstanding and I ask the Minister of State to consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his return with a view to doing a number of very basic things.  The ship was seized in international waters, it was not within the territorial waters of Russia when it was boarded by armed members of the naval service of Russia and detained.  It was in an area they consider &mdash; and describe &mdash; as the economic area zone but that is a zone and area not recognised for the purposes of international law and they had no business seizing and boarding the craft in the circumstances. In addition, three shots were fired from a 30 millimetre gun at the stern of the boat as a warning, a threat or indeed an insult.  They were then taken forcibly in tow and dragged through the waters to a naval base north of Murmansk where they were held incommunicado for almost one week.  Only diplomatic representatives were allowed to enter the ship, a lawyer and representative of Greenpeace, who were in Murmansk, <Col N="384" /> were not allowed to meet or consult the crew.</P>
    <P>The radio control room of the ship was also sealed so that no contact could be made by the crew members with their own organisation, friends or relatives. Consequently, the rights of an Irish citizen were very seriously violated by the Russian naval authorities and I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to lodge the strongest possible protest with the Russian authorities in relation to this matter. In addition, it is important that Ireland should strongly state its support, through this action of protest, for Greenpeace, which is a friend of Ireland in a very meaningful way, Indeed, one of the other members and crew on board the ship was a Mr. John Large, an Englishman who works as an adviser &mdash; not only to Greenpeace &mdash; but to Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Corporation, in regard to our interest in pursuing matters in England relating to Sellafield and other nuclear programmes there.  He was also detained in the way I have already described.</P>
    <P>Greenpeace are a non-violent, active organisation working in our interest and in those of people around the world for a safe environment.  They are acknowledged to be non-violent and are not armed.  There was no need for the aggressive, hijacking attitude of the Russian authorities on this occasion.  They were simply trying to investigate an area which is considered to be the single largest world-wide illegal dump of nuclear submarine reactors in the world.  It has been in operation for over 30 years and has been used by the Russians contrary to all international agreements, including the provisions of the London Dumping Conference of which Ireland and Russia are members.  Over the period of 30 years it has received over 15 reactors from dumped submarines and has had over 100 nuclear tests carried out there.  For those reasons, it was responsible and reasonable for Greenpeace to be in the area to carry out their own independent tests of the contamination and abuse of the environment generally.</P>
    <P>One of the crew members was an <Col N="385" /> elected member of the Russian parliament and no one could complain in relation to what they were doing.  They certainly did not deserve the treatment they got and I hope that Ireland will record its strong reservations &mdash; if not protests &mdash; about what has happened.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Dutch registered Greenpeace vessel <i>m.v. Solo</i>, was released today and has already left the Russian port of Murmansk.  Miss Susan Foreman, the Irish citizen on board, is well and has been in touch with her family by ship's radio to convey the news.</P>
      <P>The Irish Embassy in Moscow, which monitored Miss Foreman's welfare closely throughout the incident, was advised that the <i>m.v. Solo</i> was escorted out of Murmansk today at 16.00 hours, Russian time.</P>
      <P>The vessel was arrested on 12 October as it was sailing off the No vaya Zem lya Archipelago where a former Soviet nuclear test site is situated.</P>
      <P>The Russian authorities claimed that the ship had violated the state border of the Russian Federation and legislation on its territorial sea and economic zone.  The Russian authorities said the coastal protection vessel in the area, which had repeatedly warned the <i>m.v. Solo</i> that it could not make explorations in Russian waters without prior permission of the competent Russian authorities firstly detained the vessel to allow it to carry out an on-board inspection.  The inspection, according to Russian sources, revealed samples of water and soil and the decision was then taken to arrest the ship and escort it to Murmansk where a more detailed investigation could be carried out.  The ship arrived in Murmansk last Saturday, where it was until today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Moscow immediately sought an explanation from the Russian Foreign Ministry as to the reasons for the ship's arrest and was informed that the <i>Solo</i> had been arrested on three grounds: the vessel had violated Russia's borders; in entering the relevant <Col N="386" /> sea area, without the prior authorisation of the Russian authorities, it had violated the regulations governing scientific research; the <i>Solo</i> had sailed on the northern sea route without preliminary notification.  The Embassy requested information on the welfare of Ms. Foreman and were assured that they would be kept informed by the Foreign Ministry.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of EC consular co-operation, the Irish Embassy requested a Dutch consular official &mdash; as representative of the flag State &mdash; who visited the <i>Solo</i> in Murmansk to represent the consular interests of Ms. Foreman. After visiting the vessel, the Dutch representative reported to the Irish Embassy that all members of the crew, including Ms. Foreman, were safe and well.</P>
    <P>The Department were also in regular contact with Ms. Foreman's family and with the Greenpeace office in Dublin throughout the past week.  These contacts allowed the Department to be satisfied as to her safety and welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan has raised the question of the making of a protest to the Russian authorities.  As I have indicated, the Irish Embassy in Moscow sought an explanation from the Russian Foreign Ministry and the question of a further approach would need to be considered in the light of knowledge of the full circumstances and an examination of international law in the matter.</P>
    <P>Without entering into the detail of the possible legal issues involved, the ships of all States are entitled under international law to exercise the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea.  Such passage must be continuous and expeditious and stopping and anchoring are acceptable only in exceptional circumstances, for example, to render assistance to persons in distress.  In addition, it is generally accepted that certain activities are incompatible with innocent passage. These include the carrying out of research or survey activities.  Exploration or investigation in a country's territorial sea and economic zone may not be undertaken without the consent of the coastal State.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to make a short statement.  I am glad the Minister of State, a native of County Galway, will reply on this matter which relates to County Galway.  The village of Williamstown, which is in the very northern tip of County Galway, is a very low-lying area.  For many years the people of Williamstown have sought a sewerage scheme, particularly because of the problems with septic tanks in the town. Tonight I should like to make their case very strongly on health grounds because of the problems with septic tanks.  The local national school is a seven teacher school and the committee of the community centre have sought the development of the sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State and, perhaps, the Minister, will as soon as possible meet a deputation from Williamstown where there are approximately 40 houses.  The town also has a very good business community.  There are six public houses in it and the local vintners association pressed very strongly for the scheme in the past.</P>
      <P>I know that the contract documents for both the site investigation works and the scheme are under consideration in the Department and I hope approval for the commencement of the scheme will be given as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter on the Adjournment. As he knows, I have a special interest in Galway as I was born there.  Aware of the fact that Deputy Kitt was around and there would not be a Dáil seat for me there, I moved when I was only six weeks old to join the Minister of State, Deputy Flood in Dublin South-West.</P>
      <P>A sewerage scheme was first proposed for Williamstown in the late fifties.  The village is at present served by septic tanks.  Poor soil percolation limits the effectiveness of those tanks, which has at times resulted in a public health nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary report for the provision <Col N="388" /> of a secondary treatment plant, the laying of sewers, the provision of a pumping station and an outfall pipe to the island river was submitted by Galway County Council in May 1986 and was approved by the Department in March 1987.  Contract documents for the scheme were not submitted, however, until September 1992 as the council experienced difficulty in acquiring the necessary land.  The council have also submitted contract documents for site investigation, and those are currently under examination in the Department.  It is intended that the results of the site investigations will be integrated with the contract documents for the main scheme in due course.</P>
    <P>In the light of existing commitments on the water and sanitary services programme, I cannot indicate at this stage when approval may issue, but the views expressed by Deputy Kitt this evening, and expressed by him to the Minister previously, will be taken into account in assessing the situation.</P>

      <P>The Martinstown group water scheme was formed in October 1989 with the intention of supplying water to the parish of Martinstown.  The proposed scheme will serve about 100 households in the Martinstown area.  The group water scheme committee bored a test well which proved a success.  Subsequently they prepared a design in accordance with the Limerick County Council and the Department of the Environment's specifications.  The present water supply in the parish is poor and contains iron and lime.</P>
      <P>At present people have to draw water and this causes considerable hardship. More than 50 of the members of the group water scheme are farmers and, judging from water supplies taken by Teagasc over the years, most of their individual water supplies will fail the EC Directive.  It is essential, therefore, that a water supply be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware from previous replies that the Minister states that because of budgetary constraints he is unable to approve this scheme.  These people have <Col N="389" /> waited long enough and I ask the Minister to approve this scheme to give a much needed group water scheme to this area, one of a few areas in the county of Limerick deprived of this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Finucane for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>This scheme proposes to serve up to 100 households and farms.  It involves pumping from a borehole to an 80,000 gallon reservoir which will provide a gravity supply to all participants.  The design of the scheme has been cleared with Limerick County Council.  The council's view is that the group's reservoir and distribution system should be enlarged to cater for the future development needs of the area.</P>
      <P>Group water scheme grants to the participants involved are estimated at £68,000.  However, the scheme would require a further substantial grant of about £80,000 from the overall provision available for public schemes in order to meet the cost of the additional works suggested by Limerick County Council.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the funds for public schemes are not unlimited and are in fact subject to enormous competing demands at present.  Having regard to the existing level of commitments under the water and sanitary services programme, I cannot say when there will be a decision on this scheme.  I do undertake, however, to consider the Deputy's concerns closely.</P>

      <P>Protests promoted by big powerful organisations are a fairly common feature on our streets &mdash; indeed they are a regular feature outside Dáil Éireann.  It is not too difficult for the big boys to get the numbers out but a street protest from a rural community is a different matter.  One thing we can be sure of, when we see a rural protest there is a great depth of feeling behind it.  We had such a protest meeting recently by the people of west Sligo, mainly farming families, at the office of the Department of the Environment in Ballina seeking some action on the group scheme for Castleconor, Kilglass, Screen and <Col N="390" /> Dromard.  It was a plea from the heart if ever I heard one.  It is a sad day when these people are forced on to the streets to make their case for the basic need of piped water.  For years they have argued their case, and only very recently they did so directly across the table from the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>No one disputes the special needs of the area because of the dreadful quality of the water supplies at present and because of farming and tourist demands. I do not need to elaborate further on that.  I do not think even the Minister disputes the special needs of west Sligo for these group water schemes, but still what we are getting in response is a total lack of movement, total inertia.  Only yesterday in the Dáil the Minister had an opportunity, in response to my own question, to give some glimmer of hope; but his answer was even more negative than earlier ones.</P>
      <P>The Minister can if he wishes give special grants for schemes because of special cost factors.  This has been the practice in the past.  Why was this not done for west Sligo, where there are particular difficulties, especially since it has now come to light that one of the major problems was created by the Department in curtailing the regional scheme providing the source supply?  There is an anger sweeping through this community in Tirreragh seldom seen by this public representative or indeed before that in a long career as a journalist covering such matters.  The people feel they are being abandoned.  All they are being told is that because of geographical factors and other reasons there is a cost problem with their scheme.  They are told nothing further. Is it any wonder then that they are so angry?  Can we hear from the Minister tonight, through the Minister of State, what efforts he is making to provide special funds for Castleconor, Screen, Dromard and Kilglass?  Let then know that something is being done and give them some hope.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nealon raised this matter in the House last July and on that occasion the Minister outlined to <Col N="391" /> him in detail the difficulties in providing funding for these proposals under group water scheme arrangements.  These Castleconor, Screen and Dromard schemes are extremely costly by the normal standard of group schemes.  This is because as now designed and in order to meet local authority wishes the scheme embodies considerable provision for other future needs.</P>
      <P>This additional capacity has been suggested by the local authority to cater for the many households and farms which have not yet joined the scheme.  At this stage I understand that in some sections of both schemes as few as 50 per cent of householders and farmers have actually pledged themselves to join the scheme. This is obviously contributing to the difficulties of financing these schemes since grants are paid on the basis of £700 per house and £500 per farm if connected to the scheme.</P>
      <P>The overall result at present is that group water scheme grants plus members' own contributions amount to a sum of only 38 per cent of the total cost of these schemes.  The deficit of 62 per cent amounts to some £1.1 million and this substantial grant requirement would have to come from a capital provision for public water supply schemes.  This provision is under enormous demand at present from urgent schemes all around the country.  I cannot therefore give a definite commitment to grant approval at this stage.  However, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Department and the Minister are examining all possible means, including certain alternatives, for supporting the extension of the Lough Easky water supply scheme to these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this very important matter. The Minister would probably agree with me that RTE should be warmly congratulated for screening a programme <Col N="392" /> last night on child sexual abuse.  No one who watched it could have remained unmoved.  It is now long past the time when the country at large should show similar courage and stop sweeping such problems under the carpet.  We should now recognise that such abuse is widespread in Ireland.  The price of our complacency is relentless cruelty to thousands of children.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael produced a discussion document last January to highlight the problem and to give some direction as to how it should be managed.  Victims of child sexual abuse can suffer the most grevious emotional damage, destroying their chances of a normal existence.  The Minister will agree that victims can make a recovery if they receive appropriate counselling and therapy.</P>
      <P>Since 1984 thousands of cases have been reported and, of course, thousands of cases have gone unreported also.  My information is that the Government are not taking the problem very seriously and the answers I get occasionally to parliamentary questions lead me to that conclusion. Thousands of victims are not receiving appropriate and essential treatment. Following last night's programme it is imperative that the Government take this matter seriously.  I look forward to the Minister's response.  I know he is doing his best, but the Government are not giving him much support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>The sexual abuse of a defenceless child is a heinous crime which greatly disturbs all of us.  It goes without saying that any child who has been the unfortunate victim of such abuse should receive every possible support.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for monitoring and coordinating the investigation and management of alleged cases of child abuse, including child sexual abuse, rests with the health boards as part of the child care services provided within the community care programme.  Whenever an investigation into an alleged case of child sexual abuse confirms that abuse has taken place, the relevant health board arranges to make available appropriate counselling and other support services for the unfortunate victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> A number of important initiatives in relation to child abuse have been taken by my Department and by the health boards in recent years.  In 1987 my Department published detailed child abuse guidelines which set out clearly the steps to be taken by the various parties involved in the identification, investigation and management of all forms of child abuse, including child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board area units for the investigation and management of alleged child sexual abuse were established early in 1988 at Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  During the same year a special allocation was made to each of the other seven health boards to enable them to establish appropriate services in their areas.  Services are now in place in each health board area; some of them are based in a particular hospital in the region while others are provided on a community basis.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied with the range of assessment services that are now available. However, I am conscious of the need for further developments in the long term treatment of victims of child abuse, including improvements in the level of child and adolescent psychiatric provision. Towards this end my Department have approved the development of child and adolescent psychiatric services in the North-Eastern, North-Western, MidWestern and South-Eastern Health Board areas, funded with special moneys made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It is my intention to continue to develop these services as available resources permit.</P>
    <P>In come instances, of course, it is regrettably the case that child sexual abuse does not come to light until the victim reaches adulthood.  An increasing number of adults who were sexually abused as children are reporting their horrendous experiences and seeking professional help in coming to terms with those experiences.</P>
    <P>Many past victims of child sexual abuse contact the rape crisis centres for assistance. There are currently seven rape crisis centres operating throughout the country located in the following areas &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, <Col N="394" /> Clonmel and Tralee.  The Tralee centre opened earlier this year.  Services provided by each centre focus predominantly on counselling, both by telephone and on a face to face basis, to victims of recent and past rape attacks and also to adult victims of child sexual abuse.  There is increasing recognition of the complementary role of the work of the rape crisis centres with that of the statutory health services in providing a comprehensive service for victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by assuring the Deputy that I have every sympathy for the unfortunate victims of child sexual abuse and that I am fully committed to the development of services to help them. Our full energies are directed at ensuring that services are provided for children who are identified as having been sexually abused and for adult victims of such abuse who come forward.  The services which I have outlined are a clear indication of the serious efforts being made by the Government to address this difficult problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter here at this hour and the Minister of State for his presence in the House.  It is 12 years almost to the day since I attended my first public meeting in Killybegs, held in the Foresters' Hall there.  The subject matter of that meeting was a new community nursing unit for Killybegs.  I can vividly recall senior members of the Minister of State's party promising that the unit was about to be built.  We have gone around many corners since that 1980 by-election campaign but I am afraid Killybegs is still without a community nursing unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Killybegs and the surrounding areas from Dunkineely and Bruckless right through to Kilcar, Carrick and Glencolumbkille have probably a higher incidence of old people and senior citizens, many of whom live alone, than any other part of the country.  Many of their homes are located in remote areas, far removed from essential services such as shops, post <Col N="395" /> offices, doctors and churches.  These people in their declining years have to be transferred 50 or 60 miles to the nearest community nursing unit out of their immediate environment and far removed from friends, neighbours and families, that is, if any members of their families are left in the area.</P>
    <P>An active and hard-working committee for the nursing unit has been operating in the area for the past 14 years. They have met Ministers and officials and have been given many commitments, only to be disappointed and to have their hopes dashed again and again.  There is widespread support throughout south-west Donegal for a nursing unit for Killybegs. This unit is more urgently needed now than ever before.  All that is required is for the Minister to give the project the green light.  I appeal to the Minister of State here tonight not to disappoint the people of Killybegs again.  Nothing would give them greater satisfaction than an announcement that the nursing home will be provided and built during 1993.  I also appeal to him to convey this message to the Minister and to respond positively to the case of Killybegs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance responsibility for providing a community nursing unit in Killybegs lies with the North Western Health Board.  The board have been considering this for a number of years.  The original plan included residential units but these have been omitted from the present brief which comprises a community nursing unit and a day hospital day centre.  The North-Western Health Board, with my approval, have recently purchased a suitable central site in Killybegs and disposed of an earlier badly-situated site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the proposal of the North-Western Health Board to build a new community nursing unit in Killybegs, County Donegal, as a top priority and I am specifically identifying this need in seeking funding for capital projects for the elderly.  For obvious reasons, it is not the practice to incur costs on the appointment of a design team until it is <Col N="396" /> certain that funds are going to be made available to allow building to proceed.</P>
    <P>The recommendations on services for the elderly contained in the report, <i>The Years Ahead</i> have been adopted by Government and are being progressively implemented.  In 1990 and 1991 the Government allocated substantial funds to the North-Western Health Board. These funds amounted to £590,064. During the past two years the board have considerably improved services for the elderly throughout the region.  In 1990 the board used the funds to enhance community services for the elderly, in line with the then Minister's priorities.  The elderly in the North-West benefited from increased levels of home help, home nursing, day care and the provision of a Department of Medicine of the Elderly at Letterkenny General Hospital.  This investment in services for the elderly has led to a substantial improvement in the level of care for the elderly which I hope will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I must point out to the Deputy that there has been a fair share of positive action in so far as services for the elderly in the North-Western Health Board area are concerned.  I would ask the Deputy to accept the commitment of the Government to the development of services for the elderly in the North-Western Health Board area as shown by the generous additional funding for services for the elderly in the last few years.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the provision of a new community nursing unit for the elderly is regarded by the North-Western Health Board as a vital element of their community care programme.  Approval to go ahead with the project will be conveyed as soon as I am satisfied that the necessary funding is available.  I must take into account competing demands for capital funding from all over the country and indeed the internal priorities of the North-Western Health Board within the overall level of resources made available to my Department in 1993.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 1.25 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 October 1992.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="112" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 24, 34, 43 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the existing system of subvention to nursing homes and their residents is not fully satisfactory.  One of the main objectives of the new system of subvention proposed under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 is to establish an equitable system of subvention for nuring homes and for the dependent persons without the means to pay for nursing home care.  The Act provides for regulations to be drafted under four sections.</P>
      <P>Two sets of draft regulations, one dealing with standards of care and accommodation in nursing homes and another with the boarding out of elderly people have already been discussed with groups representing the elderly, the health boards and the nursing home sector.  A code of practice defining high standards of care in nursing homes has also been drafted by a group representing the elderly, the health boards and the nursing home sector.</P>
      <P>The drafting of regulations to regulate the payment of subventions by health boards to persons who require nursing home care and do not have the means to pay the cost of such care is at an advanced stage.  These regulations will provide for an assessment of the dependency of persons applying for subvention and a comprehensive means test to decide what amount of subvention, if any, should be paid in each case.  The drafting of the subvention regulations which will increase substantially the functions of the health boards in relation to nursing homes, has involved a great deal of discussion and consultation with health boards.  I am glad to say that my officials and the health boards have agreed a subvention system which will be practical in its application and meet the needs of the dependent elderly in need of nursing home care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the drafting of the subvention regulations, which will establish a completely new system of subvention for dependent persons in nursing home care, has taken some time to complete.  The remaining regulations are concerned with the fees to be paid to <Col N="113" /> health boards by nursing home proprietors when registering their nursing homes.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that consultations should begin as soon as possible with bodies representing the elderly and the nursing home interests on the draft regulations which have not yet been circulated. The implementation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 will depend on the availability of additional resources to my Department for this purpose in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children: The Western Health Board are now adopting a systematic targeted approach for the delivery of dental services to school children.  This approach ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  The approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment as necessary.  The classes chosen in the Western Health Board area are second and sixth.  These classes are chosen with preventative treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and provided with treatment as necessary.  This development seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need within the resources available.  In addition emergency treatment is available on demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adults: For the past few years my Department has made a special additional allocation available to the Western Health Board specifically for the <Col N="118" /> development of adult dental services for medical card holders.  The special additional allocation provided in 1991 for this purpose was £300,000 and the Western Board's original allocation for 1992 includes a repeat of this special provision for the continuing development of the adult dental services.</P>
    <P>The 1992 special allocation has enabled the board to provide 4,134 adult dental treatment up to 30 September 1992. However, since end of September 1992 the board's routine adult dental service has had to be curtailed for budgetary reasons.</P>
    <P>All the funds at my disposal for the provision of dental services in 1992 have been allocated.  Funding for the provision of dental services in 1993 is under consideration in the context of the 1993 estimates.</P>
    <P>Emergency service for the relief of pain is of course available on demand.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer disease, is between 20,000 and 30,000.  This estimate is based on a prevalence rate of between 5 and 8 per cent of the population aged 65 years and older.  It is not possible to break these figures down between dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia associated with other factors because of difficulties in diagnosis. My Department has made a financial contribution to the Alzheimer society to carry out research on Alzheimer's disease, which will estimate its prevalence and identify the needs of carers of people with dementia.  It may be <Col N="119" /> possible to answer the Deputy's question more fully when the results of this research are available.</P>
      <P>The incidence of dementia rises with advanced old age.  As our elderly population is increasing, the incidence of Alzheimer disease is also likely to rise.</P>
      <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i> emphasised the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose built accommodation. The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly in October 1988.  Health Boards have prepared plans to implement the recommendations of the report.  In 1990, 1991 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health services to implement the key recommendations of the report, particularly the strengthening of home and community support for the elderly.  This funding enabled boards to enhance their services for people with dementia and their families. I am glad to say that two psychiatrists specialising in the elderly have been appointed in Dublin and a third post has been proposed.  The Government has introduced the carer's allowance in recognition of the burden on relatives of caring for dependent elderly people such as those with dementia.  I feel that these developments represent progress towards translating policy into a practical network of services for Alzheimer patients and their carers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 122 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the current level of speech therapy provision generally and I have, taken steps to remedy the situation. I have reached agreement for six extra students to commence training at the School of Clinical Speech and Language <Col N="121" /> Studies, at Trinity College Dublin, commencing with the forthcoming academic year 1992-93.  The total student body will increase from some 80 students, currently spread over the four year degree programme, to 104 students as of the academic year 1995-96.</P>
    <P>For the academic year 1992-93 my Department will provide funding for this enhanced student intake, while in subsequent years, the funding will be undertaken by the Department of Education through the aegis of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the increased level of graduate output resulting from this important development will considerably ease difficulties in the area of speech and language therapy.</P>
    <P>In addition I have established a Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability to make recommendations for the expansion and improvement of services for people with a physical disability within the framework of the commitments in relation to the physically disabled contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  One of the matters to be addressed by the group will be the improvement of speech therapy services.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position at the Nano Nagle School, I understand that the Southern Health Board who is responsible for the provision of speech therapy at the school, is concerned at the adequacy of the speech therapy service in its area.  The board is currently examining the position and a detailed report will be made shortly to clarify the full extent of the deficit in the service and make recommendations as to how this situation might be improved.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and and Social Progress</i>, the Government are committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have equality of opportunity in employment and has, in the past year, taken a number of initiatives to improve employment opportunities. These are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Employment Support Scheme for people with disabilities, whereby employers are paid a subsidy in respect of reduced productivity, is being improved and expanded through</P>
      <P> (i) its establishment on a permanent footing with its own budget,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii) the eligibility of both recipients <Col N="123" /> of DPMA and Social Welfare benefits to participate in the scheme, and</P>
    <P>(iii) the retention for a period of up to one year of the &ldquo;fringe benefits&rdquo; which people had held prior to securing placement on the scheme. </P>
    <P>In the light of the improvements to the scheme, outlined above, it is estimated that approximately 150 will be employed under this scheme in 1993.</P>
    <P>2.  The National Rehabilitation Board which operates under my aegis has established a National Advisory Committee on the Training and Employment of people with disabilities.  The Committee is representative of the Departments of Health, Labour, FAS, NRB, the social partners (ICTU &amp; FIE) and organisations representing people with disabilities. While this Committee will consider all aspects of training and employment it has, in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which is aimed at maximising employment opportunities, established a sub-committee to report to the Central Review Committee on the interaction between the Department of Health, the National Rehabilitation Board and FÁS in relation to training and placement of people with disabilities. It is expected that this sub-committee will report shortly.</P>
    <P>3.  In addition the Government has established a committee, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to monitor the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase on a gradual and sustained basis the number employed of those with disabilities in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In line with a recommendation of the Monitoring Committee, the Government has decided to make each Minister responsible for employment of persons with disabilities in the area for which he has direct statutory control and/or functional responsibility.  Insofar as employment in the health service is concerned, I am fully committed to making every effort to increase the number of disabled persons employed consistent with overall <Col N="124" /> employment control and cost containment policy for the health service.  I will be pursuing this particular issue with the various health agencies which have direct responsibility for employment of staff over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The provision of psychiatric services in County Waterford is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The board in line with the policy set out in the Report, <i>Planning for the Future</i>, are developing a community oriented psychiatric service in Waterford. The development of such a service involves the provision of community and acute psychiatric admission facilities.  In line with <i>Planning for the Future</i>, a community based alcoholism service is also being developed.  The board, as part of the development of psychiatric services are arranging for the provision of better and more appropriate services for persons with mental handicap who have been inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals in the board's area.

      <P>Drug misuse is a complex, difficult and often distressing problem and I believe that effective approaches to tackling the problem of drug misuse must be part of an integrated and coherent strategy involving a number of agencies including health professionals, educationalists, parents and voluntary groups.</P>
      <P>To this end my Department's health promotion unit and the health boards have been engaged in a wide range of inter-sectoral activities to prevent the misuse of drugs.  Specific programmes are in place in the formal and informal education sectors.  In the North-Western Health Board, for example, a lifeskills programme for second-level schools has been in operation for many years and this deals with, <i>inter alia</i>, substance abuse. This programme has, in recent years, been extended to primary schools.</P>
      <P>At primary school level I have also recently launched the Bí Folláin programme in the Mid-Western Health Board.  Bí Folláin is a holistic health education programme for primary schools which has been piloted in the past three years in the Mid-Western Health Board. Although not dealing exclusively with substance misuse the programme equips young people with the skills necessary to make healthy lifestyle choices.  The evaluation of this programme was very positive and consideration is now being given as to how this programme can be made available to other health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level a substance abuse prevention programme is being developed by the health promotion unit and the <Col N="128" /> psychological service of the Department of Education.  This programme commenced on a pilot basis in 8 second level schools in September 1991 with the support of the European Commission and Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  This comprehensive programme involves the whole school staff and includes materials on assertiveness, self-esteem, influences on young people and decision making skills. An interim evaluation of Phase I of the programme has just been carried out and this indicated very positive results.  Phase II will run during the 1992-93 school year and following a final evaluation materials will be made available nationwide.  The fact that this programme is referred to in the Department of Education's Green Paper on Education indicates my colleague the Minister for Education's interest in the expansion of this Programme in the year's ahead.</P>
    <P>Also at second level, AIDS education resources materials have been disseminated. These materials were jointly developed by the health promotion unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education and circulated to all second level schools in September 1990.  The materials carry specific information on the dangers of drug misuse and the risk of HIV infection.  In-service training was offered to teachers in all schools.  Evaluation of the programme and its effectiveness is being conducted at the moment and results of this evaluation will be available by the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>In the informal education sector the drink awareness for youth programme was jointly developed by the health promotion unit and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  This programme has been running in youth clubs and schools all over the country since October 1990. Over one thousand people have been trained to use the programme which uses participative learning methods to improve decision making skills and enhance the self-esteem of young people so that they can say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to drug misuse. A detailed evaluation of both trainers and young people's attitudes to the programme and its effectiveness is in progress <Col N="129" /> at the moment.  Results of this evaluation will be available in early 1993.</P>
    <P>At community level &ldquo;Drugs Questions Local Answers&rdquo; is a community based training programme that tackles drug problems.  Since its launch in 1987 this programme has been effective in enabling both professional and voluntary agencies to co-operate in drug prevention strategies.  In my Department we are very much aware of the contribution that can be made by voluntary organisations and we support the very fine work that is being done by such organisations.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit has also initiated a pilot drug education project for parents in the Southern Health Board in conjunction with the Cork Social and Health Education Project.  This project focuses, not only on the drugs themselves, but also on the skills and personal attributes that help parents deal with drug situations in which children might find themselves.</P>
    <P>At European Community Level the Council of Health Ministers has called for a special week that will focus on drug misuse prevention.  November 16-22nd of this year has accordingly been designated European Drug Prevention Week by the European Commission.  This week will emphasise prevention strategies and initiatives targetted at young people.</P>
    <P>In Ireland a national steering committee has been established and regional co-ordinators have been appointed who will plan and oversee a range of actions and activities that will help focus on efforts that are being made to prevent drug misuse amongst young people.  In planning for this week there has been co-operation between the Departments of Health, Education, Justice and Labour and the non-statutory sector.  The degree of co-operation achieved to date bodes well for further initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>As a back up to these programmes and as stand alone educational materials a wide range of promotional literature is distributed free of charge through the Health Promotion Unit's public office. This includes the following titles:</P>
    <P>Drugs Your Choice (for young people)</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> Understanding Drugs (for parents)</P>
    <P>You, Drink and Your Life</P>
    <P>You, Drink and your Children</P>
    <P>You, Drink and Young People</P>
    <P>Women and Alcohol</P>
    <P>Information on Smoking and Health</P>
    <P>So You Want to Stop Smoking Hepatitis B</P>
    <P>The huge demand for these materials is an indication of how useful they are for professionals, educators and youth leaders.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that such inter-sectoral strategies work.  The co-ordinated efforts of my own Department with other agencies in reducing the consumption of tobacco products is evidence of this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate from the above information that the various promotional and awareness programmes on drug misuse have been evaluated at pilot stage and, again when they have been fully operational for some time.  These evaluations consistently show that such programmes can be effective and that there is a demand for them not only from teachers and youth leaders but also from young people themselves.  Our drug misuse awareness programme is only one component of the Government's comprehensive strategy to prevent drug misuse.  In this strategy we have set out to implement realistic and achievable objectives in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.  This strategy also sets out a comprehensive co-ordinated structure which is geared towards effective implementation of all aspects of programmes geared to combat drug misuse.</P>

    <P>&mdash;expectant mothers should not smoke or allow anyone to smoke near the baby during the first year of life</P>
    <P>&mdash;if at all possible mothers should breastfeed babies for the first few weeks, not because this in itself reduces the risk of cot death, but because it may reduce the risk of infection.  </P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 51 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>At present, a voluntary, linked HIV surveillance system is in operation under which a person can establish his or her HIV status.  Under the system a blood test is taken and this is analysed for the presence or otherwise of the infection. The person is counselled before the test is taken and informed about the implications of a positive test.  In the event of a positive HIV test, the person is again counselled and is advised about the management of their condition, the care and management services available and methods to reduce the risk of spreading the infection.  The service is available from a range of outlets, including sexually transmitted disease clinics, general practitioners, general hospitals, the AIDS Resource Centre, Baggot Street, community-based GP clinics for HIV and the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street, Dublin 2.</P>
      <P>The HIV surveillance system is currently used for the monitoring, by the Department of Health, of the spread of the infection, on the basis of monthly statistics submitted by the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD.  The laboratory is the national centre for confirmatory HIV testing and all HIV tests which show up as positive in the initial test are referred to the laboratory for confirmation.  Under this surveillance programme, the Department monitors the spread of the infection under a number of classification groupings as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Heterosexuals;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Intravenuous Drug Users;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Children at risk of contracting the infection;</P>

    <P>&mdash;Blood Donors and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Organ Donors.</P>
    <P>A total of 63,118 HIV tests have been undertaken for HIV antibodies to date and of these a total of 1,283 have tested positive.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health also monitors the prevalence and incidence of cases of, and deaths from AIDS in Ireland, on a monthly basis.  To date a total of 294 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Department and, of these, a total of 129 have died.</P>
    <P>While the present system is considered to be adequate to evaluate general trends in the incidence of AIDS and HIV, the National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am Chairman, recommended in April 1992 that more comprehensive and accurate information is required on the spread of HIV infection in the community generally as a basis for the planning and evaluation of relevant services and programmes.  The Committee established a Sub-Committee on AIDS/HIV Surveillance and Epidemiology and requested it to make recommendation on the contents and implementation of such a mechanism.</P>
    <P>The committee has now recommended that the HIV surveillance programme should be extended, on a phased basis, to involve the anonymous, unlinked batch screening of surplus blood specimens given voluntarily by patients for necessary clinical tests.</P>
    <P>I have decided to introduce the first part of the programme recommended by the committee i.e. anonymous screening at antenatal clinics, with effect from Monday, 26 October 1992 and will make decisions in regard to the other areas recommended in the near future.</P>
    <P>As the framework for implementing the programme is largely in place, the cost of implementing the programme are not expected to be significant.</P>
    <P>The programme is a necessary <Col N="137" /> statistical/epidemiological exercise to ensure that the appropriate and relevant services and programmes are put in place to respond effectively and efficiently to the AIDS/HIV problem.  The blood specimens used are surplus to their original requirements and, by the nature of the programme, are anonymous and unlinkable to the persons who donated them.  As I mentioned at the outset, there is a comprehensive programme of individual HIV-testing already in place, which includes the essential element of one-to-one counselling, and through which individuals can establish their HIV status.</P>

      <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee's recommendations, including those on education and prevention strategies, were adopted by the main Committee of which I am Chairman on 13 April 1992.  Specifically in the Education section these recommendations referred to the need for a series of radio advertisements for Irish AIDS Day on 16 May and a bigger mass media campaign to coincide with World AIDS Day on 1 December.</P>
      <P>A series of four radio advertisements were developed by the Health Promotion Unit of my Department for Irish AIDS Day and broadcast nationally at the time.</P>
      <P>Plans are currently in progress to fulfill the committment for a bigger mass media campaign to commemorate World AIDS Day on 1 December.  This campaign will serve to remind the public of the ever present threat of HIV and AIDS that currently exists and encourage the public to behave in ways which will reduce the spread of this deadly virus.</P>

      <P>However, there are serious considerations which dictate that the certificate should have its present format. The deletion of any reference to adoption could be misleading in that it would invite the inference that the adopters of a child were its natural parents.  For this reason the Review Committee on Adoption Services, which reported in 1984, concluded, with regret, that they could not recommend a change in the format of the certificate. In these circumstances I do not consider at this stage that any change in the format is warranted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy and that of the Garda authorities to maximise the amount of time which members of the Garda Síochána spend on outdoor operational duties.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have already been implemented to minimise Garda attendance at Court.  These include the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the computerised scheduling of Court cases so that cases dealt with by a particular Garda are listed together for hearing.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the vehicle rectification scheme in the Dublin Metropolitan Area which allows motorists to repair vehicle faults within a specified period as an alternative to prosecution and attendance in Court.</P>
      <P>&mdash;increased use in the Dublin Metropolitan Area of the summons as an alternative to the charge procedure.</P>
      <P> Part II of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 which provides for the admissibility in certain circumstances of documentary evidence will also release some members from attending Court.</P>
      <P>Other measures proposed which would reduce the amount of Garda time spent on administrative duties include:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the service, by recorded delivery, of summonses by post.  The new arrangements, when introduced, will release a substantial number of Gardaí for other duties, the majority of whom would be serving in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>&mdash;work is proceeding in my Department as a matter of urgency on proposals to achieve savings in Garda time through changes in procedure in criminal cases.  These measures will reduce significantly the demands made on the Gardai in relation to certain Court attendances. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> In addition to the above measures more Gardaí are being released for operational duties by the employment of civilians in the Garda Síochána.  At present there are some 650 civilian clerical staff employed in the Garda Síochána and this will rise to almost 700 by the end of this year. In this regard an additional 20 clerical civilian staff will be assigned to Garda stations in the City Centre area of Dublin in the near future, thus releasing an equivalent number of Gardaí for outdoor police duties.  The Garda authorities are carrying out a general review at present to identify additional posts which would be suitable for civilianisation.  I believe that there is scope for significantly increased civilianisation in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The policing needs of particular areas are continuously kept under review by the Garda authorities.  In addition, policing methods are reviewed on a regular basis and new strategies to combat crime are implemented when appropriate. Examples of new policing methods which were recently introduced are the Rural Policing Scheme which improves the level of policing in remote areas and the Community Policing Scheme which provides for a more visible Garda presence in urban communities.</P>
    <P>On the crime prevention front the Garda authorities plan to extend the Garda Schools Project to all schools in Dublin and to Cork and Limerick.  This project was established to help young people to develop positive attitudes towards the Gardaí and the environment. The school children are also made aware of the grave risks to young people from alcohol and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I am also anxious that the Garda have sufficient powers to combat urban crime and street violence.  Proposals for legislation to enhance Garda powers to deal with offences such as threatening or abusive behaviour in a public place, disorderly conduct etc. are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department at present.</P>
    <P>I am confident that through the measures already taken and those proposed the members of the Garda Síochána <Col N="158" /> are and will continue to be utilised to the best advantage in combatting crime throughout this State.</P>

Measurements have <Col N="167" /> been obtained by my Department on the actual signal levels emanating from the MMDS transmitter in County Galway.

      <P>I will be seeking a Supplementary Estimate to cover expenditure incurred by the boards which could not be provided for in their original non-capital allocations or has resulted from increased costs on demand led schemes.  The extent of the Supplementary Estimate cannot be finalised until further information is available on certain aspects of the expenditure.</P>
      <P>The main items coming within the scope of the Supplementary Estimate will be:</P>
      <P>&mdash;General Medical Services Scheme, mainly increased cost of drugs;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;increased costs arising on the community drug schemes and the <Col N="168" /> disabled person's maintenance allowance schemes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increases in costs of medical indemnity insurance for medical staff in health agencies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provision to cover miscellaneous costs, for example, costs of HIB vaccination and services for Bosnian refugees. </P>
    <P>Health agencies review the position on an ongoing basis to ensure that expenditure is in line with the approved budget. Where, however, expenditure is running ahead of the approved budget, boards are required to take appropriate corrective action.  The Deputy will understand that the position as indicated in relation to the first six months must be interpreted in the context of intended corrective action being implemented by boards and the effect on expenditure of the normal seasonal reduction in activity during July, August and September.  There also tends to be a reduction in activity and expenditure during December.</P>
    <P>The figures for the first six months are set out in the following table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  They reflect the net overspend at that date, after allowance has been made for the anticipated effect of the adjustments in allocations likely to arise out of the Supplementary Estimate.  The precise details of each Board's adjustment has yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with the health boards I have made it absolutely clear that they are required to maintain expenditure within the approved allocation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I have allocated a total of £1.6 million national lottery funds to the health boards specifically for distribution to voluntary agencies operating in their areas in 1992.  In addition, substantial blocks of lottery funds have been allocated by my Department to the health boards under various headings such as services for the elderly, child care services, services for the mentally handicapped, etc.  Health boards use this money to fund their own services and to assist voluntary agencies providing services on their behalf.  It is not possible to say what proportion of overall lottery funds are made available to voluntary groups.  Lottery funds allocated directly by me are mainly for the assistance of national rather than local voluntary organisations.  I have allocated no lottery funds directly to voluntary agencies in County Kildare this year, but I am sure that many such groups will benefit from the lottery funds allocated by my Department to the Eastern Health Board as described above.</P>

      <P>A proposal to establish a forestry/ grassland project at Ballinamore with EC funding is being examined.  The proposal aims to demonstrate how forest and grassland-based systems can best be integrated in farm practice.  This is intended to complement the forestry measures contained in the Operational Programme for Rural Development, such as demonstration farm forests, forestry promotion and publicity and farm forestry training, currently administered jointly by Teagasc and the Forestry Service of the Department of Energy.

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Employment and Training Levy for which the legislative basis is contained in the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981 and the Labour Services Act, 1987. <Col N="177" /> The rate of levy is one per cent of reckonable earnings, emoluments or income.</P>
      <P>Up to 1988, all of the proceeds of the levy were allocated to youth programmes. Under the Labour Services Act, 1987, the scope of the levy was extended to employment and training generally and since then has been used towards the funding of activities of FÁS, CERT and certain programmes run by the Department of Education.</P>
