    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Review Committee, CRC, who are representative of Government, trade unions, employers, industrialists and farmers, meet, as a general rule, on a monthly basis and sometimes more frequently to review and monitor progress in implementing the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress, PESP</i> and the achievement of its targets and objectives.  This process enables the social partners to have an ongoing input in the formulation of Government decision-making on all important economic and social policy issues.</P>
      <P>The most recent meeting of the committee was held on Thursday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme itself, which covers the period 1991 to 1993, provides that <Col N="1614" /> there would be a review by October this year and a draft report for this purpose is at present being finalised by the committee.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of this report, it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to anticipate or pre-empt the committee's discussions on it except to say that considerable achievements have been made under the various headings of the programme such as macro-economic policy, tax reform, social welfare, health and education.  This indicates quite clearly the value and importance of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and our consensus approach with the social partners in solving our economic and social problems.  This process with its emphasis on co-operation and partnership in the common support of agreed targets and policies has worked very well and has the full support and commitment of all the different interests involved.</P>
    <P>The major black spot is that of unemployment. At my request, the CRC are now examining new strategies and measures within the framework of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase employment and I understand that they expect to be in a position to discuss its recommendations in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The wideranging series of measures which the Government have introduced since the summer provide clear evidence of the Government's determination and commitment to tackling unemployment and, as the House will recall, I have given an undertaking to the CRC that their recommendations on new initiatives and strategies will be fully, carefully and quickly considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>The core strategic macro-economic commitments of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> such as low inflation, a stable exchange rate policy within the EMS, a moderate approach to incomes and public spending, greater social equity and the debt/GNP and EBR targets remain essential to enable us consolidate the achievements we have made since 1987 and attain the highest possible employment <Col N="1615" /> and living standards for all our people in the years ahead.  The continuing validity and importance of these policies and targets are all the more emphasised and are of even greater significance with the continuing turbulence on international exchange markets.</P>
    <P>There is no question, therefore, of departing from these fundamentals which we have been pursuing so successfully with the agreement of the social partners and with such success in creating a low-cost competitive economy since 1987. This success is partly evident in the recent labour force survey figures for April, which showed that employment in our economy had been stable over the 12 months to April, in contrast with so many economies where employment declined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach why, despite the clear commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, not one remedial teacher has been appointed this year at either primary or post-primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask that question of the Minister concerned, the Minister for Education.  What I am saying clearly is that there is no change in the targets set.  A full review has been held and a report on that review will be submitted to me for consideration.  I have given a commitment to the social partners that a full discussion will take place, not only on the aspect referred to by the Deputy but also on the wide macro-economic policy, education, health, social welfare and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I again ask the Taoiseach, in relation to a key element, the phased programme for 1992 for caretakers and secretaries for schools with more than 100 pupils, why not one caretaker or secretary has been appointed?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's long and comprehensive reply made reference to the review that is about to take place in relation to the possible necessity of revising the targets because of factors over which the Government have or have not control.

      <P>In view of the fact that the two key targets in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> were a substantial increase in employment and a major assault on unemployment, would the Taoiseach accept that his strategy is coming off the rails in that figures show no increase in employment and an increase of 74,000 in unemployment over 26 consecutive months?</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, in respect of the Joint Committee on Employment, he is prepared to change Government policy to permit Ministers to serve as members of the committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason to alter the established Government policy that Ministers would not serve as members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.  The Government have shown, by their acceptance of the key recommendations in the joint committee's first report, that Ministers are <Col N="1618" /> prepared to implement valid and agreed findings of the committee.  I would point out that Ministers participated in the discussion in this House and in the Seanad on the recommendations of the joint committee and gave their views on them. This, in my view, is the correct role of Ministers in relation to the work of the joint committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach not accept that at the eleventh hour of this administration and with a predicted unemployment figure of 350,000 by next summer, his attitude reduces the status of this committee to an empty, hollow Chamber?  Can he not accept that the boycott of his Ministers should be lifted and that they should now participate as key decision makers rather than looking in from the outside?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of the boycott of this committee by the party opposite.  I am aware it has continued for whatever reason but that is their decision and we all accept it.  I have not seen or heard of any input to the committee &mdash; although this is a House committee &mdash; from the party opposite in relation to any ways and means of creating a single job. This committee was set up in response to continuous questioning in this House of my predecessor.  I set up that committee very shortly after I took over.  They have been working very effectively.  They have brought forward recommendations. Those recommendations were responded to immediately.  In fact, some of the responses have been in excess of the recommendations of this committee.  I gave my commitment that those recommendations and reports would be addressed in this House immediately; that has happened and they have been addressed in the Seanad by the Minister. That is the appropriate way in which to continue.  At this late stage &mdash; at the eleventh hour, as Deputy Higgins puts it &mdash; perhaps he would consider joining the committee and make a useful contribution to solving the biggest unsolved problem of the Irish economy and the <Col N="1619" /> biggest unsolved problem of all the European economies too.</P>

      <P>In the course of my speech at the Annual Fianna F·il Wolfe Tone Commemoration at Bodenstown on 18 October 1992, I said the following:</P>
      <P>I would like to give an undertaking that any agreement that is reached between the two Governments and the political parties in the North of Ireland could be put in a referendum to the people both North and South at the same time.  In that way all the people of this island would be given the opportunity to pronounce simultaneously, for the first time since 1918, on the form that future relationships might take on this island.  Such a mandate would provide a conclusive endorsement of the peaceful democratic approach so earnestly desired and supported by the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>

    <P>In relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, I clearly stated the Government's <Col N="1622" /> position in reply to Parliamentary Questions on 7 October 1992.  Any question of a referendum affecting the Articles would arise only in the context of a comprehensive agreement which achieved, in particular, a satisfactory balance between the positions of the Irish and British Governments and of the Nationalist and Unionist traditions in Ireland on the central constitutional issue.</P>
    <P>But if such an agreement were reached and if constitutional sanction were conferred on it by a positive vote of the people in a referendum it is quite possible that the position in regard to the matters dealt with in Articles 2 and 3 could be affected by the agreement reached and any related constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>I also said in the course of my Bodenstown speech that:</P>
    <P>a balance must be restored between the recognition of existing constitutional realities and the acknowledgement of the value of a future that we believe would be best for all the people of Ireland.  That future is desired by some, and recognised by many more as likely to happen eventually. Taking a positive view of Irish unity and encouraging it as a long term solution is in no way incompatible with accepting the necessary principle of agreement and consent and does not conflict with any obligation that either Government have undertaken.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the agreement by all of the parties to the talks process that the discussions should be treated confidentially, I do not propose to comment on media reports regarding matters discussed.</P>

      <P>While I can understand the Taoiseach's reticence to comment on matters discussed perhaps he would elaborate on the undertaking that there may be a Referendum in both parts of this island?  Can the Taoiseach inform the House if he is confident that the talks which are taking place will be concluded <Col N="1623" /> successfully and can he give an outline as to when they might be concluded?</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to speculate or to try to forecast when the talks which are continuing will be finalised. All I can say, without any breach of confidentiality, is that they are making progress.  There are very complex issues involved.  There is a question of balance between the identification and recognition of the two traditions.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that those are complex items and will take time to tease out and much goodwill will be required on both sides at the negotiating table.  I am not putting a deadline on them.  I do not want to rush them.  I want to give them every opportunity because I think a real opportunity does exist and, personally, I feel there has been some shift in the political landscape in the North of Ireland.  I hope the talks can continue and reflect that charge and that we can go on to build structures that will evolve for the betterment of all the people of this island on both sides of the political divide.</P>

      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's comment that there is a need for institutional structures and powers with regard to the relations between North and South, have the Government made any formal submissions to the talks in relation to such institutions and powers? Has he any comment to make on the rather aggressive statement by Mr. Seamus Mallon at the weekend that there would be a necessity for the Irish Government to have executive powers in Northern Ireland?  What is his view in relation to the question of structures and powers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should say to Deputy De Rossa I do not propose to comment on anything that Mr. Seamus Mallon or anybody else has said.  I have also said there is a confidentiality aspect to those talks.  The Deputy can take it that we have submitted papers on various aspects of how things might evolve in future.  I will not break the confidentiality of the talks from one side or the other. <Col N="1624" /> The Anglo-Irish Agreement is in place and will continue in place until such time as there is a better agreement which will advance the situation or build on the present agreement.  That agreement provides that we have consultation on matters which need to be raised from time to time between the Irish and British Governments.  The next conference meeting will be held on 16 November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said his perception was that there has been a shift in the political landscape of Northern Ireland.  Will he elaborate on what he means by that?  Does he accept that a political shift in the landscape of Northern Ireland also necessitates a shift in the political landscape in the South and, in particular, by the Fianna F·il Party, if there is to be peace and reconciliation on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to my perceived view that there is a shift in the political landscape of Northern Ireland, I believe ordinary people on both side of the community there are sick, tired and fed up of the violence they have had to endure over the past 23 years.  There is a yearning to find a new way out of the problems and to find the path to peace. I have often used that phrase in this House &mdash; I used it on my first day as Taoiseach &mdash; and I am fully committed to doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many people in Northern Ireland; I have many friends there.  I listen to what the people on both sides have to say.  As recently as last Saturday at the international rugby match at Landsdowne Road I listened to the views expressed to me.  People of all shades of opinion are yearning for a solution to this problem.  They want these talks to continue until such time as there is some movement forward.  None of us expect miracles, but we want to see movement forward which can lead to something else.  That is the way I view this matter. There is a willingness by people on both sides of the Border to come together in a spirit of economic and cultural co-operation and to look at projects which <Col N="1625" /> will benefit both sides.  Some projects have already been put in place and, hopefully, more will be put in place.  That is the backdrop to the current talks.  I believe a genuine feeling of good-will exists.  The Government negotiators, who are acting on behalf of the Irish Government and people, are as open minded and constructive as anyone could expect them to be.  We all know exactly where we are coming from and where we are trying to get to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said earlier that the Government could envisage putting a settlement to the people here in a referendum.  Would he go so far as to say that he would be prepared, if there is an acceptable settlement, to recommend such changes in our Constitution to our people as might be necessary to give effect to such an acceptable settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not yet arrived at a stage in the negotiations where an evaluation or assessment could be made which would enable me to answer that question directly.  As I clearly said in my statement, we and most of the other people are going along in good faith and we will continue to do so, but it would be foolhardy to express a view at this stage as to whether the type of agreement we would all wish to see will result from the talks.  It would be better to let the talks continue in their present manner.  I have given my views as have the political leaders in the North of Ireland.  We all recognise that there are constitutional issues on both sides which need to be approached in an evenhanded manner.  That is and will continue to be my position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the achievement of traditional unity as commonly understood by Nationalists is not an achieveable objective in these talks and that what should be sought is a peaceful co-existence and the structures to enable that peaceful co-existence to take place?  In that regard, will he indicate whether he has made <Col N="1626" /> submissions on the structures and powers on which such a peaceful co-existence could be based?  We know that the other parties to the talks have made such submissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am trying to ascertain whether the Irish Government have made any such submissions. Will the Taoiseach explain how a referendum could be held, particularly if constitutional matters are not at issue? What procedure does he foresee to enable a referendum to take place?  As I understand it, there is no such procedure except in relation to Bills which come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it abundantly clear that at various stages throughout these talks the Government produced papers, depending on the subject on the table at any given time.  The Deputy can take it that we have done this.  I respect the confidentiality of these talks.  Some people chose from time to time to comment on the talks but I do not think comments made in public contribute to the efforts to try to arrive at a position where the balance of identity to which I referred can be achieved.  We want to build up mutual trust and reconciliation between the people and to demonstrate our willingness to come together and develop structures which we believe can be evolved for the betterment of all the people up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House knows, the Single Market will come into effect on 1 January 1993.  The economic borders will be gone but we will still be talking about an invisible political border which still exists in people's minds.  That is the issue we have to address.  Ireland will be the only place in the Community which will have a border.  However, I do not think any of us should be emotional about this issue. We are trying to find a new way forward not only for people on both sides of the political divide in the North of Ireland but which will ensure that we can live as <Col N="1627" /> good neighbours not alone North and South but with the people on these islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of his reply to my last question, would the Taoiseach agree that the whole basis upon which these talks are taking place is that nothing is agreed in any strand until everything is agreed and that, therefore, our Government would have nothing to lose, and might well contribute to the acceleration of the process towards agreement, by indicating that they would be prepared to make such changes to our Constitution as they might agree in the event of an acceptable settlement being achieved without the loss of any commitment because of the basic provision that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question and I have nothing further to add except to say that we will continue to participate in these talks with good faith and good will.  It is well recognised by the people around the table that we have done this up to now.  Any suggestion that we look at our part of the problem without looking at the two parts together would be counter-productive and would not achieve the result all of us wish to achieve.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that after the Single Market the political borders in Europe will still remain, that various Governments will still be in power and the borders will continue to exist between all member states?  May I put it to him that it is clear from what he said today that the Government have not made any submissions on the structures and powers and the relationships between the North and South and within Northern Ireland? Will he agree that until such time as the Government do this it is likely that the talks will not make any further progress?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

If that is so and if it involves constitutional change, is it not obvious that the proposal must be put to the people?  I cannot understand the reluctance of the Taoiseach to accept that this is so.</P>

Would the Taoiseach agree that if the talks do not succeed in making progress in this round, responsibility will be firmly placed on our Government for their failure?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of Temple Bar as a cultural, residential and small business quarter is being undertaken on behalf of the Government by Temple Bar Properties <Col N="1630" /> Limited, the development implementation company, and Temple Bar Renewal Limited, the company that decides on the projects that qualify for financial incentives.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties are now implementing a £100 million redevelopment programme.  This £100 million of construction expenditure will create 5,000 much needed and welcome additional jobs in construction work over the next five years.  In the completed cultural quarter some 2,000 people will be employed in a wide variety of cultural and related jobs.</P>
    <P>The Irish Film Centre is the first major public project to be opened in the area. The widespread approval for it augurs well for the necessary sensitive development approach.</P>
    <P>The private sector is also playing a strong part in the area and a number of important music venues, hotel and residential projects are now open or in construction.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited are implementing the development programme in a series of functional areas including cultural, tourism, marketing, property and redeveloped environment. I have a detailed statement under these headings and I am arranging for it to be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Limited have initiated a wide system of communication with the local community which are detailed in the statement I am circulating. In addition they have ongoing constructive contact with the Dublin City Centre Business Association in relation to development in Temple Bar.  Temple Bar Renewal Limited have arranged consultation procedures and Temple Bar Development Council are represented on the company.  I understand any concerns which may have existed are being resolved amicably and constructively.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Renewal Limited are carrying out their remit effectively in approving projects for the relevant financial incentives.  Statements of projects approved are laid before the Oireachtas at the end of each quarter.  I am arranging <Col N="1631" /> for the statements to 31 October 1992 to be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Both Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited are implementing the development programme in accordance with the provisions of the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, which set down the activities eligible and not eligible for financial incentives.</P>
    <P>I believe the development of Temple Bar represents an important and highly successful project, providing much needed jobs, based on partnership between local community, local government and central Government.  It is successful, despite a difficult property market.  It shows the value of a comprehensive approach to development integrating as it does the architectural, property, marketing and financial dimensions. It is an approach which I believe can be replicated in other areas.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to those responsible for the project, in particular to the boards and staff of Temple Bar Properties Limited and Temple Bar Renewal Limited, to the staff of Dublin Corporation planning department, the planning authority for the various projects in the area and to the European Commission and European Investment Bank that have been strongly supportive of the project.</P>
    <P>The following is the statment:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Temple Bar Properties Ltd.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The development is proceeding as follows: Twenty-two applications were submitted for planning permission in July 1992.  A further series of applications will be submitted by the year end.  The remaining schemes will be submitted for planning approval in June 1993.  These applications represent the refurbishment/building of properties for cultural, residential and small business use.</P>
    <P>The present position is as follows:</P>
    <P> (a)  <i>Cultural tourism</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;Ten cultural tourism schemes have been submitted for European <Col N="1632" /> Regional Development Fund funding and have received a very positive reaction.  Seven of the schemes were presented for planning permission at the end of July 1992, the other three schemes are at the stage of finalising the location and brief with the relevant owners and architects;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A full strategic and financial development plan is prepared for each project to ensure viability.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Independent Cultural Entrepreneurs in Temple Bar will be launched this week.  </P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Financial</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;The company's management accounts for audit are now with the Comptroller and Auditor General;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Detailed cash-flow projections have been undertaken to the year 1999, on a property or project by project basis.  </P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Property</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;In addition to the CIE portfolio of property, Temple Bar Properties has also purchased key properties necessitated by the Architectural Framework Plan;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The first tranche of Dublin Corporation property is being conveyed at present.  The second, west of Parliament Street, is in negotiation at present;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A comprehensive exercise has been undertaken involving the detailing of all possible housing to be created in Temple Bar Properties Ltd. properties.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The property programme of activity is designed so that much of the development work takes place between 1992 and 1994.  Three schemes are at present on site, 22 planning applications were submitted by 31 July, further schemes will be submitted before end-year and the remaining schemes by June 1993.   </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> (d)  <i>Marketing</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;The marketing of the area within the community;</P>
    <P>&mdash;TBP publish an information sheet/poster about the area every two months;</P>
    <P>&mdash;A Guidebook to Temple Bar has been published.  A history of Temple Bar will be published this month.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The company continues to initiate a series of events in the area.  </P>
    <P>(e)  <i>Built Environment</i></P>
    <P>Phase I of the EC Pilot Project is almost complete:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Streets Phase I of the Street Improvement is complete;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Irish Film Centre, The IFC, opened on 25 September 1992;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Marketing and Research Complete. Reports on Music, Film, Sculpture and Children's Centres available.</P>
    <P>&mdash;East West links and squares now in for planning permission.  </P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties Ltd. have initiated the following means of communications with the local community:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Temple Bar Information Centre at East Essex Street is an information source for the plans for the area, and is a base for the Temple Bar Development Council who deal with local problems and issues.  The Temple Bar Development Council is the local community group representing people in the area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a liasion officer is based at the information centre to deal with queries or complaints about the development;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a forum involving Temple Bar Properties and the Temple Bar Development Council meets every two weeks to discuss practical issues, such as cleansing, security, traffic etc., that arise from the development.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a monthly meeting is held directly <Col N="1634" /> with the council also to update on the development and discuss issues as they arise.  The Temple Bar Development Council also has four seats on the Board of Temple Bar Renewal Ltd.  </P>

People know that provision is being made for residential units and that many students are to live there.  It is a well balanced project and I have not heard the criticism voiced by Deputy Garland.  We will certainly have a look at it.  People will be living in the area.  That is important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach: (Mr. N. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach: (Mr. N. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach: (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 13 and Written Question No. 60 together.</P>
      <P>The Government are confident that our initiative in establishing new county and area enterprise partnership boards will have a strong positive impact on the development of small and start up businesses and on the development of tourism.  The Government further believe that the partnership boards will provide an important new local, rather than centralised, basis and focus for decision making in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specifically in relation to small and start-up businesses the Government have decided, as set down in the Government statement of 1 October, that the new county enterprise partnership boards will as part of their promotion and assisting <Col N="1636" /> of integrated local socio-economic development, provide financial assistance and information services for new and existing small and start-up enterprises, defined as those having existing employment, or potential employment, of up to and including 12 people.</P>
    <P>The transfer of the functions involved is from the centralised industrial agencies to the new local partnership boards. Guidelines are now being prepared for the basis of selection by the new boards of individual projects.  These guidelines will be agreed by an interdepartmental steering group, which will include among its membership representation from the Department of Industry and Commerce. This will ensure that the implementation of the county and area action plans prepared by each partnership board will accord with national policies in relation to industrial development and other areas of activity.  Decisions on the actual selection of projects and the support which they will be given will be solely for the partnership boards.</P>
    <P>Specifically in relation to tourism, the new county tourism structures will include the following:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a member of the regional tourism organisation will be appointed to each of the boards;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a specialist tourism committee will be established in each partnership board. The industry members of the existing RTOs will <i>ex officio</i> become members of this committee.  Through its chairman and a new county/city tourism manager, the committee will report directly to the partnership board and its chief executive;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a county tourism advisory council will be established, representative of the local tourism industry, all the local authorities, and, where appropriate, the State sectors in tourism. </P>
    <P>As part of the overall county action plan to be prepared by each partnership board, the new county tourism manager will prepare a tourism development plan, an integrated plan for the development of tourism in each county.  He or she will <Col N="1637" /> consult with all relevant local tourism interests and with all relevant State and semi-State agencies, in regard to the county tourism plan.  This plan, when sanctioned by the county enterprise partnership board, will form a constituent part of an overall national tourism strategy.  The county tourism plan will have the full support of the new board and access to the relevant funding at county and other levels as appropriate. Funding obtained from the industry for tourism will be allocated only for tourism and enterprises will, however, have access to the wider enterprise funds in the new arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State see any problem at all with the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is to be accountable to this House for the expenditure of taxpayers' money on national industrial development, whereas the Department of the Taoiseach is to be responsible to this House for local industrial development? Does the Minister of State see any possible difficulty in assuring coherence in the policy-making between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a matter where responsibility is so unnecessarily divided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not visualise any difficulties whatever.  The new county enterprise partnership boards will have representatives of the State and semi-State agencies, the IDA, SFADCo, ⁄dar·s na Gaeltachta and other bodies who have responsibility to the Department of Industry and Commerce and to the Department of the Gaeltacht for job creation in specific areas.  The Government have taken a decision, for the first time in the history of this country, to put an emphasis on job creation for small industry and the demarcation is that all projects up to and including 12 jobs will be dealt with by the county enterprise partnership boards.  National policies will be adhered to so this is a common effort to ensure that we can do something for the unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State not aware that the budget of SFADCo and the IDA who will be represented on this body is provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and yet the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not to be represented in any way on these boards?  Does the Minister of State not see a problem in the accountability to this House for expenditure on industry given that it is to be divided between two Departments, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Industry and Commerce with no clear responsibility in anybody's hands for achieving results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Conversely, in response to Deputy Bruton, the Taoiseach himself will not be represented on these boards either.  However, the agencies reporting to both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Industry and Commerce and albeit to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, are represented on the boards.  There is a clear demarcation up to and including 12-job projects for the county enterprise partnership boards. There can be no difficulty whatever in that.  For the first time ever the vagueness of application and decision-making for job creation is being clarified so that when an application is made people will know where to go, what is available and who is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not appear to me that the county tourism advisory councils that the Minister now proposes are any different from the regional tourism boards presently in existence.  It is agreed that in most parts of the country they are doing a very good job.  Why the change, and how are these new structures going to be funded?  Are they going to be funded directly from Bord F·ilte or from the Department of Communications?  Does the same argument that Deputy Bruton made in regard to the Department of Industry and Commerce also apply to the Department of Transport, Communications and Tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1639" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many similarities between the new county tourism advisory councils and the regional tourism organisations.  Obviously the industry will be represented in the new structure as heretofore.  However, in the regional tourism organisations there is no opportunity for all local authorities to be represented. That is now being changed. Every local authority within each county, whether it is a corporation, a council, an urban council or a town commission will have direct representation on the county tourism advisory council.  The emphasis is being put on integrated, co-ordinated tourism promotion within each county and the big difference now is that we are going to involve at county level the State and semi-State agencies.  Heretofore many of these were not involved.  Now all people involved in tourism will be working together to achieve the desired result of maximum opportunity for tourism development and job creation through the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The funds available heretofore for tourism will be available under the new system and will be transferred from the existing votes of various Departments into the new structure.  In addition the Government are making £50 million of public funds available which were not available heretofore.  The regional tourism organisations have admitted in consultation that their eye was off the ball because they had not sufficient funds available to them.  The funds will now be available to them for tourism development that heretofore were not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a reply that has not increased my store of knowledge one whit.  If there is no difference between the new councils and the regional tourism boards, why not leave them as they were and allow them to co-opt members from whatever local authorities were not represented on them?  It appears from the last part of the Minister's reply that the Department of Tourism will no longer exist.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot <Col N="1640" /> interpret my response in that way.  The Department of Tourism are doing a very good job.  The RTOs were hamstrung for funds.  The Government looked at the performance of the RTOs in the regions and the performance of the county development teams within each county. They regard these two agencies as having done an excellent job with little or no resources.  As part of the Government's commitment to job creation to local level, they have amalgamated these two excellent organisations in a new county partnership structure to ensure that there will be effective job creation for small industry at local county level.</P>

      <P>I want to proceed now to other questions.  I will allow a final question from Deputy Peter Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were doing this marvellous job would the obvious solution not be to give them the funds and allow them to co-opt those who were not already represented on to their boards rather than establish this new structure which is not answerable, as far as I can see, to any individual Minister except through this Minister to the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the structure of the RTO, which was a very broad cumbersome structure, one could say that there was not an equalisation of tourism development in each area, taking the larger populated areas against the smaller rural areas, taking the very beautiful natural areas against the artificially built facilities.  We want to ensure now that the focus is on the county, that the facilities are created, supported and promoted together, that the private and State sectors and the community will have an input so that, working together in a new partnership, we can ensure maximum opportunities in tourism development and job creation within each county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it that the Department of the Taoiseach is taking responsibility for tourism when we have a Department for Tourism?  Why is the Taoiseach's Department taking responsibility <Col N="1641" /> for industrial development when we have a Department of Industry and Commerce?  Why is the Department of the Taoiseach taking responsibility for urban renewal in the Temple Bar area when we have a Department of the Environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  What is involved here is job creation, and under the new structure all projects pertaining to job creation, irrespective of the sector, will be dealt with by the county enterprise partnership boards if they are in the small firm area providing up to 12 jobs.  The Department of Tourism and Bord F·ilte will continue to promote tourism on a national scale. Our objective here is job creation.  We are co-ordinating and bringing together all the relevant agencies into one single partnership board within each county responsible to a national management company so that there can be clear demarcation, absolute co-ordination and maximum effort to provide opportunities for people who have the ideas but who may lack management experience and who need the financial support.  That is now being provided.</P>

May I also ask the Minister <Col N="1642" /> of State when he intends to appoint the chairmen of these new boards?  Will he do so within the next three weeks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 39 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the grave consequences for the Irish fishing industry and particularly for employment in the industry should reductions of the order now being contemplated by the EC Commission be implemented.  At this juncture I am in fundamental disagreement with the Commission on its proposals to further reduce the already decimated Irish fishing fleet and will continue to oppose the proposals until a satisfactory resolution of this issue is achieved.</P>
      <P>The Commission's decision on the transitional Multi Annual Guidance Programme for the Irish fishing fleet for 1992 requires an effective reduction of the order of 17 per cent in the capacity of the fleet by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>This decision is totally unacceptable to me as it fails to adequately address the current capacity needs of the Irish fleet. Against the background of our being unable to take up our allocations of fish quotas because of insufficient fleet capacity, it is absurd in my view that the Commission should be attempting to further inhibit the catching capacity of our fleet.  The Commission's proposals would inevitably lead to job losses in both the catching and processing sectors and to a sharp decline in economic activity in our coastal regions which are so dependent on fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons, the Government in <Col N="1644" /> August last initiated court proceedings in the European Court of Justice.  In our application lodged with the court, the Government have sought to have the Commission's transitional decision annulled.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals on fleet reduction in the context of the Multi Annual Guidance Programme for the period 1993 to 1996 were considered at some length in the Council of Fisheries Ministers in Luxembourg on 19 October last.  In these deliberations I made it abundantly clear that if acceptable fleet proposals for Ireland were not tabled by the Commission, the issue would have to be referred back for discussion at the next Council of Ministers meeting in November rather than be decided by the Commission.  At my insistence the Council agreed that, in the interim, no decision would be taken which was at variance with the views of any individual member state concerned and that any such cases would be referred back to the next Council on the 23rd of this month.</P>
    <P>This was an important breakthrough in procedure which effectively prevents fleet cuts being imposed by the Commission over the heads of member states. This will help towards obtaining a satisfactory resolution of Ireland's concerns.</P>
    <P>I must stress, however, that we face a very tough battle on this issue.  As part of the Commission's proposals to systematically reduce the size of the Community fleet to preserve stocks and regulate the level of fish catches in member states, a reduction of the order of 30 per cent is envisaged for the Irish fleet over the next four years.  In Ireland's case such restrictions are totally unjustified since we do not have enough capacity to catch our existing quotas especially for the more lucrative whitefish.  This represents a loss of up to £20 million annually to Irish Fishermen.</P>
    <P>At the recent Council I renewed my demands for an increase for Ireland of at least 5,000 tonnes in the capacity of the fleet.  This represents less than one quarter of one per cent of the total Community fleet.  An increase of this order to an Objective One region would be <Col N="1645" /> insignificant in overall Community terms but to Ireland would represent a real improvement on the current unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to assure Deputies that I will continue at every opportunity to press Ireland's legitimate claims until a satisfactory solution is achieved.  I will go to whatever lengths are necessary to achieve that result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply and fully endorse and support the stand that he has taken on this important issue.  Would the Minister agree that Ireland was not responsible for overfishing in EC waters and should not be penalised by way of a reduction in the size of the fleet?  Would he further agree that instead of reducing the size of the fleet we should be increasing it in order to create the maximum number of jobs?  Finally, would the Minister respond to the question I tabled which was, whether he would be prepared to use the veto on this issue at the Council of Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I accept that this is a major issue for the fishing industry. While we agree with the Commission that there is a need to conserve stocks &mdash; and we are among the best in that regard &mdash; our fishing fleet is so small that the impact is almost negligible.  While we do not disagree with the overall policy of the Commission we are not in a position to catch our quota as we do not have the ships.  In those circumstances it is ridiculous to suggest that the size of our fleet should be reduced, and we will not accept any such proposal.  I mentioned that we made a procedural breakthrough at the recent Council of Ministers meeting.  This was important because we were not in a position to influence a decision made at Commission level.  Therefore the Commission could make a decision over our heads.  It has now been accepted at both Council and Commission level that no decision will be taken over the head of any member state.  When that decision was being made I sought clarification that this would mean any single state concerned. <Col N="1646" /> Therefore the Council of Ministers will seek agreement on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 15 and Question Nos. 19, 27, 29, 45 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>I am extremely anxious that the lessons learned from all marine casualties must be applied so that a recurrence can be prevented.  Following the <i>Havelet</i> incident, I decided that consumers should be given some opportunity to express their views in the area of passenger ferry safety.  I recently secured the approval of Government for the establishment of a new Ferry Users' Forum to deal with passenger complaints about safety matters on ferries on Irish waters.  The inaugural meeting of the Forum will be held within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the <i>Celtic Pride</i> tragedy, an immediate examination of the vessel by marine surveyors of my Department, revealed the vessel's sewerage system as the cause of the accident.  Immediate <Col N="1648" /> modifications to the vessel were carried out and the vessel was later taken out of service to allow permanent technical modifications to be carried out.  These modifications involved, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision of two new permanent sewerage vent pipes, the cleaning of all sewage tanks modifications to the internal structure of the tanks and the fitting of new aeration systems to ensure a positive aerobic operation of the system.</P>
    <P>As soon as the cause of the <i>Celtic Pride</i> accident was made known to me, I directed that a number of steps be taken to prevent a recurrence.  All ferry companies operating into Ireland were requested (a) to review and report on the sewerage systems on their vessels, particularly with a view of the containment and ventilation systems for toxic gases and (b) to review the operational procedures for crews in the detection of and response to smells and gases.</P>
    <P>I called a special meeting of the National Ferry Safety Committee, on which all ferry companies operating into Irish ports are represented, to review the accident and the lessons to be learnt from it.  They informed me that they were satisfied their vessels were safe in respect of sewage and ventilation systems.  In addition to meeting the companies, I directed the deputy chief surveyor of my Department to conduct a thorough examination of the sewerage systems of all the vessels.  This examination has now been completed and no major deficiencies or problems have been found.  No trace of lethal gas could be detected on any vessel.</P>
    <P>All EC flag state authorities were alerted to the risks identified by the accident. The cause of the accident has also been reported to the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations specialised agency concerned with maritime safety.  The organisation have been asked to develop rules with regard to the construction and operation of sewerage systems on board ships.  The Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organisation will begin work on this matter next month.</P>
    <P>In February of this year I decided that <Col N="1649" /> in future a report of investigations into marine accidents would be released and made available to the public.  However, as I indicated to this House at that time, there will be a time lag between the date of an accident and the date of release of the related report, because of legal and other constraints.  This new open policy will apply to the <i>Celtic Pride</i> and <i>Havelet</i> investigations and I am anxious to release both reports at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>A report on the <i>Havelet</i> incident was recently completed by a marine surveyor of my Department.  As such reports have not been published in the past and as it is necessary for me to ensure, as far as practicable that the rights of all those concerned are upheld, the report has been referred by my Department to the Chief State Solicitor's office for his guidance.  I would like to assure the House that when this process is completed, and subject to the Chief State Solicitor's advice, a report will be made available to Deputies and the public as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>The deputy chief surveyor of my Department has completed his investigation into the <i>Celtic Pride</i> tragedy.  His report will also have to be examined from a legal perspective by the Chief State Solicitor.  When this process is completed, the final report will be made available, initially to the bereaved family and the ferry company and then to the public as soon as is practicable.  Deputies will appreciate that I am not in a position to discuss the contents of this report at present, nor am I in a position to speculate on the possibility of criminal negligence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend in the first instance on whom the claim is against.  An Irish company are involved in the case of one of the ferries, and I presume the claims would be taken against the company and the owners of the vessels.  That is a question that would be subject to local and international law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 32, 52 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>There are a number of differing views as to the cause of the sea trout collapse. Deputies will be aware from my previous replies on this issue that the report of the Sea Trout Action Group (STAG) pointed to an increase in the number of sea lice emanating from salmon farms as the major contributory factor.  By contrast, the report of the separate scientific working group, which represents a synthesis of all formed scientific views on this problem, concluded that, on the basis of the evidence to date, it has not been possible to attribute the sea trout collapse to any one of the many factors characterising the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it very clear earlier this year that work on this complex issue should go forward in a spirit of co-operation and that differing perceptions as to the cause of the problem should not stand in the way of concerted action.  It was with this objective firmly in mind that I announced my action plan on sea trout research, conservation, and management strategies for fish farms, last May.  I am glad to have this opportunity to advise the <Col N="1652" /> House of developments since I announced the action plan.</P>
    <P>The 1992 sea trout research programme has been proceeding under the direction of my chief scientific adviser and involves the Fisheries Research Centre, the Salmon Research Agency, the Central Fisheries Board, University College Galway and Trinity College Dublin.  The main areas of research include the health status of wild salmonid stocks, the life-cycle of the sea louse and sea trout physiology.  The scientific working group will convene in early December to review the outcome of this year's research programme and I have asked the chief scientific adviser to submit the group's report to me before the end of the year.  In the meantime I would say to Deputies that definitive judgments and conclusions about the 1992 sea trout season would be premature.  However, I am advised that preliminary indications are that there has been an improvement in some river systems.</P>
    <P>On the conservation front, the three by-laws which I introduced in May will continue in force until 31 December next when I will review them with an eye to the 1993 season.  I am advised that the by-laws, which provide for close seasons, sanctuary areas and a ban on retaining or selling of sea trout, are being enforced by the relevant regional fisheries boards and that they are being observed by fishermen.</P>
    <P>The implementation of new management strategies for fish farms continues to be intensively progressed by my Department with the co-operation of the salmon farming sector.  In particular, my Department's sea lice monitoring programme has been in operation since last April, following on from last year's programme. I would point out that the monitoring programme is more than just a data gathering exercise.  The objective has been to use the information generated from the regular monitoring carried out by my officials to advise fish farmers on integrated fish husbandry and lice treatment strategies.  I can confirm that this systematic approach is paying <Col N="1653" /> dividends in terms of site management and lice control.</P>
    <P>The other strands of the management strategy are also being progressed by my Department in the context of the 1993 season and forward years.  These include reviews of stocking densities and the identification of additional sites for fallowing and husbandry purposes.  All proposals for additional sites must be backed up by extensive environmental and other technical data.  Some involve the full formal process of environmental impact assessment.  There is a public consultative process inherent in all of this.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the course of action which I initiated last May is the most effective approach to his complex and multifaceted issue.  I am always ready to consider additional constructive proposals and in that regard I have noted the concerns expressed by a number of interests, including tourism interests, and will take these into account when I consider the strategies to be implemented for 1993.  I will be formulating the 1993 programme shortly, which will build on the action I have already taken this year, in light of the forthcoming report to me on the outcome of the 1992 research effort; the effectiveness of the conservation measures this season, and the results of this year's work on fish farm management strategies.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy M. Kitt &mdash; the question of the exemption from the study of Irish of children where some of their primary education was received outside Ireland; (2) Deputy Jim Higgins &mdash; the need for the Minister for Education to change the guidelines for the higher education grants scheme, 1992, in order to make allowance for interests paid on loans obtained for pollution control, farm buildings, wages, etc.; (3) Deputy Allen &mdash; the proposed downgrading of the Mallow Road Garda station in Cork and if the Minister for Justice will ensure that gardaÌ at present serving there will continue to operate from that station and will not be asked to report to Watercourse Road Garda station for duty and if he will increase Garda numbers in Cork city; (4) Deputy Cotter &mdash; the proposals, if any, to downgrade Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

Thus, an activity could be economical and efficient in its use of resources but if the objectives for which it is directed are not being met, it would be ineffective. <Col N="1806" /> For example, there could be a programme designed to eliminate disease.  In this regard, members of the Committee of Public Accounts and the nation are aware of the tens of millions of pounds that have been spent on the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis.  The EC recently decided to grant Ireland more money in one last ditch effort to eradicate, in so far as it is possible, the scourge of bovine TB.  We hope it will be as successful as it ought to be.  Effectiveness is the most complex of the three concepts I have referred to.  I have dealt effectively with the Bill in my contribution to the debate last Thursday and now.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>First I would like to thank all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate and, particularly, I would like to thank Deputy Lyons who made a very long contribution to last Thursday's debate.  I am very glad to note the welcome which the Deputies have given to the proposals and the general consensus which is evident regarding the need for this legislation.  At this stage I do not intend to go into the detail of the individual provisions of the Bill &mdash; this can be done on Committee Stage &mdash; but I wish to reply to some of the general issues which have been raised in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that the Committee Stage of this Bill could be taken by the Committee of Public Accounts acting as the Committee for the Bill.  While this suggestion may have some attractions, I am satisfied that this Bill deals with matters of fundamental interest and concern to all the Members of this House, and that the Committee Stage should, therefore, be taken by a Committee of the whole House.  If there is an agreement between the Whips I should, naturally, be glad to discuss any alternative to that proposal, but it is my opinion that this debate has shown that many Deputies who are not members of the committee have a contribution to make and that a Committee of the whole House would be the most appropriate arrangement.  Clearly, the members of <Col N="1807" /> the Committee of Public Accounts will have a very important role to play in the discussions on Committee Stage, but I do not consider that other Deputies who may wish to contribute to these discussions should be precluded from doing so by restricting the Committee Stage to the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have argued that the commercial State bodies should be subject to inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The arguments for and against the involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the commercial State body sector are set out in paragraph 3.6 of the White Paper. The Government's conclusion is that, in general, there should be no involvement by the Comptroller and Auditor General in this area.  The arguments now advanced do not convince me that this conclusion is incorrect.</P>
    <P>First, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General have indicated that, in general, he should not audit the commercial State bodies.  It would, therefore, appear inconsistent with this approach, as well as giving rise to unnecessary duplication, to have both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts involved in this area.  As indicated in paragraph 3.6 of the White Paper, these bodies are dealt with at parliamentary level by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.  It is a matter for that committee to determine their own arrangements for reviewing the bodies under their aegis.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as regards the points made about private sector auditors, I do not accept the implication that professional accountancy firms would be prepared to put their reputation at risk by carrying out less than satisfactory audits.  That statement was made several times in the House last week.  That is my view, as I said at the earlier stage, and I stand by my decision.  In practical terms, a loss of confidence in their independence by the business community would quickly put them out of business.  In addition, steps <Col N="1808" /> have been taken to improve the standard of auditing generally.  The accounting bodies set up a review group under Dr. Louden Ryan to examine the issues involved.  The recommendations in the report of this group, commonly called the Ryan report, have received wide support here from accounting bodies, the Stock Exchange and the investment community. The provisions of Part X of the Companies Act, 1990, have all now come into effect and should also help in this regard.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, if private sector auditors are felt to have been negligent in the performance of their duties, it is open to the boards of the bodies concerned to seek redress through claims for damages in the courts.  This is an approach which is open to firms in both the public and private sectors and I would be reluctant to introduce any arrangement &mdash; such as statutory oversight of the auditing function by the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; which might have the effect of eroding the ultimate responsibility of the private sector auditors of these bodies or of reducing any liability for failure to exercise that responsibility which the auditor of a commercial State body might have.</P>
    <P>The commercial harbour authorities are in a somewhat special category. These bodies are more akin to the non-elected local authority bodies than to commercial State bodies and, on balance, it was felt they should be subject to inspection.  Some of these bodies are to be set up as commercial State bodies while harbours of lesser commercial significance will be transferred to the relevant local authorities.  Dingle harbour will be designated as a fishery harbour centre and will be managed and operated by the Department of the Marine.  Where harbour authorities become commercial State bodies or are transferred to local authorities they will not then be subject to inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General, in line with the general policy in regard to these two sectors. Legislation to implement the proposals in regard to harbours is being drafted at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question <Col N="1809" /> of consultation with the Committee of Public Accounts before the nomination of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Under Article 33 of the Constitution, the Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the President on the nomination of the D·il.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended in their 1988 report that the committee should be consulted before this is done.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that there is any need to set up any arrangement of this kind, since, beyond what the Constitution specifies, it is a matter for the Government and the D·il of the day to decide how to deal with the matter of the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In practice, the Government of the day propose a name to D·il …ireann for nomination.  Since the foundation of the State there has never been any suggestion that this appointment is in any way politically motivated.  If Deputies were for any reason unhappy with the Government's nominee, they could raise their concerns in the House at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question of the determination of the Estimates for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  In their special report of May 1988, the Committee of Public Accounts recommended that they &ldquo;should have a central role in determining the Estimate for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office&rdquo;.  They also recommended that &ldquo;within the agreed Estimate the Comptroller and Auditor General should have flexibility regarding staffing and remuneration matters&rdquo;.  The underlying concern here, I suspect, relates to the staffing and other resources of the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, that they will be sufficient for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out his functions.  The Government have set out in the White Paper their position on these matters and the constitutional considerations involved.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that the Government accept that these proposals have obvious implications for the level of resources required by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and that I will <Col N="1810" /> review these requirements in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General as the legislation is brought into effect.  I have also indicated that the question of flexibility in the allocation by the Comptroller and Auditor General of his resources will be explored with the Comptroller and Auditor General, having regard to the arrangements for delegated administrative budgets in Departments.  I cannot, however, agree to any arrangement, formal or informal, which would have the effect of alienating from the Government their constitutional right and duty to prepare the Estimates each year and submit them to the D·il for consideration.  Clearly, there will be opportunities for Deputies to raise any concerns they may feel about the resources of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the D·il, or for the committee to raise any such concerns in their reports.  I consider that these opportunities should meet the requirements of the committee and of this House generally.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I seek your advice on a point of order.  The House is debating the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Bill, 1992.  You will recall, as I do, that this issue was raised on numerous occasions by the Opposition, by Deputy Gay Mitchell in particular. The Government have now facilitated the House by making time available for this debate.  By being absent from the Chamber, Opposition Members are showing scant regard for the people of this country and for the House.  They are demonstrating total disrespect for the people whom we represent and for the House.  The Opposition have been asking what the Government propose to do. Surely it is time that some Opposition Members appeared in the House, particularly Deputy Mitchell.  It shows complete disrespect for the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question of the inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General of bodies which receive more than 50 per cent of their funds indirectly out of public moneys, for example, bodies receiving grants from State agencies.  The Government's position is set out in paragraph 3.11 of the White Paper.  I feel it would be a mistake, in view of the very great extension of the range and scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General to extend the inspection provision to cover, for example, bodies receiving grants from the IDA or Bord F·ilte.  I would point out that under the present proposals the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to examine the systems which grant-awarding bodies have in place to ensure that the expenditure of grants is properly supervised by them and that the grant schemes are effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1812" /> Deputy Mitchell also asked that official Comptroller and Auditor General queries should be answered within a month. I should say that standing instructions within my own Department stipulate that time limit but I am also aware that it is not always possible to meet the deadline. However, this is one of the matters that I intend should be followed up on an administrative basis by my Department when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of a specified time limit for responses by me to reports of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think that this again is one of the matters which we will look into when this Bill becomes law.  I agree that if the response is to be meaningful and relevant, it should be given as promptly as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question as to why committees of this House should not be empowered to carry out investigations on the lines of judicial tribunals of investigation.  The high cost of such tribunals was cited by a number of Deputies.  These are areas which are outside the scope of the Bill before the House, and they relate also to committees other than the Committee of Public Accounts.  As indicated in the White Paper, the related complex questions of privilege and compellability of witnesses before Oireachtas committees are being examined by my Department at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring pointed out that the regional tourism organisations, which the Government have decided to abolish, are included in section 8 of the Bill, while the new county enterprise boards are not mentioned.  The fact is that Committee Stage amendments may need to be made to take account of developments since the text of the Bill was approved some time ago by the Government.  The regional tourism organisations must, however, remain in the Bill as long as they still exist.  While all the details of the new county enterprise boards have not yet been finalised, I understand that it is envisaged that these bodies will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In that case they can be added <Col N="1813" /> to the First Schedule by Order if the Bill is enacted before that issue is finalised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring expressed concern at the arrangement provided for in section 13 whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General will appoint an outside auditor to audit his own Office; he considered that the auditor should be independently appointed.  That approach was seriously considered in the drafting of the Bill. However, it became apparent that in view of the constitutional responsibility of the Comptroller and Auditor General to &ldquo;audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, the arrangement proposed in the Bill was the most appropriate in the circumstances.  The Committee of Public Accounts will, of course, be able to question the Accounting Officer of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office, the Secretary of the Office, on matters arising from the audit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell raised the question of the functions of the former Committee on Public Expenditure being assigned to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I would make the point that the central role of the Committee of Public Accounts will continue to be the examination of the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General; as an extension of this and to make the examination more effective, value for money examinations and inspections by the Comptroller and Auditor General will now come within the remit of the committee.  I consider it fundamental that the role of the committee should not extend beyond the areas covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The relationship between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General goes back to the establishment of that Office in the 1866 Act.  Too great a dissipation of the energies of the committee would only render it less effective.</P>
    <P>Deputies may not be fully aware of the magnitude of the broadening of the range and scope of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office and, in consequence, of the Committee of Public Accounts from a base of some 45 Appropriation <Col N="1814" /> Accounts, together with the accounts attached to them, some 35 other departmental accounts and some 40 non-commercial State bodies already statutorily audited by him.  He will in addition be taking on the audit of some 110 bodies, including new audits of non-commercial State bodies not up to now audited by him, third level education bodies, health boards, regional technical colleges and vocational education committees.  In regard to the extended range of bodies which will now be audited by him as well as in the case of existing bodies, he will have the discretionary power of examination for value for money and he will have new powers of inspection of bodies which receive 50 per cent or more of their gross income directly from Departments or from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Clearly this will place very considerable new demands on both the Comptroller and Auditor General and on the Committee of Public Accounts and I do not consider that any further widening of the remit of the committee would be prudent at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to concerns among staff of the Local Government Audit Service regarding the implications of this Bill.  In my introductory speech I referred to these concerns and I wish to reiterate my assurances that the staff of that service will not be left high and dry following the transfer of the audits of certain bodies to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Bill provides for the transfer of staff from the Local Government Audit Service to his Office when the audits are transferred.  In addition, existing liaison arrangements between the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service will be strengthened and formalised to ensure effective co-operation. As I said at the beginning of this debate, my Department will be available for consultation with the unions concerned regarding any matters arising from the Bill which are of concern to their members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring referred to the problem of overruns in public expenditure in the context of project audits carried out by <Col N="1815" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I believe that the extra powers conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General and the new terms of reference for the Committee of Public Accounts will allow the question of management of public funds, including project management, to be the subject of closer scrutiny, and for those accountable to be examined by the committee.  I would not underestimate the power of the committee in that they are in a position to question witnesses, as Deputy Mitchell put it &ldquo;in the full glare of publicity&rdquo;.  My experience is that this form of public accountability is very effective in helping to ensure that when mistakes are made, they will not recur.  I would point out also that, over the years, the committee have contributed through their reports, to the building up of standard practice and procedure in regard to public expenditure.  Many of the matters dealt with in my Department's circulars over the years were first raised by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I regard the complementary work of the Comptroller and Auditor General Committee of Public Accounts as being a very effective one and I believe that this Bill will give them a wider effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Spring's and Deputy De Rossa's comments about the non-political and serious-minded manner in which the Committee of Public Accounts operate.  This is clearly essential to the effectiveness of the committee's work and indeed to their proper relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is certainly a tribute to the Deputies involved on the committee who are acting in the public interest and need therefore to be able to deal with matters coming before them in an impartial and objective manner.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Mitchell has acknowledged, the Government have in this Bill met most of the recommendations of the 1988 report.  Where these have not been met, the reasons are set out in the White Paper and I have referred to the arguments again this afternoon.  A number of the recommendations which relate to the terms of reference and procedure of the <Col N="1816" /> Committee of Public Accounts are matters which can be addressed administratively, are not really the province of the Bill and they will no doubt be addressed in the appropriate forum in due course.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised points of a general nature relating to the operation of Oireachtas committees, the debating of the reports of such committees, and indeed the need for D·il reform.  I do not propose to address these issues as they are outside the scope of the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on Second Stage and, particularly, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who did so much work in the preparation of the 1988 report.  I thank him for his welcoming comments on the legislation and for the detailed observations he put on the record.  I look forward to putting this Bill through Committee Stage over the next few weeks and to concluding the debate on it as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the European Communities Acts, 1972 to 1986, in order to allow Ireland to become a member of the European Union.  The Bill is necessary because certain provisions of the Treaty on European Union must be made part of the domestic law of the State.  It is necessary also to enable the State to complete procedures for Ireland's ratification of the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Treaty on European Union was approved by a large majority of the Irish electorate in a referendum held on 18 June 1992.  The President subsequently signed the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Act on 16 July.  It now remains to pass this Bill through the Oireachtas.  Ireland will then be in a position to lodge the instruments of accession with the Italian Government before 31 December 1992.</P>
      <P>Under Article R of the Treaty on European Union, the High Contracting Parties undertook to ratify the Treaty in accordance with their constitutional requirements with a view to the Treaty coming into force in 1 January 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under provisions of the Treaty, the Treaty on European Union must be made part of the domestic law of the State.  The provisions of the Treaty which must be made part of domestic law are those which affect the European Community Treaties.  As Deputies can see section 1 of the Bill makes provision for Titles II, III, IV and the relevant parts of Title VII to be made part of the <Col N="1818" /> domestic law of the State.  Title II contains provisions amending the Treaty which established the EEC.  Title III contains provisions amending the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.  Title IV contains provisions amending the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.</P>
    <P>Title VII of the Maastricht Treaty contains the final provisions of the Treaty on European Union.  As Deputies can see, certain articles of this Title are provided for specifically and certain other are not. I will give an example.  Article L of the Treaty on European Union concerns the role of the Court of Justice and is provided for in the Bill.  Article L limits the powers of the Court of Justice to the existing treaties and to three articles of the Treaty on European Union: Articles K.3 (2) (c), L and S.  It is appropriate, therefore, that this article becomes part of the domestic law of the State. However, where the Articles provide for action under the Union but not under the treaties, a reference in the European Communities Act is not required.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that the competences under the European Community Treaties of certain bodies, which will not be institutions of the European Communities but will have some legislative power conferred on them, can be exercised and have effect in domestic law.  The bodies in question are the European Central Bank and the European Monetary Institute.  No other bodies referred to in the Treaty are covered by section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this legislation to cover Title V or Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.  Title V concerns provisions on a common foreign and security policy where no requirement for domestic legislation is envisaged.  Title VI concerns provisions on co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs. Legislation may be required at some stage in the future to cover some of the articles in this Title.  However, no legislation is required, nor would it be appropriate, at this stage to cover the provisions of this Title.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" /> To date, Luxembourg, Greece and Italy have completed their ratification procedures.  The process of ratification of the Treaty is under way in the other member states.  The Birmingham European Council reviewed progress on ratification of the Treaty on European Union and reaffirmed the importance of concluding the process as soon as possible, without reopening the present text, on the timing foreseen in Article R of the Treaty.  Ireland has committed itself to complete its ratification procedures by 1 January 1993 as envisaged in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In a referendum in Denmark on 2 June, the Danish people voted against the Treaty by a narrow margin.  On Friday last, the Danish Government presented to partners its proposals for arrangements which would enable it to put the question of ratification to the Danish people.  We are considering these proposals at present.  The Danish Foreign Minister, Mr. Uffe Elleman Jensen, will be in Dublin later this month to discuss the proposals with me.  While at this stage I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, we will consider the Danish proposals in the light of the following concerns; first, our interest in seeing Maastricht ratified and in operation at the earliest possible date; second, our willingness to help Denmark, so long as the steps taken uphold Community achievements and do not impede the dynamics of integration; and, third, no reopening of the text of the Treaty as agreed by all Heads of Government at Birmingham.  We clearly would not want an outcome that would call into question the positive referendum vote here in June.  It is in everyone's interest to find a solution to the problems posed by the Danish vote and I hope that we would make a full and helpful contribution in the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the light of the debate on the Maastricht Treaty which is taking place in all countries of the Community at present, it is worthwhile recalling the origins of the Treaty.  First it is a logical progression from the previous treaties bringing us on to a new stage in the process of European <Col N="1820" /> Union.  These treaties have greatly strengthened Europe economically and politically and created a Community with real influence in the world.  Second it grew out of a view &mdash; expressed most notably by President Delors &mdash; that there was a real need for closer economic and monetary cohesion to protect and consolidate the achievements of the Community. Recent events have borne this out.  Third it was clearly recognised, particularly during the Irish Presidency in 1990, that closer political integration was required.  Events in Eastern Europe have served to justify this view.  Fourth progress on political union has to be accompanied by progress in areas such as cohesion and on the introduction of new policies appropriate to a more advanced phase of European integration.</P>
    <P>Against this background, as well as considering the text of the Bill, this debate offers an opportunity to review recent developments in the Community. The conclusions of the Birmingham European Council on 16 October 1992 set out the immediate agenda in the period up to Edinburgh in December.  I would like to examine some of the issues on that agenda.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union forms one of the major elements of the Maastricht Treaty.  Indeed, an intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union was suggested before that on political union.  Economic and Monetary Union represents a logical step in the development of the Community. The importance of stability of exchange rates for the smooth functioning of a common market became very clear during the period of currency instability in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The recent turbulence on the currency markets shows once again how currency instability can upset the smooth functioning of the common market.  We need look no further than the problems caused for some of our own exporters to see an example of the problems caused by currency fluctuations.  The recent turbulence confirms rather than puts in doubt the wisdom of aiming at full economic and monetary union as envisaged <Col N="1821" /> in the Maastricht Treaty.  A small open economy like Ireland is in a better position than most to understand the costs and the barriers created for all by the different currencies.</P>
    <P>In the wake of the recent disturbances on currency markets there was much speculation that some countries in Europe wanted to aim at monetary union on their own, in a fast-track approach involving Germany and other countries. This has been firmly denied by the countries concerned, including Germany, as the Birmingham European Council conclusions clearly show.</P>
    <P>The existing European monetary system has brought considerable stability and benefits.  The European Council at Birmingham described the EMS as &ldquo;a key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe&rdquo;.  Ireland has been in the exchange rate mechanism, the ERM, since it was established in 1979.  We have become a strong and sound member of the ERM.  This has been greatly to our benefit.  It is a measure of the progress we have made in recent years that our currency has maintained a strong position in the ERM in spite of the fall in the value of sterling and Ireland intends to be in the first group to move to full monetary union.</P>
    <P>Of course, economic and monetary union is not about currency stability alone.  President Delors has recently referred to the need for action by the member states to prevent the deepening recession.  In his speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg he called on the Edinburgh European Council to launch a European growth initiative.  I would agree strongly with President Delors on this issue.  Low growth and consequent unemployment is the most serious challenge facing all of the Governments of the Community at present.  By acting together we can more effectively tackle the problem of jobs and the Government will continue to pursue this issue actively in forthcoming Community discussions.</P>
    <P>Developments since the Maastricht Treaty was signed have made clear the need for a much greater effort by the <Col N="1822" /> Community to inform its citizens of its work, its decisions and its intentions. the single clear lesson Governments and the Commission have learned is that there has been a failure adequately to explain to the citizens what the Community is about and in particular what are the objectives, terms and implications of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are better informed than most of our partners.  Irish people have consistently demonstrated that they have a greater grasp of and appreciation for what the Community is about.  Notwithstanding this, the Government went to considerable trouble to inform the Irish people on the content of the Treaty and its implications with the publication of the White Paper and the Government's Short Guide to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Since the referendum the Government have been examining ways and means of improving public information on EC affairs.  The Government are anxious that the good work carried out in the referendum campaign needs to be carried forward.  We are anxious to see more effective communication with our citizens on European Community affairs.</P>
    <P>As the Birmingham Conclusions state, we need to demonstrate to our citizens the benefits of the Community and of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Treaty when ratified will serve to consolidate and move forward one of the most successful vehicles for inter-State co-operation the world has known.  Leaving aside the fundamental benefits of peace and prosperity, I would like to take this opportunity to list briefly a number of areas where I feel more needs to be done at Community level in particular to bring the message to our citizens: the Common Agricultural policy with its guarantee of food supplies and decent incomes for farmers; a customs union and internal market of 340 million people.  As I have mentioned, recent events in the Exchange Rate Mechanism prove that the logical consequence of and progression from an internal market is the achievement of a single currency &mdash; the fruit of economic and monetary union; a strong, coherent voice in world trade.  In <Col N="1823" /> the current GATT talks, the Community speaks with a strong voice and in fact represents the greatest single trading area in the world; a strong cohesion dimension expressed through the three existing Structural Funds &mdash; the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the FEOGA Guidance Fund.  The Government White Paper has details of the impact of these funds on the Irish economy and on the future of Irish life.  But cohesion benefits all areas of the Community and this needs to be made clear; an environmental policy which has seen agreement on high environmental standards in the Community; a research and technological development policy which will enable Community enterprises to compete with the US and Japan and create jobs in the process; a development co-operation policy which has seen the systematic support for the development of the ACP &mdash; African, Caribbean and Pacific countries &mdash; in the LomÈ framework.  LomÈ is a unique agreement covering trade and wide-ranging co-operation in many key areas of economic and social development. The inclusion of a chapter on development co-operation in the Maastricht Treaty is a recognition that co-operation with the developing countries is now one of the key policy areas of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The benefits to the citizen from these developments are not always immediately obvious.  It will be the job of Governments and of the Commission to ensure that the benefits are brought more clearly to the attention of the citizen.  The Community will have to be more open and all of the institutions will have to be conscious of the need to explain their work.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the Edinburgh European Council on 9-10 December there will be much debate on the theme of &ldquo;openness&rdquo;.  The debate on openness is linked to the debate on subsidiarity.  Our position on the subsidiarity issue is very clear.  We subscribed to the insertion of the principle in the Maastricht Treaty. We agree that the Article on subsidiarity has to be implemented.  However, it <Col N="1824" /> should not be implemented at the expense of the existing institutional balance. We made our views on this clear at Birmingham.  I am heartened by the very positive contribution of the Commission to the debate on the subject of subsidiarity. Discussions are in progress in Brussels on the Commission's communication on subsidiarity &mdash; copies of which I am having placed in the Library. Subsidiarity can be a positive principle which helps guide the formulation of Community legislation, but it should not be a kind of code for the undermining of the status of the Commission or the achievements of the Community to date.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty recognises the need for national parliaments to become more involved in Community affairs. Recent events have reinforced the need for action in this area.  The Commission has signalled that it is prepared to explore ways of briefing the national parliaments on its proposals, possibly to the extent of appointing a single Commissioner with responsibility in this area.  The Government are willing to do all that is necessary to give effect to the declarations in the Treaty regarding the Parliament.</P>
    <P>Already we have in the Oireachtas Joint Committee a means whereby input can be made to the process of considering proposals before the Council of Ministers. A Declaration in the Maastricht Treaty requires national governments to ensure that national parliaments receive Commission proposals in good time for possible examination.  We have had a system of this nature in operation in Ireland since we joined the Community in 1973.  The joint committee's role is under review in the context of the establishment of a Foreign Affairs Committee. Nevertheless, regardless of whatever new committee arrangements are made, the scrutiny of the joint committee function will remain in being.</P>
    <P>More will need to be done because the Treaty Declaration on the role of parliaments and an additional declaration on the Conference of Parliaments will bring this House into much closer and much more regular contact with the European Parliament and the <Col N="1825" /> Legislatures of other member states.  My Department are at the disposal of the House to give advice and help in dealing with the issues likely to arise in these contacts.  The Department are open to any Deputy or Senator.  I feel strongly about the need to inform and to give effect to what we are preaching within the EC in respect of openness and lack of secrecy.</P>
    <P>The further development of economic and social cohesion received an important impetus in the Maastricht Treaty and the practical implementation of this aspect of the Treaty will be a key issue at the Edinburgh European Council.  The Treaty, both in its Articles and in the Cohesion Protocol which forms an integral part of it, again strengthens the cohesion provisions of the EC Treaty. The principle of cohesion is to be taken into account in framing and implementing all Community policies.</P>
    <P>Structural Funds play a key role in helping to bring the less developed regions of the Community up to the Community average.  The Treaty provides that these will be reviewed and that a new Cohesion Fund, specifically for the four least developed member states, will be added.  The Commission's proposals on future financing of the Community, known generally as the Delors II package, include provisions for the doubling of funds &mdash; taking the Structural Funds and the new Cohesion Fund together &mdash; for the four cohesion countries taken as a whole.</P>
    <P>Decisions on this package are to be taken at the European Council to be held in Edinburgh in December.  The proposals on the new Cohesion Fund are already in an advanced state of preparation. The Maastricht text says that it should be in place before the end of 1993. The aim now is to have it in place early in 1993, in line with what was decided at the Lisbon European Council in June.</P>
    <P>Closer co-operation in the area of foreign policy is an essential part of the Maastricht Treaty.  While the Community has yet to reach a stage of development where foreign policy can be the subject of full Community decision-making, <Col N="1826" /> as is the case with Economic and Monetary Union, the Maastricht Treaty does represent a valuable step forward.</P>
    <P>Decisions will still be taken by the member states by consensus.  Implementation, as in the area of Justice and Home Affairs, will be by national action and not by directly applicable Community legislation.  However, the new arrangements for foreign policy co-operation will allow the Twelve to act together more effectively than has been the case under existing provisions.</P>
    <P>The process of co-operation on foreign policy questions since the early seventies has enabled the Community and its member states to look outwards, to other parts of the world, on the basis of agreed positions.  The experience has been positive &mdash; positive for the Community and for the internaional community as a whole.</P>
    <P>One clear indication of this is that other parts of the world increasingly look to the Community to have a common view of a situation, to become constructively involved, to back up that involvement with practical measures of co-operation.</P>
    <P>We must also keep in mind the wider international background to what is happening in Europe.  The United Nations is today more active than ever.  In the past few years, as many peace-keeping operations were established as were established over the previous 40 years.  Ireland has played a very significant role in many of these peace-keeping operations and I would like to pay particular tribute to those in the Army and so on who have given their time in very difficult and dangerous circumstances to serve with the United Nations in the interests of peace-keeping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The international community is coming to accept more and more a common responsibility towards the broader problems of international society &mdash; towards combating poverty, protecting the environment, promoting confidence-building and disarmament. This emerging international agenda <Col N="1827" /> requires a coherent, forward-looking role for the European Community.</P>
      <P>At the same time it is very important that we, as a small nation, keeping ourselves in proper perspective, should not be dissuaded from pursuing a particular foreign policy or direction.  It would be my intention, as long as I remain Minister for Foreign Affairs, to address that in the national and international interest, keeping in perspective our position as a small country, as equal partners within the European Community but, nevertheless, with a position to take on issues like humanitarian aid and so on.</P>
      <P>The chapter in the Maastricht Treaty on the future common foreign and security policy has already been discussed extensively in this House.  I hope I have said enough to reinforce the message which has been heard so many times &mdash; that international conditions today require a strengthening of the mechanisms through which the Community develops common approaches in the foreign policy field.</P>
      <P>The solutions offered in the Maastricht Treaty involve a balance.  In order to promote a coherent European Community role in world affairs, it sets out objectives, streamlines decision-making procedures under the Council, and provides for joint actions under which the Twelve will pursue a sustained and detailed policy in certain areas which are judged from time to time to be of particular importance.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Treaty includes checks and safeguards such as the continuing distinction between security and defence and the provision that policy will be determined by unanimity, as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From Ireland's point of view, an active forward-looking role for the Community gives us an enhanced opportunity to promote values for which we have traditionally stood on the world stage &mdash; the rule of law, respect for human rights, support for the United Nations, disarmament, the responsibility of the international community to address the glaring problems of poverty and underdevelopment. <Col N="1828" /> We can wholeheartedly support the foreign policy dimension of the Treaty in the contexts I mentioned.</P>
    <P>As we are discussing foreign policy, I would like briefly to refer to Somalia.  In early August, at the invitation of Irish aid agencies, I visited Somalia and witnessed at first hand the utter desolation and destitution of the people of that country.  I described Somalia then as the land that God forgot.  Subsequent to my visit I made every effort to awaken the world's conscience to the plight of Somalia. While I can report some successes in these efforts, I regret to say that the situation there at present continues to horrify us all.  The visit by President Robinson also highlighted Ireland's concern at the continuing appalling situation there.  I would like to pay particular tribute to the President for the courage, concern and dedication she showed in taking up the invitation she received from the aid agencies to go to that country. She played a significant role, a good and genuine one, in bringing that devastated country to the attention of the international community, and I salute her in that regard.</P>
    <P>Both at Foreign Minister level and at Head of Government level, at the Birmingham European Council, Ireland has played a leading part in shaping Community policy, which is based on ensuring adequate flows of aid, the distribution of aid in condition of civil disorder, and the promotion of national reconciliation in that country.</P>
    <P>As I speak, the security situation in Somalia continues to be a cause for great concern.  Although the cease-fire holds in some areas of the country.  The presence of armed bandits exacerbates an already difficult situation.  The rapid deployment of all the UN troops authorised by the Security Council remains an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>The recent resignation of Ambassador Sahnoun as the UN Secretary-General's special representative in Somalia is a matter of deep disappointment and regret.  It is hoped that his successor, Mr. Ismat Kittani, will continue the efforts of Ambassador Sahnoun in reconciling the <Col N="1829" /> waring factions and in working to bring peace to Somalia.</P>
    <P>I met Ambassador Sahnoun on a number of occasions.  He is a former Algerian diplomat and I must pay special tribute to him.  He is an extraordinary man and it was with great regret that I learned of the difficulties he was experiencing there in regard to what I consider to be bureaucratic interference in an unfair and unjust fashion.</P>
    <P>This House has had a number of detailed debates this year on European issues and I have found these debates very valuable.  I am sure that this debate will be equally valuable and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">

      <P>In the uncertain political atmosphere which now pervades our country, Fine Gael are very keen indeed to have this ratified by the Oireachtas before an election is called.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael led the charge to have the Maastricht Treaty ratified by the people on 18 June last and in the circumstances a Bill to put in place the provisions of the Treaty as part of our domestic law has our approval.</P>
      <P>Essentially the Bill is a technical measure.  Indeed, it would have been wiser perhaps if the technical aspects had been fully explored and teased out in advance.  What is perfectly obvious yet again is the need for an Oireachtas foreign affairs committee.  I have been pressing for its establishment for years and could never understand the reluctance of Fianna F·il to agree to the setting up of such a committee.  I accept entirely that the Minister is an honourable exception to my strictures and that whatever progress has been made after years of stonewalling has been since his arrival in Iveagh House.  I compliment him on his openness in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to be in a position to issue an invitation to the Minister.  In the past we had the Oireachtas Committee on Development Co-operation which I always saw as a stepping stone to a foreign affairs comittee and I would now see that as an integral part or sub-committee of the proposed foreign affairs committee.  We have had this hiatus since 1987 and, one way or the other, we are going to lay the foundation stone of a foreign affairs committee very shortly.</P>
      <P>Never was it more necessary for Ireland to have an input into encouraging the development of a vision of Europe.  At the moment the Presidency of the Council of Ministers is held by the UK which demonstrably lacks the capacity to give genuine European leadership at this time.  It is very clear that their own troubles at home mean that they can give no leadership on the European scene.  That is a matter of concern to all of us who want to see Europe giving effective leadership in the world. After the UK have completed their term we will have Denmark taking over the Presidency and poor old Denmark have even more acute political problems on European issues.  As I see it there is a vacuum and something should be done to fill it.  We must also consider what must be done to ensure that such a vacuum does not arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a role to play here.  What we should be doing is looking at the structures <Col N="1831" /> of the European Community and making what I would regard as progressive proposals to improve them.  I strongly believe that the proposals to reduce the powers of the European Commission are misdirected.  On the contrary, we should encourage the enhancement of those powers.  In the main, the Commission has always protected the role of the smaller member states.  We should acknowledge this and ensure that its powers are enhanced rather than decreased so that it will continue to play this role in the future.</P>
    <P>If we are going to give the European Commission more powers &mdash; this is one of my hobby-horses which I think deserves serious consideration &mdash; it needs to have a mandate to speak on behalf of all the people of Europe.  Today is American presidential election day and all over the United States people will be casting their votes.  I am not saying that the President of the European Commission has the same functions or powers as the President of the United States but we should consider whether the President of the European Commission should be directly elected.  If the President of the European Commission was directly elected in a European-wide election the person elected could provide the leadership of which I speak.</P>
    <P>There is also a need &mdash; this is of major relevance to us as one of the smaller member states of the European Community &mdash; to establish as one of the European institutions a directly elected European Senate with an equal number of senators from each member state and I make no apology for taking a leaf out of the Americans's book in that respect. At present the MEPs from the smaller member states in the European Parliament are outnumbered by the MEPs from the larger member states.  We have 15 MEPs &mdash; Northern Ireland has three &mdash; as compared with a figure of 81 for some of the larger member states.  If we had a senate with an equal number of senators from each member state, most countries would be far more inclined to give the European Parliament greater <Col N="1832" /> powers.  We could do so secure in the knowledge that our interests would be protected by the establishment of a European Senate.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, however, that there is any great anxiety at official level to transfer powers from the Council of Ministers to the European Parliament.  I support the idea in theory but would be inclined to baulk at it in the context of our lack of numbers in the European Parliament but I would square the circle by pushing for the enhancement of the powers of the European Parliament and the establishement of a European Senate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the structures of the Community there is one other proposal that I would like to make.  The Government have missed an historic opportunity to make a plea for the establishment of the European Central Bank in Dublin. This bank &mdash; and I hope the Maastricht Treaty will be ratified &mdash; will be the focus of the Community as a single economic unit.  It will set the Community's monetary policy and will have the ECU as its currency.  It will also be hugely influential in advising the Community on fiscal and economic policy.  Under the Treaty its independence is explicitly guaranteed but this does not mean that it will operate in isolation from the concerns and policy issues which will inform the decisions of the other institutions of the Community. Under the Treaty the President of the Council of Ministers and a designated member of the Commission will have the right to participate at all meetings of the governing council of the European Central Bank.  In addition, the president of the bank will be allowed to participate at meetings of the Council of Ministers where banking issues arise.  I would rate this institution as the equivalent of the big three &mdash; the Commission, the Council and the Parliament.  Therefore, its importance is without question.</P>
    <P>As everyone is aware, the bigger member states &mdash; France, Germany and the United Kingdom &mdash; are actively canvassing to have the bank established in their countries.  I have heard that the French will agree to the establishment of the bank in Germany provided the <Col N="1833" /> Germans agree to drop their objection to the continuation of the European Parliament in Strasbourg while London is also pushing its case very hard, but it is my theory that Ireland has an historic opportunity to promote Dublin as a compromise location for the bank.  I say this because the big three will not be able to agree readily among themselves and in a situation where the heavyweight members cannot reach agreement we could have an opportunity to slip through.</P>
    <P>Given the establishment of the Financial Services Centre, the technological advances that have been made here and the fact that we have an educated work-force, there are strong and logical arguments for the establishment of the bank in Dublin but what is lacking is the political will to push the case.  Because the prize is so great in terms of jobs, both direct and indirect, it would be worth mounting a major campaign to secure the establishment of the bank here.  It was suggested that under the Maastricht Treaty some small scale institute would be established in Ireland, associated, I suppose with Loughlinstown, but this does not satisfy me.  We have an opportunity to secure the establishment of the European Central Bank here and I would like to see that followed up and explored.</P>
    <P>There is a need to review the way in which we can ensure effective communication between governments and electorates on what the European project is all about.  It is clear that communication is a two-way process &mdash; it is not just about governments telling electorates what plans have been agreed for the future of Europe but rather about governments listening to people and taking account of their concerns about the direction in which Europe is going.  This was obvious at the time of our own referendum campaign and perhaps more so at the time of the French referendum campaign.  I would not be as positive as the Minister who in his speech mentioned that the Irish people were well informed in relation to the White Paper but it would have been marvellous if it had been published six to nine months earlier. <Col N="1834" /> However, it was published only six to eight weeks before the referendum was held.  I do not think that this was good enough because attention was focused on this issue during this period only and it was then dropped and forgotten.</P>
    <P>At European level, there was a recognition by the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors, at the Birmingham Summit, of the need for contact between the European Commission and the national parliaments.  In this regard I hope the proposal that a member of the Commission should be designated to keep in contact with national parliaments will be proceeded with.  While important in itself, this will not be sufficient in that it amounts only to communication between one institution and another.  I would like to see all our people embrace the European ideal with more enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>If I recall correctly the only occasions on which there was any debate and discussion on Europe were at the time of our accession to the European Community, at the time of the referendum on the Single European Act and more recently at the time of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty.  This does nothing for the development of the European ideal or widening appreciation on the part of our people of what is involved in our membership of the European family of nations.  As a result, the European Community is seen either as a pork barrel from which we draw grants or, alternatively, as a bureaucratic jungle which lays down restrictions which annoy our citizens.  The major responsibility rests with ourselves.  All of us who are interested in the development of the European ideal should resolve that whatever the outcome of the next election there will be much more emphasis in debates in the D·il and the Seanad, and more particularly in a foreign affairs committee, on issues of importance in the context of Europe.  Only by ensuring that our legislators are fully informed will we have any chance of ensuring that public opinion is more informed and more supportive of the European ideal.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that Luxembourg, <Col N="1835" /> Greece and Italy have completed their retification procedures.  A very important debate will be held in the UK tomorrow and we understand the position in Denmark, but I thought that France, following their referendum, would be on the list of countries who have completed their procedures.  Perhaps the Minister would give an outline of the position in other countries.  I am very enthusiastic about the proposal of the President of the Commission to launch a European growth initiative.  I believe very strongly that there is a possibility of positive results of action on jobs if taken at European level.  That is an issue that must have the enthusiastic response of us all and I hope it will lead to positive results.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the way the whole issue of subsidiarity has been dealt with at European community level. Subsidiarity now means all things to all men.  The original theory of subsidiarity was based on the Papal Encyclical, <i>Rerum Novarum</i> of 1890.  The principles laid down therein are looked on in different ways by different people depending on their perspective.  The UK, which I would not regard as the most European-minded country, is enthusiastic about the principle of subsidiarity and the Minister enthusiastically endorsed the Commission's approach to subsidiarity, but my fear in this regard is that the possibility of taking action at European level, where it should be taken, will be avoided by those countries who do not want to see Europe develop in the way I would wish.  I am thinking particularly in the context of public spending on education and health.  To take education as an example, we have a very good standard of education but unfortunately many of our people have to emigrate to other parts of the European Community. There should be recognition of that in the context of the development of Europe in the future.  If we are to be a nursery for highly qualified graduates for other member states of the Community there should be an acknowledgement of that in terms of a policy at European level.  I would not like to see the principles of <Col N="1836" /> subsidiarity used to undermine any such approach.</P>
    <P>Sufficient thought has not been given to the development of the common foreign and Community policy in the years ahead.  As regards the crisis in Yugoslavia, the efforts of the European Community have been a little pathetic. It has often been said that the European Community is an economic giant, a political pygmy and a military midget.  Never was that more obvious than in the feebleminded way in which it responded to the crisis in Yugoslavia and its component parts.  I am concerned that during the coming winter tens of thousands of people in Bosnia Herzegovina and other parts of former Yugoslavia will die from hunger, starvation and cold.  Yet the European Community seem helpless in preventing such a calamity.</P>
    <P>I would like to see in the run-up to the next referendum in 1996 an analysis of the present position from the point of view of common foreign policy, security and defence and of our outlook on neutrality, and a frank and open debate on that matter.  There is a hedging around as to what may be involved in a common security and foreign policy for the Community. An effective and coherent debate in the years ahead should not be evaded because of any notion about sacred cows, that are no longer relevant to the present position.  I am urging a very frank and open debate in the years ahead so that by the time the intergovernmental conference is held in a couple of years' time and the holding of the referendum thereafter, the public will be fully informed and aware of the issues.</P>
    <P>On the question of Somalia, I compliment the Minister for the contribution he has made in that regard.  We were all very heartened by the initial steps he took in going to that country, by the visit of the President and the way in which she took to her heart the people of Somalia and acted as a voice for them.  That had a major impact on our people but, unfortunately, considering the way matters are continuing to develop there and the fact that the problem is worsening it will be <Col N="1837" /> necessary for the Minister to continue pushing the effort.</P>
    <P>The full complement of UN troops has not been deployed and relief shipments are not properly safeguarded.  I was appalled at the resignation of Ambassador Sahnoun who apparently had the temerity to question the inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of the United Nations operation.  He should be complimented on that.  It gives me no great confidence in the UN operation that somebody who had the guts to stand up and give legitimate, frank, open and honest criticism of what deserved to be criticised, ended up without a job.  I know nothing about the new man, Ambassador Kittani, but I only hope he is half as good as his predecessor.  I hope he will not accept silently deficiences in the UN operation. We will be watching his progress.  If we are to have credibility abroad we need to maintain our effort and to give example by redressing our appalling record of official aid since 1987.  I think the Minister will agree that his efforts abroad would have much more credibility if we were seen to do more at home at official level. There has been an enormous response at voluntary level.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the United Nations on which I would like to see future policy mapped out, that is the role of the UN in international and regional conflicts.  I am glad the UN are taking a more up-front role in this regard and I am proud of our record in UN peacekeeping operations, but we must address the development of that role in future. The Charter of the United Nations restricts such development in that Article 7 restricts interference in the internal affairs of a member of the United Nations.  That provision should be changed to ensure that where there is evidence of blatant breaches or gross violations of human rights, such as genocide, there should be an automatic right on the part of the United Nations to intervene.  Certainly there should not be a restriction in the Charter preventing the United Nations from intervening in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am referring to areas in which we <Col N="1838" /> should have more detailed debates &mdash; future development of policy, future development of the United Nations and future development of the European Community.  I look forward &mdash; in Government or in Opposition &mdash; to participating in those debates and, in the meantime, I support the Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>The Government negotiated the Maastricht Treaty in secret in the sense that, while there was plenty of discussion in this House in at least four separate debates, we were not fully aware at any stage as to what precisely the Government's advance position was, until the conclusion of the Maastricht Treaty.  We were not informed that the infamous Protocol 17 was being drafted and inserted in the Treaty and, therefore, we do not know to what extent the Treaty represents a success or defeat for Government negotiation.  All we know is that they brought it to this House and subsequently proposed the referendum debate, the result of which is well known. In that debate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said that Fine Gael &ldquo;entirely approved the Maastricht Treaty&rdquo;, this afternoon he used the words &ldquo;entire approval&rdquo; when referring to the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party did not entirely approve of the Maastricht Treaty because we felt that in many respects it was a compromise which fell very much short of the objectives which we would set for the future development of the European Community into European Union.  In a document &mdash; which I laid before the House on a previous occasion &mdash; we published a clear and critical analysis of the shortcomings in the Maastricht Treaty. Notwithstanding that, we still recognised that the Treaty represented a significant step forward and that, on balance, it should be approved by the people.  We campaigned, with our colleagues and friends in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, on that basis; the result was approximately 70 per cent, to 30 per cent, in favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, one of the main concerns which arose during the course of the <Col N="1839" /> Danish referendum &mdash; and subsequently in the French referendum &mdash; was the lack of democratic accountability and transparency in relation to how the Community has conducted its affairs to date and how it proposes to do so in future.  It is relevant to read into the record of the House the considered report which was prepared by the body which is the only directly elected Assembly under the Treaty's various provisions &mdash; the European Parliament.  It was the first Parliament of the 13 parliamentary institutions &mdash; if you include the European Parliament with the 12 national governments &mdash; to approve it by a large majority, 226-62, with only 31 abstentions.  The European Parliament adopted that resolution on 7 April.  However, they did so with many reservations, which I will read into the record, because they are apposite to what the Minister said during his contribution. I quote from <i>European Parliament &mdash; Maastricht &mdash; The Treaty on European Union, the position of the European Parliament.</i></P>
    <P>A.  whereas the European Parliament defined the essential elements of European Union as being:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash; economic and monetary union with a single currency and an autonomous central bank;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a common foreign policy, including joint consideration of the issues of peace, security and arms control;</P>
    <P>&mdash; a completed single market with common policies in all the areas in which the economic integration and mutual interdependence of the Member States require common action notably to ensure economic and social cohesion and a balanced environment;</P>
    <P>&mdash; element of common citizenship and a common framework for protecting basic rights;</P>
    <P>&mdash; an institutional system which is sufficiently efficient to manage these responsibilities effectively <Col N="1840" /> and which is democratically structured, notably by giving the European Parliament a right of initiative, of co-decision with the Council on Community legislation, the right to ratify all constitutional decisions requiring the ratification of the Member States also and the right to elect the President of the Commission&rdquo;;≤  </P>
    <P>B.  whereas the Treaty of Maastricht contains provisions which are inconsistent with regard to the above requirements and whereas although some progress has been achieved on European Monetary Union, common policies and citizenship, the institutional system contains shortcomings to the extent that it is doubtful whether the European Union will be able to achieve its proclaimed objectives, especially if its membership is enlarged, and whereas it has not eliminated the parliamentary democratic deficit;</P>
    <P>C.  whereas the Intergovernmental Conferences themselves recognised the insufficiency of their achievements in that they provided in the Treaty for a new Intergovernmental Conference in 1996;</P>
    <P>D.  whereas, at the intergovernmental conference, a temporary mandate was given for further improvements to be made by the end of 1992 and a decision was taken to create a cohesion fund; </P>
    <P>
      <i>In general</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Urges the national parliaments to ratify the Treaty of Maastricht, and at the same time commit their respective governments to redress at the earliest opportunity its major shortcomings summed up in this resolution in accordance with the final declaration of the Conference of Parliaments of the European Community;</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are in accord with that opening assessment by the vast majority of the European Parliament members and it is worth reading into the record the conclusions of this very substantial <Col N="1841" /> analysis by the people who are directly charged by European citizens to provide the democratic watchdog of the European institutions:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusions</i>
    </P>
    <P>15.  Express its determination, as with the Single European Act to:</P>
    <P>&mdash; exploit to the very limit the possibilities offered by the Treaty of Maastricht;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to pursue its endeavours to obtain a democratic and effective European Union of federal type;  </P>
    <P>16.  In this light:</P>
    <P> (a)  invites the national parliaments, when ratifying the Treaty, to call on their respective governments:</P>
    <P>&mdash; to prepare the next Intergovernmental Conference in order to eliminate the shortcomings of the Treaty of Maastricht in particular as regards the remaining democratic deficit and the efficiency of the decision making process;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to undertake not to make use in Council of the provisions of pargraph 6 of Article 189b which allows Council to act unilaterally in the event of conciliation failing to reach agreement, and not to adopt in Council any legislative act which Parliament has earlier rejected by absolute majority;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to relaunch the strategy worked out at the Conference of the Parliaments of the Community, with particular regard to the need to transform the network of relations between the peoples and member countries into a European Union on a federal basis based on a draft constitution drawn up by the European Parliament in cooperation with the national parliaments;</P>
    <P>(b)  invites the Council and the <Col N="1842" /> Commission, as in the past, to enter into interinstitutional agreements with the Parliament to ensure that new treaties are applied in the most constructive and democratic way possible;</P>
    <P>(c)  invites the governments of the Member States to involve Parliament, before the European Council meeting in Lisbon, in the designation of the President and members of the next Commission of the European Communities, whose term of office will take effect on 1 January 1993 and which will exercise the powers conferred upon it by the Maastricht Treaty; declares here and now that it will consider the submission of the Commission's programme of work as an opportunity to pass a vote of confidence or no confidence in the Commission;</P>
    <P>(d)  invites the Commission, wherever legally possible, to choose for is proposals legal bases that require the co-decision procedure and expects the Commission to withdraw its proposals where, under that procedure, Council and Parliament fail to reach agreement in the conciliation committee or where, under the consultation and co-operation procedures, Parliament rejects a text;</P>
    <P>(e)  invites the Council to make use of the &ldquo;passerelle&rdquo; provided for in Article K.9 of the Treaty of Maastricht and thereby transfer matters concerning justice and home affairs to the field of competence of the European Community;</P>
    <P>(f)  instructs the responsible parliamentary organs to prepare a reform of Parliament's working methods that will enable it to make full use of the new procedures and to take the necessary measures within their field of responsibility, bearing in mind the obligation imposed by Article F (3) of the Maastricht Treaty for the union to &ldquo;provide itself with the means necessary to <Col N="1843" /> attain its objectives and carry through its policies&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(g)  undertakes to begin already preparations for a new revision of the treaties which should aim to eliminate the shortcomings of the Treaty of Maastricht; believes that many of the issues must be addressed before the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled in 1996, in particular because treaty amendments are necessary:</P>
    <P>&mdash; to adjust the number of members of the European Parliament for German unity;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to allow the accession of new Member States which requires a significant improvement in decision-taking procedures, notably as regards Parliament's right of co-decision and the functioning of Council;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to remedy the democratic deficit;</P>
    <P>(h)  stresses that it will not be able to agree to the accession of new Member States unless further reforms are adopted in addition to the Maastricht Treaty, in particular concerning the elimination of the democratic deficit and the consolidation of the principles and aims on which Political Union is based;</P>
    <P>(i)  instructs its responsible committee to complete its preparation of a draft constitution as set out in its resolution of 11 July 1990 on the European Parliament's guidelines for a draft constitution for the European Union through procedures involving the national parliaments as provided for in the Final Declaration of the Conference of the parliaments of the European Community of November 1990 in Rome;  </P>
    <P>I should apologise for reading so much text into the record but the House will agree it is relevant.  What is most relevant about it is that it was passed as far back as 7 April 1992, at least two months <Col N="1844" /> before the Danish people came up with their so-called surprise.  Had the Governments of all member states, including ours, been listening to the combined wisdom of the 226 members of the European Parliament, then much of the so-called surprise that confronted the institutional decision-makers in the Community, including various Governments, would not have occurred.  It is for that reason &mdash; in supporting this technical Bill to give effect to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the Oireachtas, as already agreed substantially by the Irish people in the relevant referendum &mdash; I want to put formally on the record the position of the Labour Party in this regard.  We are in full accord with the conclusions of the European Parliament which had the full support of the Socialist group of that Parliament, of which we are members.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; whose personal commitment in these matters is not in doubt &mdash; to take to heart the measures referred to in such detail in the report I quoted.  As I indicated, I merely read out the conclusions of a substantial analytical document.  The significance of that report is that it was prepared and ratified by the very people charged uniquely with making a democratic European union work with few exceptions right across the political spectrum.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister who has had an opportunity to experience such matters as a Government backbencher, an Opposition Deputy and now as a senior Cabinet Minister, say whether from his experience of Council meetings, he thinks that there should be an end to the facade of private meetings taking place at Council meetings.  Members rush out the moment they have made their presentation to the Council to brief journalists putting a spin on the story that will be reported back home as to how well or how hard a Minister tried to get a point of view in the national interest through to an unwilling Council of Ministers. Bearing in mind the difficulties attached to the Danish and French referenda, discounting the domestic factors involved, <Col N="1845" /> would he agree that now is the time to open up all meetings of the Council of Ministers?</P>
    <P>We all know that, within the existing framework of Council of Ministers meetings, there are periods of privacy, for example over lunch when increasingly &mdash; at least in my experience &mdash; any matter considered to be somewhat contentious within the full session of the Council is referred to either by the President or a member of the Commission as one that might usefully be the subject of informal discussion on the margins.  There are many institutional mechanisms at Council level which would enable sensitive, delicate matters to be handled in a manner which would not in any way drive decision-making down the corridors away from a properly constituted representative body.  On this point it is essential that the trappings, workings and deliberations of the decision-making processes of the Council of Ministers and therefore, the Commission, should be opened up to the press.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's view in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I would also be interested to hear the attitude of the Government to the idea &mdash; again I am quoting from the recommendations of the Parliament &mdash; that while the President of the Commission may be nominated to the European Parliament by the Council, the European Parliament should have the right to confirm that nomination.  Indeed, not only should the Parliament have the right to confirm the President but also the nomination of members of the Commission. This would mean that the executive of the Community, the Commission, would in some way be directly accountable to the elected Parliamentary Assembly of that union, the Parliament in Strasbourg. If there is not that inter-connection between responsibility and accountability, which has at its foundation a democratic base, then the gap in credibility manifest across Europe at present will remain if not deepen.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of our State and Government it is in our interest to proceed with enlargement of the EFTA <Col N="1846" /> group of countries as soon as possible. The Council meeting at Lisbon decided that that would not take place until such time as the Maastricht Treaty was properly ratified, the timetable for which I imagine has been postponed for at least six months.  The fact that Sweden, Austria and Finland have formally applied for full membership and the probability that Switzerland and Norway will lodge such an application means that they would be net contributors, not in a financial sense, to the ethos of the Community. They would be net contributors in a political sense, in that they would reflect a set of social values in the political arena to which, broadly speaking, Ireland could give its full support, although I suspect the Progressive Democrats might have a certain difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>The prevailing social democratic attitude that underpins the commitment to full employment, for example &mdash; the hallmark of the policies pursued by Governments in Finland, Austria and Sweden &mdash; are the values we need to have articulated and represented at the Council of Ministers when, with majority decision-making in place, we seek the kind of growth initiative for which President Delors sought support, without great success it has to be said in Birmingham.  So long as the prevailing conservative views dominate the decision-making of the Council, then we shall not get the type of economic relaunch of the European Community that is needed.</P>
    <P>As the Parliament has a final say in regard to additional membership of the Community, it is in our interest to take into account the concerns expressed by the Parliament, so substantially detailed in their report.</P>
    <P>I turn now to an aspect of the European debate on the Maastricht Treaty that agitated people here in a big way.  A view was expressed, erroneously but nevertheless understandably because of the complexity of the Treaty and the inadequate manner in which it was presented &mdash; it was shared by many people &mdash; that the Community, in a sense, was turning its back on the rest of the world, in particular <Col N="1847" /> on the Third World.  The view was that the Community was drawing up the drawbridge of human development and progress and leaving behind large parts of the world for which Europe had a substantial responsibility having regard to its past colonial record.  The Minister's visit to Somalia soon after his appointment was a positive step in changing that perception.  I congratulate the Minister on it.  The subsequent visit by my party colleague, Deputy Michael Higgins to Somalia added to that perspective which is shared right across the political spectrum in Ireland.  The folk memory of the horror of the Famine in Ireland is locked into our genes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt, but I too would like to pay tribute to Deputy Michael Higgins.  I omitted to do so in my opening statement.  The Deputy did a very courageous and generous thing but one has come to expect that from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Both visits ultimately led to the request for the visit by President Robinson to Somalia.  I agree with the sentiments that have been expressed.  I appreciate the unique generosity with which the Minister has acknowledged her contribution.  That is all the more reason to harness within the European Community framework of Ireland's commitment to the Community the emotional energy of a large section of the Irish people who have a strong commitment to development and the promotion of an improvement in living and working conditions in the Third World.  If we fail to persuade a large section of the Irish public that the European Community has an interest in these areas and a substantial contribution to make, we will have failed in our duty. The way in which Ireland is uniquely associated with the various LomÈ conventions, the first of which was signed during our first presidency in 1973-74 and the whole process of the European Development Fund is an indication that Ireland has some authority in this area. <Col N="1848" /> As Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Keeffe played a significant role during a subsequent Irish presidency in convincing other European colleagues to respond to the Bob Geldof Live Aid initiative during the Ethiopian food crisis.  There is a large body of concerned citizenry in the Irish body politic who are committed to development issues who have not been adequately informed of the potential commitment of the European Community to a better world.  That should be addressed by the Government. The best way to do this is through the rapid establishment of the committee on foreign affairs which would allow us to address those issues.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the committee on secondary European legislation for a period of four years.  I do not share the Minister's view in relation to its usefulness or its own perception of its relevance. Frequently we found ourselves dancing to somebody else's tune, working to somebody else's agenda and discussing in minute detail draft directives which would be implemented anyway and into which we had little if no input. I can recall only one occasion in four years where the report prepared by the committee was debated on the floor of this House and that referred to the rights of cultural workers to social welfare entitlements and so on.  It was a relatively important but nevertheless very small item on the European stage at the time. It would be incorrect and politically unwise to suggest that there was a great body of experience to be gained from the contributions of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  We have moved too far and too fast for that model to be applicable anymore.  I hope that when establishing the foreign affairs committee the Minister will display the kind of generosity he displayed so far and make available the necessary specialist staff it will require to do their work effectively. If the committee cannot produce the kind of incisive reporting analysis necessary it will simply become an ineffective talking shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> We recognised the major deficiencies in the Maastricht Treaty.  We documented them and we engaged a large element of our party membership in that process, from within the Oireachtas and from outside it.  We also had consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the constituent unions affiliated to the Labour Party.  Broadly speaking, we accept that Europe is the avenue which provides the future for this country but we will travel successfully only if we travel critically.  The debate we had in the run up to the Maastricht Treaty is not the type of debate we should continue with.  We did not have the critical debate that was essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate today concerns the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1992, which is intended to bring into Irish law the effects of the Maastricht Treaty adopted overwhelmingly by the people in June.  I sought earlier today to seek to have the motion which would have ratified those treaties by this House voted on and I was defeated by a procedural device regrettably brought forward by the Labour Party.  The reason I sought to do that was not, as suggested, because I was prepared to face down the decision of the people, but because the debate that took place at the time of the referendum, and the nature of the debate in terms of the choice that was offered, was not adequate.  One had to take Maastricht in total or leave the Community.  It was stated that we would be driven out of the Community if we did not accept Maastricht. We were told that if we did not accept Maastricht we would not get the £6 billion which we were told was sewn up and was guaranteed.  We even had Mr. Delors, the Commission President, trotted out to make statements assuring us that of course his package was virtually on line and that there was no question but that it would be forthcoming if and when the Maastricht Treaty was ratified. We know that that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we voted we knew that Denmark had clearly indicated that they were not happy with the Maastricht Treaty as <Col N="1850" /> it stood.  We know that a huge proportion of the French electorate are not happy with it, that a significant proportion of the electorate here are not happy with it, and we can see the turmoil that is growing in Britain.  I do not suggest that the dissatisfaction is the same in all cases in all countries or that the reason for it is the same, but there is a general unease that a Treaty is being implemented and the people generally did not have adequate time to address themselves to it and to understand it.  Under the Treaty the people are giving away powers and they are not really all that happy about giving them away at this time.</P>
    <P>One of the basis on which we opposed this Treaty related to the common foreign and security policy.  It is interesting that in the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, it says, in relation to section 2 (b):</P>
    <P>The competences in question do not relate to any treaties, acts or provisions other than those set out in section 1 (as amended) of the European Communities Act, 1972.  They do not therefore relate to Title V of the Treaty on European Union (provisions on a common foreign and security policy) where no requirement for domestic legislation is envisaged; or to Title VI of the Treaty (provisions on co-operation in the fields of justice and home affairs) for which, though legislation may be required at some stage in the future, it is not required and would not be appropriate at present.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one minute that anything is being deliberately withheld from us in that statement but generally explanatory memoranda present the positive aspects of a Bill.  Given that the Minister is responsible for the Bill and the explanatory memorandum I would not expect him to point out its shortcomings, but by excluding these area of our domestic legislation from the scrutiny, by and large, of the European Parliament and the European Court, we are denying ourselves the right to have a direct influence as a people in regard to those areas.</P>
    <P>We had considerable concerns in <Col N="1851" /> regard to the question of a common foreign and security policy during the Maastricht referendum campaign and we still have those concerns.  The common foreign and security policy involves an intergovernmental body who operate outside the Treaty of Rome and the European Community proper.  The European Council &mdash; that is the Summit &mdash; will decide the general guidelines and the Council of Ministers will make decisions with regard to implementation. Both those bodies meet behind closed doors and release the absolute minimum amount of information and sometimes even more.</P>
    <P>Defence matters &mdash; that is military implications &mdash; are to be subcontracted under this Treaty to the Western European Union with regard to &ldquo;elaboration and implementation&rdquo;.  The European Parliament, European Court and Commission are effectively excluded from the decision-making and overseeing process. This exclusion of Parliament is even greater than for other areas of Union competency and much less than in community matters which, in itself, does not say much.  It will be consulted in regard to the main choices of the common foreign and security policy, for example, it will be informed of the actions of the Union in regard to arms control, economic facets of security, the transfer of military technology and arms exports.  It will be informed, but cannot approve or reject anything.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers will be advised by a political committee of civil servants from the member states which shall &ldquo;prepare decisions for the Council of Ministers&rdquo; and shall be responsible for monitoring the implementation of agreed policies.  We will not necessarily be told who they are, when they meet or what topics they have discussed.  They are not answerable or accountable to any parliament or to any person who is answerable to parliament.</P>
    <P>The Western European Union Council will not be short of advisers either.  It will have a European security and defence academy.  Since 19 June of this year it <Col N="1852" /> has a military planning think tank with military officers from the nine member countries to give it credibility and real military expertise.  One need not be an outright cynic to suggest that civilian and military specialist advisers with careers connected to security development will not underestimate the need for more security and defence initiatives and will advise their Ministers accordingly.</P>
    <P>In effect, therefore, policy and actions under the common foreign and security policy will be devised by unelected and unidentifiable committee of civil servants and military officers.  Their prepared decisions will be adopted by their respective Councils of Ministers and the Western European Union, increasingly the same body, meeting in closed session and without any parliamentary control or scrutiny.  Based on past experience, there is precious little hope that this lack of democratic control or overseeing will be rectified at national level, certainly in the D·il.  Irish Ministers in the Council are notorious for the zeal with which they guard information about business which they are going to discuss or have discussed in Council.  Some people suspect that this reluctance to inform is partly related to the fear that the necessity to explain might expose gaps in understanding.</P>
    <P>The conditioned reaction to any issue dealing with defence and security is to deny it totally if possible and, if not, to deny it could possibly have any effect on our neutrality.  Accordingly, any such decisions, we are told, do not matter, do not apply to us and, therefore, do not necessitate the prior notification of the approval of the D·il.  This was the case in regard to refuelling at Shannon during the Gulf War, over flights to bomb Libya and the Single European Act when the people were only consulted following a Supreme Court order.</P>
    <P>We first attended and now we are becoming observers and may well join &mdash; we have not been told yet &mdash; the Western European Union in the same fashion.  In any event, the declaration on voting in the common foreign and security policy provisions provide the perfect excuse for <Col N="1853" /> domestic consumption: we did our best and resisted heroically but we could not resist the persuasiveness of the qualified majority in the end.</P>
    <P>That is a brief summary of the serious concerns that still exist in regard to the common foreign and security provision of Maastricht which we are told are not covered by this Bill and which we were told during the Maastricht referendum campaign did not affect the position in regard to our neutrality.  It is way past time we had a foreign affairs committee of this House which would have the right to examine in detail what our Government representatives are doing at EC level.  I am not concerned whether that requires a separate European affairs committee or a sub-committee of the foreign affairs committee that we are promised.  In my view, there should be a separate European affairs committee but no matter what way it is done there is an urgent need to enable the Members of this House to examine what is being done and not being done in our name and what case is not being put on our behalf, particularly in regard to defence policies.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign I went to great pains to point out that I was not opposed to this country involved in a defence arrangement at European level.  I made it clear that as far as I was concerned the traditional notion of neutrality, which regarded us as having to be isolated in Europe or elsewhere, was no longer valid.  The world has moved on since the forties.  We have a completely new world order, not one that I would choose having regard to the injustices that exist in the world and the way resources are squandered on arms while millions starve.  Nevertheless, there is a new order and our voice should be heard in relation to how the world can disarm itself, particularly in regard to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.  It is a crime that so much of the world's resources are being spent on such weapons at a time when the majority of people in the world go to bed hungry at night, that is if they have a bed at all.  In that regard I want to put on record my admiration for the stance taken by the <Col N="1854" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs in the past on these issues.  I welcome the initiative he is taking at present in relation to the non-proliferation treaty.  It is long past time that Ireland should play an active role in tha area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond with action in regard to a European affairs committee and a foreign affairs committee which would give this House a role in the development of our foreign policy, and our defence policy with regard to Europe.  We should not be left in the position that in four or five years time a Government could come into this House and tell us that if we do not accept what is being proposed we will be pushed out of the Community.  That is not good enough.  We have to be involved from day one, from now, in any negotiations that are taking place on how the European Community develops its defence policies.  I do not want to spend all my time on this issue but it would be my view that any European defence must, as a prerequisite, deny itself the luxury of nuclear deterrents.  That is a bottom line which this country should insist on.</P>
    <P>Regarding the economic aspect of this Treaty, there are similar problems.  More than three million citizens of the European Community are homeless.  Approximately 15 million of the labour force are unemployed and almost 60 million citizens of the European Community are living below the poverty line.  Those are the official statistics of the European Community.  It seems to me that the more European voters and people generally have an opportunity to think about Maastricht, and the more they learn about it, the more they are inclined to question it and, in some cases, to reject it.  The result, in my view, is that the entire European integration project is in jeopardy. It is not good enough for our Government or other European Governments to simply say that this process must continue at any cost, that it must carry on.  It simply will not work if it does not have the support of the people of the member states of the Community.  Far from progress towards integration, with Maastricht as the vehicle that will help to <Col N="1855" /> reduce the economic and political problems of the Community, it is my view that, as it is currently promoted, it is adding to those problems.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the sense of alienation that people are feeling, particularly amongst the more marginalised of the people of Europe, is feeding the more virulent forms of nationalism that are now rampant in many parts of Europe. Indeed, a self-interested regionalism is also developing which, I believe, can only be to the detriment of the development of an integrated federal Europe.</P>
    <P>In response to these kind of risks I do not feel it is sufficient to repeat <i>ad nauseam</i> the mantra that Maastricht must be ratified with all speed without any recognition of its growing unpopularity or any attempt to rectify its now widely recognised deficiencies.  It seems to me that the recent attempt at the Birmingham Summit to gloss over those cracks was anything but successful.</P>
    <P>On the economic situation, we are told that member states face common economic challenges.  The EC goes on to prescribe more of the same medicine that we have had up to now: continuation of policies to reduce inflation and to control budget deficits so as to meet European Monetary Union conversions terms. They say that this is the way to the recovery of economic and social cohesion and the creation of the new and lasting jobs that are needed.  There is no hint of how the same policies which led us into this mess should now, miraculously, bring us out of it.  Since our referendum the anarchy in the financial markets is fresh in everybody's minds.  The Birmingham Summit was convened initially to try to respond to that crisis.  In the end it backed away from it.  It stated that there was a need for reflection and analysis, and then passed the buck to a variety of committees to &ldquo;carry the work forward&rdquo;. Whatever that phrase means, if indeed it means anything, it certainly contains no proposals for how a recurrence of Black Wednesday can be prevented.</P>
    <P>The referendum held in this country was sold to the people on the basis that <Col N="1856" /> they must take it or leave it, take Maastricht or leave the Community.  That was an exaggeration of the position but nevertheless it was the basis on which the case was made.  The much promised £6 billion for Ireland was, apparently, not even discussed at the Birmingham Summit.  The ground is clearly now being prepared for the virtual certainty that the £6 billion will not materialise at all, despite having been told that this was one of the main reasons why we should accept Maastricht. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are suggesting that matters are tightening up everywhere and that there is much tough negotiating to be done.  I am sure there is, but I am quite certain that we will next be told that it was a negotiating tactic to claim that we were getting £6 billion in the first place.  With expectations having to be kept high in order to obtain the optimum outcome, it would be an apt epitaph to a sorry saga of dishonesty &mdash; and I must ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I am in order in using the word dishonesty in the House in view of the current row regarding charges and counter-charges in relation to that word&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some people seem to be particularly concerned about the word, particularly during the referendum campaign and, I believe, wrong-headed negotiating tactics and objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the original Delors II proposals and the crucial component of a phased increase in the budget from 1.2 per cent of Community GNP in 1993 to 1.37 per cent in 1977 had been implemented in full, and if the promised average growth of 2.5 per cent per annum had materialised, unemployment in the Community would still be approximately 500,000 higher in 1997 than it is today.  Instead of which the Community is heading into a <Col N="1857" /> deepening recession with 2 per cent of the projected growth lost during 1992 and 1993 alone.  The collapse of the GATT talks &mdash; and no sign of real progress there &mdash; continued recession in the EFTA countries and the US, plus the turbulence in the financial markets are likely to cause those growth rates to be revised downwards even further.  On top of that, the richer countries in the European Community are refusing to pay and even a Commission proposal of a two-year pause, that is no increase until 1995 at least, is not acceptable to them.</P>
    <P>The £6 billion figure was always an exaggeration in that it failed to take account of the impact of the former GDR, and that proportionately Ireland's share of whatever cake was there was likely to decline.  Instead of facing up to the reality and adopting an alternative strategy, this Government opted for short term political advantage last June which they hope will see them past the next election also.</P>
    <P>The fundamental error from the outset of the negotiations was to focus on an increase in the Structural Funds as the solution to our cohesion problems.  We should have pressed for a system of financial transfers such as those which apply in other federal systems.  The Structural Funds are not the best means of utilising the moneys which we receive.  I have argued before in this House that equivalent measures to reduce the national debt would yield a far better and more beneficial return.  The biggest and most incomprehensible mistake, however, was to oppose the development of a genuine common European industrial policy.  We should put less emphasis on Structural Funds, which we get by grace and favour, and instead support the creation of an interventionist industrial policy which would put the objective of regional cohesion at the heart of efforts to raise the technological capability of European firms.</P>
    <P>The crucial question for peripheral regions of Europe, such as Ireland, is not Euro handouts, not the begging bowl, but rather the investment and divestment decisions of the European multinationals <Col N="1858" /> who are being supported by the Community to face US and Japanese competition. That is the way to real wealth creation and a meaningful shift of the tools to create that wealth from the overcrowded centre of Europe to the periphery. This time last year I made precisely that point in this House during a pre-Maastricht Treaty debate but, of course, I was shot down by the previous Taoiseach, who thought that interventionism existed only in the Eastern European states.  The former Taoiseach's party had been pursuing interventionism virtually since the day they were founded. Even though he has now resigned and we have a new Taoiseach and a new Government there is still no sign that the Government are prepared to fight for such a real deepening of an integrated European union.</P>
    <P>As I said repeatedly, there is no future for the Irish economy outside the European Community.  That is not an option, nor has it been an option for many years. Most of our economic policy and our hopes for a reasonable degree of prosperity depend on decisions taken at European level.  In many cases, and increasingly, they depend on decisions that need to be taken at an even wider international level in fora in which our interests can be adequately represented only as part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty, particularly economic and monetary union, and the Delors II package, its medium-term economic and fiscal policy adjunct, determine the parameters within which we must operate for the rest of this century. If that is not right we are in serious trouble because there are virtually no mechanisms left to us which can be used at national level to change course or to correct mistakes.  Financial deregulation and the globalisation of trade have led to a position in which even the European Community is not a superpower.</P>
    <P>In the weeks immediately prior to the Maastricht Summit &mdash; about this time last year &mdash; I published a document which, in addition to the neutrality issue, highlighted two major shortcomings in the draft Treaty, then about to be finalised. <Col N="1859" /> The two major shortcomings I highlighted were the inherent lack of democracy and openness and the inadequate provisions for regional and social solidarity. In the months that followed, leading up to the June referendum, I argued for rejection of the Treaty on the grounds that its shortcomings in those two areas were so great that it should be rejected and renegotiated.  I maintained then that the Treaty and the Delors II package, by which we were handing over what power we had left, failed to deal with the issues concerning ordinary people, failed to concern itself with poverty and unemployment, and failed to offer reassurance to the tens of millions of people across Europe in insecure and low-paid employment that conditions would improve or that they would even be sure of what they currently had.</P>
    <P>In arguing that case, my party came up against almost the entire Irish political establishment &mdash; in the broadest sense of that term &mdash; who ridiculed the notion that one could be pro-Europe and opposed to the Maastricht Treaty.  With the benefit of hindsight, I have no hesitation in claiming that our position has been vindicated by subsequent events here and elsewhere in Europe.  I note that in Ireland in recent months some of the sheep have tentatively detached themselves from the Maastricht fold, having discovered hitherto hidden defects.  Elsewhere, hitherto visionary statesmen are wondering what went wrong.</P>
    <P>The issue is quite simple: the Maastricht Treaty was negotiated behind closed doors by a closed circle of technocrats and Euro-enthusiasts who, deluded by a combination of elitism and self-interest, felt that anybody outside their circle would not properly understand or recognise what was good for them.  That lack of exposure to the reality of daily life &mdash; in other words, the lack of democracy &mdash; meant that when the treaty was put to the test it did not have enough to offer in the way of solutions to the economic and social problems of the real world.  Democratisation is, therefore, inextricably linked with and complementary <Col N="1860" /> to other measures in the economic and social sphere.  It is not and should never be regarded as an optional add-on.</P>
    <P>Whether or not the Maastricht Treaty is ratified by the United Kingdom or Denmark, in whatever way it is finally ratified, we still need a new treaty to rectify the glaring shortcomings which have been recogised, if not admitted, and to prepare for enlargement to include the EFTA countries that are seeking entry to the Community.</P>
    <P>Having botched the present effort, the Council of Ministers should not be allowed the freedom to do the same again.  As a first step in this process an Assizes of the Community's 13 parliaments should be convened along the lines of the Conference of Parliaments which met in Rome in November 1990. That meeting should be charged with redirecting and giving fresh impetus to the integration process and laying down guidelines for a further intergovernmental conference to be convened in 1993, which should have completed their work by the time of the European elections due in 1994.</P>

      <P>I shall begin my conclusion by saying that apart from a new treaty we need also a constitution, which should be drawn up by the European Parliament and should be submitted for ratification to the national parliaments. That constitution should include a fundamental principle that all legislative deliberations be carried out in public and that at whatever level power is exercised it should be subject to effective control by and only with the approval of directly elected parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the House to defer approval of the legislation before us, not as a means of second-guessing the decision of the people in relation to the Maastricht Treaty but as a means of recognising that <Col N="1861" /> things have changed since the people voted on the Maastricht Treaty.  If for no other reason than as a negotiating stance we should say that we will not proceed further with the ratification of the Treaty until the Cohesion Fund is in place and until there are genuine steps towards democratising the institutions &mdash; genuine steps towards democratising the common foreign and security policy areas.  These are essentials if the European Community is to survive in a coherent fashion and not break down &mdash; as seems to be happening &mdash; into many regional conflicts and issues of self-interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this important Bill, which puts into Irish law the appropriate elements of that Treaty.  Much of Deputy De Rossa's contribution was confined to what will not be part of our law but is part of the Treaty.  I wish to comment on the contributions by the two Deputies whom I heard, Deputies De Rossa and Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of Deputy De Rossa and his party to the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and their views on the Treaty took me by surprise.  This group, who are relatively intelligent and whom I found to be occasionally pragmatic, at times found themselves rather uncomfortable with their position.  Even the attitude of Deputy De Rossa tonight &mdash; one of &ldquo;let us postpone it, let us try to dress it up a bit more&rdquo;&mdash; showed his party's opposition was not wholehearted. The Democratic Left Party's position seems to be based on a fear of Europe and of our capacity to make an influence in Europe.  By contrast, the tradition of Fine Gael has been very much pro-European. By and large we recognise Europe as a place where we can influence, perhaps over and above what our size might merit, the existing structures.  Indeed, some of our personnel have played very significant roles &mdash; Deputy Garret FitzGerald stands out in that context &mdash; in speeding up the process of deeper union.  It is strange that on the occasion when the President, whom the Democratic Left so wholeheartedly supported, <Col N="1862" /> addressed this House, she spoke on the themes of our ability to face into Europe, to take our Irishness, our priorities, our desire to see development in certain ways in defence and in social issues and to back them from the inside rather than hold back and be afraid to participate lest we would not be able to influence matters in the way we would wish.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the remarks made by Deputy Quinn in relation to the element of the Treaty that deals with policy and development cooperation and the Minister's remarks on Somalia. Somalia is the most moving aspect of the deep crisis facing Africa and the bulk of the African Continent.  It is a matter of grave concern to any of us who has taken an interest in development matters that in recent months there appears to be, in the face of this deepening crisis, talk of a change in policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers &mdash; and I am sure I can anticipate the remarks of Deputy M. Higgins in this area &mdash; I urge the Minister to do a number of things at European level.  The most important of these is to oppose any attempt to reduce the level of aid.  I would urge him to point out how indefensible, how anti-European and how anti-commitment to world order any principles of justice such a movement would be at a time when the need has never been greater in Africa and in other parts of the world, as evidence in Somalia, where the problems are so far from being resolved despite being in the public domain for so long.  I pay tribute to the Minister for his efforts in Somalia and I look forward to the budgetary input of the Government to redress the declining balance of our financial commitment as a means of underlining our sincerity. I am aware the Minister has made public statements in relation to this issue.  If we are in a position to influence a budget we have a publicly stated commitment which will be honoured.</P>
    <P>In the context of continuing uncertainty about the overall process of ratification I have no information about the debate taking place in the British parliament today.  We know there are moves afoot to resolve the Danish situation.  It <Col N="1863" /> is important for us to use this opportunity to ensure that we learn from our own referendum campaign the real concerns that emerged, those expressed by the President when she addressed the House and those felt more extensively and which almost led to the defeat of the Treaty in other member states.  I share with Deputy De Rossa concern about the manner in which the referendum debate was presented to the people.  The question of the near bribery of the cohesion funds and the take it or leave it approach &mdash; if we are not in we are out &mdash; did no justice to those of us who are seriously committed to Europe and who see Europe as a place which means much more than the attitude which was presented and which coloured the debate.  However, it is a testimony to the good sense of the Irish people that they could analyse and assess what Europe has meant and how positive it has been for Ireland.  The Fine Gael Party are entirely committed to the European process.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty is effectively an amendment of the Treaty of Rome.  We are amending legislation effected by a substantial part of the Treaty.  For me it involves a deepening of a relationship which, by and large, has brought substantial benefits to Ireland.  I thought many times throughout the referendum campaign that people ought to have concentrated on the contents of the Treaty &mdash; this book which I was prone to wave around at public meetings.  It is not the terrifying document which Deputy De Rossa tried to present it as; 75 per cent of the Treaty relates to pragmatic measures all of which would be welcomed and would not be controversial in most parts of the country.  The bulk of the Treaty concerns establishing a proper economic union.  It means ensuring that our workers have equal rights, that our training, policies in the areas of agriculture and fisheries, transport etc., are recognised.  These are areas of policy on which there could be no divergence and it is in our interest to have those links deepened.  I share the Minister's analysis that what has occurred in the intervening <Col N="1864" /> period indicates how vital it is for us to continue apace with the process of economic and monetary union and how important it is for us to have a European Central Bank that can have some influence on monetary policy and which does not leave us at the whim of the Bundesbank as is the case at present.</P>
    <P>During the currency crisis we called for moving rapidly so that we would have a direct influence on the economic and monetary policies affecting us so greatly and where our influence at present &mdash; as Deputy De Rossa rightly said &mdash; is through the indirect forum of whatever we can do at a Council of Ministers meeting.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me deeply in the debates that took place concerning the Treaty was the latent nationalism which I see as the alternative to European development.  We have to examine what the legacy of Europe has been for us over a quarter of a century and even longer if we go back to the development of the Council of Europe. By comparison with previous decades the main difference has been peace.  We in the western world might come to think of peace as being the norm.  Events in Eastern Europe have again shown the potency of nationalism.  We have seen the quality of their lives and their structures torn apart by civil war.  I see it with my children who always felt wars were always at a distance, they were as far away as the Gulf and in places they did not know.  Now that they are on the European Continent we must never forget the lessons of the early part of the century. In a particular way the Irish are very sensitive about the power of nationalism and how easily it can reassert itself.  While the Danish &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Europe was based on a positive nationalism much of the debate in other countries is about a very narrow nationalism, protecting self-interests. Taken a step further we could see those destructive forces becoming a feature.  Unlike Deputy De Rossa, I see a commitment to Europe as a defence against that.</P>

      <P>The Irish experience of Europe has been a positive one financially and it has brought about changes, some of which were difficult.  There has been a transformation of the quality of Irish life.  Those who liked dancing at the crossroads may hark back and say a certain quality of our life has gone.  As a modern Irish woman, much of what is good came to me and people on social welfare, from Europe, over the heads of elected parliamentarians.  Ministers were dragged screaming, so to speak, to reform many of our laws in the areas of equal rights for women, proper treatment for social welfare recipients, social legislation and standards for environmental protection.  Our involvement in Europe has brought about substantial improvements in these areas.  There is a great difference between Ireland and Denmark in terms of how we view Europe.  For example, the Danish standards in many of these areas are in excess of the European standards.  The debate on the Maastricht Treaty in Denmark was much different from the debate here.  Ireland's involvement in Europe has mainly had a positive effect on this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Maastricht Treaty will achieve so little; it is the ultimate compromise.  For example, the Social Chapter is in a kind of limbo. The British and Irish Governments have hidden behind the Social Chapter and played the same game.  There is a resistance to the introduction of what I would regard as the best European standards for workers.  Instead of aping the UK's minimalist approach to the protection of workers and their rights, we should remember that well protected and well paid workers are more productive than under paid and badly protected workers who have a low morale.  I should like us <Col N="1866" /> to aim at the introduction of the best European standards for our workforce in terms of conditions and pay.  One of the reasons Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty was because of its conservative approach to social reform.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to defence, which I regard as a very difficult issue.  I accept the sincerity of the views of Democratic Left on this issue but Fine Gael have a very different view.  We believe that if something is valuable it should be defended.  That was one of the very emotive issues raised during the campaign on the Maastricht Treaty.  I remember a woman asking me at one of the coffee mornings I organised if I would like my three sons to be conscripted.  I told her that if something was worth fighting for I would fight for it myself.  I did not say this because I am in favour of war; rather I did not accept it as an argument.</P>
    <P>Europe has a major role to play in international politics as a force for good which is committed to the principles of democracy.  We should not leave defence to one major player, as is the case at present.  While we all share the objective of creating a nuclear free world and support non-proliferation activities, the reality is that many countries have nuclear power.  This makes the world a potentially dangerous place in which to live.  A European defence and security policy which is committed to the principles of democracy could have a very positive influence on the world.  Such a policy should contain a commitment to peace, democracy, defence and political co-operation.</P>
    <P>One of the ironic aspects of the debate on the Treaty on European Union &mdash; this is particularly so in Britain &mdash; is the belief that everything will be dragged into the centre.  Europe has attempted to make the Irish Government pursue a policy of regionalism.  During the last substantial tranche of European funding, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, rejected a request to devolve responsibility for the disbursement of a limited amount of those funds to local communities.  Europe has been much more committed to the concepts of devolution, <Col N="1867" /> regionalisation and subsidiarity than the Irish Government.  This commitment has again had a valuable influence on this country.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have a very positive view of our role in Europe and we look forward to the development of the Social Charter. We welcome more spending on education under the Treaty, something we have actively sought.  We share the deep concerns expressed about the inadequate powers of the Parliament and the need to move on this issue.  We believe that greater movement towards integration will help our finances and enable us to have greater control over our financial environment.  We also welcome the greater protection being given to the environment and the opportunity being given to us to become genuine citizens of the Community, whereby we can move and work freely in Europe, compete on equal terms and help in the development of Europe.</P>
    <P>We do not regard the Maastricht Treaty as the last word.  Fine Gael were founded under a treaty which we regarded as a means of achieving much more.  This is a further step in the development of Europe; it is not the last word and much more needs to be done. We welcome this Bill in that it goes some way along the road Fine Gael wish to travel in the development of Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few moments available to me I wish to concentrate on the matters upon which I am in agreement &mdash; I am delighted to think there is consensus on these &mdash; with other Members of this House.  Reference was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in an interjection to my visit to Somalia. I thank him for that.  I should like to put on the record my complete admiration for his initial visit to Somalia which was so important in jogging the conscience of Europe and the world about the tragic plight of the Somalian people.  His visit was very necessary, preceding as it did the visit of President Robinson.  I can tell the House that the initiative by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the <Col N="1868" /> presidential initiative, were widely and deeply appreciated in the villages and parts of Somalia I visited.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>This enables me to make a link to a point made by the previous speaker and the use of the word &ldquo;pragmatism&rdquo;.  As I see it, pragmatism is a tool of diplomacy. It is very important in foreign policy, which sets out the contours within which diplomatic practice functions and must serve, that the moral moment must be recovered.  The recent speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the United Nations represented a recovery of that moral moment in Irish foreign policy.  I welcome and salute that.</P>
      <P>I regret the departure of Ambassador Sahnoun from Somalia.  I deeply regret that the European Community has not yet established a permanent office in Mogadishu.  This is indefensible, disgraceful and shameful.  I am sure the Minister &mdash; the President is not in a position to speak but she may do so at some stage &mdash; shares my horror at the appalling obscenity of a country awash with armaments. We are discussing the ratification of a European treaty.  Europe is a process, and in that unfolding process our European partners will have to come to agree, perhaps under our leadership, that the production and distribution of armaments and their sale into a continent which is dying is one of the great immoral actions of contemporary history.</P>

      <P>I very much regret that this motion would appear to be the last Private Members' motion in this Government's term of office.  The issues are of grave importance nationally to over one million people.  It is a disgrace that the country is caught up in the instability caused by the Government rather than the issues which really affect the lives of people.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael have tabled this motion to highlight to the Minister and the D·il the serious crisis pending in the health services if the GPs operating the GMS scheme go ahead with their resignations from the scheme, operative from 8 December this year.  There are approximately 700,000 medical card holders, representing over 1.2 million individuals, all of whom are threatened by a loss of a health service if the Minister for Health cannot assure us that he is involved in realistic and meaningful discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the ICGP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action being proposed by over 1,000 doctors in resigning from their contracts with the GMS is unprecedented. Why is it that general practitioners, who by the very nature of their profession are caring and responsible for the lives and health of people, are considering withdrawing their services from the most vulnerable sector in society, the GMS patients?  GPs are one of the least likely <Col N="1870" /> groups to take such action unless they feel there is literally no other course of action which will highlight the seriousness of the problem within the GMS scheme.</P>
    <P>Individual doctors have expressed anger that the Minister and the Government feel they can play them along on the assumption that doctors will not turn away patients who require treatment. This of course, is true.  GPs have clearly stated that no patient in need of acute and emergency treatment will be turned away without care.  They have also made it clear that medical card patients will be seen, but in a non-emergency situation the options for these patients will be either to pay the doctor and seek reimbursement from their local health board or to seek approval from the health board first and the necessary money to pay the doctor before the visit.  Doctors who have threatened to resign their contracts will no longer be able after 8 December to issue GMS prescriptions and therefore private prescriptions will have to be taken to local pharmacists for dispensing and payment.  Medical card holders will either have to pay for the prescriptions, many of them extremely expensive, and seek reimbursement or have their prescriptions filled at health board clinics. Alternatively they could seek the money from the health board first before getting the prescriptions filled.</P>
    <P>From my discussions with various sectors of the IMO and the ICGP and individual GPs, I warn the Minister that the doctors concerned are deadly serious in their intention to have improvements made in the GMS system, so that patients under their care can receive the same quality of service that private patients can pay for.  The ICGP have clearly indicated that rather than continue to participate with departmental cost-cutting exercises resulting in falling standards of care, Irish GPs have voted to withdraw from what is becoming in their view a shoddy, discriminatory system for the less well off members of society.</P>
    <P>This is not a case of an Èlite section of society looking for a huge increase in their personal income.  I am sure the <Col N="1871" /> Minister recognises that this is the same group of medical practitioners who are loudly proclaiming that the investment required to provide a decent quality service to the least well off has not been forthcoming, as promised by the Minister's Government in 1989 when the old system was replaced by the capitation system of payment.  The annual budget of the Department of Health is approximately £1.7 billion.  Despite the huge number of our population dependent on the GMS for healthcare, only about 10 per cent of the total budget is spent on the GMS.  I recognise the very high cost of drugs but there are a number of ways that could be tackled.  The Minister has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister make a big issue of the amount of money being spent on healthcare, there is a trend throughout Europe and elsewhere to spend more and more of the government budget on healthcare.  This is a recognition by Governments that society should be able to provide a decent and adequate quality service for their people's health.  A healthy population will be more productive, more efficient, less depressed, less crime ridden, more caring, particularly of their young and their elderly, and of course more long lived.</P>
    <P>I want to look at how the public health system we have now evolved. As I said at the beginning, prior to 1972 health services, medicines, etc., for certain income classes were provided through the old dispensary system.  This was, as one doctor put it to me, a &ldquo;much hated system&rdquo; which created divisions in our society of the poor versus the rich. This is not to say that the doctors involved in the old dispensary system were not striving to provide the best possible care and attention for their patients but the structure of the system was inadequate, under-resourced and, of necessity, neither value for money nor providing the kind of quality service which our people have the right to expect.</P>
    <P>The transition in 1972 to the &ldquo;choice of doctor scheme&rdquo;, whereby people on medical cards could opt for a doctor of <Col N="1872" /> their choice, living in their own locality, brought a dignity and an equality into the provision of health care.  No longer would people, through unemployment, low income, etc., be so readily identified and separated from their neighbours.  With the introduction of the &ldquo;choice of doctor scheme&rdquo;, patients sitting in a doctor's waiting room would be entitled to and receive equal care, irrespective of whether they were personally paying the bill or not.  No one doubts the progressiveness of this move and any attempt to revert to the old system of segregation, as allegedly threatened by the Minister and his Department in this current debate, would be dreadfully regressive and would be fought tooth and nail by the medical practitioners and more importantly by the patients in the GMS scheme, who would be the losers.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the GPs were divided on the principle of fee-per-item or a capitation scheme, which would involve a single payment per annum for each patient on their list.  In the end, the system introduced involved a fee per item with a rejection at the time of a capitation system, part of which was specifically related to &ldquo;out of hours&rdquo; availability, special fees for night visits, emergency treatment and special services.  Some GPs now argue that it was this rejection of the capitation system at that stage that was the start of their current problems. However, be that as it may, the fee-per-item system operated until 1989, when following intensive negotiations, the capitation scheme was introduced with a built-in three year review.</P>
    <P>With the introduction in 1989 of the capitation scheme, doctors would now be eligible for a proportionate pension upon retirement based on their payments into the pension scheme, they would be entitled to special grants to upgrade their practices, payments towards provision of nurse and/or secretary, study leave and locum payments for holiday leave and most importantly, there was a commitment on the part of Government for investment in the GMS scheme generally.</P>
    <P>Before the acceptance of this capitation <Col N="1873" /> system, the doctors were assured that their incomes would not drop as a result of its introduction.  However, let us look at the actual facts since 1989, as outlined by the IMO: there has been an average 25 per cent reduction in gross income for doctors with no change in list sizes; as in fact, in 1992 evidence is there that there will be a drop of 40 per cent in income since 1983; and of the £45 average payment received for a particular category of patient, a doctor will receive only £21 per annum before tax.  The 27 per cent withholding tax, which the doctors accept they must pay like anybody else, is deducted from all payments to doctors before those payments are made and this has the effect that doctors are paying, first of all, tax on part of the repayments which are not eligible for tax and which they have to claim back and, second, that they are paying their tax in some instances three years ahead of the eligible year.</P>
    <P>I would like to read the Minister a letter I received from the wife of a general practitioner in the southern part of the country:</P>
    <P>In theory the retention tax may sound feasible, but in practice it is utterly unjust.  The continuous deductions are actually payments, or in our case, overpayments of income tax by monthly instalments of up to three years in advance.</P>
    <P>The Government has this continuous interest free loan from the GP which will not be repaid until the GP retires.</P>
    <P>The cost of this to the GP is high.  It results in the business having a continuous overdraft.  Large expenses like medical defence insurance and accountants fees are paid by bank loans.  All expenses are paid &ldquo;up front&rdquo; by the GP while any grants or subsidies paid by the Department of Health are paid in arrears and minus retention tax.</P>
    <P>In summary, as a result of the retention tax, GPs are taxed up to three years in advance.  Their working capital has to be funded by bank loans and <Col N="1874" /> overdrafts.  They provide a wonderful service but the frustration they feel as a result of this injustice is forcing them to strike action.</P>
    <P>That is from the wife of a general practitioner who has personal knowledge and experience of how the system is operating for them and the difficulties it is causing for them.</P>
    <P>Since the 1989 scheme no real investment has been made available for improvements of practices.  Payments for nurses and secretaries are made quarterly, which means that many doctors have to raise loans and fund such loans in order to pay their staff.  They cannot ask their staff to wait three months until they get their payments.  This has put huge pressure on many doctors, forcing some to get rid of staff or avoid hiring staff and use the unpaid services of their own spouses or offspring to assist in the practice.</P>
    <P>The system for applying for study leave has also been criticised.  It is so complicated and so slow that many doctors find it impossible to avail of this and, if they do, all the payments take so long that the doctors have &ldquo;out-of-pocket&rdquo; expenses.  Again, any payments are subject to 27 per cent withholding tax before the payment is made despite the fact that expenses are not eligible for withholding tax.</P>
    <P>The amount of money paid for locum cover for holiday leave is such that it costs doctor money to take annual leave.  At Question Time recently the Minister said that the holiday fund had not all been taken up.  The reason is that it costs a doctor to take holidays and pay a locum, the Minister probably knows that from his own experience in general practice.</P>
    <P>In February 1992, when the Minister was appointed as Minister for Health, he sought a meeting with the IMO as he had heard of the dissatisfaction of the GPs and their support for some kind of withdrawal from the GMS.  The IMO gave that hearing to the Minister based on a willingness to hear out a new appointee and, more important, on the understanding that here was a fellow medical <Col N="1875" /> practitioner who they felt would have a deeper understanding of the difficulties they were suffering.  At that meeting the Minister urged the doctors not to take the action they were proposing, not to sign withdrawal from their contracts until he had had a chance to commence the three year review of the 1989 capitation system and also the examine the possibility of the payment of an arbitration award of 17.5 per cent to the doctors irrespective of the three year review.  If the doctors agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will have a chance to correct me there, but that is the doctors' understanding and I have articles here in the doctors' newspapers indicating that.  An arbitrator agreed that they should have an increase in payments irrespecive of the three year review but again it was decided to leave that over while the review as going on.  The doctors agreed to give the Minister the time he sought but I know now from my own discussions that there is deep anger out there that they were misled by the Minister. All that has happened in the intervening time is that they have done without their arbitration award.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctors have alleged to me that they feel misled by the Minister and that all that has happened in the intervening time is that they have done without their arbitration award and that they have been let down by a fellow professional and by the Department of Health.  I am sure the Minister is still on the mailing list for the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> and the <i>Irish Medical News</i> and I am sure he sees that anger being voiced in articles week after week.  I want to stress most that in all these arguments and counter-arguments, the most important individual is the patient.  The GMS patients is entitled to a medical card by virue of a low income which makes him or her eligible for such a medical card. Because of that he or she is more likely to be at risk from illnesses associated with low incomes, poor housing, old age.  They are at risk from such things as depression, conditions resulting from poor nutrition perhaps alcoholism, colds, bronchitis, respiratory problems often associated with poor and damp housing conditions; and we know that over the last five years those poor and damp housing conditions have increased for very many of our medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A high percentage of GMS patients will also be single parents with the associated pressures on, particularly, young mothers with poor back-up service and, very often, no family support.  Urban doctors have indicated to me that there is a huge increase in the number of visits and surgery calls being received, particularly from this latter section of medical card holders.  A young mother under 20 living in single room accommodation with a small baby will very often pay three or four visits a week to a doctor or make three or four calls to the doctor to visit her at home because of fear, very often, and lack of experience in minding a small baby.  Very often the local GP is the only back-up care service that she can call upon if her baby is perpetually crying or staying awake or generally unwell. Very often the GP has to intervene to <Col N="1877" /> ensure that the baby is treated properly and is not maltreated because of pressure on the mother.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the number of times the doctor will attend such a patient, the payment per annum is extremely disproportionate to the commitment involved on the part of the doctor.  I know the Minister will have been one of those doctors who was totally committed to his patient but we cannot abuse that caring nature.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, before handing over to some of my colleagues, I want to say that the full responsibility rests on the Minister's shoulders to sort out his problem with the doctors.  Regardless of whether this Government fall in the next few days the Minister cannot shirk that responsibility because he will still be the Minister during the interregnum.  I urge the Minister to realistically discuss with the IMO what his proposals are to improve the GMS with the prime objective of ensuring that the service is patient friendly, efficient, value for money and delivering the highest possible quality of service.  If we can get the service doing all that, then both the patients and the doctors will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The Minister should never forget, and I am sure he does not, that without the service of more than 1,500 doctors in this country we could not provide a health service to the 1.2 million people who depend on the public health system.  I equally use this debate to call on the doctors' representatives to have a full and clear understanding of the difficulties in this country and the need for them also to have realistic and attainable objectives. With such openness in the debate and discussions a solution can be found to the problems facing doctors and patients under the GMS.</P>
    <P>If the GMS system collapses from 8 December next there will be chaos with regard to the provision of public health services.  I appeal to the Minister not to introduce any interim scheme under which young hospital doctors or doctors who are out of work would be employed which would lead to allegations such as <Col N="1878" />&ldquo;IMO to get tough on scab GMS doctors&rdquo; being made in the medical services.</P>
    <P>Many thousands of people fear that they will not receive medical treatment when they need it.  Doctos have been forced to indicate to repeat prescription holders that they will not be given a repeat prescription from mid-November as they will be invalid if doctors resign from the scheme.  The other day a person with a serious heart condition and asthma telephoned me to say that she needed about £120 worth of drugs each month and does not know what she will do when she has to renew her prescription in mid-November if the doctors withdraw from the GMS scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us tonight during this debate what these people should do.  He must have contingency plans if he does not think he will be able to resolve the problems confronting him.  He must surely realise that if the GMS system collapses the emergency services in hospitals will come under pressure.  Given the additional costs that will be incurred and the difficulties confronting the hospitals already due to the reduction in the number of beds and long waiting lists, the Minister will save nothing if he allows the system to collapse. As he is aware, the hospital doctors have indicated already that they will not be able to cater for medical card holders if they pour into the accident and emergency departments of hospitals in their hundreds.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it would be far better if he recognised the legitimate case for more investment in the GMS system not because this is what the doctors are asking for but because it is required if we are to meet the needs of patients and to ensure that we do not return to a situation where it is a question of rich versus poor in the delivery of health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Already in this House today, and rightly so, the appalling plight of the people of Somalia and other trouble spots in the world have been highlighted but in endeavouring to meet our responsibilities worldwide we sometimes <Col N="1879" /> tend to forget about the people on our own doorstep.  At a time of tribunals, Government crises and other international events it seems to have been forgotten that a problem is festering which will affect many thousands of underprivileged people.  We have a forgotten people and a hidden Ireland and during the next few weeks thousands of medical card holders and their dependants will become more anxious and fearful in relation to the impasse between the Minister, his Department and the IMO.</P>
      <P>Much lip-service has been paid to the community care service down through the years by successive Ministers and it remains the Cinderella of the health services. Over 50 per cent or £700 million of the annual budget is allocated to the hospital services but these services are inefficient.  In addition there are long waiting lists and widespread abuses about which the Minister has spoken, yet done very little about them.  On the other hand, the community care service is highly efficient.  Since 1989 1,578 doctors have been employed on contracts at a cost of £56 million per annum to work from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. Indeed, if they are unavailable they have to provide a substitute.  This is a cheap service and it is underdeveloped and underfunded.  The Minister has a responsibility to look after these doctors.</P>
      <P>Very few complaints have been received under the GMS during the past 20 years.  While we have received many complaints about the quality of the service provided in our hospitals only rarely do we receive a complaint about a general practitioner who has been negligent.  I submit that the general practitioners have been the unsung heroes of the medical services for far too long and have been taken for granted.  I believe that they are right not to take it lying down and have a right to receive a fair salary for the service they are providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the capitation system was introduced the income of general practitioners has dropped.  Statistics show that £56 million is paid to general practitioners each year while £100 million is paid out <Col N="1880" /> on drugs alone.  I put it to the Minister that instead of screwing the general practitioners to the wall he should attempt to reach a compromise with the FICI.  Even though the cost of drugs is escalating, once the National Drugs Advisory Board approve of a drug it can be prescribed immediately under the GMS, irrespective of the cost involved.  It would be far better if the Minister came to grips with the problem of escalating drug costs rather than to try to pin down the level of income for general practitioners who have been to the forefront of the medical services down through the decades.</P>
    <P>It is more than likely that an election will be held during the next few weeks and amid all the excitement, hype and competition between the political parties there are people who feel aggrieved, who feel they have been forgotten and that they have been let down by the Government. Many a word will be spoken about this matter in the heat of an election campaign but at the end of the day it is in the Minister's hands.  I hope that tonight the Minister will send a signal of hope to those people.</P>
    <P>The IMO now realise that they were ill-advised to advise their members to agree to the present system.  In realising their mistake I hope the leadership of the IMO will enter into realistic negotiations with the Minister.  In recent days I have spoken to a number of general practitioners. Indeed, this matter was debated at the meeting of the Southern Health Board yesterday when concern was expressed by all members.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there will be chaos in the weeks ahead.  In her contribution Deputy Owen outlined the position in detail and it is up to the Minister to try to reach a settlement.  I hope that before this debate concludes tomorrow night he will bring forward realistic proposals to resolve this dispute.  Even as we speak secretaries and assistants in general practitioner practices around the country, about 1,000 in all, are being served with protective notice.  This marks the beginning of the process of winding down the service.  As I said at the outset, this will affect the most vulnerable, the elderly and the sick, <Col N="1881" /> in our community.  Despite the political crisis we have a responsibility to look after these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter tonight.  I do not have to give the Minister much detail on health matters but very often the responsibility of being a member of the Government outweighs that of other immediate considerations.  General practitioners carry out necessary work and provide employment in areas where jobs are very scarce.  They are in the front line of medical care.  Unfortunately, in many cases these people are seldom appreciated until they are no longer there.  There is no doubt that down the years general practitioners have, to a certain extent, been taken for granted by the public and the Department of Health.  They are very dedicated people who are often called to emergencies outside normal hours of work; in that regard their hours are similar to those of politicians.  Seldom if ever have general practitioners refused to answer a call even though they may not be on duty at the time.  I am convinced, as are most members of the general public, that these are responsible people who are not taking action lightly and without full consideration of the consequences.</P>
      <P>In recent years the workload of general practitioners has increased considerably. This is mainly due to action taken by the Department of Health.  There is a policy at present to transfer psychiatric patients back to the community, and this is a welcome approach, but in many cases it is the general practitioner who has to take on the extra work of caring for these people.  A balanced approach should be taken on this matter.  The Department of Health must bear in mind that general practitioners do very necessary and important work in caring for people who were previously in hospital care.  By transferring these people to the community they have a better chance of getting back to health and living a normal life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of pointing out to the Minister the almost criminal attitude taken by the Department <Col N="1882" /> of Health in regard to waiting lists. In the Midland Health Board area, people have been waiting for orthopaedic surgery in Tullamore Hospital for two to three years.  Surgeons in that hospital are overworked and are under great pressure. General practitioners have to take on the work of caring for people who are in severe pain while waiting for surgery. These people contact politicians to see if they can speed up their operations but little can be done, as surgeons are under severe pressure.  I know that plans are in progress but they are long overdue.  I would stress to the Minister the urgency and importance of this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards terminally ill patients who are cared for at home, here again the general practitioners has to be call on a regular basis to these people who in other circumstances would be cared for in hospitals or State institutions.  Due to overcrowding in hospitals patients are released early and the general practitioner is called in to care for these people also.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in recent years great pressure has been brought to bear on young people due to examinations, unemployment and so on. This results in psychological complaints which again are dealt with by the general practitioner.  In latter years the workload of the general practitioner has increased and the nature of the work has changed dramatically.  I would ask the Minister and the Department of Health to consider this matter now as these problems should not be allowed to escalate.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;D·il …ireann</P>
      <P>&mdash;notes the recent arbitration award to doctors in the General Medical Service involving a significant increase of 17.5 per cent, implementation to be negotiated in the context of negotiations for the renewal of the 1989 Agreement;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1883" />&mdash;notes that the review of the GMS Contract has been under way for some time and that, in that context, the Minister for Health has brought forward innovative proposals for the development of general practice which take account of the realities of the budgetary situation and the constraints of the pay provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress;</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;regrets the decision by the Irish Medical Organisation to withdraw from the scheme while the review is continuing; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;calls on the Irish Medical Organisation to withdraw its threatened action and to continue negotiations in good faith in a normal atmosphere free from the threat of withdrawal from the existing Contract.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this motion regarding the current discussions with the medical organistions on the future of the GMS.  I sometimes feel that in the intensity of discussions such as these, there is often a danger that we may lose sight of the fact that the patient should be our primary concern at all times.  Therefore, let me assure Deputies, at the outset, that while I am confident of a successful outcome to these discussions, in the event of this not happening, the health boards will ensure that free general practitioner services and free drugs and medicines will continue to be available to persons covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>It may be helpful to Deputies if I outline in some detail the background to the present discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners on the existing contract for GMS services.  These discussions are taking place in a review of the services which is chaired by Professor Tom Murphy.  This review commenced in March of this year.  The 1989 contract, which is the subject of this review, represented a fundamental change in the manner in which general practitioners <Col N="1884" /> were paid in respect of services for medical card patients in that it changed from a fee-per-time system to a capitation based system augmented by a range of additional benefits.  This change resulted in an estimated 16.5 per cent increase in GP costs.  The bulk of these additional costs were attributable to:&mdash; a superannuation scheme (with a state contribution of 10 per cent of gross capitation income); payment of out-of-hours consultations; contributions towards the cost of employing nurses and secretaries; contributions towards locum expenses for annual/sick leave, study leave and maternity leave; early retirement arrangements; a doubling of the rural practice allowance and payment for a range of special services which had not been paid for before.  Almost 100 per cent of doctors providing GMS services opted for this new style contract on the basis that it would be reviewed after one year and in March 1992.  They all signed the new contract.</P>
    <P>A review of the first year's operation and the new contract was completed in February 1991 between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation under the independent chairmanship of Mr. John Horgan.  This review covered both the service and financial consequences of the new system and clarified aspects of the original agreement at a further additional cost of about £4 million which was met in 1992.</P>
    <P>Last year GMS doctors claimed an increase on all fees of 40 per cent to be paid retrospectively to 1 July 1989.  Their claim was heard at independent arbitration in December 1991 and the arbitrator recommended, having regard to the very detailed case made by the Irish Medical Organisation, that these fees should be increased by 17.5 per cent with effect from March 1992 a date which coincided with the three year review of the existing contract.  He further recommended that the implementation of the award should be negotiated in the context of that review.  The Irish Medical Organisation formally accepted the arbitrator's recommendations on behalf of the GPs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> This award would cost an additional £11 million per annum, which would represent an average of almost £7,000 per doctor per annum, which would be due to be paid on the same basis as all other public service pay awards this year i.e. payment of revised rates on 1 December 1992 and retrospection from 1 March 1992 to be paid on 1 January 1993.  The cost in 1993 of implementing this award, including retrospection payments, would be £20 million and the award would increase the average annual payment for doctors in the GMS to about £41,500. This average payment would, of course, only be in respect of the treatment of medical card holders who represent about one third of the population and would not take account of the potential private income available to general practitioners from the population not covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the present GMS contract provides for a review of its operation after three years.  This review commenced in March this year.  The Irish Medical Organisation are represented on the review with the Irish College of General Practitioners, the health boards and the Departments of Health and Finance.</P>
    <P>At the outset it was made quite clear to the doctors' representatives that the review would be required to work within the parameters of public pay policy and that the main purpose of the review was to ensure: that a high quality of service was available to medical card holders; that the arrangements for the delivery of services to medical card holders were appropriate, adequate and cost effective; that structures were in place to allow for: the proper management and organisation of service, the control of costs and quality, with particular emphasis on the achievement of responsible prescribing, the effective co-ordination of the service within primary care services generally and effective working arrangements with other general practitioners, with hospitals and other institutional services; that the framework within which general practitioner services were provided for the total population was rational and cost <Col N="1886" /> effective in respect of the use of State resources.  The review, therefore, would deal mainly with the organisation and funding of general practice rather than simply the payments to doctors.</P>
    <P>Since the review commenced, there have been regular meetings both at plenary level and at sub-committee level which have dealt with a wide range of issues such as: the development of general practice, the organisation and management of general practice, prescribing in general practice, workload and expenses, right of entry to the GMS and rural practice.  There has been very constructive dialogue on these issues and broad agreement in principle on the way forward has been reached.  I assure Deputies that it is my intention to push ahead with the work of the review with a view to resolving outstanding issues through meaningful discussions within the next month.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, I have had many years experience in the health services before I became Minister for Health.  In that time I became convinced that many of the difficulties faced by Governments in meeting the increasing expenditure on the health services result from the major imbalance between the primary care and the acute hospital services. Health care delivery in this country is over reliant on the hospital sector where the emphasis is on expensive high technology medicine.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt, in my mind, that a great number of procedures now being undertaken at hospital level could be more appropriately and cost effectively carried out by the general practitioner. It is my aim, therefore, to redress this imbalance and to restore the general practitioner to his rightful and central place in the delivery of health care within a fully integrated health care system.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I see the development of general practice as a necessary and key requirement for the development of our health services.  As part of this development it is necessary to broaden, where appropriate, the scope and depth of the general practitioners contributions to primary care and to improve the interface <Col N="1887" /> between general practice and the rest of the health services.</P>
    <P>If general practitioners are to adequately fulfil the functions they are capable of fulfilling, the general practitioner service must be integrated with other health services to enable it to function as an integral part of the work of the health board in patient care.  I also accept that doctors in general practice provide 24-hour cover for 365 days of the year and restructuring of general practice must take place to take account of this unique service.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the difficulties in developing general practice stem from the fact that general practitioners, from an organisational point of view, are separate from the formal structure of the health services, and from lack of structural liaison between general practitioners, management and other sectors of the health services, due no doubt to the fact that they are private contractors to the health services.  They contract to provide this service for general medical services patients, as opposed to the position in Britain where they are fully paid by the State for their services.  As the House will know, here the medical card system caters for approximately 34 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>In more specific terms organisational and service problems arise from, first, the fragmentation of general practice and the isolation of general practitioners.  Fifty-nine per cent approximately of general practitioners operate from single-handed practices with 15 per cent only operating from practices with three or more doctors, making it both difficult and costly to fund desirable developments. For example, general practitioners often work isolated from other general practitioners, or from community care services and hospitals.</P>
    <P>Other problems arise from the lack of epidemiological data relating to disease process and morbidity within the community in addition to the lack of a defined practice population.</P>
    <P>Since there is no definite list of private patients, the general practitioner in many <Col N="1888" /> cases does not know what his total practice population is in terms of either numbers or named patients.  In the past, research in Dublin has shown that approximately 11 per cent of families with young children reported not having a G.P.  A similar percentage attending at Dublin hospitals Accident and Emergency Departments recently reported having no G.P. at all.  In the Dublin setting at least, the general practice population is not stable and a proportion of patients do not closely identify with one G.P.  They freely change from doctor to doctor and practice to practice.  To add to difficulties in practice organisation, in a proportion of families different members attend different doctors and practices.</P>
    <P>Then there is the variation in practice styles.  Variable issues include those aspects of the service with which the doctor is comfortable in dealing; what a doctor wants to do and level of investigation within practice.  The setting of the practice, whether suburban, inner city or rural and the socio-economic profile of the panel also affect practice style.</P>
    <P>Both sides in the review have accepted that general practitioner services should be organised in such a manner that they are capable of delivering a comprehensive level of primary medical care. It has also been accepted that if general practice is to fulfil its full potential: patients must be satisfied that the service available at all times is of a standard that normally avoids the necessity for them attending hospital particularly as a first point of contact; and the service must be seen to be capable of providing care. Therefore, patients and other health carers need to be assured that there is ready access to a general practitioner service which is appropriately equipped and which has satisfactory liaison arrangements with other health services.</P>
    <P>Essentially, therefore, we need to shift the focus of health care delivery away from expensive treatment in hospitals to the primary care services and, more particularly, to general practitioner services. However, before such a reorientation can be achieved, the <Col N="1889" /> organisational problems within general practice need to be addressed.  In this connection, I am satisfied that, if general practitioner services were organised properly, many of the shortcomings identified in the General Medical Service could be overcome; costs and workload would be reduced and funds freed up to allow for investment in the service.  These are the reasons a high priority is being given to a resolution of these organisational issues in the current review.  In attempting to meet my objectives for general practice, I would envisage that a number of different practice models would be introduced as follows:</P>
    <P>First, group practice in urban areas and towns would normally be staffed by a minimum of three doctors in full partnership providing cross-cover for nights and weekends within the group and working from an appropriately-equipped medical centre.  Within this centre, there would be facilities for doctors, practice support and other primary care services such as paramedical and social services. Such medical centres would either be provided and equipped by health boards or on a joint venture approach with general practitioners within agreed parameters. The level of equipment and facilities to be funded would be subject to agreement with the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>Second, multi-centred group practices would apply in both urban and in rural areas and would involve either: (i)  a minimum of three doctors working as a group in full partnership from different locations i.e. a doctor who resides and practises in an area would enter into a full partnership, providing cross-cover, as above, with two or more general practitioners in the neighbourhood.  While each would have their own centre of practice, the group would have one central medical centre which would have equipment and facilities available to all members of the group, either by doctors practising there for specific planned sessions or by equipment being borrowed by GPs for fixed sessions.  Equipment would be interchangeable between practices on the basis of agreement with the <Col N="1890" /> group; or (ii)  any number of doctors who are located in proximity to a general hospital entering into a co-operative-type arrangement.  All doctors in the arrangements would continue to operate from their own centres of practice but would agree to pool all resources, including staffing and equipment, and to provide full cross-cover.</P>
    <P>Third, where group arrangements are not workable, for example in isolated areas, one or two-handed practices would be recognised and supported by the provision of incentives, provided arrangements acceptable to the health board are made with other practices for night and weekend cover.  Access to equipment in group practices by these doctors would be encouraged.</P>
    <P>In the case of all these arrangements it is recognised that a general practice requires support structures such as nurses, secretaries and access to sessional arrangements for various paramedical services and to a range of diagnostic and treatment facilities.  Of course, the range of support structures necessary would be dependent on the type of practice arrangement entered into.  I should say that, whenever a doctor would be given a grant towards the cost of a practice nurse, he would be paid in respect of the proportion of his practice only applicable to medical card-holding patients.  He would not be paid a full secretarial salary if a proportion of his patients only were general medical service patients.  Many doctors who never had secretaries before availed of the grant but, of course, incurred extra costs because they were provided with a proportion only of the secretarial salary in respect of their medical card patients.</P>
    <P>A major portion of expenditure within the general medical service scheme relates to the cost of prescribing which in 1991, amounted to £120 million and which we expect to rise to over £130 million by the end of this year.  As a result of the agreement drawn up between the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries and my Department, drug prices have remained stable here over the past two years.  Notwithstanding that stability in <Col N="1891" /> prices, expenditure on prescribed drugs within the general medical service continues to rise as a result of increasing volumes of drugs being prescribed and the substitution of newer, more expensive drugs for older cheaper ones.  These trends are an international phenomenon and are not unique to this country. Nevertheless they place heavy demands on the Exchequer and limit the scope for investment in general practice.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted by the Irish Medical Organisation that the level of prescribing within the scheme could be reduced without any adverse effect on the quality of patient care.  It has been agreed also that indicative prescribing targets should be determined for all doctors participating in the scheme, that is, indicative prescribing targets which are realistic.  I readily admit that indicative prescribing targets were set for doctors, I think two years ago, which were totally unrealistic and which created great problems for them.  Realistic indicative prescribing targets should be determined for all doctors participating in the scheme and a proportion of any savings generated from the operation of these targets should be applied toward general practice development.</P>
    <P>I also hold strongly that a greater contribution toward the development of the public health services could be derived from other sources.  In fact I would be very confident that such an increased contribution would materialise very shortly. I am heartened by the level of goodwill shown by the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioner representatives towards the establishment of measures aimed at achieving rational prescribing.  I am confident that, arising from this review, workable arrangements will be put in place which will introduce more cost-effectiveness in this area.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, therefore, my main priorities in the GMS review are the strengthening of the role of the general practitioner to enable a comprehensive primary care service to be provided for persons <Col N="1892" /> covered by medical cards; improving the interface between the general practitioner and the hospital and other institutional and community services; encouraging the development of more group practices and better cross-cover between existing practices in order to enhance the continuity of care for patients; and implementing measures which will result in safe and cost-effective prescribing.  As I said these priorities deal with the service issues including the adequacy of the funding for general practice rather than simply payments to doctors.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the major role played by general practitioners in the overall provision of health care and I have been anxious in the review, to identify areas where their contribution could be enhanced in a cost effective way.  Proposals have been put to the doctors which will significantly improve the quality and standard of general practice.  Deputy Owen accused me of not bringing forward proposals.  I would suggest that she listen to me.  Of fundamental importance is that these proposals offer general practitioners, for the first time, a central role in the day-to-day functioning of primary health care services at both national and local level.  I advise Deputy Owen to read the blueprint for general practice which emanated from my office.  She would learn a great deal.  I see these proposals as representing a blueprint for the development of general practice here over the next decade and I envisage that future GMS contracts will fit in with the strategy outlined in this blueprint.  It is certainly encouraging that we have now reached a stage in the review process where agreement in principle has been reached on these proposals which I am glad to say both sides accept will be a major step forward for general practice. We should have a little less r·mÈis and a greater understanding of what is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone pays tax.  I would, however, accept the need for investment in the capital development of general practice if the policy objectives which I have already outlined are to be achieved.  As I stated, if general practice is reorganised, it will be possible to relocate resources for the development of the service and the blueprint for general practice being discussed in the review sets out how this will be done.</P>
      <P>In addition to the discussions on organisation and service development issues, considerable importance has been attached in the review to the broad area of the maintenance of standards in general practice.  This is an area of particular concern to the Irish College of General Practitioners whose valuable contribution to the review process is very much welcomed by me.</P>
      <P>While proper organisation and satisfactory conditions of service are very important factors in ensuring that quality of care is maintained at a consistently high level, professional training and updating of skills represent an equally important requirement.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that it we are to refocus health care delivery towards general practice, patients must have total confidence in the professional competence of their family doctors.  Given that the largest group of students qualifying in medicine gravitate towards general practice, it never ceases to amaze me how little attention is given to this specialty at undergraduate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the plus side, however, at postgraduate level, a general practitioner vocational training programme has been in operation here since 1972.  Together with the continuing medical education scheme, these schemes, which are supported by my Department and the health <Col N="1895" /> boards, are vitally important if we are to ensure continued efficiency, effectiveness and morale in general practice. I share the college's wish to see these schemes properly co-ordinated and placed on a firm footing financially and I am confident that we will reach agreement on this important issue as part of the review.  I am conscious of the wish of the IMO and the college to have a national forum for general practice where issues such as standards and manpower requirements would be examined.  I consider that it will be possible to provide for such a forum within the organisational proposals which have been agreed in principle in the review.</P>
    <P>My approach to the current GMS review discussions is similar to that of the doctor in the treatment of his patients. The doctor must establish the patients clinical history, carry out a full clinical examination, make a diagnosis and decide an appropriate treatment.  Similarly, in the review we have analysed what has been happening to date in the operation of general practice with particular reference to the GMS; we have identified the shortcomings and their root causes and we have put forward proposals for overcoming these shortcomings. We put forward proposals for treatment.  To approach the problem in any other fashion would inevitably result in further frustration on the part of both general practitioners and management and a recurrence of similar difficulties one or two years down the road.  I want to avoid such a scenario at all costs and to put in place an agreement based on firm foundations.</P>
    <P>My objectives would be, therefore, to reorganise and develop general practice along the lines I have outlined and create a general practice development fund of the order of £10 million from resources freed up from an agreed drugs strategy in the GMS and a greater contribution from other sources towards the development of the health services.  I have got agreement to use this fund specifically for the development of general practice on the lines proposed.  Another objective is <Col N="1896" /> to establish a specific general practice unit in the Department to oversee and monitor all aspects of general practice. The unit's staff will include a general practitioner medical officer who will be employed on a fixed term full-time basis. The unit will administer the practice development fund.  The unit will also identify areas where general practitioners could cost-effectively perform work which is being done in other areas of the health service and develop policy for the development of the service: I can see these GPs carrying out health promotion programmes on a community basis throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a specific general practice unit in each health board whose staff will include a general practitioner is another objective.  This unit will have a specific earmarked budget within which they will be required to identify a specific development fund.  It will be concerned with all aspects of general practice including service delivery, practice support, drug budgeting and practice development. Guidelines on the operation of these units will be issued by my Department. The thrust of these units will be developmental in so far as their primary function will be to identify and correct the infrastructural deficiencies and shortcomings in general practice at the moment.</P>

      <P>I know that, but I am correcting my Department.  My figure is 960.  The Department say approximately 1,000 but I am saying 960 because I know it and 960 doctors currently participating in the GMS scheme have served notice of their intention of withdrawing from their GMS contracts with effect from <Col N="1897" /> early December next unless progress is made in the review in meeting their aspirations.</P>
      <P>In the light of what I have said, I am sure Deputies will agree that every possible reasonable effort is being made in this regard within the parameters set by public pay policy.  My commitment to the development of general practice is well known.  With the negotiation now at a crucial stage, let me assure the House that I will continue to seek solutions to the outstanding issues.  My objective is to reach agreement with the IMO within the next month on my proposals and I am confident that I will have the goodwill of the doctors in meeting this objective.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would again take the opportunity to allay any fears that might exist among medical card patients and to assure them that free general medical services will continue to be available to them from December.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen mentioned the case of an acute asthmatic but doctors have said that any person with an acute illness such as that need have no fears.  Doctors and the IMO have gone to great pains to assure patients that they will not be deprived of medical care.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 a general election was precipitated by health issues when the then Minister for Health, Mr. Desmond, refused to accept, and was supported in this by his Labour colleagues, a Health Estimate that would begin the process of cutting health expenditure.  Mr. Desmond resigned because of the consequences that policy would have for our health services.  The election was held and during the campaign the largest party currently in Government fought mainly on the health issue, festooning the country with billboards that have gone down in political history.  These carried the message: &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.&rdquo;  On, as it transpired, the fraudulent basis that that party would not do anything to damage the health services but would, in fact, begin the process of building up and improving them, they were given a mandate; they did not get an overall majority, but enough to form a minority Government. What happened subsequent to that mandate has gone down in the annals of infamy.  On assuming power that Government <Col N="1900" /> set about dismantling the health services.  Within weeks of coming to office the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, set about closing beds and hospitals and laying off health workers, putting in train a sequence of events that has damaged the health services from that day to this.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there was another general election during which the Taoiseach of the day admitted that he was unaware of the effects of the health cuts.  Again, a health issue precipitated that election and some Members may remember that the issue related to fair compensation for haemophiliacs who had become HIV positive or who had contacted full blown AIDS as a result of receiving contaminated blood. The intransigence of the then Minister for Health and the then minority Government in their refusal to grant adequate compensation to that group of people, was the final shot which brought down that dreadful Government in 1989.</P>
    <P>We are here again tonight addressing an issue which is of great importance to the health of every citizen of this nation. The motion ought to provide a useful and valuable opportunity for Members of this House to highlight a growing crisis that exists in a vital sector of our health services, the General Medical Service.  It might have been possible for us to convince the Minister for Health of the extent of the crisis and the necessity for him to take immediate steps to resolve it but, unfortunately, this debate is taking place in a totally unreal atmosphere.  The Government have been totally discredited by their own actions.  As we speak, they are toppling from one political crisis to another.  Seldom in the history of this State has there been such an unedifying, disreputable and undignified run-up to the collapse of a Government as we have witnessed in the past few days.  By the time we vote on this motion tomorrow night &mdash; if we reach the stage of voting on it &mdash; the D·il will be on the brink of dissolution and the nation will be facing a general election.</P>
    <P>The Government need expect no comfort when they seek a mandate from the people.  Since they have come into office <Col N="1901" /> they have demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the pain and suffering their health policies have caused. Increasingly, they have shown nothing but contempt for the ordinary and valued democratic processes.  They have no capacity, and probably never had, to address, in a manner that would mean something to the many thousands of families they are supposed to represent and support, the economic and social difficulties facing this nation.</P>
    <P>The coming election may well be fought around the issues which have dominated today's headlines &mdash; Government credibility, honesty and decency, the so-called character issues which in recent days and weeks have played such a prominent part in the American presidential election, but I say to the Minister of State, that the minds of the electorate will turn very quickly to the economic and social challenges I have mentioned. Very high, if not the highest, on the list of real issues that will dominate the coming election and the concern of the electorate will be the decimation of the health services that we have witnessed over the last six years.</P>

Complacent Ministers, such as yourself, have sat in those seats before only to understand reality when they were forced to knock on doors; that reality is not long away from you, Minister and your Government.</P>
      <P>The monument to your Government can be measured in terms of long waiting lists, cutbacks in treatment and entitlements and the closure of essential facilities for old people, children and mothers. It would be an insult for anybody to come into this House and suggest otherwise. The complacency, indeed, the arrogance is an insult to those who are dependent on the general medical system and the health services in general.  In cold statistical terms the continuing health care crisis can be summed up in the financial problems facing each of the health boards.  It is worth putting on the record of the House, perhaps, for the information of the Minister of State, that every single health board faces a substantial overrun currently.  I will give the Minister of State the figures for the first half year.</P>

      <P>I will put that to the test now.  I will quote some figures for your information and for the information of Members of the House.  For the first six months of this year deficits for the health boards are as follows: the Southern Health Board, £2.216 million; the NorthWestern Health Board, £0.5 million; the Mid-Western Health Board, £0.95 million; the North-Eastern Health Board, £0.895 million; the Western Health Board, £0.243 million; the South Eastern Health Board, £0.946 million and the Midland Health Board, £0.375 million.  I do not have the exact figure for the Eastern Health Board because they did not supply the figure, but I understand it is well in excess of £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Altogether, there is approximately £11 million in overruns in the health boards' expenditure for the first half of this year.  That can only be described as an interest free loan commandeered by the State at the expense of each and every health board, ultimately at the expense of the services that this House charges those health boards to provide, and that, increasingly, simply do not exist.  Orthodontic treatment, hip replacements or such services that are available are now becoming rare increasingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those figures take no account of moneys already owed by health boards. They amount in total to a major burden of debt which is crippling the effectiveness of health boards today and will continue to do so in the future.  It makes salient reading to look at the minutes <Col N="1904" /> of health board meetings.  If I may say, through the Chair, it would be instructive reading for the Minister and the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which we discuss the crisis in the general medical service.  There is no point in the Minister telling this House that the allocation for the general medical service has been increased this year.  The reality is that for most of the last five years the allocation has been systematically cut by the Department in real terms.  The only reason behind the increases in expenditure has been that the demand-led schemes operated by the general medical service have been stretched beyond breaking point.  This has happened because of the other cutbacks within the health care area.  The pressure has now been put on the GMS.  It is a classic case of the sick subsidising the sick.  As geriatric beds and hospitals are closed, more pressure is put on the GMS system and the local doctor to meet needs that were previously met by other elements in the health service but which are no longer available because they have been discontinued by the health boards due to lack of money or directly by Government action.</P>
    <P>The problem is now compounded by the dispute involving general practitioners within the general medical service. It is all very well for the Minister to point to an arbitration award, as he did tonight.  In the normal course of events an arbitration award of 17.5 per cent would receive considerable welcome from general practitioners.  The difficulty in this case, as the Minister is aware, is that the award of 17.5 per cent is not the issue.  If the Minister was present, I would say to him, through the Chair, that as a former general practitioner he must be familiar with the cash flow problems from which many general practices suffer.  It is abundantly clear from discussions we have all had with practitioners around the country that the problems I have mentioned have been exacerbated for many practices by the retention tax that is applicable to all earnings under the GMS.  In other words, in the operation <Col N="1905" /> of the health services generally, the Minister is expecting sick people to subsidise other sick people.  The Minister expects general practitioners to subsidise the operation of their practices in so far as medical card patients are concerned from whatever income they receive from their private patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come as a surprise to some, perhaps to the Minister, that the Labour Party are aware of and concerned about the difficulties faced by general practitioners.  It is probably true that none of us knows very many doctors who are poor but we have a very fine GP service, one we are all proud of that we will seek to maintain and expand.  It is a service in which the people repose a great deal of trust.  It reflects very little credit on this Minister or this Government that they have done damage to that fundamental trust.  They have forced doctors into a situation that in the near future general practice services may only be available to those who can afford them. That is sad and unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current situation in the general medical services scheme, it is salient to talk of the difference that is now being made between private and public patients.  When the system was set up both types of patient were treated identically.  Whether a patient was fee paying or a medical card holder made no difference to the quality of care and attention they received.  Unfortunately, that is no longer the case.  There has been a change, particularly in relation to preventive medicine.  There is a number of procedures that those who are private patients would normally seek, such as, smears, cholesterol tests, smoking cessation programmes, breast examinations, etc.  These preventive measures, so important in modern medicine and available to private patients and accepted as routine, are now becoming increasingly rare for medical card holders.  The great paradox is that where they are needed most, that is, for those who are dependent on the GMS &mdash; mainly the unemployed <Col N="1906" /> and the elderly &mdash; they are least available and where they are least needed, for the more affluent elements of the community, they are most readily available.  That is a sad position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise tonight the proposed downgrading of the Mallow Road Garda station in Cork, which presently has two sergeants and nine gardaÌ.  The proposal is that one garda and one sergeant remain at the Mallow Road Garda station on a 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. six-day week basis, Monday to Saturday, and that the other sergeant and eight gardaÌ report on a daily basis to the Watercourse Road Garda station in Blackpool.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that this proposal is with the chief superintendent in Cork in order to solve a problem in the Watercourse Road Garda station.  The implementation of this proposal would transfer the problem from Watercourse Road Garda station to the Mallow Road Garda station.  The Mallow Road Garda station serves the catchment area of Whites Cross, Sunset Ridge, Monard, Parklands, Ballyvolane, Bride Valley View and Fair Hill in Cork city as well as the Mallow Road area itself.  The area has a large population of elderly people and many businesses there would feel very exposed to vandalism and robbery if the station were to be downgraded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal is all about the shortage of manpower in the Cork area. Implementation of the proposal would result in the whole catchment area that I have named being completely stripped of real Garda service and real Garda presence.  I hope that I do not hear the Minister say in his reply that the proposal is part of a move to reorganise Garda services in Cork to provide a better service to the community, because I believe truly effective Garda service to any community comes from the presence of <Col N="1907" /> gardaÌ in that area, with gardaÌ using the contacts they have and the relationships that they build up with the people.  The relationship is two-way: the gardaÌ protect the public and the public support the gardaÌ.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister tonight to tell me that he is rejecting the proposal as set out.  As I have said, it is my belief that the proposal concerns a lack of manpower in the Watercourse Road Garda station and that the problem would merely be transferred to Mallow Road Garda station from Watercourse Road Garda station. Watercourse Road Garda station provides Cork Prison with escort and patrol services.</P>
    <P>It is a sad indictment on the system that this kind of proposal be made, especially in view of the results of a recent survey carried out by myself as my party's urban affairs spokesman.  From a 600 person survey carried out in my constituency in the city I discovered, to my amazement, that 50 per cent of those who were affected by crime in the past four years did not even bother to contact the gardaÌ about the matter because they felt that the gardaÌ had neither the resources nor the manpower to investigate minor crime.  That is a sad indictment on the manner in which Garda resources are stretched to the limit at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do two things: to immediately veto any proposal to downgrade Mallow Road Garda station and to give an assurance tonight that he will give adequate Garda manpower to the services in Cork.  It is only by providing a service within the community that there will be an effective Garda presence and Garda service.  We do not want Garda service by remote control or from distant, centralised units.  It is only when gardaÌ live in the community and are with the community that they will be able to deliver a service.  There is great support for the gardaÌ in Cork, who are committed people; committed people who are stretched to the limit but are determined to protect the people whom they are paid to protect.  The Minister has it <Col N="1908" /> in his power to veto this unwise proposal and I ask him to do so.</P>

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner, who is responsible for policing arrangements in this jurisdiction, that the divisional officer in Cork is carrying out a review at present in the interest of providing the best possible service to the public.  As this review is not yet complete I am unable to say what effect, if any, it will have on policing arrangements for Mallow Road and Watercourse Road Garda stations.</P>
      <P>The current Garda strength in Cork city is 581.  Eight members of the force in the division have been released from clerical duties for outdoor police work through the employment of civilian clerical staff and I understand that this will be increased to nine in the very near future.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister of State for coming into the Chamber to reply.  I am very concerned about several decisions that have been taken by the Department in which an exemption from the study of Irish has not been allowed for children who have had some of their primary education outside Ireland.  I point out to the Minister of State that the <Col N="1909" /> current position is that all students are required to study Irish for recognition for grant and other purposes.  However, a child whose entire primary education up to the age of 11 years was received outside Ireland may be allowed to substitute any other subject from the list of approved subjects for Irish in order to make up the required minimum number of subjects to be studied.</P>
      <P>I have raised several issues with the Minister for Education in relation to children who have not been 11 years of age, although they have been almost 11 years, and have not been granted the exemption. I shall give two brief examples of what can occur.  One child I know of was nine and a half years of age when her family returned to Ireland.  Originally the Department of Education said that she was exempt from the study of Irish but she was later told that that was a mistake made by the Department.  Ironically, her brother, who was 11 years, was told that he was exempted from the study of Irish. The anomoly reminds me greatly of the school transport regulations under which some children under ten years of age get free school transport while children over ten years of age do not.  In this case, for two children of the same family one child was exempted from the study of Irish and the other child was not.  Just as from time to time the school transport regulations and other regulations are reviewed, the Minister should examine the issue of whether 11 years will forever and a day be the age at which a cut-off point is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give another example of where a child returned to Ireland and the family language was Spanish.  This child had to learn English as a first step, before going on to study Irish.  At eight and a half years of age the child had to begin to learn English in junior infants in a national school.  At 13 years of age that child is now studying Irish in a secondary school. I regret to say that what is happening is that families who can afford it arrange for private tuition because of the regulation. This is very expensive and some families cannot afford it.  I would ask the Minister to review the regulation regarding the <Col N="1910" /> age limit of 11 years concerning children who have received some of their education outside the State.  If a student cannot cope with Irish at junior certificate level, perhaps the Minister would consider having that student exempt from the study of Irish in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne, Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter.  I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department of Education's position regarding this question.</P>
      <P>Rule 46 of the Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools provides that a child whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland may be allowed to substitute any other subject from the list of approved subjects for Irish so as to make up the minimum number of subjects necessary to constitute an approved course.  Otherwise, all pupils in primary and post-primary schools are required to study Irish.</P>
      <P>Although not formally stated in the rule, the practice has been to allow exemptions in certain other cases, mainly of physical and mental handicap.  An exemption from Irish granted by the Department, although only intended for the period of a pupil's secondary education, seems to be accepted by the universities, the Garda SÌoch·na, the Army, nursing and other professional bodies as a basis for exempting aspiring entrants from their own language requirements. However, Irish would for obvious reasons, be essential for teaching in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>The present rule can be a hindrance to returned emigrants in that, if their children were at school before emigration, for however short a period, they must, on return, study Irish, no matter how old they are.  This aspect of the matter is causing some concern and the general position is under consideration in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are numerous instances of children of returned emigrants successfully taking up Irish at a <Col N="1911" /> comparatively advanced stage of their school career and acquitting themselves well in the leaving certificate.  At foundation level, the junior certificate Irish course attempts to cater for pupils who have not previously studied Irish.</P>
    <P>Apart from the special position of Irish as the national language, the acquisition of another language and the effort it entails are educationally desirable in that they help to develop understanding. Monoglots, in speaking, reading, writing and thinking easily glide over ideas and facts which a bilingual person has by necessity to really concentrate on and comprehend.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, on balance this particular problem warrants closer examination and I am glad to inform the Deputy that measures have already been initiated to alleviate this matter.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in, mind the Minister would be only too glad to have it fully investigated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said repeatedly in this House it would be difficult to find a more anomaly-ridden scheme than the higher education grants scheme.  I have asserted time and again that while increases in the income qualifying thresholds are welcome in themselves they are, in many cases, illusory.  When translated into hard reality they mean very little indeed because they are based on gross rather than net incomes and, therefore, the amount of real relief is marginal.</P>
      <P>Essentially, income threshold increases constitute a tinkering with the scheme rather than a real root and branch reform.  Indeed, in many cases such tinkering with the system can only serve to make it more complex and inequitable. The Minister for Education's revision of the higher education grants scheme this year was welcome in itself but is a classic example of making an already complicated and bad state even worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a case of a young student, the daughter of a small farmer, who did first <Col N="1912" /> law in 1990-91 in University College Dublin.  She qualified for a higher education grant last year because the interest-free payments on their capital borrowings was allowed.  The family in question have 25 acres.  They had the foresight to see that their only hope of survival and making a living was to borrow and intensify, otherwise it would be a case of packing up, getting out and drawing the dole.  They borrowed from the bank and invested in five mushroom tunnels.  It is hard, backbreaking work, demanding many hours of hand-on management. Most of the profits go towards paying back the bank &mdash; the capital repayments and the bank interest.</P>
    <P>Last year the student qualified for her grant because the interest repayments were allowable and deductible.  This year the guidelines were changed and the interest repayments are disallowed and, therefore, the student has lost her grant. The family are now trying to pay back two loans simultaneously &mdash; the loan for the mushroom houses and the other to educate their daughter.  The irony of it is that in calculating the grant in question the interest is allowable for income tax purposes and is deductible.  Therefore, one arm of the State &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; are operating one set of guide lines and the Department of Education &mdash; another arm of the State &mdash; are operating a completely restrictive and more punitive guideline.  Another irony is that if the family in question had actually applied for the dole this would have been allowable under the heading of expenses necessarily incurred in running the farm for the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>Why the Department of Education should seek to introduce such a discriminatory, anti-farmer change this year is beyond me.  It is particularly difficult to understand when it was done under the guise of that much heralded improvements in the higher education grants scheme with the so-called principle of equity being trumpeted as one of the primary guidelines and <i>raisons d'Ítre.</i> What is relevant to a farmer, or to anybody else for that matter, is the actual income that remains after essential input <Col N="1913" /> costs are looked after.  That is all that really counts at the end of the day.  That is why profits which are ploughed back for essential development purposes should be allowable for higher education grant purposes, the same as for income tax or for social welfare purposes.  That is why investment for pollution control or interest on borrowings for pollution control control should be allowed.  That is the reason wages paid to a family member &mdash; which is creating employment &mdash; should be allowed, particularly for members of families who are not drawing social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, as the Minister of State knows full well, is going through a rough patch, but it is still one of the cornerstones of the economy and is still one of the high density employers.  It is an area which is fundamental to this country and is one which will give employment provided we invest in it.  Obviously agriculture can never absorb the outflow of population from the land.  It is fair to say that members of agricultural families have the same right to education as everybody else.  The Minister should ensure that such farm families get a fair crack of the whip.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture, to carry out a root and branch reform of all third level grants &mdash; ESF grants, higher education grants and vocational education committee grants &mdash; to try to unravel once and for all, the labyrinth of restrictions and regulations, of thresholds and guidelines which exist.  In the interim I ask the Minister to take on board those proposals which were very eloquently put to the Minister by the Irish Farmers' Association approximately ten days ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Higgins for raising the issue and I am happy he did so.  It affords the Minister for Education an opportunity not only to clarify the position about interest on borrowings for capital purposes when determining reckonable income for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme but also to <Col N="1914" /> review the major reform which, to date, he has introduced in this area.</P>
      <P>Let me state at the outset that interest on borrowings for capital purposes has never been taken into account as a deduction when determining reckonable income under the higher education grants scheme.  The Minister made no change in this regard in this year's scheme.  In fact capital expenditure of any nature is not allowed as a deduction in computing reckonable income for grants purposes, and capital cost on pollution control, farm buildings etc. are, accordingly, not allowed for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The Minister's main concern with the 1992 higher education grants scheme was to address the very urgent matter of income eligibility limits.  He is happy that he has achieved his objective in that regard with an unprecedented increase in the limits, of up to 40 per cent in some instances.  Other major income-related improvements which he also introduced in this year's scheme include: an increase of £2,000 in the income eligibility ceiling for each child after the first attending third level education: the assessment of income eligibility by reference to current income and current income limits, rather than as heretofore the income limits of the year of sitting the leaving certificate examination.  This removed an anomaly which was seen as being particularly invidious; the exclusion of the social welfare lone parents' allowances from income assessment for grant eligibility and provision for mature students who are not dependent on their parents to be assessed on the basis of their own incomes and, where appropriate, that of their spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also eliminated another bone of contention by deciding that the 1992 scheme would apply to all first time entrants to approved third level institutions in 1992 regardless of when they sat their leaving certificate and would apply to both existing and new mature students.  All these improvements were made not only in the grants scheme administered by local authorities but also in the scholarship scheme and ESF grants <Col N="1915" /> scheme administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Department have been doing their utmost to ensure that the new schemes are put into operation as effectively and as speedily as possible by the relevant vocational education committees and local authorities and towards that end have been holding seminars, issuing follow-up assistance and clarification, etc.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to emphasise that State expenditure on student support for fees and maintenance is currently running in excess of £75 million with more than half of all students holding grants or scholarships.  He is, of course, conscious that the grants schemes are still far from perfect and that various matters including the matter of determination of reckonable income need to be examined and refined further.  These schemes are the subject of ongoing review by his Department and all relevant factors are being taken into consideration in the preparation of the schemes for next year.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that the IFA and other farm organisations have made a very strong case for changes.  I understand that the scheme is under review at present.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle.  This matter relates to the need for an office in Carrick-on-Shannon to which farmers can go to get their livestock headage administered. County Leitrim is the only county in the country which does not have such an office.  Following the dissolution of the Land Commission office space will become available in Carrick-on-Shannon. It is appropriate that a headage office should be opened in County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years farmers in County Leitrim have had to travel to Sligo to get their cattle and sheep headage administered.  Due to the way the headage payments system has been operated over the past number of years many farmers have run into difficulties in filling in their application forms.  Farmers who have made minor mistakes in filling in their forms have been deemed to be fraudulent.  Many farmers find it difficult to fill in the application forms.  County Leitrim is entitled to a headage office.  I appeal to the Minister to adhere to my request to open a headage office in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Currently both the livestock and veterinary schemes for County Leitrim are administered through my Department's office in Sligo.  This facilitates farmers as they can obtain information and get queries answered on both matters from the one office.  My Department have an office in Carrick-on-Shannon from which farm development and Land Commission functions are carried out.  This office is quite small and it would not be possible to accommodate the staff dealing with County Leitrim veterinary and livestock issues in this office.  To separate the two functions would be administratively costly and provide an ineffective service to the farming community as frequently both sets of files are consulted when problems arise.  Consequently, I have no proposals <Col N="1917" /> at present to establish a livestock office in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  Over the past 25 years the Teagasc centre in Ballinamore, my home town, has carried out tremendous research for farm families in poor regions.  Unfortunately, when the Government came into office they introduced changes in Teagasc and took away the funding provided for research.  It was decided to make the centre in Ballinamore a &ldquo;transition&rdquo; or &ldquo;transmission&rdquo; centre &mdash; no one seems to know what it is meant to be.  The nine employees in the centre do not know whether they will have a future in this centre.  This problem has been ongoing for the past two years.  It is time these people were given proper projects to carry out; much research needs to be carried out on behalf of family farms in poorer farm regions.  I think the Government have said that they want to keep family farms in the west alive and viable. They are not backing up this claim by moving research stations to more prosperous regions.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position in regard to the Teagasc centre at Ballinamore, to give a commitment that it has a future and that the nine people working there will continue to carry out research and development at this centre over the next number of years.</P>

      <P>I first came across the work of the agricultural research centre at Ballinamore, County Leitrim, as a television journalist during the sixties. Since then I have admired the work carried out by that centre, particularly in the area of drainage and improving production in the poorer land in the west. The findings of this centre have made life that bit better for many small farmers. The results of this research have been put to practical use in farms in many countries outside Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of further research in this centre is under threat.  I was very glad to learn from the Minister for Agriculture, and Food, in response to a Parliamentary <Col N="1918" /> Question put down by me last week, that there was a proposal to establish a forestry grassland project in Ballinamore with EC funding.  I would welcome a definite promise from the Minister of State tonight that this project will go ahead and that the grassland aspect will not be submerged or regarded as a token of the forestry aspect.</P>
    <P>At present nine people are employed in the research centre administered by Teagasc.  This centre may not seem large by Dublin standards but it is very important to County Leitrim.  It is necessary to keep some form of farm research in the west to let farmers know that there is an interest and some confidence in what may be regarded by them, at best, as an uncertain future.  I am very thankful to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to make this plea on behalf of the Ballinamore research centre on what I thought would be the last day of the 26th D·il.  Of course, you, Sir, will be back, whatever about the rest of us.  I make a special plea to the Minister of State to avail of this relatively historic occasion to guarantee that there will be a future for the Ballinamore research centre, with increased activity.  If the Minister does this he will be remembered fondly by the people of that area.</P>

      <P>The structures and activities of Teagasc are currently under examination with a view to providing over the next decade, in a cost effective manner, the most relevant services required by the agriculture and food industry.

    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal to establish a forestry-grassland project at Ballinamore with EC funding is being examined by my Department in consultation with the Department <Col N="1919" /> of Energy.  The proposal aims to demonstrate how forest and grassland-based systems can best be integrated in farm practice.  This is intended to complement the forestry measures contained in the operational programme for rural development, such as demonstration farm forests, forestry promotion and publicity and farm forestry training, currently administered jointly by Teagasc and the Forestry Service of the Department of Energy.  The proposal is being examined to ensure that it is consistent with the objectives set out in the efficiency plan and it is not possible, at this juncture, to state precisely the future position of Ballinamore pending decisions in regard to the proposal.</P>

      <P>To be reclassified from less to more severely handicapped status, an area must be homogeneous, consist of poor land and have the characteristics of low farm incomes and heavy dependence on agriculture.  The results of the 50 per cent random survey of farms in these areas carried out by the Department of Agriculture in 1989 indicated that no area in north Kerry which is less severely handicapped met these requirements. The two requirements or criteria that (a) the average income of an area must be under 40 per cent of the average national family farm income and (b) that more than 40 per cent of the population must <Col N="1920" /> be engaged in agriculture discriminate against a county such as Kerry.  The national average family farm income is estimated at £6,900 a year.  Thus the average family farm income in an area must be under £2,760.  In a county such as Kerry with a high dependence on milk production, it is very difficult to meet these criteria.</P>
      <P>Over 230,000 acres in Kerry are still less severely handicapped.  Unless the criteria are changed before the review takes place, it is unlikely that any of this land will be reclassified, resulting in the loss of potential income for many farmers which would ensure their survival on the land.  I remind the Minister that over 5,000 farmers have left the land in Kerry over the past 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The control and monitoring of illegal fishing by all vessels, including Spanish vessels, is a matter of paramount importance to my Department.</P>
      <P>From my visits to fishing ports around the country I am very much aware of the grave concerns of Irish fishermen with regard to illegal fishing off our coast.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to resolving this problem and that I will continue to explore all possible means of achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>In an effort to address the problem, the upgrading of Ireland's surveillance operation is being assisted financially by the Community through a comprehensive surveillance programme envisaging expenditure of some £34 million covering the years 1991 to 1995.  Already one CASA aircraft, improved communication and data handling equipment and onshore transport and surveillance systems have been acquired.  The coming on stream last year of the new Casa aircraft, which is wholly devoted to fisheries surveillance, has greatly enhanced the State's overall surveillance capabilities. The Casa is deployed in supporting naval vessels in spotting and positioning suspect fishing vessels or fishing activity.  I have no doubt, therefore, that the effectiveness of our fisheries protection effort at sea will be further enhanced as more new equipment and technology being acquired by the Naval Service comes on stream.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the most effective means of combating illegal fishing is through strict enforcement of Community fisheries law at sea.  In this regard I wish to acknowledge the valuable work of the Irish Naval service in protecting fish stocks off our coast.  Last year a total of 85 boats was detained by the Navy for suspected fisheries infringements.  This year to date the number of boats detained stands at 72.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the current review of the Common Fisheries Policy, I have, as <Col N="1658" /> part of the overall strategy to improve our surveillance effort, sought an increased contribution to the costs of our fishery control programmes.  I am particularly concerned that a greater proportion of the overall financial burden of our surveillance effort should be borne by the Community on whose behalf we effectively monitor a massive area of water off our coast.  I will be renewing my efforts in this regard at Council to ensure that Ireland's surveillance burden is recognised in practical terms by the Community.</P>
    <P>It is also very important to acknowledge the progress made in recent times to co-ordining at Community level the fight against illegal fishing.  Following an initiative by Ireland at the Council of Fisheries Ministers, a co-ordinated plan of action against illegal fishing activity in Community waters has been agreed. Under the plan the member states concerned and the Commission agreed to cooperate at operational level in monitoring the activities of unauthorised fishing boats.  I am confident that these measures represent a major step towards enabling the control authorities in member states to establish the real extent of the problem of illegal fishing and will contribute towards finding solutions.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that, arising from this increased level of co-operation between the control authorities of member states, a meeting between the heads of control, on problems relating to surveillance, including the monitoring of fishing vessels, was held in Aberdeen within the last few weeks.  This was the first such meeting and represents a major advance in creating closer liaison and co-operation between member states in dealing with the Community wide problem of unauthorised fishing.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think it important to point out that arising from the current review of the Common Fisheries Policy, new proposals in relation to the Community wide control of fisheries have recently been tabled by the Commission. Over the coming weeks these proposals will be examined and refined at expert working group level and I am hopeful <Col N="1659" /> that before the end of the year, the Council will be in a position to adopt new measures that will re-inforce our efforts at national level against the activities of illegal operators.</P>
    <P>The developments both at national and Community level, that I have outlined, underline the current acceptance within the Community as a whole of the need to address in a meaningful way the threat posed by illegal fishing operations. I am confident that progress is being achieved and that this will make a positive contribution towards the renewal of stocks that have been particularly affected by illegal fishing operators.</P>

      <P>A new Fishing Boat Register was established in 1990 in accordance with European Community requirements in order to get a more accurate picture of the Irish fishing fleet and to form a reliable basis for ongoing monitoring and management. The establishment of the new register was widely publicised throughout the industry and in the media, and in addition registered owners of vessels were advised in writing of the requirement to re-register their vessels.  The new register contains much more detailed information than the previous one and gives a more accurate profile of the fleet.</P>
      <P>For a boat to be eligible for registration on the new register one of the essential conditions was that the boat had been previously legally registered.  Therefore the creation of the new register did not provide any means of registering previously unregistered boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other means now to secure registration is first to be issued with a sea fishing boat licence.  The key requirement <Col N="1660" /> with the licensing of a boat not previously registered is that the applicant withdraw equivalent capacity from the fleet.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are a significant number of small boats which have been operating for a long time on an informal basis in the Irish fishing fleet.  I am anxious to find a means of regularising the position of such boats.  This is indeed one of the issues I am pursuing with the European Commission in the context of discussions on the multi-annual guidance programme for the period 1993 to 1996.</P>
    <P>When the guidelines for the Irish fleet for the medium term are settled I would hope to be in a position to progressively register small boats which have been in the fleet for a considerable period and prior to the introduction of the relevant replacement requirements.  I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that there would in equity be no question of giving special treatment to boats currently unregistered which entered the fleet subsequent to the replacement conditions being imposed.</P>

      <P>Legislation is at present being prepared to bring about a major reorganisation of commercial ports.  The new Harbours Bill, which will be designed to facilitate commercialisation, will: set up commercial State companies to manage the ports of Dublin, D˙n Laoghaire, Wicklow, Arklow, New Ross, Waterford, Cork, Foynes, Limerick/Shannon Estuary, Galway, Dundalk and Drogheda; provide for the reorganisation of port pilotage services; transfer responsibility for ports of lesser commercial significance to the local authorities; designate Dingle Harbour as a fishery harbour centre and provide for the designation of other fishery harbours as fishery harbour centres in the future.</P>
      <P>The new proposals are based on the main recommendations made to me by the Commercial Harbours Review Group.  I expect to bring the new legislation before Government in the near future and it is my objective to have the Bill published well before the end of the year.

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 22, 28, 53, 106, 107 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of the National Coastal Erosion Committee's report, <i>Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action.</i>  This is a valuable report in that it indicates the extent of the coastal erosion problem affecting the Irish coastline.  The report is particularly welcome in that it should help to raise the awareness generally about coastal and marine problems. It is estimated in the report that some 1,500 kms of Ireland's coastline of 5,800 kms is under threat from coastal erosion and that 490 kms require immediate attention at an approximate cost of £125 million.  The report also contains recommendations regarding the institutional and legal framework which might be adopted to implement a comprehensive coast protection programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment primary responsibility for coast protection rests with local coastal authorities, some of which have undertaken protection work themselves. Owners of private property have, of course, the major role in protecting their own property.  My Department's role is to facilitate the implementation of permanent protection schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.  To this end and in order to formulate a programme of coast protection works for the next few years, my Department wrote to all maritime local authorities last year requesting them to submit a list of priorities for coast protection projects which they consider would be warranted and feasible and for which they are prepared to make funds available.  It is expected that the outstanding proposals from county councils including Dublin and Cork will be submitted in the near future.  When all the proposals are received I will examine the options available to me within available resources and put in place a comprehensive national coast protection programme. When examining these proposals <Col N="1664" /> and when putting together the long term strategy I will of course have regard to the views expressed by the National Coastal Erosion Committee.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the reshaping of parts of the coast is an ongoing natural phenomenon.  Material is eroded from some locations and deposited in others, particularly during storms.  The removal of beach material is also a contributory factor to coastal erosion.  In this regard the Oireachtas has recently passed the Foreshore (Amendment) Act, 1992, which I introduced to protect and safeguard our valuable beaches and sand dunes.</P>
    <P>There is at present no EC structural funding for coast protection.  However, my Department has been successful in securing funding for coast protection measures under NORSPA and LIFE council regulations.  The funding has been obtained by way of a joint project involving my Department, EOLAS and the local authorities for Wexford, Waterford, Kerry and Clare.  The project title is Environmentally Friendly Coast Protection (ECOPRO).  A total of 900,000 ECU in grant aid is provided for over a two and a half year period.  The objectives of the project are, (i) to assess the vulnerability of the coast to changes (including erosion), (ii) to consider needs for protection (both now and in the near future), (iii) to examine the performance and environmental impact of existing coastal protection works including a demonstration project.</P>
    <P>The project also includes provision for grant aiding the construction of coastal protection works.  The site or sites of these works have yet to be determined. Their design and construction methods will be assessed under the project.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated there is no Structural Fund provision for coast protection in the present round of structural funds.  However, I will be pursuing the possibility of including coast protection for funding in the post 1993 period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the long term gauge records in County Cork I understand that this refers to the gauge at Glanmire Road in Cork Harbour which has been <Col N="1665" /> in operation since 1922.  The gauge is owned and operated by Cork Harbour Commissioners.  The commissioners have informed me that the harbour staff carry out such analysis of the record as is required for their purposes.</P>

      <P>The report of the D˙n Laoghaire Harbour Board has been endorsed by the Government.  The proposals in that report are an integral part of my policy for the development of Dublin Bay &mdash; a policy formulated following full consultation with all interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next stages in the implementation of the development plan for D˙n Laoghaire Harbour involves site investigation work, cost benefit analyses and other studies which are needed to underpin the expenditure set out in the Plan and to investigate the sources and costs of funds for the development.  The early completion of these works and studies which will be undertaken in the context of plans for the full development of port facilities in Dublin Bay as a whole, and the optimum development of both Dublin Port and Dun Laoghaire Harbour, is essential in the context of securing funding from Structural Funds for <Col N="1666" /> ferry terminal facilities in Dublin Bay. As a first step in the process I expect that it should be possible to initiate very shortly site investigations at D˙n Laoghaire Harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious that the staffing levels of all the fisheries boards have fallen significantly in recent years due to general restrictions on recruitment and to the take up by the board staff of the early retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the need to ensure that the fisheries boards are adequately staffed to enable them to fulfil their functions to protect, conserve and develop the important inland fisheries resource.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for the Marine I have been actively pursuing the filling of certain priority posts in the boards including supervisory posts.  It is necessary, in accordance with Govenment policy, due to restrictions on public expenditure, and by extension recruitment to the Public Service, to explore the possibility of filling these poses by redeployment from within the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 13 October last, I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have completed their restructuring of the customs and excise service and as a result of this they have identified surplus staff in certain areas.  They expect to be in a position to offer redeployment to these staff on a targeted basis.  It is expected that this <Col N="1667" /> process will commence in the very near future and I am hopeful of a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>With regard to supervisory staff, I am satisfied that existing staff resources are deployed by management in such fashion to ensure that the work of the boards is carried out as effectively as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for a major extension of Dunmore East Harbour in County Waterford in view of the serious congestion involving trawlers and pleasure craft.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious from recent visits to Dunmore East that there can be congestion of vessels berthing at Dunmore East harbour. This is a problem which is common to virtually all the large fishery harbours in the State.</P>
      <P>In an effort to relieve congestion at the harbour I recently arranged for the installation of five 17 foot pontoons at the west wharf of the harbour.  This development has been well received by the small boat fleet in the harbour.  I have no doubt that, with co-operation between the individual users at the port the maximum use of available berthage is possible.  However the overall berthage difficulties still remain to be addressed.</P>
      <P>One proposal at present being considered by my Department is the possibility of building up the existing breakwater and decking it to increase available berthage.  Substantial expenditure is necessary to achieve this and the proposal is being examined to determine if the additional berthage to be achieved from this exercise will justify the level of expenditure required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dunmore East is, as the Deputy will be aware, a designated fishery harbour centre with about 40 fishing boats based there.  This number is at present augmented by a number of large trawlers temporarily relocated in the harbour for <Col N="1668" /> the duration of development works at Rosslare Harbour.  Adding to this number are a visiting pelagic fleet during the Celtic Sea Herring season and a seasonal influx of visiting yachts.</P>
    <P>This large volume of traffic necessitates careful policing of the existing limited berthage in an attempt to accommodate all users.  However, I must emphasise that Dunmore East is a fishery port and, as such, fishing trawlers must be given priority for berthage.</P>
    <P>In addition to examining the need for developments to alleviate berthage I received a plan for improvements at the harbour from a locally formed development group.  My Department are examining this proposal with a view to incorporating it in the fishery harbour development programme 1993-1997 which will be submitted to the EC for assistance.  The plan will require careful study by the Department engineers.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that the infrastructure requirements of all fishery harbours, Dunmore East included, will be assessed and attended to as financial resources permit.</P>

Such licences are only issued on foot of comprehensive health certification from the authorities in the country of origin and where my Department's Fish Health Unit is satisfied that there is no disease risk.</P>
      <P>This longstanding policy is designed to safeguard the health of Ireland's fish and shellfish stocks, farmed and wild, by preventing the introduction and spread of serious diseases.</P>
      <P>In the context of the new trade conditions arising from implementation from 1 January 1993 of EC Directive on Fish Health, i.e. completion of the internal market while minimising the spread of fish disease within the Community, existing import restrictions with the rest of the European Community will be lifted, in line with the Directive provisions, and the free movement of live fish and shellfish between areas of equivalent health status will be permitted.</P>

      <P>Fifty-seven foreign registered vessels were arrested in Irish Waters by Irish fishery protection vessels since the beginning of 1992.  The countries of registration of the vessels in question were as follows; Spain 39, United Kingdom 12, Belgium two, France one, Holland one, Portugal one and Germany one.  Of these 31 were escorted to Castletownbere, five to Cobh, nine to Galway, four to D˙n Laoghaire, three to Rathmullen, two to Cork and one each to Clogherhead, Dublin Port and Skerries.</P>
      <P>I have had a schedule prepared outlining the specific information requested by the Deputy and I have arranged to have it circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Of those arrested, one vessel was released without charge and four were issued with warning letters.  Fifteen convictions for fishery offences were secured yielding fines totalling £260,641. However I would stress that the bulk of cases have not yet been heard by the courts and therefore remain <i>sub judice.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very encouraged by the initial take up of angling share certificates provided for under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1991.  Some 8,000 share certificates have already been issued.</P>
      <P>Sales of the new angling certificates have topped £90,000 bringing a matching £90,000 into the trout and coarse fisheries development societies.  Resources of the new angling co-operatives in 1992 will, therefore, exceed £180,000.  These funds are earmarked for local development initiatives including restocking and improvement of facilities such as stands and access to rivers and lakes.</P>
      <P>The performance this year is particularly welcome in that the individual societies were not fully up and running until the season was well under way.  In this regard I must commend highly the trustees of the societies who on a voluntary basis put such a major effort into getting the societies off to a successful start.  They have laid a secure basis for the new trustees who will be elected later this year to make greater progress in 1993.  I also see the eight new co-operatives playing an important role in the successful implementation of the major programme of job creation on the basis of the angling resource which the Government have approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of Roaringwater Bay as a shellfish growing area and of the considerable potential which exists for further development of the sector in the area.  I am confident that through the provision by BIM of financial and technical services together with the provision of support in the marketing area, further investment, additional employment opportunities and further growth in output can be achieved in the sector.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of EC Directive 91/492 on the health conditions for the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs, due to come into effect on 1 January next, a shellfish sampling programme is being undertaken by my Department with a view to finalisation, by December, of the classification of all areas, including Roaringwater Bay for shellfish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the licensing of applications for aquaculture development in the bay it is my Department's firm objective to regularise, by the end of the year, the considerable number of applications <Col N="1675" /> on hands.  This process, which involves the rigorous assessment of applications from technical and scientific perspectives and consultation with relevant local interests, is very far advanced.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in my Department's current fishery harbour development programme for infrastructural improvements at Roaringwater Bay. However, this programme is being updated to cover the period 1993 to 1996, and to this end all relevant local authorities were invited to submit proposals for harbour works in the fisheries interest, for which they are prepared to make funds available.  Cork County Council, in their submission to my Department, have included a proposal for the provision of a new pier and approaches at Roaringwater Bay at an estimated cost of £100,000.  All proposals received are currently being assessed by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has satisfied himself that sufficient funding is available to carry out the necessary research at Abbotstown Research Centre, County Dublin.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In that context I would like to refer the Deputy to Subhead C of my Department's Vote for 1992.  This subhead covers Marine Research and Development conducted at my Department's Fisheries Research Centre at Abbotstown, County Dublin and the Deputy will note the provision of £2.4 million for 1992 which represents an increase of 140 per cent over 1991 expenditure in this area.  In addition to this sum, salary and overhead costs for the Fisheries Research Centre are met direct from my Department's administration budget.</P>

    <P>The increase reflects the funding provision this year for my Department's measures under the marine sub programme of the STRIDE (Science and Technology for Regional Innovation and <Col N="1676" /> Development in Europe) Operational Programme for Ireland.  The expenditure is being 75 per cent funded by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The STRIDE Programme for Ireland gives particular, and very welcome, recognition to marine research and development and will allow for a total investment of £8 million in the area over the next two years.  The agreement of the EC to co-finance marine investment under the programme is a recognition of the development potential as well as the acknowledged need to apply additional resources to secure and develop that potential.  The planned total investment under the marine sub programme of STRIDE addresses the need to build up national capability in marine science and technology which will underpin further development in the sector including the fisheries and aquaculture sector.</P>
    <P>I am personally committed to strengthening the marine research capacities of the State.  As an earnest of this commitment the Deputy will be aware that I have now brought into being the Marine Institute which will focus all the efforts of the State to ensure that maximum economic and social benefits derive from expenditure in this area.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that Kinsale Harbour has a vibrant and growing leisure fleet.  Regrettably, however, commercial traffic at Kinsale has declined from 160,000 tonnes in 1986 to 96,000 tonnes in 1991 and there has been a similar decline in portal revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commercial Harbours Review Group, whose report was presented to me on 6 July 1992, addressed the present and future direction of ports policy and <Col N="1677" /> legislation for the commercial seaports. The review group recommended that responsibility for ports which cater for commercial traffic of less than 200,000 tonnes per annum and which do not cater for a significant level of seafish traffic be transferred to local authorities.  Kinsale Harbour falls within this category.</P>
    <P>In the consultations which I have had with all harbour authorities, I have stressed that I will listen very carefully to their considered views on the best way forward in the case of each individual harbour.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers involved a collision between the Irish trawler <i>Ainnir Ordha</i> and a Spanish registered fishing vessel, the <i>Nuevo Ebenezer</i> on 31 March 1991.</P>
      <P>Following the incident, Navy personnel boarded the two vessels concerned and interviewed crew members. A marine surveyor of my Department subsequently examined the vessel <i>Ainnir Ordha.</i>  The question of alleged ramming incidents involving Irish and Spanish fishing vessels in the waters off the south west coast was taken up with the Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>The appropriate form of redress in cases of collisions involving an Irish and a foreign vessel outside territorial waters is by way of civil action.  I understand that proceedings under civil law have been initiated by the owner of the <i>Ainnir Ordha.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the House I would like to outline the legal background to our national regulations governing collisions at sea.  The &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for ships moving in our territorial waters are <Col N="1678" /> contained in the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as amended.  The latter are implemented internationally on a uniform basis and that basis is enshrined in the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) Order, 1984, as amended by the Collision Regulations (Ships and Water Craft on the Water) (Amendment) Order, 1990.  Those committing wilful breaches of these regulations are guilty of a misdemeanour under section 419 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to two years under section 680 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  However, there is a difficulty in that the collision regulations do not apply to foreign-registered vessels where incidents occur outside our territorial waters.  The incident referred to by the Deputy occurred outside territorial waters.  In the circumstances the only option is to report to the maritime authority of the flag state concerned and this was done.  A basic tenet of maritime law is that the flag state is responsible for the regulation of its vessels' behaviour in international waters.  The response of the Spanish authorities was that they were anxious to help and would not hesitate to take action against Spanish nationals in situations where it could be shown that they had been culpable.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the State's powers in this area should be enhanced to provide a more effective remedy in cases such as this.  The Attorney General has been asked to examine this complex area of maritime law to see if any means can be found of overcoming the problem.</P>

      <P>My Department already provide substantial funds for the development of harbours <Col N="1679" /> which are not designated under the 1946 Act.  In particular my Department owns and manages five major fishery harbour centres at strategic locations around the Irish Coast, namely Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs.  Works at these harbours are funded directly by my Department.  I might add at this point that it is my intention to designate Dingle Harbour as the sixth fishery harbour centre.  As the Deputy will be aware, substantial State investment has been made in this harbour over the last few years and it is now one of our top fishing ports.  The necessary legislation is being drafted by my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department also grant-aids work at other fishery harbours, which are generally owned and maintained by local authorities.  The level of grant aid made available varies by geographic location. The east and south east coasts attract 50 per cent aid levels and the west and south west coasts attract 75 per cent aid levels.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently implementing a Fishery Harbour Development Programme which covers the years 1989-93.  The programme which was drawn up following consultations with maritime local authorities provides for the development of all the five fishery harbour centres owned by my Department as well as providing grant aid for a number of selected harbours, most of which are owned by the local authorities. The funds allocated to my Department are intended for capital development works at harbours rather than maintenance and repair works.</P>
      <P>Programme expenditure is financed by the Exchequer and attracts EC funding through the Structural Funds &mdash; the Rural Development Operational Programme &mdash; and an EC Structures Funding Mechanism (4028/86) which finances the provision of facilities at fish landing places.  The Fishery Harbour Development Programme 1989-93 involves the expenditure of £15 million pounds on infrastructural improvements at selected harbours, of which £7.5 million is being provided from the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> During 1992 the following works were undertaken at my Department's fishery harbour centres: Howth, County Dublin, design and commencement of auction hall construction; Killybegs, County Donegal, workshop construction; Rossaveal, County Galway, dredging work completed and pier construction underway; Dunmore, East, County Wexford, fencing erected, garage built and fendering survey completed; Castletownbere, County Cork, contract awarded to re-roof the auction hall.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure at the fishery harbour centres, works were also undertaken at the following fishery harbours in 1992: Greencastle, County Donegal, pier construction; Roundstone, County Galway, pier reconstruction; Dingle, County Kerry, harbour development; Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, site investigation completed; Clogherhead, County Louth, model study/site investigation; Carrigaholt/Doonbeg County Clare, survey/site investigation; Crosshaven, County Cork, site investigation; Darby's Point, County Mayo, site investigation; Duncannon, County Wexford, hydrographic survey/site investigation; Renard, County Kerry, ESBI report commissioned; Keelbeg, County Cork, design work completed; Burtonport, County Donegal, site investigation; Cleggan, County Galway, repairs to 1902 Act Pier.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently updating its Fishery Harbour Development Programme for the period 1994-97.  To this end maritime local authorities and harbour authorities were invited to submit proposals for harbour developments, in the fisheries interest, for which they are prepared to make funds available over the period of the programme.  The submissions received by my Department are currently being examined with a view to their inclusion in the new programme.</P>

      <P>D˙n Laoghaire Harbour is managed and operated by my Department.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>I regard the current review of the Common Fisheries Policy to be of paramount importance to the Irish fishing industry.  It provides an opportunity whereby the imbalance in the application of the policy as it applies to Ireland can be addressed.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the review I have targeted four key objectives: (a) increase in allocations of fish stocks to the Irish region; (b) the adoption of fleet guidelines for the Irish fleet consistent with the allocations of fish stocks made to the Irish region and the adoption of positive structural measures to support the development of the Irish fishing industry; (c) the extension of exclusive coastal zones to 12 miles or the adoption of other measures which would strengthen the protection afforded to inshore fisheries; and (d) the making by the Community of an increased contribution to the costs, including operational costs, of Ireland's fishery control programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting of the EC Council of Fisheries Ministers last April I made a <Col N="1691" /> major submission on these specific matters. My submission was examined at subsequent Councils on 9 June and 19 October as part of the review process and I have taken every opportunity, both at Council and in bilateral contacts with Council colleagues, to strongly press what I regard as our rightful entitlements in relation to the objectives that I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Proposals on the future of the CFP, which have been recently circulated by the Commission, are currently being examined.  My initial reaction is that they fall considerably short of what would be acceptable to Ireland, as they do not appear to address in any meaningful way the key issues that had been identified in my submission to Council.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to assure Deputies that any Commission proposals that fail to take account of the needs of our industry will not be acceptable to me.  I will continue, therefore, to forcibly argue Ireland's unique case for special consideration and to press the Commission to make a realistic response to the legitimate demands that I have tabled.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the widespread dissatisfaction being expressed by fishermen and organisations, he has any plans to introduce a new system of issuing sea fishing boat licences.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps explain that the objective of sea fishing boat licensing policy is to control and regulate entry into the Irish fishing fleet.  Boats wishing to enter the fleet must first be licensed under section 222B, as inserted by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983, of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constraints imposed by the Current EC Policy in respect of fleet capacity within the Community have necessitated the introduction into Irish licensing policy of a requirement that all applicants <Col N="1692" /> must provide 100 per cent replacement tonnage and horsepower in support of licence applications.  Under this policy, applicants must demonstrate that they intend removing from the current sea fishing boat register an amount of active tonnage and horsepower, at least equal to the tonnage and horsepower of the proposed new boat, in order to facilitate the entry of that boat into the fleet.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some fishermen may feel aggrieved, when licence applications are refused because of their inability to comply with the current licensing policy requirements.  I would stress, however, that any fisherman who feels aggrieved by a particular decision or who considers that he is now in a position to meet the policy requirements may request to have his case reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that in the light of our current difficulties with the EC Commission on the size of the Irish fleet, there can be no basis at this stage for any general relaxation of the present replacement policy requirements.</P>

      <P>A common position was achieved by member states of the EC during the Irish Presidency, on 29 June 1990, on the Second Life Assurance Freedom of Services Directive (90/619/EEC). The Directive is now due to come into effect in all the member states by 20 May 1993.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Directive is to provide harmonised rules throughout the EC governing the delivery of life assurance across EC borders by way of services without the necessity of the insurer establishing an office.  Prior to the adoption of this Directive, under the First Life Assurance establishment Directive (79/267/EEC), insurance undertakings had to be established in a member state in order to do business.</P>
      <P>The Second Directive stipulates that supervision of the insurer will be by the supervisory authorities of the member state where the risk is situated except in the case of life assurance commitments taken out on the initiative of the policyholder. The rationale behind the Directive is that these latter type of policyholders are willing and capable of choosing an insurer and safeguarding their own interests, whereas directly canvassed policyholders require the extra protection of the supervisory authorities of the member state of the risk.  This Directive is the initial step towards the complete liberalisation of the life assurance market throughout the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> The liberalisation process in the life assurance sector will be completed with the implementation of the Third Life Assurance Framework Directive.  A common position was achieved on this Directive by Council of Ministers on 29 June 1992.  The Directive is due to come into effect in all the member states by 1 July 1994.  Once implemented, life assurance undertakings will be able to operate freely in all member states either by establishing branches or by cross border services, supervised primarily by the member state where the head office of the undertaking is situated.</P>

However it does not require, nor is it my intention to introduce, a budget to coincide with the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Government has always been aware of the potential difficulties which economic union may pose for peripheral countries. It was for that reason that, as soon as the negotiations on European Monetary Union started, it submitted a series of amendments to the Treaty, designed specifically to cater for the situation of less-developed regions.  Throughout the negotiations, the Government continued <Col N="1703" /> to press this issue and was successful in securing in the Treaty a framework for effective and continuing Community action on cohesion.  That achievement is reflected in the Commission's proposals to promote cohesion &mdash; the `Delors II' package &mdash; which are, at present, under negotiation.  In the longer-term, the provisions of the Treaty will enable the Community's actions in favour of cohesion to be developed in parallel with the increasing integration of the Community. Against that background, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the conclusion of the Governor of the Central Bank in the statement under reference that, given appropriate support and policies, the process of economic union could on balance be favourable for Ireland.</P>

A decision to sell will depend on sale terms acceptable to the Government being agreed with an interested party.  As stated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government will consult the board of the company and the trade unions concerned if shares in a State company are being sold.  A meeting with the trade unions representative of the bank's employees will take place shortly.  In addition, the matter has been discussed recently with the Social Partners at the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> in line with Section V, Paragraph 84 of that Programme.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the measures implemented by the Minister to counteract the various forms of tax evasion, default, non-compliance and smuggling produced an overall identifiable yield to the Exchequer of just under £300 million in 1991, the latest year for which figures are available.  Seizures of illegally imported drugs valued at £10.3 million were also carried out in that year.  In addition to the direct yield of £300 million, the various compliance and enforcement programmes implemented by the Revenue Commissioners have an important role in protecting the overall yield to the Exchequer.  The total net receipt of taxes collected by Revenue in 1991 was almost £8,003 million.</P>
      <P>Details of the various anti-evasion measures are contained in Chapter 2 of the Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1991, copies of which are in the library.</P>

      <P>Wexford was selected by the Government as a centre for decentralisation on 12 June 1991 and it was subsequently decided that the Headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency and part of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners would be located there.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency headquarters is to be accommodated in Johnstown Castle outside Wexford town. The provision of accommodation for the new Revenue service is at present being considered in the context of overall Civil Service accommodation needs in Wexford town.  Officials in my Department in consultation with the Office of Public Works are reviewing the accommodation requirements of all Government Departments in Wexford town in tandem with the needs of the additional Revenue staff involved in the decentralisation programme. I expect to be able to make a decision in this regard very shortly.</P>

General policy in relation to travel in this country on board business by such chairpersons would be to allow payment of Civil Service mileage rates in respect of journeys reasonably and necessarily undertaken.</P>
      <P>In relation to the chief executives of these bodies, the policy is to apply the arrangements recommended in Report 30 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector. Under those arrangements the chief executive of some State bodies, mainly the commercial bodies, would be allowed private use of a company car without charge.  In the case of other bodies an annual deduction, equivalent to 20 per cent of the list price of the car, would fall to be made in respect of such use from the basic rate of remuneration recommended by the Review Body.  These arrangements would also apply to a full-time chairperson who would be regarded as the chief executive of the body concerned.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the ongoing situation regarding the strength of the punt against the pound sterling, he will now ease the PRSI system to help firms going through difficulties, especially companies which have a large export business.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not favour using the PRSI system to direct assistance to firms or sectors going through difficulties at present.  The PRSI system is a good one; it is clearly understood and easy to administer and fulfils the very important objective of making funds available &mdash; £1.5 billion this year &mdash; for a range of Social Insurance benefits.</P>
      <P>Our PRSI rates are highly competitive <i>vis-‡-vis</i> other EC countries, and there are no viable alternatives to raise the necessary resources otherwise than through the tax system.  In this regard it is well to remember that an across the board 1 per cent reduction in employers' PRSI would cost £85 million.</P>
      <P>Our system is not suited to differentiation by reference to either individual firms or sectors.  Firm by firm differentiation would require the use of information and criteria which are entirely outside the scope of Social Welfare legislation and administration.  A sectoral differentiation, besides being inequitable and inefficient as a means of targeting relief, would be extremely difficult to administer on any kind of stable basis.</P>
      <P>Finally, any differentiation would lead to demands for its extension to other sectors or to meet other circumstances. This could severely jeopardise the funding of the Social Insurance Fund which has outgoings of £1.7 billion in 1992.</P>
      <P>In short, the Government does not regard differentiation of PRSI treatment by firm or sector as an appropriate instrument of industrial policy intervention. The system is there to obtain the resources needed to finance a wide range of benefits for insured contributors; it is simple, easy to administer and our PRSI rates are among the lowest in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has established a £50 million Market Development Fund to assist firms which have been seriously affected by the <Col N="1709" /> recent turmoil in exchange rates.  It is the Government's view that this fund provides properly targeted assistance to companies affected.</P>

Financial aid will be provided in the form of direct grants and in the form of interest rebates on loans.</P>

The total amount of loans which will be eligible for interest rebates over the period 1993-1997 would be ECU 1.5 billion.  Priority will be given to projects which place particular emphasis on the environment, on transport including infrastructure, education and training.  Among projects submitted by private undertakings, special consideration will be given to small and medium sized enterprises.  The shareout of financial assistance between the eligible countries has not yet been decided.</P>

      <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety at sea, it is my objective to achieve the best standard practices for safety on board ferries operating in and out of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Irish registered ferries are required to undergo a rigorous annual inspection by my Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their Passenger and Safety Certificates.  This involves dry-docking the vessel and a very thorough inspection of the vessel's bottom, hull, structure and all watertight doors and closing appliances on board.  The vessel's life-saving appliances and fire-fighting appliances are examined and tested where necessary.  Tanks and other enclosed spaces are opened out and inspected as part of an on-going survey programme.  The vessel's lifeboats are inspected in detail and liferafts on board are sent ashore for servicing.  Lifejackets are also examined.  All signs indicating to passengers what to do or where to assemble in an emergency are checked, examined and replaced, as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland, it is the policy of my <Col N="1714" /> Department that foreign-registered vessels providing a regular service using Irish ports are also subjected to inspection, carried out at least once a year, under the Port State Control mechanism.  Port State Control is carried out by a number of European countries under a Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control inaugurated in Paris in 1982.</P>
    <P>Port State Control involves, <i>inter alia,</i> inspection of vessels' Safety Convention Certificates relating to Ship Construction, Loadlines, Safety Equipment, Oil Pollution, Manning.  The inspection includes a detailed examination of the vessel, its bridge, charts, nautical publications, life-saving appliances, fire-fighting appliances, ship's accommodation, store rooms, galley, engine room and ancillary spaces.  The vessel decks, cargo equipment, mooring arrangements etc. are also checked in detail.</P>
    <P>Foreign registered ferries, providing a once off or a short term relief service are required to be in compliance with the standards laid down in the relevant International Conventions.  These Conventions are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, as amended by the Protocol of 1978;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Merchant Shipping (Minimum Standards) Convention, 1976 (ILO Convention No. 147).  </P>
    <P>Where my Marine Surveyors have reason to believe that any ferry operating to an Irish port may be unsafe, an immediate <Col N="1715" /> inspection is carried out, regardless of flag administration.</P>

      <P>The rental valuation for the property in question was provided by the Valuation Office, which advises my Department on such matters.  I am advised that the rental sought is fair and reasonable.  The rent has not, in fact, been increased for nearly forty years.</P>
      <P>On the question of negotiations my Department assumed responsibility for management of Howth Fishery Harbour Centre from 1 January 1990.  Negotiations on the issue of a new lease to the company commenced in January 1991, and have continued since then.  There have been regular contacts between the company and my Department, and several meetings between the respective valuers, the last being in recent weeks. Negotiations between my Department and the company concerned are continuing in relation to the actual terms of a lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the company occupies a prime site within the fishery harbour centre, the value of which has been considerably enhanced by the very considerable State investment in the harbours <Col N="1716" /> infrastructure over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>The Department is obliged to secure a fair market rent for State property, and it has already demonstrated its good will by considering concessions in certain areas and pursuing negotiations over a prolonged period of time.  However, having failed to secure agreement on a reasonable rent, the Department has been legally advised that there is no other option open to it but to secure vacant possession of the premises, and relet them at a realistic rent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the company has had a retail outlet at Howth for many years. This was a major factor influencing the decision to offer them a new lease.  My Department remains willing to negotiate with the company on a realistic basis.  The question of making phased payments of any rent arrars will be considered at the appropriate time.</P>

However, this number was increased to 61 by 31 December, 1982 by the Garda authorities in order to tackle particular problems which existed in the area at that time and there has been no significant decrease in the manpower levels in Finglas Garda station since then.  On the <Col N="1721" /> other hand, the figures for indictable crime for the sub-District of Finglas fell by almost 6 per cent between 1982 and 1991 and by almost 17 per cent between 1989 and 1991.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that foot and mobile patrols are carried out on a regular basis in the Finglas area. The area is also patrolled regularly by members of the Divisional Task Force and the District Detective Unit car.  In addition to this, there are five Community GardaÌ who keep in close contact with the community through the various Residents' Associations and Neighbourhood Watch Groups in the area.  Two civilian clerical staff were assigned to Finglas Garda station during 1990 and this has resulted in the release of two GardaÌ from administrative work to outdoor operational duties.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are closely monitoring the policing situation in Finglas and they will deploy their resources to maximum effect while taking into account the overall demands on the Force.</P>

Such by-laws are made after consultation with the local authority concerned and with the consent of the Minister for the Environment.

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Firearms (Temporary Custody) Order, 1972 (S.I. No. 187 of 1972).  This Order, which was valid for one month, required all persons residing in the State, in the interests of public safety, to surrender to the GardaÌ all pistols, and rifles of a calibre greater than .22 inches (5.6mm) and ammunition for same.  On the expiration of the Order the GardaÌ adopted a general policy of not issuing firearm certificates for pistols, revolvers or rifles of a calibre in excess of .22 inches (5.6mm).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities have in certain limited cases issued certificates for the use of higher calibre rifles, i.e. those in <Col N="1724" /> excess of .22 inches (5.6mm), for the culling of deer.  The circumstances under which such certificates are issued are currently under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what is meant by the reference to judicial reforms.  The only area I can think of is the question of sentencing policy and that is something that is currently under general review by the Law Reform Commission.  The reforms which are contained in the Criminal Justice Bill, 1992 at present before the D·il are relevant. These provide for a new procedure for the review of unduly lenient sentences. The Bill will also require courts, when determining the sentence to be imposed for a sexual offence (or an offence involving violence or the threat of violence) to take into account any effect (including any long term effect) of the offence on the victim.  This measure will have important implications for cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>I should also say that the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 provides for important changes in the law in relation to child sexual abuse cases.  Under the Act and with effect from 7 October, 1992 evidence of a child under 14 years can be given otherwise than on oath or affirmation, the requirement of corroboration has been abolished, and a spouse is both a competent and compellable witness for the prosecution in such cases.</P>
      <P>The Act also provides for the giving of evidence of physical or sexual abuse by means of live television so as to make it easier for victims to testify.  The relevant provision will be brought into effect by the order of the Minister for Justice when the work associated with installation of the necessary technical equipment in the courts has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 introduced new offences relating to sexual assault and aggravated <Col N="1725" /> sexual assault.  It also abolished the irrebuttable presumption at common law that a boy under the age of 14 years of age was incapable of committing rape. Again, while this is a general measure, it will have a relevance for the type of case in question.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Report of the Law Reform Commission on Child Sexual Abuse is concerned, certain other recommendations relevant to questions which are within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice are being examined in my Department and any proposals which I may have in relation to them will be announced in the normal way in due course.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the recent practice of young people buying old, used cars for very small amounts of money and driving them in a reckless and dangerous manner.  Because of the ages of the persons concerned, the cars cannot be taxed or insured.  In this regard, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, that proposals which will increase the powers of the Garda to deal with this problem, including the power to impound vehicles, will be included in the new Road Traffic Bill.  These new powers will significantly strengthen the position of the Garda and allow them to deal more effectively with the problem.</P>

      <P>The scale of fees paid to doctors by the Garda SÌoch·na in respect of medical examinations and reports was, due to an administrative error, increased by an incorrect rate with effect from 1 September, 1992.  When the error came to light immediate steps were taken to apply the correct rate, which provides for increases in the order of 37.5 per cent. The correct rate of increase takes into account movements over and above general round increases &mdash; which have been applied to the fees in question in the <Col N="1728" /> normal way &mdash; in the pay of doctors in the Health Service since the fee structure was agreed with the Irish Medical Union and Irish Medical Association in 1981.</P>
      <P>Due to overpayments having been made since 1 September, 1992, when the incorrect rate was applied, it has proved necessary to arrange for the recoupment over time of the amounts involved.  The Irish Medical Organisation were advised of the position prior to these arrangements being put in place.  The Deputy will appreciate that as taxpayers' money is involved it is incumbent on the State to seek repayment of the overpayments made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The current estimated annual cost of the operation of the prison system is £80 million, on the basis of projected expenditure for the year.  This corresponds to an estimated weekly cost of £700 per prisoner.  These figures do not include any element in respect of capital expenditure. They are arrived at by taking gross projected expenditure for the Prisons Vote, deducting Appropriations-in-Aid and expenditure not connected with the running of the prisons (Probation and Welfare Service and Community Service Orders' Scheme) and adding relevant costs borne on other votes (Superannuation and Teachers' Salaries).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> As I have indicated already to the House, I am at present carrying out a review of the prison system with a view to deciding on a policy for the future.  It may very well be that as a consequence of this review an increase in the number of prison spaces will be indicated.  Given the huge cost of providing and operating prisons, however, other options will have to be considered first including greater reliance on community-based sanctions and, perhaps, the more judicious use of the spaces which are already available. Even if it were decided to provide additional prison spaces I am not convinced that locating them in an isolated part of the country would have any advantages.  It would still cost a minimum of £100,000 per place to build a new prison and the operating costs, which are about £36,000 per place at present, would most likely be higher in such a location.</P>

      <P>Each script on which a review is sought is fully marked afresh by an experienced examiner, other than the original examiner.  Where the appeal examiner considers that an upgrade may be warranted, the script is also reviewed by the Inspector for the subject.  A change in grade is implemented where the Inspector agrees with the appeal examiner that an upgrade is warranted.</P>
      <P>This year the closing date for receipt of applications for review was 4th September as against 31st August previously. The applications had to be verified against fees received and each of the 4,318 scripts located amongst the half million Leaving Certificate scrips held. The scrips were then forwarded to the appeal examiners.  Each examiner was allocated about 50 scripts and given two weeks to complete the work, taking into account that teaching duties had been resumed.  Inspectors were requested to deal with any scripts forwarded to them as a matter of priority.</P>

    <P>All of the work described was completed in the case of almost 98 per cent of applications by 15 October and notifications were issued in respect of over 4,200 applications on that day.

      <P>The Government fully supports <Col N="1741" /> the maintenance and development of ferry services in the interests of trade and tourism.  However, the decision to operate services on particular routes is a commercial decision for individual ferry operators.  Similarly, decisions as regards the future of individual companies is a matter for the owners of those companies to decide.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that Exchequer assistance was made available to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited in 1987, 1988 and 1990, as well as an offer of assistance in 1989 which was not taken up by the company.  The Government has, therefore, done all it can reasonably be expected to do in assisting the establishment of a Cork Swansea service.</P>
      <P>Swansea Cork Ferries Limited were informed in 1990 that the Government had decided that no further Exchequer assistance would be available to the company from 1990 onwards.  There is no change in that position.  I am pleased that the Cork Swansea ferry service has operated with commercial success both in 1991 and the current year without Exchequer subvention.</P>

      <P>The Aer Lingus aircraft EI AOM which crashed off Tuskar Rock in 1968 with the loss of 61 lives was tragic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A most thorough and searching investigation by means of an official inquiry was made into all known circumstances and evidence in relation to the accident. The report of the investigation by the then Inspector of Accidents which was issued in September, 1970 stated that <Col N="1745" /> there was not enough evidence available on which to reach a conclusion of reasonable probability as to the initial cause of this accident.  This report was published and copies of it are available if so required.</P>
    <P>Whilst I acknowledge the Deputies' interest, since my Department has received no new information which would indicate that the findings of the published report are open to question, I could not justify, in the absence of such new evidence, the diversion of scarce staff resources from other more pressing tasks to explore speculative lines of inquiry.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Deputies concerned to forward to my Department any information they have which is of material evidence to the findings of the published accident report.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers relates to a person who was treated in Tralee General Hospital from 25 June to 29 August, 1992.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of in-patient services for more than thirty days within a twelvemonth period may be liable for charges under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1987, except in the case of medical card holders or persons with dependants.  In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's circumstances. Allowance is made for any commitments the person may have, such as rent, and a reasonable amount is left to the person to meet personal needs.  A person who has been a medical card holder while living in the community does not automatically retain that status if being maintained in an institution where he/she is being provided with all necessary medical and surgical services on a long-stay basis.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Southern Health Board to examine this case to ensure that the charge made was in accordance with the Regulations.  I should mention that a comprehensive review of these charges and their application is at present being carried out in my Department, and I will consider whether changes in the Regulations are desirable when the review has been completed.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board have the services of two consultant orthodontists doing two orthodontic clinics per week. In addition the board have the services of nine dentists with specialist qualifications in orthodontics providing a total of sixteen sessions per week.</P>
      <P>In the period July 1990 to August 1992 a total of 5,012 patients completed treatment, or were undergoing treatment, with the involvement of these personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1990 my Department have made a special additional allocation available to the Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of orthodontic services. The special additional allocation provided in 1991 for this purpose was £292,500.  The Eastern Health Board's <Col N="1753" /> original allocation for 1992 includes a repeat of this special provision for the continuing development of the orthodontic services.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board are at present making arrangements for the shared appointment of consultant orthodontists with the Dublin Dental Hospital and the interviewing of candidates was held recently.  In addition to their own direct clinical involvement, a primary task of the consultant orthodontist will be to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to specialist and sub-specialist levels for health board dental staff which will enable them to provide a greatly increased volume of service.</P>

      <P>The long term illness scheme covers fifteen specified illnesses.  There are no <Col N="1754" /> plans at present to extend the scheme to include any further conditions.  Rheumatoid-arthritis is not one of those illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>No long term illness grants automatic entitlement to a medical card.  However, persons with long term chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship, may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines without charge.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication, can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme.  This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries, on prescribed medicines, to £32 per month.  This scheme is being availed of by over 20,000 persons and the take-up in the scheme emphasises the benefits of the scheme for persons with a long term drug requirement.</P>

      <P>Road improvements at Terminus Street/Sallypark have been raised with my Department by Waterford Corporation in the context of the new port development at Bellevue and a feasibility study, prepared by consultants appointed by the corporation, has been received. The corporation are currently seeking the advice of a further consultant with regard to complementary traffic management measures that will be needed at both ends of Rice Bridge.  When this report is received, the overall project will be considered for road grant financing.</P>
      <P>The corporation have also raised the question of constructing a high level bridge, which was the subject of a bridge order application in the seventies and associated roads.  It is not evident, however, that a further bridge will be required to cater for national route traffic in Waterford city in the short to medium term.  Neither is it accepted that any national route by-pass that might be required in the longer term would necessarily use the alignment of the high level bridge proposal submitted in the seventies.  The Corporation have been so informed.</P>

      <P>The initial funding for road projects which are assisted from EC Structural Funds is provided by Government road grants.  EC assistance is paid to the Department of Finance and is remitted to the Exchequer in partial recoupment of these grants.  The same arrangements <Col N="1765" /> will probably apply to assistance from the proposed Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>Road grant funding for non-national roads such as that referred to in the question is generally provided in the form of discretionary grants where the selection of projects to be carried out is a matter for the local authority, subject to general guidelines notified by my Department.  If Kerry County Council decide to carry out improvement works on this road for their discretionary grants, it would be open to them to nominate the works for cofinancing from EC funds.  Any such nomination would be considered in the light of the selection criteria for the relevant EC funds.  However, any EC funding provided as a result would be remitted to the Exchequer in partial recoupment of the road grants.</P>

      <P>Article 138e of the Treaty on European Union provides for the establishment of the Office of European Ombudsman.  The Treaty sets out the method of appointment and the role of the European Parliament in the drawing up of the regulations governing the office.</P>
      <P>The first step is for the European Parliament to lay down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties. Parliament is expected to consider a report from its Committee on Institutional Affairs (Rapporteur: Mrs. Rosy Bindi) on these regulations and conditions at its part-session commencing on 16 November.</P>
      <P>When the regulations and conditions have been agreed by Parliament (after receiving the approval of the Council of Ministers) the next step will be for the Parliament to elect an Ombudsman.  The Council will have no function in this election. While I would not wish to pre-empt the content of the regulations and conditions governing the Office of the Ombudsman I would point out that it is the practice for any Ombudsman to report to the Parliament which appointed him or her in respect only of the actions or decisions of organs of administration falling under the jurisdiction of that Parliament. It would not therefore be appropriate for the remit of any Ombudsman appointed by the European Parliament to comprehend the activities of Irish Government Departments or Agencies. In the event of such an Ombudsman's investigation entailing requests by him for information from Irish Government Departments, I would expect that the cooperation and assistance already afforded by them to existing regulatory investigation or audit organs of the Community would be extended to the Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>Ireland is playing its part in the international response to the humanitarian crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Following a Government decision, a group of 178 refugees arrived in Ireland in early September.  These refugees are now settled at the Cherry Orchard Reception Centre where they are being provided with a special induction programme which includes specialist counselling and language training.  The Government and the relevant Departments and Agencies involved have spared no effort in ensuring that the refugees are made as comfortable as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government have also responded to appeals for assistance for those refugees and displaced persons remaining in the area of the former Yugoslavia. £100,000 has been donated to the UNHCR and a further £10,000 to nongovernmental organisations working to assist refugees.  In addition, Ireland is contributing its share of the European Community's programmes in respect of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the appeal made at the Birmingham European Council the Government intend to contribute an additional sum of £200,000 to assist the people in the region who are facing harsh winter conditions without proper shelter or food and medical supplies.  This money will be channelled through UNHCR.  The Government have also indicated their readiness to provide Army personnel for logistical support in the delivery of humanitarian aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that we are doing all that we can to help, having regard to the financial resources available.  The Government are prepared to consider further assistance, for example, the possibility of reuniting some of the refugees <Col N="1769" /> already here with close family members and the possibility of accepting other refugees who wish to be settled in Ireland.

      <P>The UN Human Rights Committee, which oversees implementation of the terms of the Covenant by States parties, has been notified of Ireland's withdrawal of this declaration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 215 together.</P>
      <P>No courier agency was used to deliver the short guide to Maastricht during the postal dispute.  The Special Distribution Service of An Post transported copies of the guide to all An Post regional offices, at a cost of £4,690 and it was delivered to households by local postmen who were not affected by the dispute.  Following the settlement of the dispute a courier agency was used to deliver the guide in the Clondalkin area of Dublin, when it became apparent that a local industrial relations problem would prevent the delivery by the normal postal services. Ten thousand six hundred guides were distributed in this way at a cost of £299.61, excluding VAT.  The total cost of distributing the guide by the normal An Post delivery service in the rest of the State was £48,094.66.</P>
      <P>In all 1,250,000 copies of the English-language version of the guide were printed at a cost of £40,555.  In addition 20,000 copies of the Irish-language version were printed at a cost of £2,604. Total printing costs were therefore £43,159.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the House will agree that the expenditure concerned was productive in terms of facilitating an informed public debate prior to the referendum. Indeed there was widespread praise &mdash; in &ldquo;The Economist&rdquo; newspaper for example &mdash; for the clarity with which the complex issues concerned were set out in our information material.</P>

      <P>In evaluating the expenditure on Bovine TB eradication account must be taken of the essential role the scheme plays in preserving export outlets for livestock and livestock products.  In this regard I am satisfied that the expenditure to date has been necessary and worthwhile and has reduced the incidence of the disease to less than 1 per cent of animals.  A recent study carried out by Professor SÈamus Sheehy has shown that investment in the Scheme has been extremely cost-beneficial.</P>
      <P>However I am anxious that a consensus would be achieved on a programme for the next 4 years which would enable disease levels to be further reduced.</P>

      <P>The position is that the GATT talks have not broken down and that bilateral talks are continuing between the Commission, as the Community's negotiator, and the US in an effort to resolve outstanding differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish position on agriculture aspects is well known and I have expressed it forcefully at every available opportunity.  I have been in regular contact with Commissioner MacSharry on the issue and have expressed my concerns <Col N="1779" /> at successive Agriculture Councils and in bilateral meetings with my Community colleagues.</P>
    <P>My major concerns on agriculture relate primarily to the need to safeguard the Common Agricultural Policy reform compensation, to maintain adequate opportunities of exports to third countries and to ensure that the various commitments undertaken in the different areas are compatible with each other.  I welcome progress made at recent meetings in safeguarding the compensatory and Disadvantaged Area payments from GATT disciplines but difficulties remain in other areas.</P>
    <P>Any agreement reached will of course be subject to Council approval.  You can be assured that I will be insisting in these dicussions that a GATT outcome cannot be at the expense of the critical interest of any member state.  I will also be insisting that an agreement must be comprehensive and balanced, involving equivalent progress in areas other than agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Dissolution Bill provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for: the dissolution of the Land Commission, i.e. the offices of the Judicial Commissioner and the Lay Commissioners; the revocation of the power to acquire land for land settlement purposes and the transfer of certain continuing functions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Among the functions to be transferred to the Minister are: the disposal of land on hands; the settling of title of allotted lands; the exercise of statutory controls over the subdivision of farms and the purchase of land by non-qualified persons &mdash; mainly companies and non-EC nationals; the promotion of group purchase and leasing of land and the provision of assistance in schemes of rearrangement and commonage division; miscellaneous statutory and other obligations such as the collection of annuities, custody of title documents and responsibilities of the offices of the Examiner of Title and of Public Trustee.</P>
      <P>Consequently there will be a considerable volume of work which must continue to be undertaken by both the administrative and field staff assigned to &ldquo;lands&rdquo; work.  Enactment of the Dissolution Bill will therefore have little or no immediate effect on the overall workload/staff requirement for &ldquo;lands&rdquo; work.</P>
      <P>Any reduction in staff requirements in certain areas of the Land Commission can be attributed to the termination of the policy of land acquisition (effectively ceased by 1984) rather than to the legislation to abolish the Land Commission. Every effort will be made to assign surplus staff to duties within my Department or elsewhere in the public service.</P>

      <Quest>the total cost of the free travel scheme on an annual basis; the way in which these figures are calculated; if he has satisfied himself that the costs passed on to his Department from CIE are in order.</Quest>

      <P>Total expenditure on the Free Travel Scheme amounted to £28.2 million in 1991.  The cost of the scheme in 1992 is expected to be £29.6 million. The bulk of this expenditure (96.7 per cent in 1991) is made to the CIE group of companies.  The balance is spread over a total of 30 private bus and ferry operators.</P>
      <P>Payments are made to all participating operators in the Free Travel Scheme based upon surveys of passenger usage conducted by the operators themselves. The findings of these surveys are rigorously examined by the Department after which a fixed recoupment level is agreed with each individual participant. To confirm the accuracy of the payments being made, officers of my Department occasionally conduct their own surveys of passenger usage by individual bus and ferry operators.</P>
      <P>The basis of the agreed rate of remuneration with CIE in respect of the free travel scheme was a survey of passenger usage carried out by CIE personnel on all its services during October 1974. These findings were examined and approved by my Department at that time in consultation with the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Finance. As free travel usage is restricted to off-peak times on CIE's Dublin and provincial bus services, the Department negotiated a 40 per cent discount in the total annual payment due to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All percentage fares increases applied by CIE since 1974 have resulted in a corresponding percentage increase in the rate of remuneration by my Department to CIE.  Developments of the free travel scheme as a result of various budget <Col N="1788" /> extensions in client coverage have also resulted in further remuneration to CIE due to increased free travel passenger usage.</P>
    <P>The notional cost of each Free Travel Pass amounts to £66 per annum.  This has been calculated by dividing the total estimated cost of the scheme in 1992 (£29.6 million) by the number of free travel pass-holders (444,700).  This cost includes provision for some 14,000 special category free travel pass-holders who are entitled to be accompanied by a companion on unlimited free travel.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this scheme expenditure represents good value for money in relation to the cost of bus fares generally, as well as being highly valued by the free travel pass-holders themselves.</P>
