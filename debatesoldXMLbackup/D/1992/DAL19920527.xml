      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10.  It is also proposed that business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m.  It is further proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 10, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; (2) statements, to which Standing Order 41 shall not apply, shall be taken today on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statement of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and of the spokespersons for the Fine Gael and Labour Parties shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other Member called on shall not exceed ten minutes; and (iii) the Minister or a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food shall be called upon not later than 10.20 p.m. to make a statement in reply.</P>
      <P>Private Members' Business shall be No. 20 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>With regard to items Nos. 1 and 10 on today's Order Paper, it was my understanding that the statements on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would commence at 12.30 p.m. today.  I am deeply disturbed at the idea that those statements will not commence until 9 p.m. taking into consideration the voting arrangements for this evening. Given the serious implications for Irish agriculture of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, I ask that the Whips meet again to see if more time can be allocated to this debate, even if the Committee Stage of item No. 10, the Criminal Evidence Bill, is concluded earlier.  I believe agriculture warrants more than a one-and-a-half-hour debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The time allocated for the debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is totally inadequate. Under the proposals put by the Government, this party will have only two speakers in addition to our spokesman.  For a party with 55 Deputies, this proposal is totally inadequate.  In order to have a lengthier debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy I suggest that the proceedings on the Criminal Evidence Bill be adjourned at 12.30 p.m. until another day rather than concluded at 6.30 p.m.  I propose that as an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Those of us who have been actively involved in the debate on the Criminal Evidence Bill would be more than happy to conclude the debate today.  Therefore, I ask that the debate not be adjourned, as suggested.  I believe the debate can be concluded sooner than the time indicated and I ask that no guillotine be put on the debate.  The reason I rise is to ask the Taoiseach if those amendments put down by Members on this side of the House which are acceptable to the Minister will also be agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government do not have a problem with when the proceedings on No. 10 are finished.  Yesterday, an aspiration was expressed to the Whips that the debate would be concluded either last night or early today. The Whips can meet again after the Order of Business today to discuss the matter.  If the debate can be concluded by 1.30 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. today that is acceptable to the Government.  We do not have a problem with granting more time to the debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; we wish to facilitate the debate in the House &mdash; but I would not be in favour of adjourning the debate on the Criminal Evidence Bill.</P>

We would like to commence the debate on the Common Agricultural Policy at 12.30 p.m. or 1.30 p.m. but we would not like the debate on No. 10 to be guillotined.  We should like the debate on that Bill to be adjourned at that stage.</P>

      <P>I would draw to your attention, Sir, a serious breach of the privileges of Members of this House.  In this morning's papers there are widespread accounts of a report allegedly published by the visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison.  It is my understanding that that report should have been laid before this House and copies should have been placed in the Library and given to Members of this House.  As of 10.15 this morning no Member of this House had a copy of that report, nor was it in the Library.  It is a report of considerable seriousness.  I would ask that the necessary arrangements be made to deal with the difficulty and that an explanation be given to the House as to why the report has not been placed in the Library.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the widespread confusion created because of the conflict between his remarks to this House and the remarks of our ambassador to one of the European institutions in relation to the legislation promised as a result of the Norris case?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the ambassador has stated, on behalf of the Irish Government, that amending legislation is to be introduced?

I have said on many occasions in this House that work is proceeding on the legislation and that it is part of the Programme for Government, but legislation that has greater priority in the Government's legislative programme takes precedence over it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with a provision in the Bill relating to proceedings in the District Court.  The section provides for notice to be given to an accused if it is intended to rely on video recordings at any stage during the proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section proposes that where an accused is to be sent for trial to the Circuit Court and video recording evidence is to be relied upon notice should be served on the person so that he or she would have the opportunity of viewing the evidence as part of the preparation for trial and the conclusion of the preliminary examination.  The section applies to a number of circumstances. Subsection (1) (a) states: &ldquo;Where the person is before the District Court charged with an offence to which this Part applies,&rdquo; and paragraph (b) states: &ldquo;the person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed is a person under 17 years of age.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment proposes to add to that, circumstances in which the section should apply not just to the victim who <Col N="557" /> is 17 or under but also to where the prosecution of the offence can involve the testimony as to fact, of a witness who is under the age of 17 years.  The section as drafted is too narrow.  My understanding is that we are going to rely upon video recordings as an aid to testimony not just in the circumstances outlined in the section but also where the witnesses to be called for testimony are persons under a particular age who need the assistance of the intermediary and of the separate location.  In those circumstances video recordings can be used under the earlier sections and clearly notice of the intention to rely upon video recordings should be served on the defendant in the case.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to my proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea) Willie O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 deals with the situation where the prosecution wishes to put in evidence at the trial, a video recording of an interview by appropriately qualified people, of a child under 14, or a mentally handicapped person who is alleged to be the victim of physical or sexual abuse.  It provides that the prosecution must give the accused an opportunity to see the recording in advance of the preliminary examination, and that if the alleged victim is available for cross-examination, the video recording may be considered by the district judge conducting the preliminary examination. The section is confined to cases where the evidence in question is evidence by the alleged victim and where it is contained in the video recording of the interview. It would not seem appropriate to provide, as suggested in the amendment, for a case where a prosecution of the offence includes testimony as to facts by a witness under 17 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not appropriate where the court is going to rely upon the video recording? Perhaps the object of the exercise is to alert a defendant to the fact that a video recording had been used and to allow the accused an opportunity to see the video recording. That is fair, but, it begs the question that there will be at some stage in the pretrial <Col N="558" /> process the preparation of the video recordings of victims.  I can see why a victim who is under age can have the facility of video recordings but will there not also be preliminary steps taken to prepare video recordings of the testimony of young witnesses as to facts? I see that the Minister is indicating a negative to that.  Does this not then raise the prospect of a major gap in the process? Is the position to be that the defendant will rely only on the written record of the testimony of the victim or of a witness, and that the video recording is something that will happen instantaneously at the trial, and there will not be any issue of pre-recording? Is that what is intended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that there will be no out of court video recording of an interview of anybody other than the alleged victim.  This is in a situation where the offence has happened in relation to somebody who is 14 or under. If a person is aged over 14 but is under 17 at the time of the trial the video can be used.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy McCartan's other question, my understanding of the section is that other witnesses under 17 years of age who give testimony at the preliminary hearing will have their testimony video recorded and the video recording of the interview with the victim, together with the video recording of the testimony of the witnesses who are under 17 at the preliminary investigation, will be available at the trial, and the trial judge can exclude any part of it he wishes to exclude in the interests of justice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37a:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the insertion after section 2 of the following section:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;2A.  (1) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person is before the District Court charged with an offence to which Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, applies, and</P>
      <P>(b)  it is proposed that at the preliminary examination of the offence evidence will be given through a live television link pursuant to section 12 of that Act, and</P>
      <P>(c)  a certificate for free legal aid (in this Act referred to as a &ldquo;legal aid (preliminary examination) certificate&rdquo;) is granted in respect of him by the District Court,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the person shall be entitled to free legal aid at the preliminary examination pursuant to a legal aid (preliminary examination) certificate and to have a solicitor and counsel <Col N="560" /> assigned to him for that purpose in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations under section 10 of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2) A legal aid (preliminary examination) certificate shall be granted in respect of a person if (but only if)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  application is made therefor,</P>
    <P>(b)  it appears to the District Court&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that his means are insufficient to enable him to obtain legal aid, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been set up), it is essential in the interests of justice that he should have legal aid at the preliminary examination.&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the insertion in section 9 (2), after &lsquo;legal aid (District Court) certificate,&rsquo; of &lsquo;a legal aid (preliminary examination) certificate,&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on the provision of section 12 which requires evidence given through a TV link at a preliminary examination to be recorded and section 15 which enables the video recordings to be used as evidence at the trial.  The effect of these provisions is that the examination of the witness will be carried out at the preliminary examination stage.  However, under the present law, legal aid for the employment of counsel is not available for preliminary examinations unless the offence charged is murder.  It is necessary to amend the criminal legal aid legislation to provide for the engagement of counsel at preliminary examinations in cases to which this Part of the Bill applies, that is violent or sexual offences committed against young or mentally handicapped persons, and where evidence is to be given by TV link.  That is achieved by this amendment and I would ask the House to accept it <Col N="561" /> on that basis.  As it is envisaged that the examination of witnesses for these types of offence will take place at a preliminary hearing, we are providing for legal aid for that.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give some indication as to the level upon which fees will be fixed? This is an important aspect.  I will not trespass into areas relating to a current dispute but the workability of any section will depend upon the resources committed to it. There will be some interest among members of the Bar who will be coming into the preliminary examination process in the District Court.  At the moment all fees there are fixed statutorily in relation to the existing legal aid regulations.  Specific sums are mentioned and there is no automatic review.  There is no linking of those fees to anything exterior to the system.  The fees of barristers are related in the Circuit Court to what the prosecution is allowed and that is settled between the Attorney General, the DPP and the Department from time to time. That mechanism is not available in the District Court.  Have the Department and the Minister given any consideration to the level of remuneration or the basis on which the fee will be fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a layman's view abroad that the preliminary investigation is in some way a lesser hearing than the trial at District Court or at Circuit Court level and there is a suggestion that the fee payable will be lesser than the standard miniscule fee for a day's District Court hearing. That is a dangerous argument which does not reflect the importance of the preliminary investigation.  The good intentions <Col N="562" /> of the amendment should not be spoiled by not providing adequate funds for the remuneration of lawyers in this area.  A preliminary investigation is slow and tedious but it is extremely important in establishing a fair trial.  There can be a quick and summary hearing in a District Court case without any undue delay, whereas a preliminary investigation is tortuous and time-consuming.  The fees fixed must reflect the importance and complexity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for further consideration and I thank Deputy McCartan for bringing these matters to our attention.  I am assured that the principle that the prosecution and the defence should be paid the same fee will apply in relation to preliminary examinations.  I am also assured that the argument that the preliminary examination is in some way less important than the trial will not prevail.  It will be treated in the context of fees as akin to the trial.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> In page 11, subsection (1) (b), line 22, to delete &ldquo;persons who are in the opinion of the court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a person or persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a technical amendment which may not be required.  It relates to section 15 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>15.  &mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (2)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a videorecording of any evidence given by a person under 17 years of age through a live television link at the preliminary examination of an offence to which this Part applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a videorecording of any statement made by a person under 14 years of age (being a person in respect of whom such an offence is alleged to have been committed) during an interview with persons who are in the opinion of the court appropriately qualified for the purpose,</P>
    <P>shall be admissible at the trial of the offence as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.</P>
    <P>I beg the Chair's pardon.  The amendments should be taken together.  I apologise. The first part of section 15 deals with the videorecording of statements made by persons where there are allegations of physical or sexual assault.  This section deals with sexual assault.  Section 15 of the Bill envisages an allegation of sexual assault on a child by an adult and an assessment of some description being carried out by a person with some qualification. Subsection (1) (b) deals with this issue.  A parent, a social worker or a teacher may be of the view that the child has been sexually abused and may feel it is necessary that an assessment be carried out to determine whether sexual abuse has occurred.  That type of assessment can be carried out in a special unit or by individuals such as social workers or medical practitioners who have, or believe they have, an expertise in the area.  There is concern that, whereas the <Col N="564" /> majority of professional people working in this area have expertise, not all have. Some have been self taught and that can be dangerous in dealing with an issue such as this.</P>
    <P>The child will be presented to the professional person, who we may assume will be a medical practitioner, possibly a child psychiatrist.  Various types of approaches are adopted to determine whether a child has been sexually abused. Those approaches may be dictated partially by the age of the child and by the nature of the physical evidence, if any, as to whether there has been sexual abuse.  The form of assessment may involve simply observing the child in a form of play with what is known as an anatomically correct doll or dolls.  It may involve a form of interview with the child in order to ascertain from the child's responses whether there has been abuse. It may also include asking a child to execute drawings or to colour various types of pictures presented.  The approach adopted by the child can lead professional people to reach certain conclusions. In this area conclusions from the play of the child can be difficult to draw and can be somewhat dangerous. There is a danger that if a professional person undertakes an assessment based on an assumption that there has been abuse, then something the child does may be interpreted as confirming abuse which has not in fact occurred.  If a professional person enters into an assessment with an entirely open mind the right or the wrong conclusions may be drawn.  This is an area fraught with difficulties and dangers. Nevertheless this type of assessment has provided a less formal means of trying to determine whether allegations, in particular of child sexual assault, are correct.</P>
    <P>Section 15 allows for the videorecording of these types of assessment. In effect it is stated that the interview must take place with persons who are, in the opinion of the court, appropriately qualified for the purpose.  The section does not specify what is meant by persons &ldquo;appropriately qualified&rdquo;.  It is left for a court to determine whether someone is or is not appropriately qualified.  Those <Col N="565" /> assessments and those videos can then be produced, as stated in the section, &ldquo;as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence... would be admissible&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The problem that has arisen in England and in other jurisdictions until recently &mdash; we have had a mirror image of that problem in Ireland, although the Irish cases have drawn little media attention &mdash; was that professionals and others who conducted this type of interview were drawing conclusions that, at best, were misconceived and, at worst, were dangerously false and inaccurate.  False conclusions were drawn from physiological examinations of children, from the manner in which children played with anatomical dolls and from the way in which children responded to questions. Perhaps not in all cases were the conclusions false but at least they were not based on a clear and objective view of the child's responses.  Perhaps, on some occasions the conclusions reached by professionals were based more on trying to prove a statistic of the number of children sexually abused than actually trying to establish whether the particular child, being assessed, was abused.  There was a general belief among certain professionals that whenever an allegation of child sexual abuse was made their main role was to prove that the allegation was correct to the extent that if a father denied sexual abuse, the father would find himself in a position where it was absolutely impossible to establish that there had not been sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I had the experience, in one particular court case of having a particular medical practitioner in a witness box in a case in which allegations had been made of child sexual abuse.  The allegation was such that there was a suggestion that the shape of the private parts of two young boys was conclusive evidence that these boys had been sexually abused.  This conclusion had been reached by a medical practitioner without actually troubling himself to talk to the paediatrician who had examined each of these children on birth.  The parents told the medical practitioner that each of their children had <Col N="566" /> been born with a physiological deformity and that the paediatrician had advised them that they would either grow out of this deformity or they could be operated on at the age of six or seven and the difficulties would be resolved.  The medical practitioner who reached the conclusion that the children had been sexually abused &mdash; and that the particular shape of the children's private parts indicated abuse &mdash; did not bother to go to the trouble of contacting the paediatrician to find out whether what the parents had said was correct.  A health board brought proceedings to have these children put in care.  They were seized under what is known as a &ldquo;place of safety&rdquo; order and put in care for a couple of weeks.  Pending the hearing of the case the father had to move out of the family home.  Until the case was fully heard the parents had two choices: either the children would be kept in the care of strangers without their having access to them or the father had to move out of the home because it was assumed he would sexually abuse them. The father moved out and the children returned home.</P>
    <P>It was established in court that the children did have a physiological problem and what this particular medical practitioner had described as classic symptoms of child sexual abuse was wrong. When I asked the particular medical practitioner in the witness box &mdash; as the lawyer for the parents &mdash; whether he knew the father had denied the allegation of sexual abuse, the medical practitioner said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In response to whether the denial was accepted he said: &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I then put it to the medical practitioner as to what would happen if an error was made in the suggestion that a father had sexually abused a child and if the father constantly protested his innocence.  The classic response was: &ldquo;In the end the father would admit sexual abuse&rdquo;.  Happily, on hearing that response, the court threw out the case.</P>
    <P>These children had been put through the trauma of being taken from their family home and their parents for two weeks, placed in the home of strangers with no access to their parents and then <Col N="567" /> returned where they had no contact with their father pending the court hearing. How much damage did that particular approach do to those children?  That is why when it comes to this issue, as someone who has worked in this area for many years, I have no doubt there is a real problem with child sexual abuse.  I have no doubt that for many years we did not acknowledge the problem fully in this country.  I have no doubt there are more instances of abuse than we ever realised. I am also concerned when people engage in campaigns on these issues that the pendulum swings from one side to the other, and from an assumption that nobody every abuses any child to an assumption that whenever an allegation is made there is always abuse.  It is essential in the civil and criminal law area that we build proper protection against that because of the enormous damage a wrong conclusion can do to a family.</P>
    <P>That somewhat lengthy introduction to the amendment was required for the following reason.  There are two amendments that I propose to this section.  The first relates to section 15 (1) (b) which states:</P>
    <P>a videorecording of any statement made by a person under 14 years of age... during an interview with persons who are in the opinion of the court appropriately qualified for the purpose,</P>
    <P>shall be admissible at the trial of the offence...</P>
    <P>A video recording could be undertaken where one medical practitioner or one social worker would be present.  It may be necessary to use the phrase &ldquo;a person or persons qualified for the purpose&rdquo;. The section leaves it to the court to determine who is qualified.  I do not believe we should have within our criminal justice system a possibility where all sorts of persons could carry out these interviews and as an <i>ex-post facto</i> rationalisation, after a criminal trial has started, there would have to be a trial within a trial as <Col N="568" /> to whether the person who conducted these assessments was qualified.</P>
    <P>I would strongly argue that an ordinary general medical practitioner who has no specialist training in this area should not be regarded as a person so qualified. There is a great danger in ordinary medical practitioners teaching themselves about how to interview children to ascertain whether they have been sexually abused and then drawing conclusions which are submitted to a court.  This is an area that requires a degree of speciality though the general practitioner may have an initial and important role in the area. In cases where there are no immediate and obvious physiological indications of abuse, and this sort of video recording technique for these types of interview is not envisaged as applying specifically to that area, there is a huge danger in leaving it to a GP, or to a social worker who has graduated from university with ideas about this area, to draw conclusions.</P>
    <P>I presume it is no longer happening, but three or four years ago I was hearing some extraordinary stories of what one or two social workers in different health board areas were doing with anatomical dolls when they got it into their minds that a child had been sexually abused. They were using anatomical dolls with the child to try to establish sexual abuse and assuming that they could teach themselves how to deal with this area and then drawing conclusions.  If any of my children, or any of the children of Members of this House, were presented with a life size anatomical doll with large parts protruding from it, be it noses, arms, legs or other parts, I would not like any social worker to draw a conclusion as to whether my child or the child of any Member of this House had been sexually abused by simply observing by which part the child might pick up the doll in a play situation.  That is hugely dangerous.  The idea of newly qualified social workers out of university in a fit of enthusiasm to prove that there is widespread sexual abuse of children in Ireland using these dolls in this way makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned that the courts <Col N="569" /> might decide simply because someone has a social science degree, that they are qualified to engage in this kind of interview.  I would be concerned that a newly qualified general practitioner without any expertise could be regarded as a qualified person to conduct these interviews and assessments, and I would be concerned that other people might be regarded as so qualified who are not.</P>
    <P>Where a video-recording is taken by a person or persons, obviously this section should apply to it.  My amendment proposes to insert a new subsection which would read:</P>
    <P>A person &lsquo;appropriately qualified&rsquo; for the purposes of subsection (1) (b) shall be a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist who specialises in dealing with children and who has received special training in the interview techniques required for interviewing a person who is an alleged victim of a sexual or physical assault.</P>
    <P>Within the terms we have established to deal with these areas, we do have such people.  I do not think we should allow enthusiastic amateurs to present themselves to the courts as qualified to deal with these matters.  I do not think we should leave it to judges to determine whether someone has had the specialist training necessary.  It should be a matter of fact.  One either has the training or has not.  The fact that someone is an adult psychiatrist who, perhaps, specialises in problems of alcoholism should not be sufficient for them to conduct these types of interviews for evidential purposes in criminal trials if they have not had the necessary special training.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to allow the courts deal with very serious allegations, in particular of child sexual abuse, within a modern legal framework which takes account of modern psychiatric psychological techniques and modern learning in this area.  We must also ensure that it does not make it easy for the courts to wrongly convict people against whom false allegations of abuse have been made because that would be the ultimate tragedy.  This is not about making it easier <Col N="570" /> to put people behind bars.  It is about trying to ensure that people innocent of charges are found innocent; that those who truly engaged in the most awful and disgusting conduct of child sexual abuse come up against the full weight of the law and that the facts can be presented to a court in a way that makes it possible for a court to unravel allegation and counter allegation, denial and counter denial. That is very important.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the section is far too woolly in the way it is drafted. Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are interrelated to the remarks I made but we are not specifically dealing with them.  I urge the Minister to look very seriously at this amendment.  It is essential that we insert in this Bill a definition of who is a qualified person.  If we do not, instead of this Bill facilitating the processing of these types of charges, we will end up having trials within trials.  Every time this aspect of the Bill comes before the courts over the next four or five years we will have trials about who is and who is not a qualified person and there will be appeals on that.  We must remember that these criminal charges when they are brought before the courts are usually traumatic. Where the allegations are true, the trauma for the victim, and the family of the victim continues because they are put through a form of trial.  We are trying in this legislation to amelioriate the trauma to some degree.  If we create a situation where we are guaranteed trials within trials on technical issues of law which could postpone a full court hearing for a year or more that would do huge damage to children who have been victims of child sexual abuse.  We have an obligation to say who can carry out these assessments and to clearly set out what their expertise and their qualifications would be.  If the House does not do that we are abdicating that role to the Judiciary and, it is we who are the legislators, not the Judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Fine Gael is a reasonable one. The Minister should have fair regard to the point that the section is much too wide.  The question of narrowing it down <Col N="571" /> and identifying in legislation who is qualified to carry out such interviews is something we can look at more closely later. If we were to confine it to the rather close definition given by Deputy Shatter, I would be concerned about the possibility of being able to find an adequate number of these people to assist the process.  I take his point about the scenario he has painted of the over enthusiastic university graduate working peripherally or actively in this field having certain views that might not synchronise with the more established and qualified view of professionals working in the area.  There is the risk of people working their way around this process because it need not necessarily be relied upon in an investigation of this sort.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, when these cases, particularly child sexual abuse cases, emerge it is very much the social worker who discovers it or believes it exists or who has been consulted who takes charge.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Garda Síochána, the social worker has a big input into how the investigation is conducted and how the victims are attended to and looked after.  We have to be very careful that a situation does not arise whereby this section might, for all practical purposes, be abandoned by the welfare agencies. However, because the section introduces a new concept, and a substantial portion of the evidence at any subsequent trial could be the video-recording of the pre-trial process which can be a very significant factor in a jury arriving at a conclusion, it is important that the interview is done on a precise, clinical and professional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also heard of many disturbing and worrying cases &mdash; although I was not directly involved at a professional level &mdash; where anatomical dolls and other devices were used in interviews to suggest or create beliefs rather than to assist people to come to objective conclusions.  We have to be very careful about this matter. It is important therefore that this new procedure should be clinically controlled in a professional way.  If the wording of <Col N="572" /> the section is left as it stands, it will be very worrying if, in the initial stages when this idea will be the subject of close scrutiny and challenged by the defence, the process is brought into disrepute because we, in the Legislature, did not establish a high standard to ensure that the public and the courts have full confidence in the procedure.</P>
    <P>The other point I wish to raise relates to amendment No. 37 which I withdrew earlier but which is germane to this section also.  May I ask the Minister of State &mdash; perhaps Deputy Shatter would know a bit more about this matter in the light of his experience in this area of the law &mdash; if it is not conceivable that a child sexual abuse case for example, might well involve a young person who witnessed a friend or a sibling, brother or sister, being sexually abused and who may on another occasion have also been a victim? Within the close confines of the family it is not unusual, where one child has been abused, for a second or third member of the same family to be abused in time. On occasion, one child witnesses another being abused.</P>
    <P>Would it not be proper and fair, if interviews are pre-recorded with these children who may well make useful witnesses at the trial involving the other child, to make the recording available as evidence at the trial where it could be relied upon?  That was the purport of amendment No. 37 which I withdrew earlier. It is also relevant and germane to this section, which is specifically confined to the testimony of the victim.</P>
    <P>I can envisage occasions &mdash; I hope they do not occur often &mdash; when interviews with young children who witnessed a brother or sister or a friend being abused could be of assistance at a trial in the same way as a video recording of the interview with the victim.  As I understand it, these interviews will take place at the early stages following the intervention of clinical professionals to help them to establish the facts and to counsel, console and rehabilitate the victim.  They can form, and often do, a relevant and useful part of the overall testimony to be presented to the court.  Surely the same <Col N="573" /> concepts and principles should apply where, for example, the young person involved is not the victim for the purposes of the trial but would make a relevant witness nonetheless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the case made by Deputy Shatter in support of his amendments, amendments Nos. 28 and 41.  He mentioned that experts could draw false conclusions and cited as an example a case, that he himself was involved in, which involved a medical practitioner, an ordinary general practitioner. I do not know what other experts he is referring to but if somebody could point out an expert in any field who has not made a mistake or drawn false conclusions I would love to meet him.  On the other hand, I agree that we must be careful about this matter.</P>
      <P>Usually, in the criminal law area there is in the United Kingdom or some neighbouring jurisdiction, a precedent for any legislation which is brought before this House and we can examine such a precedent to see how it operates in practice. However, there is no similar legislation to this in the United Kingdom.  It is entirely new.  I have asked my officials if there is any similar provision in any jurisdiction that we could examine and I have been informed that there may be a similar provision in Canadian law.  I undertake, to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage to see if indeed there is a similar provision in Canadian law and to find out how it works in practice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter made the point that, by inserting the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, interviews may only be carried out by one individual. He further made the point that we should allow more than one person to do so and change the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;.  It is my advice that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes the plural but I have no great objection and can ask my officials to change it if the Deputy thinks this would make the matter clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also said that there is a danger that interviews will be conducted by newly qualified social workers, and I can sympathise with him.  While I have no practical experience in this area <Col N="574" /> and Deputy Shatter's knowledge is greater than my own, it has been brought to my attention that some social workers who become involved in these cases as witnesses are predisposed to believe that the accused is guilty.  It would be undesirable if such people were to become witnesses for the prosecution or be the interviewers of those people, whose evidence is videorecorded, on a wide scale. The person appointed to conduct the interview must, in the opinion of the court, be appropriately qualified for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>These are pre-court hearing interviews.  The court does not become involved until after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true but the point is that the trial judge will be entitled to exclude any part of the recording which he thinks should be excluded in the interests of justice.  Perhaps this safeguard is not sufficient.  The interviewer's lack of experience and qualifications could become a matter on which the defendant could appeal to a higher court. As I have said, I have no practical experience in this area but it would seem to me if the person who conducted the interview with the accused did not carry it out in a proper and fair fashion this would be evident from the video tape, and the trial judge is obliged by the legislation to examine the video tape before it is admitted in evidence.  As I said, it will soon become obvious if the interviewer was being unfair and leaning against the accused in the interview, as it is not just the answers that will be recorded but also the questions.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy McCartan's point that if the amendment, as drafted, is accepted we could run into a problem in relation to numbers.  It is my own view that people who in the past, because of court procedures and the cross-examination process have been afraid to make a complaint, may be more disposed to do so when this legislation is in force.  Therefore, the number of cases could increase.</P>

    <P>Another point which occurs to me is that the use of the word &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; may <Col N="575" /> give rise to difficulties; for instance, a woman member of the Garda may have to be present even though she will not participate in the interview.  Amendment No. 37, tabled by Deputy McCartan, suggests that it should be possible to video-record the evidence of young witnesses in these cases.  I take this point but it would be a considerable jump.  We want to put this in context and to maintain a certain balance.  We are allowing the prosecution &mdash; and indeed the person who makes the complaint &mdash; to give evidence by way of video recording provided that they will be available for cross-examination, if needed.  That is quite a dramatic jump and to allow one, two, three or more witnesses also to give their evidence by way of video recording seems to be a substantial extension of the proposed section which, in itself, is a substantial extension of the law as it stands. However, as I said, I am prepared to look at that matter.  I will look at the position in Canada to see if there are similar provisions there and see how they work in practice.  I wonder whether it is appropriate for the Bill to contain a detailed definition of the qualifications which the interviewer should have.</P>
    <P>Deputies Shatter and McCartan have often used the Law Reform Commission to support their arguments and, in response, I said that the commission are not the sole repository of wisdom. However, the Law Reform Commission did not suggest that the qualifications should be set out in detail in the legislation; they proposed that an out of court interview should be &ldquo;conducted by an appropriate person, e.g., an appropriately qualified child examiner called in the Bill an intermediary, a doctor, a psychologist, a ban garda or a social worker&rdquo;.  I have no strong feelings in this regard one way or the other but I am conscious of the need to get this right.  At present it should be left to the courts to decide whether, in any particular case, those conducting an interview of this kind are appropriately qualified.  It is important that the interview is conducted properly and whether, in the opinion of the <Col N="576" /> court, the statements &mdash; or some of the statements &mdash; recorded may, fairly, be admitted in evidence.  Before such a recording can be shown to the jury at the trial, the trial judge will have to satisfy himself that it can properly be admitted, wholly or partly.  He will have to do that irrespective of the qualifications of the interviewer, as is written into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I was asked last night by Deputy Kavanagh about this point and I will repeat what I said in reply.  The appointment of intermediaries will, in the initial stages anyway, be in the hands of the trial judge.  In relation to interviewers, I will discuss with my Department the question of having the qualifications set out but, even if we were to do so, we would have to have a wider definition than that contained in Deputy Shatter's amendment, which is too narrow from the point of view of having other people at the interview, and the question of numbers, referred to by Deputy McCartan.  In view of the reservations of the Law Reform Commission in this regard we will have to give serious thought to whether we restrict the sort of people who can conduct interviews.  As I said, it is a difficult question because the legislation is new. In view of the arguments advanced by Deputy Shatter, I will give the matter further consideration but I must also take the views of the Law Reform Commission into account and they have suggested the exact opposite to Deputy Shatter's proposal.</P>
    <P>I cannot give a commitment at present that I will accept the amendment but I am prepared to ask my officials if it is necessary to make it clear that more than one person can conduct the interview. My advice is that the word &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes the plural.  I accept the Deputy's point that, perhaps in some cases, the interview can be conducted by more than one interviewer and we will see whether that matter can be clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have the report of the Law Reform Commission.  It seems that different types of interviews could be video recorded.  The interview conducted <Col N="577" /> under section 15 (1) (b) might be one conducted in a Garda station by a ban garda with a child which might be video recorded or it could be the elaborate type of assessment I just described which certainly would not be carried out by a ban garda.  The Minister is right in saying that the Law Reform Commission's report on child sexual abuse, paragraph 7.20, envisages interviews being conducted by an appropriate person.  They give the example of an appropriate qualified child examiner, a doctor, psychologist, ban garda or social worker.  It is important that the Bill clarifies exactly what sort of statements will be videoed and shown in court.  I do not have any problems with a ban garda asking general questions, indeed, if I had my way I would bring into operation the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provides for video recording all interviews in a Garda station because it would ensure that false allegations of unfair interrogation cannot be made by people brought before our courts.  It would also ensure that, when there are allegations of people being ill-treated in Garda custody &mdash; and where there has been such ill-treatment &mdash; it would also be available to be viewed by the court.  That simple interview by a ban garda is a separate item although clearly it falls within the remit of the Bill.  I am talking about more complicated assessments involving the type of matters to which I referred previously. I will not delay the House by repeating them but, when you are talking about those more complex assessments, you need people with proper qualifications. Perhaps this section should have separate portions which deal with a Garda interview of a person who is an alleged victim of a physical or sexual assault.  I do not have any worries about video recording that, it would be a very good idea and I have no objection to it. However, this involves something a good deal more complex, it goes into another area.  complex assessments by professional people to determine &mdash; often in ways which require a great deal of training &mdash; whether there has been a sexual assault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> I do not think the report of the Law Reform Commission came to terms fully with the differences between an interview by a ban garda and the use of anatomical dolls, play and other approaches by child psychiatrists or social workers.  However, other aspects of the report deal with this in some detail and we will be coming to those matters shortly.  If the Minister wants to provide for the video recording of interviews by a ban garda that is fine, but there should be a separate subsection dealing with it.  However, if we are talking about people appropriately qualified using the techniques I described, they need to be defined.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister said he would examine the matter and if this results in substantive proposals on Report Stage they will be very welcome.  However, they will not be welcome if this is just a device to ensure that the vote on an issue is put on Report Stage rather than on Committee Stage.  I appreciate that is not the Minister's approach and we are trying to be constructive.  I am saying that there is a need to sub-divide this.  I will be dealing with the report of the Law Reform Commission when debating amendments Nos. 39 and 40 and I will be asking the Minister about the Pigot Advisory Group and the code of practice they suggest should apply in this area.  It is not clear that this Bill provides for a code of practice or for anyone laying down a code of practice. There is a very important interaction between that recommendation of the Law Reform Commission and what will be done under this section and its application to cases of child sexual abuse. Indeed it seems to me there are parts of the report of the Law Reform Commission in that regard that require statutory provision which is not being implemented under this Bill.  I will not dwell any further on this.  I welcome the Minister's indication that he will examine it.</P>
    <P>I might make one further comment and, in doing so, respond to Deputy McCartan.  I would say to the Minister: please look at it, not through the narrow confines of the advice available in the Department of Justice.  One of the problems <Col N="579" /> we encounter in dealing with legislation of this nature is the artificial boundaries drawn between the Departments of Justice and Health.  Deputy McCartan quite properly asked whether, if we did define who are the qualified people, there would be sufficient of them in the country.  As I understand it, the answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but they are under pressure because health boards were not in a position to make assessments with regard to allegations of child sexual abuse.  Teams have been established or are supposed to have been established within each health board area with the necessary expertise to carry out such assessments and conduct such interviews.  In so far as there may be a health board area that does not have a team available to it, that is the fault of the Department of Health and of the relevant health board.  In Dublin there is a north side team and a south side team, one operating out of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, and the other out of Temple Street Hospital, as I understand it.</P>
    <P>If it is recognised that we need qualified people to carry out this type of work for the purposes of determining the truth or falsity of allegations of sexual abuse, we cannot say: Ah, well, if we do not have the qualified people we will go alone with unqualified people reaching conclusions and conducting interviews.  We must remember that we are here dealing with the lives of children.  These interviews, if not dealt with properly, can be as traumatic or even more traumatic than the experience the child may have had when being abused.  We are dealing with an area of life that can destroy a family, if a false allegation is made, because it leads to suspicions, perhaps arising between husband and wife, that did not arise at all previously.  We are dealing with an area of great sensitivity and concern.  If we are going to deal with it in this way we would want to use qualified people.  If we do not have sufficient qualified people then we must ensure they are put in place.</P>
    <P>In examining who can be defined within the Bill as a qualified person, the <Col N="580" /> Minister should communicate with the Department of Health, and ascertain from the Minister for Health what teams exist on the ground at present who are undertaking this work; the extent to which they currently co-operate with the Garda; and the extent to which they will be able to co-operate in future in applying the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed the Minister should ensure that, within each health board area, there are the necessary qualified personnel.  There is a need to draw a distinction between the simple interview by a garda with a child or parents in a Garda station and an interview that involves the type of assessments about which I am speaking.  That distinction should be drawn.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold up the business of the House with undue <Col N="581" /> repetition on a day on which we are again over-heated in this Chamber.  I think my colleague, Deputy Deasy, protested to the Ceann Comhairle yesterday about the fact that this Chamber does not have air conditioning, at the fact that this House does not ever appear to be able to regulate itself in a way that makes this Chamber liveable in.  It is fortunate that there are only three of us here today.  I do not know whether it is the heat that has driven out the Labour Party or whether they have just no interest in this Bill.  Certainly they appear to have little interest in the justice area since they had no one in for the Justice Question Time and no one in the Chamber today on an issue of great importance, which I find extraordinary.  But, in relation to the heat of the House, we are going to have to do something about this Chamber.  Indeed if we are still here at 1.30 this afternoon I am going to set a precedent by removing my jacket.  I do not think the breath of the nation will stop if Members of this House remove their jackets when conducting business in this House.  It is quite extraordinary that we have to put up with the working conditions we have here. Obviously the heat has driven out the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are interrelated and deal with the issue about which I spoke a few moments ago.  Under the terms of section 15 (1) (b) &mdash; dealing with videorecording of interviews, there is a proviso which reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that, in the case of a videorecording mentioned in paragraph (b),...</P>
      <P>It does seem to me that while paragraph (b) may apply in other areas its drafters had child sexual abuse essentially in mind.  Therefore, what the section boils down to is that, for a videorecording of a statement, made by a child who has been the victim of an alleged sexual abuse, to be admitted at the trial of the offence as evidence of any facts stated therein, the following provisos must be complied with:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  it has been considered in accordance <Col N="582" /> with section 14 (2) by the judge of the District Court conducting the preliminary examination of the offence, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the person whose statement was videorecorded is available at the trial for cross-examination.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>(2) If at a preliminary examination of an offence to which this Part applies the person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed is available for cross-examination, any statement made by him on a videorecording mentioned in section 15 (1) (b) may be considered by the judge of the District Court conducting the preliminary examination.</P>
    <P>In other words, first, the videorecording must be considered by the judge in the District Court and, second, the person &mdash; presumably the child who has been the victim of sexual abuse &mdash; must be available at trial for cross-examination.</P>
    <P>I am proposing two additions to this section.  It would seem to me that these are two conditions the Minister should accept.  This is not an issue that requires to be left in abeyance until Report Stage if Committee Stage is to mean anything. I am proposing that the third condition be that the person who conducted the interview which was videorecorded is available at the trial for cross-examination. In other words, if it is to be a qualified person, defined or undefined &mdash; be it a social worker, child psychologist, child psychiatrist or whoever, that person must be available to give evidence to the court.  Fourth, I propose the condition that no leading questions be asked by the interviewer during the course of such interview.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in this area is as follows: it is quite clear that if someone is to be judged on whether they are or are not a properly qualified person, at the very least they will have to go into the witness box and give evidence as to their qualifications; they are going to have to be available at the trial for the judge.  If that <Col N="583" /> person has been conducting the interview, obviously the nature of any conclusions drawn by that person will be a matter of some importance with regard to the interview.</P>
    <P>In the area of leading questions one of the huge difficulties in a whole series of cases in England to which I referred on Second Stage, was that it was discovered &mdash; in the context of the type of interview techniques I previously described &mdash; there was a difference between an interview carried out for forensic purposes and an interview for other purposes, to which I referred as therapeutic purposes. When interviews were undertaken by child psychiatrists and social workers, for so-called therapeutic purposes, they asked leading questions which were effectively putting words into a child's mouth.  Then, having put the words into the child's mouth, the so-called therapeutic interview was used as a means of confirming that a child had been abused.</P>
    <P>There was a whole series of civil cases in England where the courts held that the use of leading questions ensured that any responses received were entirely unreliable in that a young child would often respond, or could respond in a way, to please the adult interviewing him or her, or the child, who did not necessarily have the command of the English language of the adult putting the questions, could give answers to which adults gave a different meaning to the meaning attributed to them by the child.  This is addressed at some length by the Law Reform Commission in their consultation paper and final report on child sexual abuse.  The Minister has both reports so I will not delay the House by going into them in detail.  In addressing the matter of leading questions, I now quote from page 83 of &ldquo;A Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse&rdquo;.  Under the heading, &ldquo;Leading Questions&rdquo;, the report states:</P>
    <P>In the Consultation Paper, we considered the controversy and debate <Col N="584" /> that has arisen in relation to the reliability and status of testimony elucidated by professionals from children suspected of being sexually abused. We pointed out that many workers in the area of child sexual abuse had modified their clinical techniques using the assistance and advice of the courts and legal experts so that the interviewing in many cases was more acceptable to the courts.</P>
    <P>As the debate had not taken place in Ireland, the Law Reform Commission was to a large extent relying on the experience in England and elsewhere in this regard.  At the time of this report, those professionals had modified their approach and this had started to be mirrored in the professional approach being taken by the teams established by the health boards, although perhaps not always mirrored by some other individuals who work in this area.  It continues:</P>
    <P>We also set out a summary of the stages of interviewing and the modified structured interview now in use in Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the vast majority of the law cases to which I referred the Minister on Second Stage relate to the English Family Law Report, 1987, and derived from interviews carried out in the Great Ormond Street Hospital where this whole technique was pioneered.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>We provisionally recommend that:</P>
    <P>(1)  at no stage in the investigative process in relation to child sexual abuse prosecutions should the child be subjected to leading questions.</P>
    <P>(2)  This exclusion of leading questions should apply also in non-criminal cases where an issue of child sexual abuse arose.</P>
    <P>There was no dissent from these provisional recommendations, which we accordingly confirm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The commission went into great detail on this matter in their report but there is no reference at all to this recommendation in the Bill before us.  This recommendation is uniquely applicable to section 15 and in particular to the subsection which applies to the video recording of these interviews.</P>
    <P>The Pigot Advisory Group were set up to advise on a code of practice for this area and what they suggested be covered by a code of practice is contained in Appendix A of A Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse. The code of practice details the practices that should be adopted in the type of interviews that are envisaged should take place under section 15 to determine whether an allegation of child sexual abuse is or is not properly made.  Unfortunately, a great many of their recommendations are not contained in the Bill. I believe it should not be left to the Judiciary to put this code of practice in place through a series of decided cases in the same way as judges rules in the criminal law area have evolved over the years.  This code of practice should be incorporated as part of the Bill and where possible should form a statutory part and where that is not possible should be put in place through ministerial order made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>If I may, I will mark the Minister's card because if he does not table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the making of ministerial orders to allow a code of practice to be put in place along the lines recommended by the Pigot Advisory Group, it is my intention to table such an amendment on Report Stage.  There is no reason that this type of code of practice should not be put in place by legislators rather than being evolved through case law and judicial application.</P>
    <P>The Pigot Advisory Group suggest that in relation to the timing of interviews:</P>
    <P>The video taped interview should be conducted as soon as practicable after an offence has been reported &mdash; no more than several days &mdash; but allowing for sufficient time for inter agency consultation, <Col N="586" /> consideration of the circumstances surrounding the case and prior medical examination where appropriate.  The video taped interview should broadly equate with a witness statement in which the first detailed account of a complaint is given to the police.  A supplementary interview can be done in those cases where the prosecutor having viewed the video and considered the papers in the case, needs to elicit further information.</P>
    <P>And that in relation to location:</P>
    <P>Video taped interviews can take place in purpose built suites in hospitals or in police stations where suitable facilities are available.</P>
    <P>They also deal with the type of equipment to be used.  Under the heading of &ldquo;Participants&rdquo;, they state:</P>
    <P>Ideally, the child should be interviewed by a single interviewer, nominated by the different agencies of child welfare and police department.  With very small children, parents can be present.</P>
    <P>There is no indication, Sir, as to the role parents ought to play.  I appreciate that if an allegation of sexual abuse is made against a parent, it will certainly not be appropriate for the parent to be present at the interview but where the allegation of sexual abuse or the person suspected of sexual abuse is not a parent, for example, a baby sitter, a stranger or a teacher or some other person not connected with the immediate family, surely the parents should be given the possibility of being present and, in fact, there should be a clear rule stating that if they wish to be present they may be present.  It should not be possible to obstruct their presence. However, there is nothing in the Bill about this.</P>
    <P>The Pigot Advisory Group seem to be talking about interviews in the Garda stations rather than the more elaborate assessment I had in mind and they envisage that the interviewer will normally be a social worker or a police officer. However, they state that: &ldquo;The interviewer <Col N="587" /> will normally be a social worker or police officer specially trained in the handling of child abuse cases.&rdquo; In other words, the ordinary ban garda or social worker who has not had special training should not be involved in this area.  They further state:</P>
    <P>Because it is envisaged that recorded interviews will substantially replace examination-in-chief at the trial, interviewers must receive training in the law of evidence, especially as it relates to rules and procedures for the examination of witnesses in court.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Consent&rdquo;, the group suggest:</P>
    <P>Consent of child witnesses and their parents to the making of a video recording should only be sought where consent would be necessary if the interview were not recorded.  However, the fullest possible information should always be given to interested parties. Where serious offences have been committed against children, video recording should be the standard and accepted way in which the evidence is given to the police and the courts.  If a tape is to be used subsequently for training purposes, specific consent should be sought.</P>
    <P>On the question of conducting the interview, the Pigot Advisory Group state:</P>
    <P>The Committee endorsed the &ldquo;stepwise&rdquo; approach to the interview which requires the interviewer to proceed from the most general open aspects of the interview to the more specific.</P>
    <P>The advisory group deals specifically with leading questions, the subject matter of this amendment.  They state:</P>
    <P>Video taped interviews should be conducted as far as possible in accordance with the rules of evidence which govern the examination-in-chief of witnesses in court, which it is designed to replace.  Thus, leading questions should be avoided.  Where children are concerned the courts already allow <Col N="588" /> some latitude in this area depending upon the child's age and understanding. We think the important point is that interviewers should never be the first to suggest that a particular offence was committed or that a particular person was the perpetrator.  We do not believe that the courts would exclude fairly conducted interviews for purely technical reasons or because of the inclusion of occasional insignificant leading questions.  Nevertheless, it should be remembered that crucial leading questions which relate to the central facts of a case must be avoided wherever possible.  This may well result in the exclusion of the interview at court.</P>
    <P>My amendment, in effect, means that no leading questions are asked by the interviewer in the course of such interview. That is essential because in my view asking leading questions can result in a very young child making a comment which an adult could regard as an indication that someone has sexually abused the child when the reality is that the child's comment was not intended to result in such a conclusion being drawn. Amendment No. 39 would ensure that the person who conducts the interview would be available to the court for cross-examination and would ensure that leading questions would not be asked.  I think this should be set down very clearly at this stage in the use of the new technique in the context of court hearings.</P>
    <P>As we are discussing amendments Nos. 39 and 40 together, I will now comment on amendment No. 40.  Amendment No. 40 deals with the Pigot Advisory Group recommendation No. 8 &mdash; to which I have not yet referred &mdash; and with the Law Reform Commission's recommendation on page 83 of their report on the use of anatomical dolls.  Amendment No. 40 deals with the issue of anatomical dolls to which I have already referred substantially. It seeks to insert additional words in section 15 (3).  Section 15 (3) states that: &ldquo;In estimating the weight, if any, to be attached to any statement contained in such a video recording <Col N="589" /> regard shall be had to all the circumstances from which any inference can reasonably be drawn as to its accuracy or otherwise&rdquo;.  I am seeking in my amendment to insert after the words &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and save in exceptional circumstances regard shall not be had to any video recording of an interview in which anatomical dolls were used as an aid by the interviewer&rdquo;.  This would allow the use of an anatomical doll but only in exceptional cases where it is necessary to use it.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, in making reference to their earlier working paper, state:</P>
    <P>We also referred to the use of anatomical dolls by medical and police personnel in the investigation of child sexual abuse cases.  We provisionally recommended that since, under the existing law, the courts will exclude statements which are obtained in circumstances unfair to the accused and convictions will in any event be unlikely without corroboration, the use of such techniques which are clearly of assistance to many of those professionally concerned with the investigation of possible child sexual abuse, should not be outlawed.</P>
    <P>There was little dissent from this provisional conclusion.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>We would endorse the view of the Pigot Advisory Group that they should only be used to help the child establish details with which he or she may have verbal difficulties once the general substance of a complaint is clear.</P>
    <P>The Pigot Advisory Group state:</P>
    <P>A code of practice should make clear that such aids should only be used to help the child establish details with which he or she may have verbal difficulties once the general substance of a complaint is clear.</P>
    <P>In other words, they believe these dolls should not be brought into use at an early stage in the carrying out of an assessment and generally should only be regarded as of use for very young children who are not yet fully articulate.  It is important <Col N="590" /> that we are circumspect about the evidential use of play with anatomical dolls in drawing conclusions as to whether abuse has or has not taken place.</P>
    <P>The Minister may take exception to the words &ldquo;save in exceptional cases&rdquo;. He may feel that an amendment relating to anatomical dolls would be appropriate but that it could be phrased somewhat differently.  Because many judges in this jurisdiction do not yet have a great deal of experience in the use of anatomical dolls and the dangers in that use &mdash; I admit that some of them have had that experience and voiced worries in cases of which I am aware &mdash; there is a very specific need in the context of section 15 (3) to draw the attention of a court to the specific dangers inherent in using anatomical dolls as part of the interview technique in determining, in a forensic sense, whether an allegation of child sexual abuse has any substance.  There should be an express reference to this issue in section 15.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some considerable length on this very important matter.  A great deal of concern has been expressed about the issue of child sexual abuse and I find it somewhat depressing that there are so few Deputies engaging in this discussion. I regret that the debate is becoming somewhat specialist as between the three lawyers in this House.  As I said, this is a very important issue and I hope the Minister will look very seriously at these amendments.  I hope he will indicate in his response how he and his Department intend to deal with and implement the recommendations of the Pigot Advisory Group, whether he disagrees with any of those recommendations and the changes he would like to see made to them.  I believe there should be a rule of practice in relation to the usage of this section and the various problems associated with it, such as that contained in the recommendations made by the Pigot Advisory Group.  There are one or two points in those recommendations with which I would quibble slightly but they are certainly much better than having nothing there at all; indeed, they have substantial merit.  I should like <Col N="591" /> to hear the Minister's views on whether anything will be done about those recommendations.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to make a plea to the other two Members present in the House, both of whom, I understand, have been consulted by their Whips as to the likely progress we will make in regard to this legislation this morning.  I understand it was specifically said by Deputy Shatter to his Whip that we would conclude the debate comfortably by 1.30 p.m.  We have spent half the time available to us this morning debating section 15.  I accept that the points made are very important.  As Deputy Shatter correctly said, this is a very important and sensitive issue.  However, I plead with him to send a signal to his Whip that we will not make considerable progress on the Bill before 1.30 p.m.  This Bill constitutes a hallmark in the area of criminal evidence.  Part IV, with which we will deal later, deals with the very important issue of competence and with compellability in regard to spouses as witnesses in criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright has put down an important amendment in regard to the powers of arrest.  I have put down an amendment which deals with the crucial issue of testamentary evidence by way of document and certificate in preliminary hearings in a District Court.  Both the chairman and I dealt at length with this issue during a recent visit abroad by the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  I would be outraged if, having made little or no progress on the Bill this morning, we were told at 1.30 p.m.  that a guillotine would be put on the debate.  Again I plead with both the Minister and Deputy Shatter to send some signal to their Whips that the placing of a guillotine on the debate at 1.30 p.m.  should not be contemplated, which I understand is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues dealt with in these amendments are very crucial and important. The more I listened to what Deputy Shatter said the more I came to the conclusion that we should be working towards a <Col N="592" /> substantive section which would deal with the powers given to the Minister to introduce regulations dealing with the vast range of issues commented on by the Law Reform Commission and the Pigot Advisory Group.  The clear indication is that the Law Reform Commission and the other committees who have looked at this area, have laid down very clear guidelines and have analysed many of the inevitable events which will occur and which must be addressed.  The proposal that the person who conducts the interview should be available at the trial for cross-examination is almost a <i>sine qua non</i> of the process.  If this is not already envisaged, it must be provided for as it is the counter balance, so to speak, to this very new and important provision which proposes the bringing in as a testamentary aid and evidence the video recording of an interview which had been made before the trial and even, perhaps before it was ever intended to bring a case to court.  The proposal that the person who conducted the interview should be present at the trial, if necessary is a good proposition.  It struck me that this was already intended in the legislation and if it is not then it must be provided for.</P>
    <P>The second issue dealt with in the amendment is the proposition that no leading questions can be asked by the interviewer.  That is a good proposal in principle.  Both the Pigot Advisory Group and the Law Reform Commission said that no crucial leading questions should be asked.  As a matter of practicality, there is a need to qualify the absolute embargo because if one asks, for example, the chairman, who is present in the Chamber and who is outside the debate, if he is Deputy John Stafford, in essence that can be regarded as a leading question.  If the interviewer comes into the room and leads off by trying to win the confidence of the person being interviewed it is a very useful and permissible device to ask them leading questions which may help them to loosen up.  When children enter a room where video cameras are in use and with strange surroundings they may tend to clam up.  By <Col N="593" /> asking them their name it helps them to loosen up.  Therefore, an absolute prohibition of leading questions, as suggested in the amendment, is not desirable.  However, I accept the proposition advanced by the Law Reform Commission and in the Pigot report, that no leading crucial questions dealing with the central issue of the complaint being investigated be allowed.  For example, to suggest what exactly happened or to suggest the identity of the person accused or suspected of the offence clearly should not be allowed. We should agree to the suggestion that these matters be provided for by way of regulations.</P>
    <P>The third issue relates to the use of anatomical dolls.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Shatter with regard to the incredible suggestiveness of these dolls.  They are designed in such a way as to help people to describe rather than conclude exactly what happened.  In some circumstances they were used by well-intentioned social workers to suggest rather than to help as a descriptive aid.  It is important that we be cautious about how these dolls are to be employed.  One difficulty was that a child in the close confines of a room with a social worker or a medical practitioner, by interchange with the interviewer, learned about what parts go where so that when the time came to give testimony the child repeated what he or she had learned in the room.  One can imagine the dramatic impact it would have on the jury to see the child correctly fitting the anatomical dolls together.  I believe it is now the practice not to allow anatomical dolls at criminal trials and they are not relied upon in testimony before the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter has suggested the inclusion of &ldquo;save in exceptional circumstances&rdquo; may be a restriction.  We should be working more towards the formula in the Pigot report of these dolls being used simply as aids to description rather than to make suggestions.  I support the general thrust of the amendments but because there are so many other matters to be addressed that were dealt with in the Pigot report and by the <Col N="594" /> Law Reform Commission, the Minister should best address this issue by agreeing to introduce on Report Stage a comprehensive provision allowing for him or the Minister to introduce regulations appropriate to these matters, indicating the general thrust of the regulations.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of Deputy Shatter's amendment, he made two points in support of his proposal. The first point is that the interviewer would have to be available at the trial to give evidence of his or her qualifications, but I do not accept that.  It is up to the court to satisfy itself that the interviewers are appropriately qualified. The prosecution would have to produce all the proof in this regard and they can do so by ensuring that the interviewer is present.  Alternatively, section 5 provides that documentary evidence as to qualifications shall be produced &mdash; indeed, that is one of the main reasons for section 5. I would point out that if the prosecution does not call the interviewer but the defence wish to call that person there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. As the amendment is framed it would be an essential condition to admitting videorecordings that the interviewer be available, but I am not sure that should be the case.  If, for some reason, the interviewer is not available &mdash; for example, if the interviewer has died or is not available for some reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many reasons why the interviewer would not be available, and it would be unfair that the interviewer be available in one case and not available in another.  Therefore, I cannot accept the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of Deputy Shatter's amendment relates to leading questions. I do not think the debate so far has taken sufficient account of the role of the court in this matter, and the role of courts generally, to exclude, as being inadmissible, <Col N="595" /> any evidence that contravenes the defendant's constitutional rights or that is basically unfair.  Not only does the court have a wider constitutional role in this matter but it is specifically directed by the terms of this legislation.  I have some sympathy with Deputy Shatter's proposal regarding leading questions but I wonder if it is necessary in view not only of the right of the court in this regard but of their duty to exclude what is unfair to the defendant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter quoted an extract from the report of the Pigot committee in Britain.  That report states: &ldquo;We do not believe that the courts would exclude fairly conducted interviews for purely technical reasons or because of the inclusion of occasional insignificant leading questions&rdquo;.  I could not accept an amendment which totally excludes all leading questions.  Deputy McCartan made a very good case for allowing certain types of trivial leading questions which do not change the nature of the evidence and do not balance what is being said one way or the other.  I cannot give sympathetic consideration to the total exclusion of all leading questions because it is possible that harmless leading questions may be asked.  The Pigot Advisory Group, in referring to crucial leading questions said:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it should be remembered that crucial leading questions which relate to the central facts of a case must be avoided wherever possible. This may well result in the exclusion of the interview at court.</P>
    <P>The courts are now very aware of the danger of leading questions and would be willing to exclude evidence which is obtained on a videorecording by way of leading questions being asked.  They are not only entitled to do so but are obliged to do so.  Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 40 referred to anatomical dolls and states:</P>
    <P>and save in exceptional circumstances regard shall not be had to any videorecording of an interview in <Col N="596" /> which anatomical dolls were used as an aid by the interviewer.</P>
    <P>My initial inclination is to leave the question of admissibility of videorecordings in which these dolls are used to be governed by the court in the exercise of its duty to exclude any evidence which should be excluded in the interests of justice.  The Pigot committee recommended for inclusion in its suggested code of practice, under the heading &ldquo;Anatomically Correct Dolls&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>A code of practice should make clear that such aids should only be used to help the child to establish details with which he or she may have verbal difficulties once the general substance of a complaint is clear.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with that.  I am alive to the dangers of evidence secured by the use of these aids, and Deputy McCartan has made a very good case. However, Deputy McCartan's case can also be turned the other way around.  The Deputy is saying that because it has been demonstrated that this thing can give a misleading impression, because the witness can learn the process, the courts are inclined to exclude the evidence.  If the courts are so alive to the possibility that they are inclined to exclude the evidence in these cases, it should not be necessary to write in a specific power to exclude. The Pigot committee seemed to suggest that these artificial devices should be the exception rather than the rule and that they should only be used when it is clear what the substance of the complaint is.  I would prefer to leave it to be regulated by a code of practice, but I have no objection to a suggestion to my Department that they look at amending the section in a way which would make it clear that the use of artificial devices would only be in cases where the general substance of the complaint is clear.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy McCartan's question on the recommendations of the Pigot committee, I will ask my Department to draw up an administrative code of practice which will contain guidelines in this area.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(iii)  the person who conducted the interview which was videorecorded is available at the trial for cross-examination, or</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide some sort of administrative practice code in relation to the Pigot recommendations.  My difficulty with that is that it would have no statutory force.  I am not quite sure to whom the code will be directed.  The Minister might clarify that for us.  If something of that nature is to be put in place there is no reason why we cannot take a copy of the relevant provision from the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provided the rules of conduct to be made in relation to interviewing to be brought before the House and confirmed by statutory instrument.  Such a practice direction or code could be dealt with in that way so that it would have some legal force.  Is the Minister prepared to undertake to the House to make available to Members of the House a particular form of direction he has in mind, before Report Stage, so that we will know precisely how it will fit into the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's responses to the amendment that I tabled, I accepted that one could deal with the &ldquo;no leading questions&rdquo; issue with a different form of wording.  However, what the Minister says about the provision which would require the person who conducted the interview to be available to the court is a cause of great concern.  There are criminal trials which on occasions either cannot go ahead or cannot use evidence because a witness is dead.  Unfortunately, there is not much we can do about that. However, in the overwhelming number of instances where this technique is to be used, unless the social workers and the child psychiatrists of this country are to be struck down by an unanticipated disease it is highly unlikely that we will have a problem with large numbers of people conducting interviews dropping dead between the date of the interview and the date of the trial.  What is of concern, as Deputy McCartan pointed out, is that the professional who undertakes an interview may very well go abroad for professional reasons and when that interview <Col N="599" /> is being conducted it is not clear that the video, for example, will include not just the child but the questioner.  The Minister might clarify this.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether an enthusiastic questioner of a child might not, by facial reactions to the answers given, signify approval or disapproval of what the child is saying or might not do that by his mannerisms.  Indeed, when a child gives a response to a question asked, that response may be open to a variety of interpretations.  From the point of view of the prosecution it may be of importance that the interviewer be present to give evidence as to what the interviewer believes the child meant by what the child said.  From the point of view of someone against whom an allegation is made, he may want to ask the same question of the interviewer and he may call an independent professional witness with similar qualifications who has viewed the video to indicate whether his understanding of what the child meant coincided with that of the interviewer.  The questions an interviewer asks, on the assumption that they are not all written out in advance, may be stimulated by a reply received to a previous question.</P>
    <P>In a criminal trial where we start off on an assumption that one is innocent until proven guilty, the idea that someone who has conducted a central interview of an alleged victim on an incident that has given rise to the trial in the first instance, and that that person may not be present to give evidence, is extraordinary.  It conjures up images of the book by Franz Kafka, <i>The Trial,</i> when unknown evidence was being given against someone who could not quite find out what it was he was being accused of by unknown people.  We are talking about a criminal trial.  I would envisage constitutional difficulties with this section, if the State sought to prosecute a case and produced a video with, for example, the person who conducted the interview being out of the country and the accused's lawyers not being able to even <i>subpoena</i> that person to attend that court, and the State insisted that nevertheless this whole <Col N="600" /> interview could be presented to the court even though that person was not available. I can see huge problems with that. I am not raising this as a debating point. It is a problem, an issue which we would need to address properly.  It is very easy to put this to a vote but in the light of what the Minister and Deputy McCartan have said, I would like to go back and look at this amendment, in particular the phraseology of the leading questions portion of it.  It would seem to me that that amendment could be better phrased. That is the usefulness of this procedure. I will not press amendment No. 39 but I will propose an amended version on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will listen seriously to what I am saying about the person conducting the interview being available to the court.  If we maintain that the courts will have to judge the fairness of these interviews and what can or cannot be admitted, we will be setting up a series of trials upon trials.  There will be a series of court cases to tease out what is fair and what is not.  Rather than facilitating the criminal justice process we will be creating a line of cases awaiting hearing while various appeals go through.  In so far as we can lay down the parameters of the application of this legislation, we have a duty to do so.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the Minister's response on the issues relating to the use of anatomical dolls and I am considering pressing that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's view is that this whole matter should rest with the court and that each court should decide what is fair and proper in the circumstances.  We would then end up with so many trials within trials upon issues in this legislation that this would add to the length and complexity of many cases.  That is not good practice.  This is a matter of crucial importance and it is incumbent on us to set down guidelines for the practice of law throughout the whole country.  I am worried that different approaches could be taken by different judges on different circuits that would frustrate the development of the criminal <Col N="601" /> law and jurisprudence in that there would not be cohesiveness and consistency of approach.  A practitioner going to the south-east circuit would have to ask about the attitude of a particular judge to the professional witness.  Some judges might regard that person as not being a witness; other judges would maintain it would be unconstitutionally unfair not to have the professional person available. There could be variations.  There could also be disagreement about leading questions and the use of anatomical dolls.  It is not desirable in practice to leave it to individual judges and cases for rules to be built up.  Confusion would certainly arise.  In Dublin judges could be trying cases contemporaneously.  One judge might allow the video to be shown even if the interviewer were not available, but a judge sitting down the corridor in another court might rule othewise.  That would not be good practice.  The courts will round on us when this issue comes before them and will quite correctly criticise us for not laying down guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Minister should at least give an undertaking that he will consider a general provision enabling him to bring in regulations which will cover a range of issues dealt with by Pigot and the Law Reform Commission.  The guidelines should be a matter for regulation under legislation as a way of introducing a standard national approach in all courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the submission made by the Incorporated Law Society.  They make the valid point that it appears these videos will be presented as if they establish the facts of the allegations contained.  They say it seems that the video recording of the interview with the witness can be used in evidence if the witness is available at the trial for cross-examination.  This suggests the prosecution would present the videorecording of the evidence and then invite the defence to cross-examine the witness on the basis of the video.  They say in practice this would be counterproductive as the witness would be launched into a cross-examination without the settling effect of an examination-in-chief. Can the Minister of State comment on the different types of videos referred to in paragraph (a) &mdash; a video recording of any evidence given by a person under 17 years of age, and that referred to in paragraph (b), a video recording of any statement made by a person under 14 years of age? Is it intended that they be applied differently or that a video of the type of assessment, to which I have referred, could be presented as the extent of the evidence of alleged sexual assault? There may be one video recording of evidence given in a preliminary examination in a District Court, which is a formal giving of evidence &mdash; and we may say this is the formal giving of evidence, and that this witness is available for cross-examination.  That might be acceptable although there is a point in saying a witness may be unsettled if he or she is immediately launched into a cross-examination; nevertheless that may be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the medical practitioner with relevant qualifications conducting an assessment, could that be presented as the evidence of the allegation and cross-examination could then go ahead? If that is the case it would be a matter of some concern because that type of approach may elicit information that either elucidates <Col N="604" /> the events surrounding the sexual assault or may seek to confirm that one took place.  It may not be a coherent presenting of an incident that took place in a way that is evidentially necessary in the context of a criminal trial.  As in other sections of the Bill, we envisage that the young person giving such evidence would do so in a less formal surrounding than applied heretofore.  It would seem that direct evidence of an alleged offence should be given and it should not be sufficient simply to present the video.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter is correct in his interpretation of the section in relation to paragraph (a).  This is the evidence given by a witness under the age of 17.  The evidence which he will be giving will be at the preliminary examination. That is what will be video recorded and it will be given on a live television link.  He may be cross-examined at the trial on this video recording.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 15 (1) (b), this is an out of court interview on which the person who gives the interview may be cross-examined at the trial.  I realise what the Law Society are saying.  My interpretation of the situation is that the video recording will be in addition to whatever other evidence-in-chief the child may give.  Even though there will not be a full examination-in-chief, because the video will be there as a supplement, nevertheless the child will be giving some evidence-in-chief which may lessen the unsettling effect.  It may be useful to go through the video with a child on the day before or on the morning of the trial as a reminder of what was said.  It is envisaged that the video would be a supplement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is a need to amend this section on Report Stage because this section is open to interpretation as a video may be presented as direct evidence.  There is a danger that could happen.  If that did happen and if a prosecution was properly brought in a case where there had been a sexual assault there would be a real danger, if that evidence was regarded <Col N="605" /> as the evidence-in-chief and a conviction was secured, that that could be upset on appeal and that someone who should be convicted could be let off in the circumstances. I would ask the Minister to look again at that section.  I do not want to dwell on it any further as we have spent a great deal of time on it.  I would ask him to look at it again to ensure that evidence-in-chief is presented.  There are constitutional difficulties here about someone being convicted of an offence in circumstances where the victim has not given primary evidence before the court of the events that took place.</P>

      <P>This is simply a provision to clarify the right of the parties to the proceedings. Section 16 allows the court to transfer a case from its jurisdiction to that of the jurisdiction of a neighbouring or other court that has all the telecommunication and video recording facilities necessary to implement the provisions provided for in Part III.

I am anxious, as I am sure we all are, that the legislation will be fully operable as soon as it is passed.  I am glad to hear there are now three courts in Dublin providing these facilities.

      <P>I move amendment No. 42a:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>17.&mdash;Where, at the trial of a person for an offence to which this Part applied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed is under 17 years of age,</P>
      <P>(b)  evidence is given&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that the accused was known to that person before the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the accused has been identified by that person or another person under that age as being the offender at an identification parade or through another identification procedure,</P>
      <P>that person or that other person shall not be required to so identify the accused at the trial, unless the court in the interests of justice orders otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this amendment to meet concerns expressed by a number of <Col N="608" /> Deputies on Second Stage and also in the light of Deputy Shatter's amendment No. 43.  On reconsideration I am satisfied that section 17 as drafted does not adequately achieve its purpose, that is, to avoid unnecessary in-court identification in child abuse cases.  It also contains a presumption, rebuttable it is true, but only rebuttable when the contrary is proved, in this case by the accused person.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier in another connection, any shifting of the burden of proof onto the accused is objectionable in principle and I want to be consistent in this matter.  The amended text excludes in-court identifications by an alleged victim who is young or mentally handicapped in two cases.  One is where the accused was known to the alleged victim before the offence was committed, say, a relative or a babysitter.  The other is where the alleged victim or another person has identified the accused at an identification parade or through another identification procedure.  In each case it will have been established by evidence that the accused was known to the alleged victim or, as the case may be, that the accused was so identified.</P>
    <P>However, to ensure against any possibility of injustice, the new text provides for the court to allow in-court identification in exceptional circumstances, that is, where such may be required in the interests of justice.  I consider that the amended section achieves a proper balance avoiding unnecessary and traumatic confrontations with those accused of child abuse and the need to ensure fairness of trial procedure, and I commend it to the House on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of section 17 as it stood prior to the amendment the Law Society solicitors made the point that it was an extraordinary provision for which they could find no justification. They state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It involves the reversal of the burden of proof in a criminal case when an accused is identified by a witness under the age of 17.  It is assumed that the <Col N="609" /> purpose of this action is to obviate the necessity of the witness physically picking out an accused in court which may not be possible where there is a live television link.  It creates a presumption in certain circumstances that the person identified on an identification parade or other identification procedure is the accused.  In certain circumstances the accused should be prevented from offering rebuttal evidence without the leave of the court. It is not clear whether the section involves a presumption that the accused was correctly identified or simply that he was the person who was picked out by the witness.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 43 seeks to insert a provision to the effect that &ldquo;nothing contained in this section shall prevent the accused from challenging the validity of the accusation that he has committed an offence to which this Part applies or the accuracy or the identification by the person in respect of whom the offence is alleged to have been committed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment goes some of the way.  Will the Minister tell the House the difference between his amendment and my amendment and the reason for not including this provision in it? It does seem that an accused can still challenge the validity of an accusation that he has committed an offence, even without that provision.  I am wondering about circumstances where there is an allegation that someone has been the victim of a sexual offence and someone has been picked out at an identification parade. Let us say the sexual assault on the person occurred on a 15 or 16 year old late at night in a badly lit area and the victim did not get a full look at the person and in an identification parade the victim picks someone out and that person is then present at the trial.  It could be that the victim picks out the alleged perpetrator within hours or a day of the event when the victim is under stress.  At the trial let us say the victim assumes, and everyone assumes, that the person picked out was the right person.  The victim at the trial may realise that this is not the person. <Col N="610" /> Normally in the witness box the victim would have to identify the person in court and in 999 cases out of 1,000 they identify the accused; the accused is quite obviously there and identifiable.</P>
    <P>I wonder how we deal with the situation where a distraught victim points out someone at an identification parade a short time after an offence has been committed, comes along to a court and cannot recognise anyone?  We assume that the person who is the accused has committed the offence.  How does one deal with that, because people under stress brought by the Garda to identification parades can make serious errors. It seems that when that happens we start off with the presumption that the person identified is the accused and is guilty.  I have great concerns about this because of the uncertainties of identification evidence.</P>
    <P>I fully accept, in the context of child sexual abuse or sexual assault that if the assault is by someone who is a close relation, be it a father or a cousin or a brother, or perpetrated by a babysitter of course, there is no difficulty in identifying that person.  However, what is the position if it is not someone who is related, if a 13 or 14 year old walking down a dark lane late at night is assaulted and picks someone out the following day in an identifications parade and then a trial takes place?  One may, under stress, have picked out the wrong person and that person may find the onus has switched. They are presumed to be the person.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how that will be dealt with in the interests of justice.  A judge will be left with the discretion, in the context of the Minister's amendment.  He may say that it is in the interests of justice, because it was a dark lane and because of the circumstances surrounding it, that this person should again be identified.  I am somewhat uneasy about this.  I feel very strongly that if the person who is accused is the father of the child or a close relation or a babysitter that the child should not be put through the trauma of being physically present in a courtroom and having to point out that <Col N="611" /> person again because that adds to the effect of the events that have taken place on the child.  I am concerned about the other situation.  I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I wonder if we should have yet a further look at this on Report Stage. Also, will the Minister respond to my amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has given me a great deal of trouble.  I thought long and hard about putting down a simple amendment opposing the section but felt it would be better to wait for some debate and discussion on Committee Stage to come to a final conclusion on it.</P>
      <P>I commented yesterday that the Law Society did not see anything particularly good in this revolutionary legislation as we have described it, but in their submission they seemed to be arguing on the Bill entirely from the conservative established point of view.  They were unable to recognise the real efforts being made to move into a modern context of court proceedings, albeit they deal with accused persons standing in the dock who are to be presumed innocent.  Of this section they say: &ldquo;This is an extraordinary provision to which the committee takes exception and for which the committee can find no justification.&rdquo; That is pretty strong language, we have to concede, coming from such an august and conservative body as the Law Society.  They continued:</P>
      <P>It involves the reversal of the burden of proof in a criminal case where an accused is identified by a witness under the age of 17 years.  A reversal of the burden of proof is a rare event, in our view, in terms of the criminal law and should never be introduced except for very good reason and need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, as a practitioner, been involved in cases where people have been placed in the dock by process of wrongful identification. One case some years ago involved a fracas at a restaurant in this city of Dublin.  A young girl, who was loosely involved in the fracas, was picked out by the Garda Síochána and charged <Col N="612" /> before the District Court; the Book of Evidence was served, and she was returned for trial.  The restaurant staff gave evidence of being assaulted and injured and spoke about the issues surrounding the event.  They were also cross-examined and questioned about their capacity to observe.</P>
    <P>However, if I recall correctly, it was only when there was a break for lunch that the witnesses, who had completed their evidence, indicated in a casual conversation that the girl sitting inside in the courtroom in the dock was not the person who had assaulted them.  In frustration, the garda asked them why they had not said so and the answer they quite correctly gave was that no one had asked them during the course of the trial, no one had asked them formally to look around the courtroom and pick out the person who they believed was responsible for the assault.  If they had been asked to do so for the first time in the criminal process they would have looked at the person sitting in the dock and said that was not the person responsible but someone else.  It may well be that a friend of the defendant sitting in the body of the court could have been picked out.</P>
    <P>That was a remarkable event and the case could have gone before a jury and a conviction recorded against that person if the casual conversation between the witnesses and the garda during the break for lunch, which was unscheduled, did not take place.  While this may be a small event &mdash; it was a big event in the mind of the defendant &mdash; it brings home to me time and again the point that we should be reluctant to adopt the concept put forward by the Minister of State that we should avoid unnecessary court identifications. This is almost a contradiction in terms, except in the narrow circumstances to which the Minister of State refers in subparagraph (i) of the amendment which reads &ldquo;that the accused was known to that person...&rdquo;  I have difficulty even with the language used there for example, what is meant by the word &ldquo;known&rdquo;?  Does it cover cases where the defendant lives in the same locality as the victim and is known to the victim because <Col N="613" /> they pass up and down the same road at 9 o'clock in the morning on the way to school or at 5 p.m. in the evening on the way home from work?  This matter needs to be clarified.  It can be argued also that in a small provincial town everyone knows everyone else.  I know what the Minister of State is getting at in subparagraph (i) where someone knows someone else because of their relationship or because they have come in close contact with them, be it a babysitter or a friend in the gang, but the concept of &ldquo;known&rdquo; is open to a wider interpretation. Given that in a small provincial town or village the issue of identification can have a real meaning, it is important that we look again at the language used.</P>
    <P>I accept that we should abandon the notion of court identifications where there is no doubt that the victim knows the defendant.  Clearly, the victim would know his/her father, brothers, cousins, close relatives and those who visit the house for a particular reason, be it a tradesman, worker-employee or babysitter but we will get into difficulty if we extend that concept to cover those who frequent the same road or live in the same part of the city or town.</P>
    <P>In regard to subparagraph (ii), I think the Minister of State should delete it and that it is necessary, in those circumstances, to have the ultimate safeguard of allowing the victim or witness to say in court before the jury who the person is.  For the reasons outlined by Deputy Shatter and having regard to the illustration I have given the House, the jury should be able to see the victim point in the direction of the defendant and hear them say that that is the person who was responsible.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State is going to leave that subparagraph in the Bill let me ask him a question about the phrase &ldquo;or through another identification procedure&rdquo;. What has the Minister of State got in mind?  The Court of Criminal Appeal are very critical when the police use procedures other than the identification parade.  If I recall correctly, a murder trial was stopped recently and one of the grounds on which the accused <Col N="614" /> was discharged without the case going to the jury was that the identification parade was made up of six people, not the usual seven.  The courts have ruled that there is one way and one way only of using the identification process.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in Dublin many detectives took people in the back of their motorcars to the Bridewell courts where they could watch, either from the car or the street, people passing to and from the courts through the front gate.  Thankfully this practice has been abandoned.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has received a communication from a man in Mountjoy Prison &mdash; but many of us have, including, I have no doubt Deputy Shatter &mdash; who complained bitterly about his conviction in a rape case. This case has been drawn to the attention of the Minister who has answered questions in the Dáil about it.  The witness, while in the back of a Garda car, identified the defendant who was riding a bicycle.  The case was surrounded by controversy but the conviction was upheld on appeal.  Indeed, the Attorney General has refused him a certificate to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>All I am saying is that the Garda are strongly criticised when they use processes other than the identification parade.  I would like to know what the Minister of State has in mind but if he is going to leave subparagraph (ii) in the Bill he will have to remove the words &ldquo;or through another identification procedure&rdquo;. When legislating we should take into account what the courts have said is the correct and proper way of making an identification in these circumstances that is, by way of an identification parade.</P>
    <P>On the face of it this seems to be a reasonable and innovative procedure but it has raised many worries and considerations in the minds of Members in the Chamber and it is important, given that we are breaking new ground in this area, that we look at each of these sections closely and carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Shatter who raised the question of presumptions, <Col N="615" /> the presumption is now gone. The section, as originally drafted, contained a presumption which was unfair for the reasons I have already explained. The purpose of this amendment, which will insert a new section 17, is to avoid the trauma of in-court identifications by victims under the age of 17.  Regardless of whether this can be achieved or not, it is a desirable objective.  Deputy Shatter is concerned that there would be nothing to stop the accused challenging the validity of the identification or disputing that he had committed the offence as a result of section 17.  The accused can still cross-examine the person who identified him. Deputy Shatter gave an example of an accused person being identified by the victim at an identity parade at a time when the person was under stress.  A person can be cross-examined in that regard; he or she can be asked when the identification parade took place, how long after the event this happened and what his or her feelings were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will intervene to be helpful. On the television link system which will be used, if the victim does not identify the accused, will the camera, for the benefit of the victim, focus on the accused?  Could the victim be asked questions in a trial without seeing the accused on screen because all that may be seen would be the lawyers asking questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct, the camera will not focus on the accused.  The only way in which a person in that case would be able to identify the accused in court would be to bring the child into the court to point out the accused.  There is no provision whereby the camera can pick out the accused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this is a huge problem in relation to challenging identification evidence?  In other words, the distressed person makes the identification in the way I described, three months later there is a trial but the child does not see the accused and does not get an opportunity to do what Deputy <Col N="616" /> McCartan described, which is to realise suddenly that the person picked out is not the person who committed the assault.  How do you challenge the identification evidence in those circumstances if you are an accused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The accused will be the person challenging it and there is nothing to stop the child victim being brought to court to officially identify the accused.  I am advised that there is nothing to stop the accused from challenging the validity of the evidence.  Deputies will notice that the second last line of the amendment in my name says that to avoid injustice there is provision for in-court identification, even in those cases, where the interests of justice require it.  It is a saving provision to cover cases where the accused would insist and the court would feel that they could not be satisfied unless they had an in-court identification.  They would feel that the accused is entitled to that.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan made the point about the accused being known to the person.  Perhaps we could use some formula such as &ldquo;personally known&rdquo;.  I will have that matter examined.  Deputy McCartan also made the point about what other identification procedure we had in mind.  That occurred to me when I first read the amendment and it is something we will have to look at more closely. In the light of what has been said &mdash; this is a very important section although it involves a small percentage of accusers, namely child victims under the age of 17 &mdash; we will ask the Department to have another look at the section to ensure that there are proper safeguards.  I take the points raised by Deputies that there is a distinction between somebody who is obviously personally known to the victim and a person who is only identified by the victim in another context.  We will have to bear that distinction in mind and I will ask the Department to look at it between now and Report Stage.  Perhaps we can come back with further refinements and modifications at that stage.</P>

We have withdrawn amendments to which valid objections were raised and it seems a little futile to incorporate an amendment of this kind which needs to be teased out further.  This is the first occasion we have teased it out and I am grateful that the Minister has taken on board the worries which we expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach is similar. Instead of wasting the Minister's time on the question of identification, it struck me that there is a practice within the Garda that where an accused refuses to stand in an identity parade the police are entitled to confront the witness directly with the accused person.  That may be one of the provisions envisaged by the <Col N="618" /> wording.  I will be happy to come back to this on Report Stage but I repeat that I am still fundamentally worried about the overall idea.  In-court identifications are a necessity and I agree with that, especially when I heard the Minister suggesting that in the event of the accused challenging the identification it would be open to the court to allow the victim to come into court.  That will inevitably happen in virtually every case where identification is a central issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, line 42, after &ldquo;accused&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a person who has concluded <Col N="619" /> a deed of separation with his spouse under which the parties have agreed to live or to continue to live separate and apart from each other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a relatively simple amendment in relation to the competence and compellability of spouses.  There are various provisions in Part IV of the Bill detailing circumstances in which a wife or husband or a former wife or husband can be required to give evidence.  One rule will apply where separation decrees are granted by the courts but that will not apply where a husband and wife permanently and voluntarily separate by agreement.  In my experience, although a large number of separation cases come before the courts, the majority of husbands and wives who resort to lawyers following marital breakdown end up resolving their problems by entering into a separation deed or agreement.  It is my formal proposal that we amend the Bill to take this provision into account by including an amendment in page 12, line 42, in which there is a definition of a former spouse which is said to include a person who has been granted a decree of judicial separation in respect of his marriage to the accused.  I propose that we insert the words in my amendment. It is a sensible approach and is the type of provision made in other legislation where it was necessary to differentiate between couples who are living together happily and those who are living apart.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether the question has been tampered with?  When tabling the question I did not use the words &ldquo;for which he is responsible&rdquo; because, ultimately, the Taoiseach is responsible for all legislation in this House.  For example, on the Order of Business, legislation actually promised in the House only can be referred to and the Taoiseach responds to all questions in relation to legislation.  I put it to the Taoiseach that he has access&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> No public relations firm will be employed but I can confirm that an advertising agency has been appointed.  This is perfectly defensible in a matter such as this in which it is important to clarify for the Irish people the issues on which they will be voting on 18 June.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, recall that the Dáil and Seanad recently endorsed overwhelmingly a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  I am not in a position at this stage to give costings for the individual components as this will vary and depend on our monitoring and assessment of the programme as it develops.  However, the Deputy might recall the commitment I gave in the House last week &mdash; which I now repeat here this afternoon &mdash; that the appropriate amount of money will be provided and that I will have no hesitation in making the exact figures available to the House as soon as they become known.</P>
    <P>I should add that current estimates indicate that costs will not exceed £600,000 in total.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach seriously expecting this House to believe that the advertising bill for this whole campaign will be only £100,000 since he has already indicated that the cost of producing the leaflet was £500,000?  Now he is saying that the total cost of the campaign is £600,000, leaving only £100,000 for advertising.  What advertising firm has the Taoiseach appointed for this purpose? In addition, would he say whether this advertising will advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="The Tánaiste John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not listen very attentively to the replies I give in this House.  On the question of advertising &mdash; I should say that leaflets also come under the heading of advertising just as do many other items &mdash; I have said today that the entire cost of this campaign is capped at £600,000.  I will <Col N="623" /> give the details when the campaign is over.  In addition, there will be full scrutiny, as is normal, on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The name of the agency appointed is the Peter Owens Agency.  Of course, we will be advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  What would the Deputy expect the Government to advocate?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the elements about which the Deputy has asked are separate from the question.  If the Deputy wants to table a separate question it will be answered.  I have named the successful firm.  I said invitations to tender were invited in the normal way, of which the Deputy will be fully aware, that is to competent firms who can undertake this task.  If the Deputy has any reservations about it I will be only to happy to give him full information in regard thereto.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

I understand that as a result of the postal dispute several hundred thousand booklets are lying in the An Post depot on the Naas Road.

I refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 17 of 18 February 1992, when I said that the major issue in regard to the National Heritage Council is their future statutory status.  My Department are in the process of preparing this legislation at the moment.  It is the intention that the statutory heritage council will absorb the functions of the Wildlife Advisory Council.  The functions of the present National Heritage Council already relate to flora and fauna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his very positive reply.  In view of the present fragmentation, the fact that agencies such as the National Museum, the Department of Education and the Office of Public Works are responsible for heritage, is it not very important that one agency should deal with all matters relating to heritage? Were the National Heritage Council consulted in regard to the major forthcoming conference in Rio de Janeiro?</P>

On the question of the number of agencies involved in heritage, it is widely welcomed that the functions of the Wildlife Advisory Council will be absorbed by the heritage council and this is a step in the right direction to achieve the objectives to which the Deputy referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The mismatch between growth rates and job creation was discussed at the meeting which I and other Ministers had with the Central Review Committee on 28 February 1992.  I informed the committee of the consideration the Government were giving to a new appropriate structure with political input to develop new ideas and proposals to deal with unemployment.  Such a structure was welcomed by the committee and it has since been set up as the <Col N="628" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.</P>
      <P>I also informed the committee that the National Economic and Social Council are undertaking an EC-supported study on the connection between growth and employment which will analyse Ireland's performance compared to other EC-OECD economies.  Phase I, which is underway, will examine Ireland's recent performance with regard to growth, employment and unemployment in comparison with the other EC member states and selected other OECD countries.  This descriptive account will be linked to an examination of theoretical approaches to the growth-employment-unemployment relationship.</P>
      <P>Phase II will draw on the overview of performance to analyse (i) the factors influencing the employment intensity of Irish growth, and (ii) the policy and practice of those countries where comparative analysis indicates better employment performance.</P>
      <P>The Government have already numerous strategies in place to generate more employment, for example, tax reform, the employment and training subsidy schemes, the 12 area-based partnerships, the Culliton-based development of indigenous industry, the task force on employment and the task force on tourism. The conclusions of the NESC study will be taken into account fully by the Government as will the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attach special importance to the work being done by the State companies linkage group established by the task force on employment to use the resources of the major State commercial companies to promote linkages between those companies, the multinational businesses operating in Ireland, and specialist indigenous Irish sub-supply companies. The approach has recently been extended by developing an integrated approach to linkiages through a deepening of the national linkage programme in which the lead role is taken by the IDA.  The first industrial sector in which this new integrated approach to linkages is being <Col N="629" /> developed is the Irish building products industry.  The second industrial sector for which an integrated linkages approach is being developed by the State companies linkage group is the software and related services industry.  The group are also examining in detail a report entitled &ldquo;Forging Links With Foreign Industry&rdquo; which was recently submitted to me by the Small Firms Association.  Another aspect of the development of linkages was the launch by Deputy O'Rourke, Minister of State for Trade and Marketing, on Wednesday, 22 April 1992, of a new campaign involving Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland which is aimed at increasing the level of supply to industry by small companies in Ireland, north and south.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Taoiseach for his very full reply and in particular for his announcement that the National Economic and Social Council, in co-operation with the EC, are undertaking a specific study into this crucial area.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this is the critical problem in the Irish economy and that it is very disappointing that continuing reasonable growth rates are not being translated into jobs?  Would he further agree that the experience of the past decade is that approximately the first 2 per cent growth in GNP is absorbed by better productivity in the existing work-force and has absolutely no effect on creating extra jobs and is effect anything less than 2 per cent growth will show a decline in the number of jobs in our economy?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the National Economic and Social Council to look specifically at the situation in the United States where very moderate growth rates result immediately in extra jobs?  Will the Taoiseach establish the differences in the US economy which lead to such a quick response to growth in the job market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the various questions raised by the Deputy, let me say that we are of course disappointed, <Col N="630" /> and everybody should be disappointed that the level of growth which has run on average at approximately 5 per cent &mdash; and, in fact, in 1990 the growth rate in our economy was one of the highest in the world, if not the highest and was 2 per cent higher than the Japanese rate in that year &mdash; has not paid off in terms of jobs.  While this resulted in thousands of jobs we did not create the number of jobs that one would expect from a growth rate of that magnitude. That problem is being examined by this study in order to find out why there is such a mismatch between growth rates and job creation.</P>
      <P>For many years we were led to believe that if we achieved a certain level of growth in that area it would make big inroads into the creation of employment. This has not happened for many reasons, some of which are evident.  One reason is the leakage out of the Irish economy in the first instance through the poor supply of goods and services to large investors in the country and many of the semi-State and commercial organisations. We are not producing anything like the level we should be producing to supply those investment needs.  We are only producing something like 27 per cent of the requirements of large multinational investment here; the remaining requirements are imported.  Clearly we are not getting the value-added within our economy by virtue of the sub-sector supply being sourced elsewhere.  We are sustaining jobs abroad through the purchase of exports of approximately £800 million to £1,000 million every year. These requirements could be met in Ireland.  That is the reason for the focus to which I referred in my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quick response in the American market would clearly come from the self sustaining aspects of that economy.  Their level of imports is very low in relation to their requirements.  They are self-sustaining in many aspects of their economy and clearly any upturn in the economy there will immediately generate jobs; the demand is within the economy and does not mean there has to be a demand for imports.  I accept that approximately 2 <Col N="631" /> per cent of the growth rate is taken up with increased productivity within the system and that this would not generate many extra jobs.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Taoiseach agree that some of the growth rates claimed are artificial and can be explained by the transfer pricing policies of foreign companies who transfer their profits into Ireland on the basis that we have a benign tax regime and that growth in the international industrial sector is not real growth but is simply paper transactions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was always an element of transfer pricing in the Irish economy.  I believe the level of transfer pricing has been less since the termination of the exports sales relief.  There may be some attraction in this respect but not anything like the level it was in the past.  I repeat that even though our exports are booming, because we are not supplying the demands in materials, services and goods naturally we do not get the same pay off in jobs as we would expect.  This is why the focus has to be placed very strongly on linkage.</P>

Can the Taoiseach indicate how the growth to which he referred has been measured and whether any attempt has been made to analyse the components of that growth? To what extent have the transfer pricing arrangements which the multi-nationals in the Irish economy clearly engage in affected our growth figures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to an economic study.  The growth rate is made up of the normal components of production within the economy.  I do not have information on the different components with me but they are well known and are available.  Any economic study will set out clearly what the components are.  With regard to the effect the transfer pricing arrangements have on our growth rate, I would not be able to answer this question off the top of my head.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the closed or self-sustaining nature of the US economy.  Would he agree that Europe is equally as closed, relatively speaking, as the United States in so far as this issue is concerned?  Would he further agree that there is a poorer performance in Europe as a whole in converting growth into jobs than there is in the United States and that, therefore, there may be other factors at work apart from the closed nature of the economy?  Will he look at whether centralised wage bargaining may contribute in some cases to converting extra growth into higher incomes for those at work in Europe whereas decentralised wage bargaining, or plant level bargaining which is the norm in the United States, may contribute to the United States converting extra growth into extra employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well recognised that the flexibility and mobility of the workforce in the United States economy contribute to growth in jobs.  Many of the same problems exist in Europe which the Single Market will eliminate.  For example, the control of public purchasing <Col N="633" /> represents approximately 15 per cent of growth in the European economy.  The removal of the bureaucratic and national restrictions built into the system will inject the necessary impetus and dynamic into the European economies.  With regard to the arguments for and against centralised bargaining, we have seen over the past four or five years the benefit in our economy of our consensus with the Social Partners.  Having spoken to our European Partners, I know they are surprised at the way in which we have managed to turn around our economy while at the same time restricting the increase in borrowing and expenditure.  They believe that the consensus of the Social Partners has been a major contributor in this regard.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan and the Taoiseach seem to be surprised that jobs have been lost while growth has been rising.  I have been saying this for years but no one listened to me.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that one of the main reasons for the lack of job creation is that much modern technology has destroyed jobs at the same time as it has created growth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly modern technology and the rapid changes in technology have replaced manpower in many labour-intensive industries.  We also have to take into account the increase in population and the fact that approximately 25,000 people join the labour force every year.  Those are two of the factors operating against growth in employment.  In addition, we must remember that there is a depression in economies throughout the world which take our exports.  We export two-thirds of what we produce and when international markets are in a recession inevitably we catch the backwash. All those factors contribute to an increase in our unemployment level.</P>

In some countries it is not easy to govern the regulations in this area and difficulties can arise.  Our system has served us well for 70 years.

      <P>The second Finance Bill to which the Deputy refers and which will be introduced in the autumn, will have two primary functions.  Firstly, it will complete, subject to progress at Community level, the programme for fiscal legislation required by the Internal Market; there are areas where the relevant EC Directives have still to be adopted. In this context, it will also provide for the domestic measures needed to offset the adverse cash flow implications for the Exchequer in 1993 of the ending of VAT at point of entry on goods sourced in other EC member states.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Bill will contain the legislative provisions for a new fringe benefits tax as announced in the budget, as a means of ensuring the effective taxation of such forms of remuneration and of broadening the tax base, and which is to come into operation on 6 April 1993.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Bill may contain some other provisions which the Government may feel necessary between now and its publication.  It would be my intention that such measures would be kept to a minimum so as not to detract from the primary functions of the Bill to which I previously referred.</P>

Work on the matter was suspended during the course of the work on the Finance Bill but it recommenced this week.  I accept what the Deputy has said, that we should not put this matter on the long finger, and it is not my intention to do so.  About half a dozen suggestions have been made and they require extensive analysis.  I would like to see what their impact would be on industry, and that work will be done immediately.

Would the Minister consider consolidating all anti-evasion and anti-avoidance measures in the Finance Bill in the autumn so that one code and one reference would be available to the taxpayers and the professional practitioners involved in these matters?

I am anxious to keep the Bill in the autumn to an absolute minimum.  Many of the people involved in the work on that Bill will also be involved in work on various EC Directives.  The point made by the Deputy is a reasonable one <Col N="638" /> because many of the issues involved have been in law for 20 years.  However, the public have realised that most of these issues have created no difficulty &mdash; the difficulty has arisen mainly with third party measures, which I have amended. Discussions have commenced with accountants and tax officials on a statement of practice to make sure that no difficulty arises.  I am not sure what the implications of the Deputy's suggestions are but I will consider the matter to see what can be done.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 9, 13 and 54 together.  To date over 200 projects have been approved for <Col N="639" /> the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax at the IFSC.  These projects involve 155 companies and 25 of these have now located in the Custom House docks area. A number of others have committed to move to the centre in the immediate future, on expiry of their existing leases. The remainder are temporarily located outside the area.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, a requirement of every tax certificate for the IFSC that the company move to the area as soon as suitable premises become available.  It was not possible for all companies to locate in the area on commencement of trade as construction on the site was ongoing and suitable space was not available.  It was necessary for many of them.  consequently, to enter into short leases for accommodation outside the area.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to available accommodation is as follows: Five buildings have now been completed at the centre and three of these &mdash; the buildings known as West Block, Harbour Master One and Harbour Master Two &mdash; are fully occupied.  The only space currently available at the centre is in the other two blocks &mdash; North Block and South Block. Negotiations are taking place between the owners of these two blocks and potential occupiers and I understand that the terms of occupancy on offer in these negotiations have recently been improved.  While the terms of such lettings are a matter for settlement between the parties concerned, I have taken the step of requesting my Department to write to them expressing my concern that these negotiations should be successfully concluded.  I am hopeful that these developments will clear the way for the take-up of the available space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further phase of office development in the area is due to commence in August of this year and will involve the construction of two additional blocks.  My Department will be monitoring closely the take-up of this space and will be ensuring, in consultation with the Custom House Docks Authority, that adequate advance arrangements are made to ensure that companies will be <Col N="640" /> able to occupy suitable accommodation as it becomes available.  The movement of companies to these buildings, when completed, will make a significant impact on the number of companies actually located at the centre.  I do not at this time consider it necessary to add to the powers already available to me under current legislation.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy McCartan's reference to the total value of tax breaks claimed by companies, I would point out that the corporation tax yield at 10 per cent rather than 40 per cent does not represent a loss of 30 per cent to the Exchequer.  The international financial services activity in Ireland represents new business and new employment which has developed as a result, among other things, of the concessionary tax rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>That is correct.  There are three blocks completed and two blocks are partially completed, one owned by the Bank of Ireland group and the other by Mr. Dermot Desmond and his compnay.  Both of these are in negotiations with a number of companies.  The negotiations have been protracted.  Until recently the terms on offer to the various companies were not improved, but within the last four weeks the compulsory escalating rent clause and the review clause which were creating difficulties for a lot of the companies have been removed, so negotiations have recommenced.  Following the negotiations we will fill the remaining two blocks fairly quickly. After the builders' holidays two new harbour masters' buildings will commence along with 200 housing units.  That is part of the next phase of development which is being negotiated between the Custom House Development Authority and the Custom House Company.  That is part of six more office blocks on the site.  The first <Col N="641" /> two, which will commence in August, will be 70,000 square feet each.  It will be towards the end of next year before they become available.</P>

As soon as buildings are available it is my intention to do all I can to ensure that people move into them.</P>

      <P>The register of landlords to which the Deputy is referring is <Col N="642" /> a listing of the details of known landlords as well as let properties.  This database of information is maintained for internal purposes by the special enquiry branch of the Revenue Commissioners and is used primarily as an information cross-check as part of the Revenue programme to tackle tax evasion in the private rented sector.  The register is continually updated as further information is received.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are precluded from allowing the public to inspect this register because of their obligations to observe confidentiality in relation to individual taxpayers affairs.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is a marvellous opportunity available to the Revenue Commissioners, who have not shown a degree of shyness in the past in these matters, to engage the support of many private rented tenants throughout the cities who are being badly exploited by landlords who are charging exhorbitant rents? Would the Minister not agree that to make that register open to the public would be a useful and cost-effective way of updating and improving the accuracy of the information the Revenue Commissioners have?</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners hold this for internal use.  I was rather surprised to see that it is not computerised.  Following a question put down some months ago I asked about that aspect and requested that it start.  I do not want to go into details about how the register is kept.  When this is computerised there will be an index of known landlords, containing names and addresses of landlords, as well as the address of the let property and an index of let properties containing the addresses of properties and the number of units. The public send a lot of this data to the Revenue Commissioners as do owners of property in their tax returns.  Section 227 of the Finance Bill makes it compulsory for letting agents and managers of premises to return details of all premises managed by them to the Revenue <Col N="643" /> Commissioners.  Until now that did not happen.  We can try to extend the base. In the matter of making it public, the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from doing that because of their obligation to observe confidentiality.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear of the sensitivity of the Revenue Commissioners in this respect.  It does not match with their sensitivities proclaimed in other aspects of their demand for powers.  If this Government are committed to open Government, tenants have a right to see what their landlords are recording as the rent which they purport they are getting from the tenants. Can the Minister not simply make it clear to the Revenue Commissioners that it is in the public interest that tenants in private rented sector accommodation have the right to be able to see in Dublin Castle, in the Revenue Commissioners offices, what rent they are reputed to be paying to their landlord on foot of the landlord's information to the Revenue Commissioners and to adjust it accordingly, if that is necessary?</P>

      <P>I have asked that this be computerised.  At the moment it is not in a form which could be made available for public inspection.  A great amount of the data used here comes directly from the returns of individuals and the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from making public data which is obtained through tax returns.  If there is a way around that I will explore it, because I have no difficulty in seeing data on premises published.  That is why last week, and the week before, I was arguing for some powers in this area.  The data must be in a form which will not break confidentiality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 99 together.  The projected rate of increase in the consumer price index in 1992, as indicated at the time of the budget, is 3¾ per cent.  The most recent available consumer price inflation figures are those for mid-February 1992.  These showed a quarterly increase of 0.8 per cent, with a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per cent in the consumer price index.  It is likely that the mid-May quarter of 1992 will see an increase in the year-on-year rate, partly due to measures announced in the budget.  In the second half of the year, however, it is expected that the rate will begin to fall.  While there should be no complacency about a prospective rate of inflation to 3¾ per cent for the year as a whole, at this level Irish inflation would remain comfortably below the EC average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> As to the other matters raised, I assume that the Deputies are concerned with factors which may have contributed to the increase in the year-on-year rate of inflation from 2.6 per cent at mid-February 1991 to 3.7 per cent at mid-February 1992.  Import price trends are one explanatory factor.  Import prices, which fell during 1990, rose somewhat during 1991.  In addition, as indicated by the constant tax price index, published by the CSO, tax measures may have accounted for about one-quarter of the acceleration.  Food prices, which fell marginally during 1990, also rose during 1991.  However, the rate of price increase in certain other elements of consumption also accelerated, to a degree not clearly explained by either import price trends or taxation measures.  In particular, the rate of price increase for &lsquo;Services and Related Expenditure&rsquo; accelerated from 4.1 per cent in the year to mid-February 1991 to 5.0 per cent in the year to mid-February last.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to hear the Minister say he expects the rate to fall during the year.  That is very welcome news.  Will he indicate how he believes that will arise?  He indicated that the rise between last year and this year related to the extent of about a quarter to the budget provisions and the increase in the price of food and services.  What aspect of the budget accounted for that quarter of the increase?  Was it the increase in VAT?  What were the factors in the rise of the cost of food and services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The indirect tax element of VAT had an effect on the quarter to May.  That will be out of the system for the remainder of the year.  The items which show a higher than average increase over the past year are services, ranging from meals to electrical repairs, motor insurance, bus, rail and other travel, entertainment charges and medical fees.  The key contributors to the quarterly increase of 0.8 per cent to mid-February were increased food prices, which added .22 per cent to the index, higher drink prices which added .2 per <Col N="646" /> cent, tobacco and cigarette prices which related to the budget increases, housing costs which added 2.4 per cent and the rise in services-related expenditure which added 1.6 per cent.  Services-related expenditure covers a long list of services. There are indications of a slowdown in that area but 5 per cent in the year to February is far too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the increase in prices in the services sector which the Minister says is above average, has that been the trend in previous years? Can it be explained by the fact that the services sector is less open to foreign competition than manufacturing?  Much of the services sector is subject to restrictive licensing or monopoly arrangements administered by the State which may give greater facility to increase prices above what is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the services sector is mainly in areas related to entertainment in the broadest sense, from cinema to concerts, food and drink. This is where people are targeting their disposable income.  I have been in regular contact with the Department of Industry and Commerce about this.  In other areas figures are fairly well on target.  There were significant rises in some areas in the February to May quarter last year but they seem to have slowed down.  The European figure is about 4.6 per cent and we should end up around 3.7 per cent.  I do not want to give the impression that I am satisfied with that figure.  Pressure has to be maintained to get it as low as possible, despite the fact that it is lower than the European average.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 22, 32, 43, 45, 81, 83 and 89 together.  The question of aligning the sub-national divisions used by Government Departments and State agencies in the provision of services to the public was <Col N="648" /> extensively examined some years ago by my Department with the assistance of an interdepartmental committee and outside planning and organisational expertise.</P>
      <P>It was clear from this examination that while improvements might be effected by increased co-ordination on a regional basis of the activities of some of the bodies concerned, divergences in the territorial arrangements for the provision of different services had been shaped, in large measure, by the nature of the service involved and the fact that the most effective structure for the delivery of one service frequently turns out to be unsuitable for another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are there different regional arrangements for health boards as compared with local government planning structures?  Surely there is no justification for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great number of changes in the regional structures operated by organisations such as the IDA, FÁS and the local authorities. The inter-departmental group which examined this matter some years ago came up with some realistic answers to these questions.  To have a certain standard of hospital there must be a certain catchment area of population.  Areas of the Gaeltacht must cover an Irish-speaking population.  Industries try to take in certain catchment areas.  The Minister for the Environment is engaged in an examination of the structure of regional and local authorities.  In preparation for the next round of the Structural Funds I have been anxious to move to that system but in the absence of agreement I am left to deal with the sub-groups as they were for the last round.  This matter has been looked at by successive Governments and nobody has agreed to standard regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is a classic case for political decision and that if he leaves this sort of matter to an inter-departmental group of civil or public servants, all of whom fear they might lose something by changing <Col N="649" /> the existing regional pattern, nothing will ever happen and that the only way any rational regional policy will be introduced, with simple workable regions which relate to each other, is if Ministers like him take the decision to do it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Bruton is saying.  The Fine Gael-Labour Government in the mid-seventies spent a lot of time working on this.  I am not sure if Deputy Bruton was a member of that Government.  I read the report in preparation for answering this question. They started out along the lines of what Deputy Bruton is saying but the then Taoiseach, Mr. Cosgrave, and the then Tánaiste, Mr. Corish, said what we have said.  When the matter was examined they found pages and pages of reasons not to do it.  It was looked at again by the late George Colley and it was again agreed not to do it.  It makes great sense until somebody tries to do it.  For the past three or four months I have been waiting for the Department of the Environment to clear up the position relating to regional authorities.  That has to be cleared before we move to standardised regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of us have been involved in that kind of exercise.  Would the Minister not agree that when all the words in the numerous pages to which he refers are distilled, the underlying advice is political from the bureaucrat to the Minister of the day, to the effect that an integrated regional structure which combines the powers of health, planning, regional development and anything else would confer a certain degree of political strength on such regions, to the disadvantage of the permanent civil servants and the Minister of the day?  Would he agree that there is an internal political conspiracy by the permanent government to prevent such cohesion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot blame Deputy Quinn for being involved in Government at that stage because he was not but, after the permanent civil service of the day came to the conclusion that they could do nothing they handed the matter to a <Col N="650" /> Cabinet sub-committee in 1976 who did nothing either.  It went to my party when in Government in 1978 for the late Deputy George Colley to deal with but he did not change it.  The facts are that all our parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few brief points.  The theory of this issue is very good and it has been examined by the Department of Finance and other Departments in the past.  There are many <Col N="652" /> crucial points such as that administrative boundaries do not lend themselves to match in with others.  The Gaeltacht, which spans several IDA and health board regions, has its own partially elected Údarás.  If that were broken into regions it would break the whole structure. A certain level of population is required to provide the utilisation needed to justify certain sophisticated hospital equipment and if that were broken up it would result in huge costs being put on the health services which they cannot afford.  Boundaries used by the Department of Agriculture and Food have to take account of cattle and human population and the incidence of cattle diseases and that argument has been looked at and written about extensively.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Bell</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if, having regard to his press release of 11 March 1992 relating to guidelines for semi-State bodies, and having regard to the fact that the Official Secrets Act applies to all citizens of the State, he will outline whether there is in existence codes of conduct or legislative provisions in relation to the activities of civil servants; if he will further outline the essential matters contained therein and the responsibilities of civil servants acting on boards, authorities or companies established under statute or the Companies Acts; the date they were last updated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules concerning the conduct of civil servants in the course of their official duties are contained in a number of circulars issued by my Department over the years.  There are also statutory provisions, for example in the Official Secrets Act, 1963 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889-1916. Overall, the main areas covered include official secrecy, State employees and politics, conflict of interest, contracts with, purchases from or sales to government Departments, bankruptcy, use of influence and dealings with the public. The instructions seek to ensure that employees perform their duties honestly and impartially and avoid situations which could compromise their integrity.</P>
      <P>As regards civil servants acting on boards, authorities or companies established by statute or under the Companies Acts, their responsibilities do not differ from those of any other member of the boards in question.  In the case of bodies established under the Companies Acts, for instance, their responsibilities are clearly to the company in question, and the Acts make this clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, in the case of bodies in the State sector, board members, including civil servants are, generally speaking, appointed either by Ministers or the Government.  In the case of civil servants, their presence means that Departments and Ministers can have a much better insight in regard to the progress and policies of State boards, while they can see the affairs of bodies in the context of Government policy as a whole and should be able to make a substantial contribution <Col N="654" /> to the affairs of bodies in question. I might add that the report on which the guidelines mentioned in the Deputy's question are based examines the question of civil servants on State boards.</P>
    <P>As regards civil servants acting on boards, authorities or companies in the private sector, they would be bound by the normal rules for civil servants which I mentioned earlier, where these are applicable.  In particular, they would have to be certain that such involvement would not in any way conflict with the interests of their Department, or be inconsistent with their official position.</P>
    <P>I am currently having a comprehensive review of all relevant circulars carried out with a view to ensuring that the regulations in question are fully up-to-date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply to Deputy Bell's question.  Do I take it from his reply that, following the statement of 11 March, he is now engaging in an updating and integrating into a single document of the relevant guidelines and requirements that should apply to civil servants who find themselves in these situations?  Will such guidelines, when completed, be published for the benefit of the general public and be specifically brought to the attention of all civil servants and, in particular, those directly involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is generally correct. The document published on 11 March sets out the practice and principles to be followed by various boards and bodies.  The Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1891-1916, the Official Secrets Act, 1963, and a host of circulars and memoranda in between, set down guidelines. A civil servant taking up duty at the commencement of their career in the Civil Service is given this data to decipher. My aim is to make it easier for them to decipher it.</P>

      <P>Earlier, I argued the case for civil servants to be allowed to participate in politics.  May I ask the Minister, in view of the fact that he was bringing forward legislation to deal with the <Col N="655" /> declaration of interests of Members, if he would consider that that legislation should extend to civil servants and members of State boards?  In that regard is he aware that Fine Gael have proposed the creation of an ethics commission composed of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and a High Court judge which would set down the code to be followed by all concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Deputy Mitchell has been involved in this area for some time and made this point in a recent debate in the House.  At this stage my memorandum on the codes of practice for Members is almost ready.  I thought it would be advisable because, by and large, it affects all Members, to bring those proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges where they could be debated and any other ideas, such as those suggested by Deputy Mitchell today, could be looked at in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether there is an inherent conflict of loyalty in the case of a civil servant who is serving on a board of a company where his first loyalty is to the company but who may also be responsible in his working capacity to a Minister who may, in certain cases, quite legitimately be in some form of disagreement with the company though he may be a shareholder or the shareholder in it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Civil servants previously had an involvement in some areas such as Irish Life and other companies. In ICC and ACC, for example &mdash; banking areas under my control &mdash; there are civil servants on the boards and the system works well in relation to confidential matters, although there may at times be conflicts of interest.  Broadly speaking the civil servants are answerable to the company under the Companies Acts.  Over the years circulars have dealt with situations where a conflict of interest could arise.  They set out precisely how civil <Col N="656" /> servants are to act and they have served the State well over the years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 29, 36, 55, 68, 111 and 112 together.  As previously indicated, this matter has been examined in my own and other Departments in recent months and the views of the Attorney General on how to give effect to new arrangements in this area have also been obtained. Arising from this examination, it has become clear that implementation of arrangements of the kind mentioned by the Deputies might have significant implications for the manner in which Oireachtas committees conduct their business.  I would, accordingly, think it necessary when introducing legislation on these issues to discuss this matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I intend to do so at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the meat industry tribunal is costing taxpayers a lot of money and will cost more; that people are very worried about the cost of tribunals of this kind and that, therefore, there would be public support for the idea of giving Oireachtas committees some of the kinds of powers <Col N="658" /> that are enjoyed by committees in the US Congress and also in parliaments elsewhere, including the neighbouring island, to enable them to investigate matters of this kind under oath?  Would the Minister agree that we would be both saving money and also giving the Dáil a useful job to do in dealing with issues that arise from time to time by allowing committees of the Dáil the power, if the Dáil agrees, to conduct some of the inquiries that now cost a lot more when conducted by judicial tribunals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has a point.  These tribunals are a mounting cost for any Minister for Finance.  I have been looking at the issues.  Like Deputy Bruton I am a believer in the committee system.</P>
      <P>Let me make a few points on the down-side &mdash; there would be no point in my going through the positive side.  We will have a chance at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to iron out some of these arguments.  The Oireachtas committees at present adopt a practical and pragmatic approach to their terms of reference. In general Members are allowed to put whatever questions the chairman considers relevant, and they can and do from time to time interpret these terms of reference rather loosely.  It works well and the civil servants who go before the committees answer well.  My understanding from legal advisers is that once witnesses are compelled to attend committees and face penalties if they do not answer questions, this position would have to change and the protection of a witness's constitutional rights in that situation would require the terms of reference of the committees to be tightened up and would require committee members in any inquiries they pursue to adhere strictly to their terms of reference. In addition, the witnesses may have a right to know the precise procedure under which the committee operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have sympathy for the objectives of enhancing the powers of Oireachtas committees, there are dangers that such changes, if not carefully worked out, might pose a threat to <Col N="659" /> elements of our present committee system which we all regard as very valuable. As this is a matter of such fundamental importance to the House the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are the group best fitted to express their views on it.  There are many arguments which I do not need to go through as they will be in my memorandum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>is the Minister aware that there is a number of committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, which have the right, as bestowed on them by this House to send for persons, papers and records but are not in a position to apply a penalty in the event of someone not complying with such demands.  Would the Minister agree that that is totally anomalous and needs to be changed?  Is he aware that the Constitution refers to this House as the House of representatives, not just as a Legislature but as a body which is supposed to hold executive and other responsibilities. Is he further aware that in 1976 the Privileges Act passing through this House had in it a section which permitted witnesses to be compelled to attend before committees and it was only deleted when the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, persuaded the Taoiseach of the day, Mr. Cosgrave, that they did not need these powers?  Legislation is there which shows exactly how it can be done.  Finally, is the Minister further aware that under existing legislation the Ceann Comhairle does have the power to confer on any committee of this House the power to carry out examinations under oath?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of most of those points because I have been involved in some fairly contentious issues over the years.  The Deputy will agree, however, that the real world is not so simple.  In any move we make in this area there is the major issue of rights, what kind of privilege would be bestowed on these committees and whether privilege would be the same for everybody.  This is something I feel strongly about and <Col N="660" /> which will be addressed in my paper which will be discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the general thrust of Deputy Bruton's remarks which he has been stating consistently for a number of years.  However, we are a relatively small parliament.  If we take on some major inquiries we must take into consideration the time involved.  Without going into the issues that we have to resolve, it is not as simple as saying we will do this, that or the other.  This is an area that I have an open mind on and my paper tries to address the issues in a positive fashion. Naturally I have to deal with the legal issues as I have been advised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the utmost personal respect to the Minister, let me suggest that his response to my first supplementary question, to the effect that there would be dangers in chairpersons of committees not acting in a judicious fashion in the way they exercise their powers, is potentially a reflection on Members of this House in so far as it is implied that one can trust judges, accountants and others to conduct inquiries in a fair minded fashion but one could not trust elected representatives to do so. Would the Minister not agree that so long as elected representatives of any party are given adequate legal advice in the conduct of such inquiries, public representatives can be trusted entirely, whatever party they belong to, to conduct an inquiry in a fair minded fashion, that they have proven themselves capable of doing so on many occasions in the history of this State and that therefore, there should be no fear in the matter of conferring power on committees of this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is twisting my words.  In listing some of the issues that have to be addressed on the negative side, what I said was that Oireachtas committees by definition consist of politicians and, rightly or wrongly, there would be an impression among the public that individual committee members might approach an inquiry in a political way <Col N="661" /> rather than with the impartiality associated with an independent judiciary.  That is one of the issues that must be addressed. I am confident that this House will deal speedily with the various issues involved.  We have to deal with the legal questions and the question of pivilege and come to an agreement.  I will submit my paper to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Committee of Public Accounts reached agreement, on an all-party basis, on a difficult report on Carysfort at no additional cost to the State?  I think all concerned would acknowledge that that was a good and thorough report. However, at the same time enormous fees are being paid to people outside this House in relation to the Greencore inquiry, the Telecom inquiry and the Beef Tribunal etc.  Would the Minister acknowledge this?  Second, in addition to the powers of the Ceann Comhairle in relation to oaths and the 1976 Act which deals with the question of pivilege in its original form is the Minister aware that senior counsel's opinion was appended to the special report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the committee on how privilege can be extended and withdrawn from witnesses and on how penalties can be imposed constitutionally on witnesses who refuse to attend.</P>

However, they wanted to co-operate fully.  We will also have to deal with the question of whether <Col N="662" /> we should change the procedures.  While I am aware that the opinion of senior counsel was appended to the report on the future role of the Comptroller and Auditor General I have to follow the advice of the Government's legal adviser, the Attorney General, and not the advice of independent counsel.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle wishes to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given to me under Standing Order 20 (3) (a) and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Laurence Kelly &mdash; the proposal by Cork County Council to sell a portion of land at Gurteenard, Kanturk, County Cork, which costs approximately £24,000, for the nominal sum of £1,000 to a private individual; and if he will investigate the position; (2) Deputy Michael Lowry &mdash; the present position regarding mining operations in Tipperary north; (3) Deputy John O'Donoghue &mdash; the decision by Aer Rianta to grant a licence to First Rate Bureau De Change, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Ireland, to issue tourist VAT refunds via bank outlets at airports thereby assisting it to create a dominant positon in the market place to the detriment of the Irish tourism industry and employment in Killorglin, County Kerry and Spiddal, County Galway; (4) Deputy Michael Moynihan &mdash; the unreasonable delay on the part of the Department of Education in giving approval for the erection of a new primary school at Lispole, County Kerry; (5) Deputy Mary Flaherty &mdash; the crisis in funding of the home help service in the Ballymun area which has resulted in no new referrals being accepted, a waiting list for service and the collapse of the whole service by October/November if the crisis is unresolved; (6) Deputy Alan Shatter &mdash; the report of Mountjoy Visiting Committee, published today, regarding the conditions in Mountjoy Prison; (7) Deputy Nora Owen &mdash; the provision of the much needed new health centre in Swords, County Dublin; (8) Deputy Michael Finucane &mdash; whether the <Col N="777" /> Minister for Finance is aware that, as a result of the postal strike income tax and VAT refunds have to be collected from the Dublin offices and whether it can be arranged that the cheques be sent to regional offices to prevent hardship and inconvenience to those concerned; (9) Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan &mdash; the serious situation in the Lebanon in which Irish troops were in danger due to Isreali attacks; (10) Deputy Pat Lee &mdash; the serious financial problems that the 2,500 employees (and their immediate families) who are not in dispute with An Post have because of the suspension of the payroll staff by An Post management.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 12, line 42, after &ldquo;accused&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a person who has concluded a deed of separation with his spouse under which the parties have agreed to live or to continue to live separate and apart from each other&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Deputy Shatter.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this is a technical amendment, although it would have important implications in the context of this Part of the Bill, rather than making a lengthy speech on the matter, perhaps without further ado we should get the Minister of State's response to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister of State contributes I would like to signal my support for this concept.  It would be reasonable to extend the provisions to include persons who have signed a deed of separation.  There is no difference between a situation where the court orders a couple to live apart and a situation where a couple decide to avoid <Col N="778" /> the necessity to go to court by executing a deed of separation to achieve the same ends.  The ultimate legal situation is exactly the same; in the first case it is done by way of a court arrangement, agreement or order and in the other case by way of a deed of separation between two adults to whom we had previously given the power and authority to marry but now they are agreeing to live apart.  I see no reason the amendment should not be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Shatter, I, too, intend in the insufferable conditions in the Chamber &mdash; this has nothing to do with those present but merely the temperature &mdash; to remove my jacket, if that is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we are requested to wear our coats but I am not going to impose any further hardship on people who have to endure these appallingly warm conditions. Nevertheless, I will give good example by enduring the conditions, as I must, by wearing coat and gown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Shatter and Deputy McCartan will find that there is all-party agreement in relation to the conditions in the Chamber.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 45 in the name of Deputy Shatter, which is being taken with amendments Nos. 53 and 57, proposes that spouses who have concluded a deed of separation under which they have agreed to live or continue to live apart should be included in the definition of &ldquo;former spouse&rdquo;.  These spouses would thus be equated with those who have obtained a decree of judicial separation. Accordingly, they would be compellable for the prosecution and a co-accused in all cases except for any non-violent offences committed by the other spouse while the couple were living together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Shatter, who has far greater experience of these matters than I, would agree that in many cases decrees of judicial separation are obtained because the two parties to the marriage cannot agree on how the property should be shared.  Therefore, they have to go <Col N="779" /> to court and allow the judge to decide. Therefore, I see no distinction in reality between a case where people have separated and drawn up a deed of separation through their respective solicitors and a case where people go to court to have the Circuit Court judge draw up a decree of judicial separation.  From that point of view, I do not see any great objections to the amendment.  I would ask Deputy Shatter to withdraw his amendment on the basis that I undertake to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which will be saying substantially what he proposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I think there is enough political heat generated in the Chamber without all of us cooking.  That is why I have taken my jacket off.  Anything we have been doing on this Bill all day has been considered with sufficient seriousness.  I do not think the dignity of the House will collapse or my brain power will be in some way diminished by not wearing a jacket.  Indeed one wonders whether the absence of journalists from the House during Committee Stage of this Bill is due to the political heat or due to the climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister appears to accept the amendment but I cannot help being somewhat dismayed at the oddity of the Minister's reply, which I would attribute to the usual bureaucratic departmentalese.  Apparently officials in the Department of Justice convey a sense to Ministers, be they senior or junior Ministers, that in some way their political manhood or womanhood is put at risk if they accept an amendment from the Opposition benches.  It seemed to me that we had got away from that type of approach in some recent legislation when one or two Ministers who survived the reshuffle and who are part of the current Government were willing, on Committee Stage, to take on board amendments from Opposition Deputies whenever they were constructive.  This is a constructive amendment bearing no particular party political stamp.  There is not a Fine Gael trademark riding on the back of it that will result in the Fine Gael <Col N="780" /> Party suddenly jumping 10 per cent in the opinion polls if the amendment is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a lot more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed if the Minister accepts this amendment there will not be hordes of Fine Gaelers standing outside Leinster House cheering the accomplishments of the Fine Gael Party.  One can take it that most people outside the House would not be particularly interested in this technical amendment. Nevertheless it is of importance, in particular in criminal cases where spouses may be sought to give evidence.  In some instances, a spouse, even in a separation situation may regard it as a form of protection to be able to say to the spouse from whom they are separated that they have to attend at court by way of subpoena. That can actually be a form of protection rather than saying: &ldquo;I voluntarily came along to do you in court&rdquo;, which can be counterproductive.  As the Minister quite rightly said, and as I said before lunch, there is no great difference, in the legal context between a judicial separation and a separation agreement. If that is agreed, why is it that Ministers have some sort of possessory instincts over their legislation, whereby some Ministers have a psychological difficulty in saying to an Opposition Deputy: &ldquo;Yes, that is a good amendment, thank you very much, we will take it on board, if you get the slightest kudos from somebody in Clonakilty who understands what it is about, if you get a quarter of a round of applause at a local Fine Gael branch meeting for some major national achievement on this Bill, well, good luck to you&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sensible amendment.  There is no technical reason it cannot be adopted. It is dealt with adequately in the Bill. There is no reason for the Minister not to take it on board and to come back on Report Stage with a different amendment. Before lunch when the Minister proposed an amendment which improved a provision of the Bill, albeit a somewhat flawed improvement, he said to me <Col N="781" /> appealingly, across the House, when I suggested to him that perhaps he might want to withdraw it and come back with the correct amendment.  &ldquo;This is better than what is contained in the Bill already; we will look at it on Report Stage&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  If he will not accept it I will put it to a vote because we are trying to be constructive.  I see no reason it cannot be accepted.  If it is inserted in the Bill and some further minor change is required on Report State, so be it; let us bring it into the House.  But let us not get into the foolish position in which an Opposition Deputy, be it myself or Deputy McCartan, produces a technically correct amendment that addresses something that needs to be addressed and the Minister across the floor of the House says: &ldquo;If you withdraw it I will do the same thing on Report Stage.&rdquo;  The only difference on Report Stage is that instead of the amendment being tabled in the name of Deputy Alan Shatter or Deputy <Col N="782" /> Pat McCartan it will be tabled in the name of An tAire Dlí agus Cirt.  I do not think the nation will be stopped in its stride if this amendment is adopted.  I do not see it as the main news story on the six o'clock or nine o'clock news.  I would predict that it would not even hit those insomniacs who stay up sufficiently late at night to watch &ldquo;Dáil Report&rdquo; on the television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter knows there is a time constraint on this Bill.  If he wishes to divide the House, so be it. He wants to achieve something.  I thank him for the benefit of the Fine Gael people in Clonakilty and elsewhere, for bringing this matter to our attention.  I accept the logic of what he has said.  I will introduce an amendment to achieve what he wants to achieve.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding I wish to advise the House that fairly definite statements have been made by Members that in their opinion the normal decorum of the House is not being upheld.  Accordingly, I appeal to the two Members who, understandably in the temperature prevailing, decided to remove their jackets, to put on their jackets and endure the heat for the sake of what is considered by all sides as the decorum of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the comment you are making, Sir, but I think it is fair to say that the conditions in this House are a disgrace and would not be tolerated by any person working in either the public sector or the private sector, other than the elected Members of this House. I believe the decorum of the House is not based on some post-colonial concept of copying what is done in Westminster. We have been doing serious work in this House on this Bill since 10.30 a.m.  The only Opposition Deputies who have contributed to the debate and tabled amendments relevant to last night's session and today's session have been Deputy McCartan and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe the value of what we are doing is in any way diminished by our not wearing jackets.  Less pomposity and more real work is what is required in this House.  I am most anxious not to get involved in any rows with you, Sir. Indeed I was going to extend to you an invitation to take off your jacket if you so wished.  If the Minister has difficulty in taking off his jacket that is his decision. I do not see why we cannot acknowledge the fact that temperatures change and <Col N="785" /> why, in the important committee work we are doing, it is necessary for us to sit here like some stuffed shirt, post-colonial boys mirroring the practice of the British Parliament.  There are parliaments throughout the world where it is quite acceptable for the members to take off their jackets.  Yet, here we are in the year of Maastricht and it is not acceptable for us to take off our jackets.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we need to have a speech about it. The weakness in the Deputy's presentation is that while he is expressing his views he would seem to disregard the views and judgments of everybody else in the House.  In that way one must take the consensus view.  One cannot in any House presume to have rules and regulations that suit oneself only.  If it is the considered opinion of the House, as was indicated during the vote, that the normal decorum is not being upheld one must subject one's personal opinions to it until the matter has been resolved in some other fashion.</P>

However we have been here. I did not hear any pronouncement of discomfort from any member of my party and if members of Fianna Fáil are discommoded by people removing their jackets so be it.  I am not sure what the qualitative difference is between Deputy Gregory's not wearing a tie and my not wearing a jacket.  If it is acceptable for Deputy Gregory not to wear a tie, it should be acceptable for myself and Deputy McCartan to take off our jackets in this sort of climate and weather.</P>

I frankly do not consider that I am being in any way discourteous to you and the House by simply divesting myself of my jacket so that I can better apply myself to the job at hand.  You will be aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that during the last two years the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have sought sanction from the Department of Finance for the necessary funds to install a proper air conditioning system in the Chamber but that this request has been rejected by the Department on each occasion.  This means that on very warm and welcome days like today it becomes very difficult to work in this Chamber.  I hope therefore you will tolerate what is considered to be my lack of decorum and allow me to continue in the manner in which I have been working for the last few minutes.  There is only a short time left in the debate.  I take the point you have made and I have no doubt that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will discuss the issue at greater length.

    <P>This amendment deals with a very central and essential point.

Previously spouses were deemed neither competent nor compellable to give evidence against their other half in proceedings.  As crime is very much a male-dominated activity, this was a provision against women who could neither be considered competent nor compellable because, as with the age old notion, the woman was the property of the husband and was a lesser person once drawn into the marriage arrangement.  It is very curious that one of the arguments as to why this proposition should be <Col N="789" /> maintained so long in our law was that there was a certain sanctity to marriage, and within marriage the woman was the lesser of the two people.  The provision has been invidious in the areas of violence and sexual abuse as well as in the areas we are anxious to deal with in the legislation. There was a limited provision in earlier legislation that in those circumstances a woman was competent and, on occasions, compellable, but by and large the general principle militated against her involvement in these proceedings.</P>
    <P>Therefore the provisions in Part IV providing for the woman are necessary, and when I say &ldquo;woman&rdquo; I mean spouse, but for the greater part of these proceedings it is the woman who is affected. The Minister and the Government recognise that in all criminal proceedings a woman is competent.  My amendment goes further.  I propose that not only should she be competent but she should also be compellable.  I reject the concept that confidentiality in the marriage arrangement is sacrosanct, thus making it impossible for the prosecution to rely upon the testimony of a spouse in circumstances where that testimony would be crucial to and capable of bringing a proper conviction.</P>
    <P>It has been argued that by breaking down the element of compellability one is in some way invading the so-called sanctity of marriage as it exists.  I would argue that where a spouse engages in the unilaterial action of committing a crime, by those actions alone they are attacking the community and invading the sanctity of the union between the husband and wife.  To go out and commit crime is a breach of the confidence that exists in the basic union of marriage.  It is rarely that the wife or the husband, whichever is the innocent party, would give prior approval of the illegal activities of the other spouse in the commission of crime.  There are people who work in concert not only within the marriage bed but outside in the criminal world, but they are the exception.  The first betrayal of the confidentiality of the marriage is by the person committing the crime.  Why should the person be allowed to apply, <Col N="790" /> in their defence, the very concepts that they have thrown out the window by becoming involved in the crime in the first place?</P>
    <P>For example, suppose it happened that a husband, without consulting or getting prior approval from his wife &mdash; as a matter of policy we should never contemplate a situation in which a spouse can give approval to the commission of a crime &mdash; commits a robbery using a firearm, makes good his escape and goes home where his wife totally unaware of what has happened, observes him disposing of the weapon and the proceeds underneath the bed.  Subsequently, the Garda visit the house and discover the weapons and the proceeds, but do not find the husband. They interview the wife who says: &ldquo;It has nothing to do with me.  I saw my husband come in and hide the proceeds and the weapons.&rdquo;  Under the law as proposed by the Minister the Garda, who may require the woman's testimony in order to prove that the husband deposited the items in the bedroom, might be told that there is some principle with regard to the sanctity of marriage and the need to maintain confidentiality &mdash; which is being abused by the husband &mdash; which prevents them from compelling the wife to go to court to testify.</P>
    <P>It makes a nonsense of our law not to provide that in those circumstances a spouse is competent and can be compelled to attend court for the purpose of giving testimony on behalf of the prosecution. I would go further and suggest that often it would be in ease of the spouse, in circumstances where they disapprove of the other's criminal activities, to be compelled and subpoenaed to give testimony.  Very often in those circumstances a spouse who would like to give testimony cannot do so because she is not compellable and her husband may tell her to stay away from the court so that he will go free.  In the circumstances the Minister is providing for, there is nothing to compel the spouse to come forward although she wishes to testify but is reluctant to do so because of pressure from the husband.</P>
    <P>We should follow through with the <Col N="791" /> logic of what the Minister is providing for here.  In introducing the general proposition that spouses in all criminal proceedings are competent, I am not interfering with the progress being made. We should go the further logical step of adding to the formula that spouses are also compellable and can be required, in the interests of justice, of the fair prosecution of the offence and of the community at large, to attend and give the relevant testimony.  I hope the Minister accepts the amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan will note that section 20 deals with competence of witnesses, whereas section 21 deals with compellability of witnesses.  I would have thought that what Deputy McCartain is proposing would be more appropriate to section 21, but that is only a small point.  Deputy McCartan has put down one or two amendments to section 21 and we can discuss the matter further at that stage.  My initial thoughts on this matter are as follows.  The proposal that a spouse should be compellable for the prosecution in all criminal proceedings against the other spouse would be a very radical departure from the present law and, indeed, from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  It appears, as a result of a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal &mdash; DPP <i>versus</i> JT in 1988 &mdash; that a spouse is compellable against the other spouse only in cases of assault or of a sexual offence against a member of the family.</P>
      <P>In section 21 we are proceeding to adopt that on a statutory basis.  We are also making a spouse compellable in the case of violence or a sexual offence against any person under 17, whether a member of the family or not, which is quite an extension on the present law, even taking into account the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of compellability of spouses is a delicate one.  It involves striking a balance between the need to have constitutional protection for the institution of marriage on the one hand, and the equal need to defend and vindicate <Col N="792" /> the personal rights of those who have suffered injustice.  There will always be differing opinions when a balance has to be struck.</P>
    <P>It also occurs to me, that if two people are living together in a stable relationship, one can be compellable against the other.  I accept that there is an anomaly here.  It is a difficult situation.  We are providing a pretty radical extension to the law as it stands.  We are trying to strike a balance because a balance has to be struck.  At present I am not inclined to go all the way suggested by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tease this out a little further.  It is a difficult matter and there is not an ideal solution to it. Obviously, where there are violent crimes, threats of violence or sexual offences, and the types of offences referred to here, a spouse should be compellable.</P>
      <P>If in a good marriage the wife of a member of the IRA who was engaged in gun-running asked her spouse to stop this activity, but he did not, and was charged in the courts, that woman would not volunteer as a witness because she would not want her husband to continue with what he was doing.  Indeed, she may be concerned that his life was at risk, that if he continued doing what he was doing, not only might he be imprisoned, but another subversive organisation might have him shot or the organisation of which he was a member might have him shot, for a particular reason.  That woman could not volunteer to give evidence but she would want her husband to stop even if it meant he had to serve a sentence of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way one can give evidence is if one is subpoenaed to court and one is a compellable witness.  One may feel that that is a desirable thing to happen in the long term, but as a spouse one needs the protection of the subpoena to give that evidence.  A spouse needs to be able to say, &ldquo;I have no choice; I have to go to court; I have been subpoenaed, and if I do not go to court I will be put in jail.&rdquo; Perhaps there will never be such a case, <Col N="793" /> and perhaps that is idle speculation.  The argument that has always been made in the past for not compelling spouses to give evidence, is that there is an assumption that compelling a husband to give evidence against his wife or a wife to give evidence against her husband will break up what might be a happy and viable marriage.</P>
    <P>I wish to put the other side of the argument.  It is possible that a subpoena, and a person being compelled to give evidence on occasions, is actually a protection, to allow someone to give evidence one feels one should give, in a way in which one is not given a choice.  One cannot do it by choice and that is the other side of the argument.  It may not be right, but it is a value judgment as to whether what Deputy McCartan is saying is correct or should be so confined.</P>
    <P>A spouse is in a unique position.  A spouse is the only competent witness who is not compellable generally speaking. We should ask, why people should be compelled to give evidence in court.  In criminal cases the only reason anyone would be compelled to give evidence is that someone has committed an offence, and a person is on trial for committing that offence and there is a belief that a person can give evidence in court which will help either to prove that that person has committed an offence, or assist in establishing that person's innocence. The compellability aspect is to ensure that a reluctant witness is made available to a judge and jury in a trial to allow them to get at the truth.  A judgment has to be made as a matter of public policy as to whether in all criminal cases the courts should be facilitated in getting at the truth or whether there is an overriding public interest that says in some criminal cases the court should only be allowed to get part of the truth.</P>
    <P>I do not want to keep harping back to the alleged incest case in Waterford, which got much mention in this House, where a person, alleged to be the father of the child, allegedly had sexual relations with the child.  The charge was dismissed because the mother did not go to the court to give evidence and was not <Col N="794" /> subpoenaed.  It would seem that under section 21 that mother is competent and compellable.  The Minister might clarify that.  In that case I wondered whether the common law was such that that mother was competent and compellable.</P>
    <P>In cases of that nature it would seem that the overriding public interest is that the court should get at the truth.  Let us assume that there is a major robbery in one of our banks tomorrow morning in which £2 million is taken and there is no violence.  Arguably, there would be the threat of violence as someone would have to have a weapon in his hands.  Let us assume that the bank was robbed at a week-end and there was no one in the bank, that bank robbers who had a compulsion to watch videos of bank robberies did the classic thing of getting into a premises next door to the bank, breaking through the walls over the week-end and making off with the cash amounting to £1 million.  Is there not an overriding public interest in the wife of the alleged bank robber being a competent and compellable witness to give evidence in that case if it is believed that the wife can give evidence which would be helpful? For example, if three days after the robbery she finds that there is a present of a £60,000 sports car from her husband, outside the house, though she knew the previous week he was unemployed and on social welfare benefit, would it not be worthwhile and in the public interest that she would be a competent and compellable witness?  What overriding public interest is there in not making her a competent and compellable witness?</P>
    <P>There is an artificial view about the sanctity of marriage in this context.  The overriding public interest, certainly in instances of major crime as opposed to petty crime, what lawyers call indictable offences rather than misdemeanours, would indicate that where a serious offence is committed, a spouse should be a competent and compellable witness.  It would seem that for minor offences or misdemeanours nothing should be done to place a marriage relationship at risk and a spouse should not be <Col N="795" /> compellable, albeit he or she should be competent.  I do not fully agree with Deputy McCartan's amendment as I tease it out, but the approach that we are adopting in the Bill is not adequate.  In the context of all serious offences there is a strong case to be made that a spouse should always be a competent and compellable witness, but for minor offences that case does not stand up.</P>
    <P>One other issue arises on this and is of relevance as I understand the provisions in this Bill as they interact with the current law.  What I am saying relates to Deputy McCartan's amendment to sections 20 and 21 where there is interaction. If I marry in Ireland, live in Ireland, get a divorce in Haiti or the Dominican Republic or use an accommodation address and get a divorce in England, then marry a second person in England, Haiti or the Dominican Republic and return to Ireland, I have in theory celebrated a bigamous marriage. We have a large number of people whose marriages have broken down and who have got divorces of convenience outside this country and then remarried and are living with their new spouses in Ireland. All of these marriages are bigamous and invalid.  We probably have the highest proportion of persons committing bigamy per head of population in Ireland than any European State.  If anyone does a table of it we will be at the top.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons bigamy prosecutions do not take place.  The first is that we turn a blind eye to it.  If, however, the first spouse disapproves of what has happened and tries to get the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring a case or tries to bring a case personally, the first spouse is in the ironic position currently of not being a compellable witness and not being competent either.  She cannot actually give evidence in court saying.  &ldquo;I am married to this man, this man has celebrated his second marriage and it is bigamous&rdquo;.  Under this legislation one will be able to become a competent witness but unless one has a judicial separation, one is not compellable.  This is where we stand at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I am not suggesting that we start prosecuting everyone who is committing bigamy currently in this State.  If we did that we would clog up our courts for the next ten years.  We would have to multiply by two the total number of lawyers in the State simply to defend the poor people brought before the courts. The Minister might confirm that, welcome though this section is first it will mean that we can now have a lot more bigamy prosecutions and, secondly, some spouses where there is a judicial separation will be compellable to give evidence in such cases and others will not. What will happen if some of the more fundamentalist groups, like SPUC, decide to start a war on second spouses and start looking for prosecutions?  Could there be dangers if all wives were compellable to give evidence in respect of such situations?  I am merely speculating. It is a complicated area and the complications are exacerbated by our antiquated approach to social issues in the divorce area and as it inter-relates with the crime of bigamy.  We should come back on Report Stage looking at the compellability of spouses in circumstances where a spouse is charged with a serious offence that is not simply an offence of assault or an offence involving violence or sexual abuse.  There is a public policy decision to be made here of some importance. As the Minister has said, it is a very long time since this was addressed. Indeed, I am not sure this has ever been fully addressed in this House.  A lot of this is common law.  If we do not get it right in this Bill, perhaps in 50 years time we will return to it.  I think we should get it right this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in the Waterford case, as I understand the law at present, the spouse would have been compellable as a witness under the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1988.  Deputy Shatter raised a question about bigamy prosecutions.  He is quite right in saying that the spouses will now be competent witnesses.  That is correct. A subpoena can force somebody to come to court, presumably under threat of <Col N="797" /> imprisonment or whatever, but no subpoena can force somebody to tell the truth when they come to court.  As the law stands at the moment or if this Bill is passed in its present form, if a spouse who is competent to give evidence against the other spouse does not want to come to court for some very good reason such as intimidation, fear or whatever, we can make them compellable to appear in court but we cannot force them by legislation to tell the truth when they go to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the IRA type case which Deputy Shatter mentioned, has it occurred to the Deputy that making the spouse in that case compellable might actually put the spouse in danger?  If a spouse is made compellable and for some reason or other does not want to go to court, whether because of intimidation or desire not to wreck the marriage, I do not think she is going to be a very good witness if she is forced to come to court. She may turn out to be a hostile or an untruthful witness.  If we make spouses compellable in every case and the spouse for some reason, whether through fear or through desire to save the marriage or whatever, does not obey the summons, what sanction can we reasonably impose? It is a question of striking a balance and there will always be a dispute when it comes to striking a balance.  Deputy Shatter does not fully agree with Deputy McCartan.  Deputy Enright might not fully agree with either of them.  When one is striking a balance one is of necessity going to leave people on all sides of the argument not fully satisfied.  We are constrained by the terms of Article 41.31º of the Constitution whereby the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it against attack.  Perhaps if it were not for that provision we might be a little freer to make spouses compellable in a larger number of cases than we are proposing. It has been acknowledged by Deputies that we are making a pretty radical extension to the law as it stands.  I am disinclined to go any further at this point, bearing in mind the human and the constitutional <Col N="798" /> considerations.  From that point of view I am not inclined to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument about constitutional considerations is spurious entirely.  I do not believe any provision of the Constitution can be employed to assist someone to suggest that there is an onus on the Stage to protect the sanctity of a marriage that is given over to conspiracy or confederacy in crime.  In other words, if a husband and wife are confiding in each other about crime, I do not think the concept of marriage as envisaged in the Constitution in those circumstances is one that deserves constitutional protection.  On the other hand, if there is breach of trust between the parties, the better interests would be served by the entitlement of the State to call one or other spouse as a witness.  I do not believe that constitutional requirements demand of us to use the Constitution to protect a spouse under a guise that he or she has abused in the first instance by going out, without confiding in the other spouse, and committing a crime against the community and by definition against the other spouse in the broadest possible sense.  I do not really think the Constitution is a worry in this regard.</P>
      <P>In this debate I am in disagreement with the Law Reform Commission.  They did not borrow the Constitution as a reason.  They said there was the notion of the sanctity of the institution of marriage and that it was in some ways an extension of the privilege of the right against self-incrimination, a curious concept built on the notion that the family or the marriage creates a bonding or a union of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue that has to be thrown into the balance is the individual rights on the one hand as opposed to the community interests on the other.  I accept the proposition as a better refinement of what I am trying to achieve here or what is being suggested by Deputy Shatter that we cannot gradate, at least in areas of serious crime.  We have introduced an element of gradation in this where we have made a spouse compellable in instances of sexual <Col N="799" /> abuse, in instances of violence and in instances of crimes against children under a certain age.  We have introduced the notion of gradation and a balance between community interest and personal interest.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take away from what has been achieved in terms of the improvements incorporated in sections 20 and 21.  They are significant in themselves but in my view there is need for a further extension of the logic that subtends the improvements already in sections 20 and 21.  This is something we will come back to on Report Stage because it is a matter I would be anxious to press further.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I appreciate fully, as an Opposition person working on the Bill, the way in which the Minister of State has taken on board the views and points made by me, at least, and I am sure by other Deputies on this side during the course of this debate.  It has been refreshing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make this statement to the House on the conclusion of what has been an historic agreement in the future orientation of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.  As everyone here knows, the question of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has been foremost in the minds of farmers and policy makers alike for the past 18 months.  Long and difficult negotiations took place during this period culminating in last week's marathon session of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels. It is my firmly held conviction that the outcome of this Council has been very good from a national point of view and will see producers and consumers alike derive considerable benefits from it over the coming years.</P>
      <P>From an Irish point of view the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform were the most important undertaken since we joined the Community. Agriculture is a uniquely important sector in our economy.  I am very pleased that our ability to get this message across in the Council of Ministers and at every other opportunity, including bilateral meetings with each of the Ministers, bore fruit when the time came for decisions to be taken.  The agreement of the Council to the adoption of special measures for the beef sector will be of unique benefit to us and testifies to the success of the final outcome of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious that there was need for a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In recent years it had become clear that the policy adopted at a time when the Community had a food deficit was no longer the answer in the face of spiralling production and recurring market imbalances in major sectors such as beef, milk and cereals.  The build up <Col N="802" /> of substantial stocks of goods in intervention, to which we in this country contributed very substantially, led to financial pressure on the community budget and pressure from public opinion for change.  FEOGA market support expenditure was on the increase in recent years, up by 32 per cent in 1991 when compared to 1990, but it had not prevented a decline in producer incomes as much of the increase was being absorbed in the financial costs associated with intervention on a grand scale.  The continuing decline in the number of producers in the Community, down 40 per cent since 1975 despite an increase in FEOGA support expenditure from 4 billion ECU to 31.5 billion ECU in the same period, bore ample testimony to the need for reflection and a carefully planned change in policy direction.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatsoever but that we in Ireland benefitted greatly from the Common Agriculture Policy which has resulted in an inflow of some £11.5 billion (a) £10.7 billion under the guarantee and (b) £0.8 billion under the guidance section since we joined the Community. However, one certain way of destroying the Common Agriculture Policy would have been to ignore its deficiencies.</P>
    <P>All those with the interests of farmers at heart knew that change was required, none more so than Commissioner Mac-Sharry who spearheaded the adoption and presentation by the Commission of its blueprint for the reorientation of the Common Agricultural Policy early last year.  Our reaction to these proposals was cautious.  While we sympathised with the underlying principles of what the Commission had in mind, which included the maintenance of the maximum number of farm families in rural areas, an expansion in the role of such farmers to be producers of food as well as protectors of the environment and a fairer allocation of Community expenditure, we knew that major adaptations would be required before an agreement acceptable to us could emerge.</P>
    <P>Once the Commission had put forward its proposals for reform there were two alternatives open to us; accept the Commission's <Col N="803" /> paper as a basis for discussion while highlighting its deficiencies or adopt the negative stance of total rejection of what was on the table.  Sensibly Ireland adopted the positive and what has ultimately proved to be the correct approach.  What would have happened if the other approach had been taken as some in this House had advocated?  Let us not beat around the bush.  The only alternative policy for the Community would have been a major intensification of the recent trend of price cuts without compensation.  I am convinced that no Deputy in this House seriously believes that for us to have facilitated such a policy in any way would have been in the best interests of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Let us recall what our requirements were going into these negotiations.  In general terms these included the need to ensure that the policy was modified in such a way as to give a more concrete expression to the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy laid down in the Rome Treaty, to potect the role of agriculture as the most important sector of the Irish economy, to safeguard the incomes of farmers, to promote policy options which would result in the maintenance of the maximum number of farm families on the land, to protect the vital commercial element of our agriculture industry, to prevent discrimination against grass based extensive methods of production, to secure adequate and lasting budgetary resources and to seek to ensure that any reform package agreed would be secure in the context of an agreement under the GATT.  We accepted the need to curb production growth, with a view to bringing markets more into balance thereby leading to greater producer returns from the market rather than from intervention mechanisms.</P>
    <P>We had particular policy objectives in each sector.  As regards beef, we sought measures which would address our seasonality problem including satisfactory premia arrangements and assurances on the provision of adequate intervention arrangements well into the future.  In the <Col N="804" /> case of milk, avoidance of the proposed quota cut was one of our aims, together with a much smaller price cut than the 10 per cent proposed, preferably involving some adaptations in the price of butter. On sheepmeat we wanted to maintain current eligibility limits for the purposes of qualification for the ewe premium and as regards cereals we sought less severe price cuts combined with fuller compensation.</P>
    <P>Were these policy objectives achieved? The answer can only be a resounding yes.  The agreement reached represents a really major improvement on what had initially been put forward and its conclusion will end the uncertainty which has prevailed in farming circles over the past 15 months.  All involved in agriculture, farmers, processors and traders can now confidently proceed with their plans knowing the future shape of support and premium arrangements.  I am confident that farm incomes will be stabilised and that the contribution of the agriculture and food industry to the well-being of our national economy will continue and even improve in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>What has been agreed is a significant reorientation of Community support away from direct market price support towards direct payments to farmers to offset any consequential income losses. The adjusted market support measures will be accompanied by a series of socio structural actions relating to early retirement, agri enviroment and forestry.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that what was achieved is highly significant given the difficulties involved.  The outcome is especially welcome for the beef sector where as we all know producers have been facing declining returns in recent years.</P>
    <P>Early indications are that upon full implementation this Common Agricultural Policy reform package will benefit producers overall to the tune of £70 million annually.</P>
    <P>The policy switch agreed will see producers deriving a greater percentage of their incomes from direct payments.  I am happy that since such payments go directly to farmers we will see a more <Col N="805" /> equitable distribution of the Community's resources amongst producers than in the recent past.  As a result of the negotiations, direct payments &mdash; headage and premia &mdash; to Irish farmers will increase by £340 million to exceed £620 million per year.  I am also confident that farmers will react positively in response to the new price signals by increasing their productivity and will also benefit from a much more market led approach which I am sure will be adopted by the processing sector.</P>
    <P>I would now like to make special mention of the improvements and arrangements for those sectors of particular importance to Ireland.  The main effect in the beef sector will be to completely reorient cattle price support arrangements. While the intervention price for cattle will be reduced by 15 per cent in three stages beginning in 1992, dramatically increased and specifically targeted premia will both compensate producers and at the same time tackle the long standing seasonality problem.</P>
    <P>Beef farmers will, on full implementation of reform, benefit from a basic male bovine premium of £158 per male animal compared to the current level of £35.  In addition in a development of particular importance to Ireland, a special slaughter premium of £52.75 will be payable on all male animals slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April.  This provision has been included in the package specifically at our request and is designed to tackle the problem of seasonality of production in the beef industry which has long been recognised as a major impediment to its development. Furthermore, an additional premium of £26 per male animal will be payable on holdings where the stocking rate is below 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  Farmers could therefore qualify for a maximum male bovine premium of £237 compared to £35 at present.</P>
    <P>I would also like the point out that the forthcoming changes in premia arrangements will not affect producers traditional entitlement to headage payments. They will also be paid.  I have given an undertaking that headage and premia <Col N="806" /> payments will be paid in the calendar year for which they are due.  I was not satisfied, nor did I make any excuses, that these payments were long delayed and the only people who were seriously affected were the farmers but, now that the headage and premia payments are of far greater value, I will be insisting that payments are made smoothly and on time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that these arrangements were specifically designed to meet our request to tackle the seasonality of production here and I am confident that a real change in the pattern of our slaughterings can be achieved.  These payments will be of particular benefit to extensive grass-based producers.  It is expected that around 90,000 producers with 950,000 animals will benefit from these premia with the maximum national eligibility being confined to total stock numbers in any of the three years 1990, 1991 or 1992.  The premium can optionally be operated at the level of the individual which will benefit traditional producers.  We were very anxious that the traditional beef or cereal producers would be able to make a living from their particular system of farming.</P>
      <P>As regards the suckler cow premium, the level of increase will be from the current rate of £52 to a new annual rate of IR£123 per animal in all cases and to £149 where the applicant can benefit from the £26 extensification premium.  The right to the premium will be confined to the number of animals in respect of which premia were paid in 1990, 1991 or 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New intervention arrangements will be introduced with a return to buying in of quantities similar to those applicable <Col N="807" /> before the BSE scare and the Gulf War. An intervention ceiling of 750,000 tonnes will be introduced in 1993 but will be reduced to 350,000 tonnes by 1997. However, safety net intervention will be retained and quantities bought in under that arrangement will not be counted in the overall ceiling.  Significantly, the Council noted a declaration by the Commission that its decisions on the acceptance of offers of beef for intervention will take special account of regions with a heavy dependence on beef production with a view to avoiding the necessity of recourse in such regions to safety net intervention.</P>
    <P>All in all the deal agreed is an excellent one for the beef sector.  Direct payments will be increased by in excess of £200 million and together with input savings should more than compensate beef producers for any losses arising from the reduction in institutional prices.  At the same time, the new arrangements and in particular the special premium to assist winter fatteners will enable Irish beef plants to be more competitive.  I am confident that the trend of the last two years which saw 52 per cent and 56 per cent of total beef production going into intervention will be reversed.</P>
    <P>As regards milk, I am very pleased that there will be no quota reduction this year and that the proposed cuts in quota of 1 per cent for each of the two following years can only be introduced following a review of market conditions.  It was in response to arguments put forward by me and others in the Council, to the effect that the current market situation did not necessitate a quota cut, that the original proposal was dropped.  The Council also agreed that there will be no price cut this year and to limit the price cut for this sector to 2.5 per cent over two years from 1993-94 which will arise from a 5 per cent adjustment in the butter price, compared to an original proposal to cut the milk price by 10 per cent.  I am sure that we all recognise the need to cut the price of butter, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the market place.  Another welcome development is that the milk <Col N="808" /> co-responsibility levy will be withdrawn from the beginning of the next marketing year.  They are the conditions relating to milk quota and price; anything else members read in any publication is simply incorrect.</P>
    <P>In the case of cereals the outcome represents a signficant improvement on what the Commission had originally proposed. In particular the price cut of 29 per cent is less severe than the 35 per cent originally proposed while the compensation arrangements have been improved for both the price reduction and set-aside. The position of traditional producers will be safeguarded by the facility to operate the new arrangements at individual farm level.  In addition the discontinuation of all co-responsibility levies will benefit cereal producers to the tune of £16 million this year.</P>
    <P>A further benefit will accrue to producers under the new system as compared to the existing one.  At present, if the Community maximum guaranteed quantity were to be exceeded, all member states would be penalised, even those which had not contributed to the Community's over-production.  Under the new scheme the Community will be divided into regional base areas and Ireland will be considered to be a region under the new arrangements.  It is only if the base areas in a region exceed the maximum guaranteed quantity that producers in that region will be penalised. That is very important from Ireland's point of view because up to now if the Community exceeded the quota we were penalised even if we were under the limit. That will not happen in the future.  It must also be emphasised that livestock producers will benefit by way of reduced input costs arising from the cuts in cereal prices.</P>
    <P>In relation to the sheep sector a national quota based on a reference year of either 1989, 1990 or 1991 will be introduced in respect of the ewe premium. There will be no change in the present maximum flock sizes qualifying for the premium and 50 per cent of the premium for animals in excess of the maximum will continue to be paid under the new <Col N="809" /> arrangements.  Ireland's 52,000 sheep producers have been protected in the face of a major effort to reduce the numbers of ewes eligible for premiums and to phase out the payment of any premiums in respect of numbers in excess of the eligibility limits.</P>
    <P>The accompanying measures consist of three key elements: an agri-environment action programme, a forestry programme and an early retirement scheme.  I see the operation of these schemes as complimentary to the arrangements for the various market sectors.  They will offer farmers opportunities for diversification. I am confident that the smooth operation of the early retirement scheme, which will be 75 per cent funded by the European Community, will improve the rate of land transfer to younger farmers, while adequately providing for the security of those farmers willing to participate.  I realise that all previous retirement schemes were unsuccessful and did not work in Ireland.  I am very pleased that this one is to be put in operation and will be adequately funded.  I hope that it will elicit a better response than previous schemes.</P>
    <P>On the matter of financing for the new package, a number of spokespersons have legitimately raised questions.  There is no point in making an arrangement unless it is a long term one, and I am satisfied by assurances given by Commissioner MacSharry that adequate and durable Community funding will be provided. I am equally satisfied that this agreement will not be subject to discipline under any future GATT agreement. I know that the Commission and the Community as a whole are fully determined that this will be the case.</P>
    <P>This agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy presents us, in Ireland, with major opportunities, especially when taken in conjunction with the completion of the internal market which will give us free access to the Community's 340 million consumers. I am confident that the producers and food processors of Ireland will not simply sit around reflecting on what has been achieved.  I hope that they will now make <Col N="810" /> their assessments, frame their plans and grasp their opportunities.</P>
    <P>In the new situation, particularly reduced intervention availability, we will need to develop new markets.  Regrettably we have up to now been less successful than I would have wished in penetrating markets within the Community. This situation must change or the hard-won concessions achieved last week will be undermined.  An improved performance will require a major effort and a lot of hard work, but the impetus is there now for us to adopt a more market-led approach.  It is time that we stopped just talking about capitalising on our image as unrivalled producers of wholesome food in a clean environment and actually went out and delivered these goods to the European consumer.  It is only in this way that the gains secured last week can be copperfastened in a way that will protect the incomes of all those involved in the agriculture and food industries.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me and I think to everyone that last week's Council agreement represents an historical turning point in the agriculture sector, not only here but throughout the European Community. What would have happened had there been no reform proposals or if, having been made, they had not been adopted by the Council?  The simple answer is that the system would have broken down under the weight of surpluses and under the cost of financing them.  Either that or the European Commission would have been forced to employ the many management tools at its disposal to effect a drastic and probably uncompensated reduction in the scope and impact of price supports.</P>
    <P>These things I am glad to say did not happen.  Instead we have had a reform which is balanced and thought through, not adopted suddenly in a crisis situation, one which takes proper account of Ireland's needs and one which, for the first time ever, addresses the complex and obstinate problem of excessive seasonality in Irish cattle production.  This is not the disaster that some people predicted <Col N="811" /> but a package of opportunities for the future.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute here to the major effort of the initiative and negotiation put in by Commissioner MacSharry who showed all the talent and skill required to meet the real needs of member states, including Ireland, and to reconcile them with the equally real needs of the Community he serves.  I also salute the efforts and organisational work of Council President Cunha who succeeded in his aim of having the reform adopted during the Portuguese Presidency.  I would like to put it on the record of this House that I received magnificent professional support from the senior staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food.  They are an outstanding team and have built up tremendous contacts over the years which we used to very good effect in finalising this agreement for the benefit of Ireland.</P>
    <P>If Deputies compare the original reform proposal with the final outcome they will see what has been achieved.  The price reduction and the move away from price support have been moderated and made more gradual; adequate compensation for them has been provided, and a counter-cyclical cattle scheme has been adopted.  These are the aims that the Government and I set out to accomplish. We have accomplished them.  In doing so we have set out on the road of lower prices for consumers, without lowering the incomes of farmers, a road which should allow our food processers to advance in the construction here for a food industry to rival the best in the world.  We, in the European Community, have set a headline and laid down a challenge to our competitors on the world market, especially those with high levels of internal support.  We say to them &ldquo;this is what we have done in the Community; can you do the same to stabilise markets internationally?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Many of the implementing details remain to be worked out but we have achieved the concession that the member states can have the flexibility to implement these measures.  That is very <Col N="812" /> important from Ireland's point of view. As a member state, we will be able to implement these measures rather than have the Community work them out for us.  They will be worked out and in ways which I will ensure will provide the maximum achievable benefits to the country.  However, on Common Agricultural Policy reform itself I ask the House, would you have preferred the chaotic alternatives?  Would you like to have closed your eyes and clung blindly to a system that could not and would not last, losing your chance to influence the future shape of the Common Agricultural Policy?  The answer to that question has to be no.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform decisions of last week were more than historic.  They were necessary and good for this country.  I commend them to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Only time will tell whether these negotiations have been to the benefit of the country.  As I said last Thursday evening when the negotiations in Brussels concluded, the Government have adopted a high risk strategy in that we are now expected to do something which we have never done before, that is, sell our own produce.  By the Minister's own admission, in his statement here today, in recent years we have been placing over 50 per cent of our beef into intervention each year.  Indeed we have been placing an even greater amount of milk products into intervention.  If we cannot sell those products on the open market within a short number of years, then they will have to be physically dumped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record, as regards selling within the Community, has been lamentable. Given the elimination of export refunds and the eventual elimination of the intervention system, if we cannot sell products then we will just have to physically dump them.  That is a daunting task.  It is what renders the outcome of the negotiations <Col N="813" /> extremely high risk.  Our track record proves that we are not able to sell into Europe, into the market of 340 million people.  If our record is proved to be correct in the future these negotiations will turn out to have been an unmitigated disaster for agriculture here.  Far from being superb or constituting a national milestone in agriculture here &mdash; as was stated by the Minister &mdash; they could well turn out to be an unmitigated disaster. That should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I have always been one of the proponents of an Irish agricultural sector which could sell on the open market.  I have never been one to say we should be dependent totally on intervention; it has been a very false set-up.  Rather there should have been a phasing-out system under which we would have a percentage reduction on the amount of produce going into intervention each year rather than looking forward to a total phasing-out of intervention within a short number of years.  Our industry is not geared for that; if they cannot sell beef into a market of 340 million people now, how could they be expected to do so next year or by 1997?  Similarly, if they continue to manufacture butter and skimmed milk powder which cannot be sold on the open market, what are they going to do by 1997 and subsequent years?  That is why I sound this note of warning.</P>
    <P>We are in a very precarious position. Our track record has been abysmal.  I would like to see some indication that we will have that marketing ability.  I see no evidence that we can do it.  I hope we can.  As I said on radio and television, it is a challenge and I hope we can rise to it but indications are that we have not done so in the past and will not do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister is sidestepping the most major issue, that involves the GATT negotiations.  In the GATT negotiations we will not be playing a parlour game; we will not have niceties; we will not be dealing with people who will be gentlemanly all the time, if indeed any of the time.  For 30 years the large agricultural-producing countries in the world have <Col N="814" /> wanted to get into the European market. Some of these include the United States, Canada, countries of South America such as Brazil, and Argentina together with Australia and New Zealand.  They perceive this round of GATT negotiations as their chance to penetrate the European market, something they have been unable to do.  I take the Minister's categoric assurance obtained from the Commission in Brussels that there would be no fiddling around with or cessation of subsidies with a grain of salt.  I contend it is not worth the paper on which it is written.</P>
    <P>When one goes into the GATT negotiations, one goes in as an equal partner with all of these people; there are no guarantees, written or unwritten.  It is my very definite opinion that we are going to find it extraordinarily difficult in the Community to withstand the pressure from those countries, together with a host of third countries, who want access to the EC on two fronts.  First, they want to see the abolition of subsidies in any form &mdash; export refunds and intervention would go out the window; they will want the elimination of any other subsidies. Second, they will want free access to the European markets, something they have not had with the exception of the New Zealanders and the Americans; the New Zealanders with a limited amount of butter and and an unlimited amount of lamb and the Americans, apparently with an unlimited amount of cereal substitutes. Everything will be on the table.</P>
    <P>If they get their way to a significant extent that agreement in Brussels last week will sound the death-knell of agriculture here.  I do not want to sound like a person who is scaremongering but the fact is that it is all to play for at this stage. It is the world stage.  We are not talking about a cosy club of Twelve; we are talking about the world stage.  Even in the cosy club of Twelve, I have expressed my doubts about our ability to sell.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues has just expressed our ability to meet the type of payments the Minister has mentioned. The greatest scandal we have seen in agriculture in modern times here was the <Col N="815" /> lack of payment of beef premia and other forms of subsidies.  If farmers are to be dependent on the payment by our Department of Agriculture and Food on these subsidies and premia for a living, then all I can say is: God help them.  We have all met dozens of genuine people in our clinics over the past year who are being blackguarded by officialdom, who have not got what they are entitled to for the most nebulous reasons, perhaps because a form was not properly completed and they are difficult to complete at the best of times.</P>
    <P>We are dependent on a system that has creaked and, in some cases, not worked. How can we expect people to believe the Minister when he says that everything will be done according to the book, that everything will be in order.  Doing things according to the book can be all very fine but, when that does not take into consideration compassion, and people's entitlement to live with a certain amount of dignity then the whole thing collapses. The performance of the Department of Agriculture and Food has been seen to be dreadful in that regard.  The Minister promised action, we have not seen action.  Every member could cite numerous examples of people who have been victimised.  The premia subsidy system may not be at all what it is being built up to be.</P>

      <P>Evidently the media generally seem to think that this package will constitute a bonanza for consumers. Prices of products will actually drop in the shops.  In, fact, over the past two years agricultural prices and farmers' incomes have dropped by 20 per cent.  In the same period the prices of those same commodities they produce have risen by 3 per cent.  That is a very sobering figure. Prices and incomes have dropped by 20 per cent but the consumer has not benefited; consumer prices have gone up by 3 per cent.  I contend that this talk of consumer prices coming down is a lot of hog-wash; it just does not wear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> The biggest benefit we can get from the EC at present would be a major investment in research and development to ensure that the milk and beef we produce can be processed so that our products are saleable, getting away from the butter and skimmed milk powder syndrome. Second, the greatest service they could do us would be to heavily finance a marketing system so that we could sell those products when we produce them.</P>
    <P>We can talk about a new era.  We can talk about a market-oriented system.  I wish we had it but we do not and we never had.  We dumped more than half of what we produced into intervention, into storage, it has been a disgrace.  I would like to see us get away from that disastrous episode in our history.  I would support the Minister if I felt he would do that.  I hope he can but I have grave reservations I have even graver reservations about the outcome of the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, time will tell; the proof of the pudding is in the eating. There are many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; about the outcome of these negotiations.  I am afraid they may blow up in our faces, that in two or three years time our agricultural sector may discover that they are worse off than they were before the MacSharry proposals.  These proposals are inherently contrary to the best interests of agriculture in this country.  I for one will wait and see if at the end of the day they live up to the promises that were made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite understandable that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh appears very elated this afternoon as he outlines the benefits or otherwise of the reforms presented to us.  I am sure the Minister has spent days, weeks and months working on them and he is obviously delighted they have been concluded.  I suggest, <Col N="817" /> however, that it is not entirely justifiable for the Minister to present in what could be described as exaggerated terms what the proposals will and will not mean for Ireland.  It is wrong to significantly downplay some of the very serious repercussions of the Brussels proposals for our agriculture and our economy.</P>
      <P>I suggest, a Cheann Comhairle, that we must examine these measures under the following criteria: their effect on the population and way of life in rural Ireland and their effect on the consumer. Obviously, as Deputy Deasy has just done, we must examine the economic and employment prospects on and off the farm.  We must look at the post reform attractiveness of farming as a way of life for young people, including young farmers and the environmental impact of changes in farm practices.  There are certainly many serious doubts and worries which must be highlighted under these criteria, but we do not have time to do so in detail this afternoon.  I am sure, however, we will have the opportunity to do so in the future.</P>
      <P>I agree with those, including the Minister, who claim there were and are definite problems with the Common Agricultural Policy.  I agree also that European taxpayers do not have bottomless resources to expend on the Common Agricultural Policy.  I fear, however, the Irish Government appear to have caved in and accepted that the problems of agriculture in all parts of the EC are quite similar.  We appear to have officially set aside now Ireland's unique dependency on agriculture.  The Minister and his officials have accepted that the Irish family farm is as great a contributor to the European agricultural problem as is the factory farmer of Europe.  This policy concession is disastrous for Ireland.  All in all I submit that the factory farmers of Europe have won out at the expense of the family farm units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture in Ireland, a Cheann Comhairle, has only one advantage, that is our ability to grow the best grass at the cheapest possible price.  We have lost this advantage as the Irish farmer will continue to compete against the European <Col N="818" /> farmer who has easy and cheap access to imported animal feedstuffs from the United States and the Third World.  The import of non EC substitute feedstuff has been a fundamental problem of European agriculture in recent years and this was not fully dealt with in the Brussels talks and proposals.  This is a matter of serious concern and regret, as it puts another nail in the coffin of the family farmer and benefits the factory farmers of Europe.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the cheque in the post syndrome and certainly as a result of these talks the cheque in the post will now become a norm for Irish farmers.  Of course, I welcome compensatory measures in as far as they go, but they will certainly introduce a totally new dependency in Irish agriculture.  The Irish farmer was renowned throughout Europe and throughout the world for his hard work, often working against the grain.  As a result of this move towards direct payments with the cheque in the post, Brussels will now be seen as similar to the Department of Social Welfare as far as Irish farmers are concerned.  Top class production methods and efficient farming will become secondary to filling out application forms properly for grant and headage payments and other aids. Discouraging efficient production by putting a cheque in the post is surely a very poor way to ensure we have a proper food industry.</P>
    <P>May I refer briefly to what Deputy Deasy said in relation to consumer benefits. I agree there is a great deal of lose talk about the benefits that will accrue to the Irish consumer.  It is wildly false to predict major decreases in food prices. Cattle, lamb and pig prices have all fallen dramatically over the past number of years but there has been no corresponding decrease whatsoever in the cost of these products in the weekly shopping basket.  There is no guarantee that this situation will change.</P>
    <P>In addition let me point out that the gradual phasing in of reforming measures will ensure that there will be no short term bonanza for the Irish consumer.  It is vital the Government monitors this and <Col N="819" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce will need to be extremely vigilant in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the economic costs of reform.  The Government's decision to support these reform proposals officially brings to an end our hopes that the agricultural and food industries would play a significant role in solving our unemployment problem.  We have now agreed to place a limit on the march of Irish agriculture.  This is an extraordinary decision because it means we are fighting the unemployment battle with both hands tied behind our back.  We have tied up our greatest natural resource.  No matter what the Minster says fewer people, not more, will work in agriculture and in agricultural related industries as a result of the Brussels agreement.  There may be some extra jobs generated in the beef industry but the lower quotas and the lower level of production in the dairy sector will certainly cause job losses in the dairy industry.  No measures appear to have been enacted to halt the flight from the land.  Even more significantly there appears to be no measures whatsoever which would encourage young people into farming.</P>
    <P>All in all from the point of view of creating jobs, which is very important when there are almost 300,000 people out of work, there is very little in these proposals to keep people in farming and even less to encourage new entrants into farming.  I regret this very sincerely.  We are gradually moving to the stage where there will be fewer people farming land, perhaps we are even beginning to move towards the factory farms.  This is very disappointing.</P>

      <P>I will conclude by saying a few words on the environmental aspects of the reform.  I would have thought, a Cheann Comhairle, that the reform talks gave Ireland an opportunity to promote <Col N="820" /> family farming, as well as taking full advantage of our natural foodstuff, grass, and other measures to protect our environment and the EC environment, but on all these counts the Government have failed.  Most EC food production will now be concentrated on factory farms where the high rates of fertiliser usage, etc., will continue.  The environment will continue to suffer from these excesses and the consumer will still note with concern the non-green origin of their food.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to begin by saying what I have already said in public &mdash; the fact that agreement has been reached on the Common Agricultural Policy reform at least is to be welcomed.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food says that Irish farmers will benefit to the tune of some £70 million while spokespersons for farming associations say precisely the opposite, and both cannot be right.  Even though few of them agree on this subject, objective commentators and journalists tend to favour the Minister's assertion rather than the assertion of the leaders of the farming organisations.  Nevertheless, the entire set of proposals will need to be carefully studied and objectively appraised by all of us before it is possible to analyse the many risks and challenges which will face Irish agriculture in the years ahead as a result of the changes which will take place in the industry.  It will be several months before it is possible to assess the immediate cash effects of these changes on farmers.  It may even take years for some of these eventual consequences to filter through, for example, the cheque in the post or the promised payment from the Department. In the end factors which have nothing to do with Common Agricultural Policy reform but which affect farmers' incomes will make it difficult to arrive at any true figure of the benefits for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the same token, no one should take it for granted that the benefit for consumers will not be swallowed up.  This, too, will require a detailed response from the Government.  It was stated last week that there would be a £100 million bonanza for Irish consumers from the <Col N="821" /> Common Agricultural Policy reform. Such talk should be treated with a large grain of salt, unless specific action is taken by the Government to make it happen.  A sum of £100 million will mean roughly £25 for every member of the population.  If this bonanza is spread over three years, it will mean £8 per consumer per annum in their food bill.  This will not alleviate the plight of a great many families to any great extent, particularly families on social welfare who need food as a sustenance.</P>
    <P>The real danger I see is that this bonanza will not trickle down to consumers but rather will be a bonanza for processors and middle men.  Deputies on all sides of the House have a responsibility to ensure that this bonanza gets to the people who need it.  If the reduction in product prices is to be passed on to where it will do the most good, it will require specific Government initiatives.  During the seventies the National Prices Commission acted as a watchdog for consumers to ensure that price increases were fully justified.  The time has surely come for the Government to consider the creation of a similar watchdog to ensure that consumers benefit to the maximum possible extent from price reductions and that these are not creamed off in fatter profits for already wealthy individuals.</P>
    <P>I know several Government Ministers have already spoken about taking action to ensure that consumers benefit.  With respect, I would suggest that talk is not enough.  There is a readily available model in the National Prices Commission, which at several junctures in its history was of very considerable benefit to the ecomony and to consumers generally, to ensure that consumers benefit.</P>
    <P>Consumers in this context means families, including farm families and families on social welfare.  Every family in Ireland spends a high proportion of their disposable income on food &mdash; the poorer the family, the higher the proportion required.  It is time farm families were given an assurance that there is now some hope of a reduction in food prices.  The Government should act to ensure that that reduction is as large as possible and <Col N="822" /> act immediately to put the structures to control this in place in time.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that there is a fundamental moral issue that has yet to be addressed by the European Community. For years, we have been paying people to produce food for deep freezing, including storage compartments on ships.  Now we are going to pay people to produce a lot less food.  This agreement has been reached during a month when hundreds of thousands of people may die from hunger in the Third World.  Surely it is time for a Community that wants to plan for the future to begin to take hunger into account?  I fully recognise that there is a danger of simplistic approaches or solutions to this issue.  I do not have all the answers by any means, but I am convinced that not enough thought has been given to this issue either at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Ireland has probably the worst record of any of the member states in the area of Third World aid.  We will undoubtedly slip further down that league when the Scandinavian countries, with their outstanding record in this area, become full members of the Community.  The point must be made that this scandalous and shameful record is not the record of the Irish people.  No people in the world have a prouder tradition of being willing to help and support the Third World than we have.  However that record has been besmirched by the attitude of this Government and their predecessors: they have made the most savage and heartless cuts in a vulnerable budgetary subhead. This has happened in a country which produces surplus food while much of the world is starving.  Clearly, if reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is to mean anything in the long run it must begin to be seen as a mechanism, among other things, for addressing the issue of world hunger.</P>
    <P>To return to the central point of this debate, it is already clear that a great deal of the future of Irish agriculture lies in our hands and in the heads of the industry. Planning for the future, to take full and proper account of the changes now underway, must start now.  For example, <Col N="823" /> the Culliton report has already called for the publication of a national food plan. This must be seen as the first priority of the Government who have accepted the recommendations of the Culliton report in principle.</P>
    <P>For years, we have been calling for a proper plan, to include all the relevant interests, for the development of the food industry.  Processing, efficiency of production, pricing of the product, quality, diversification, &ldquo;green&rdquo; agriculture, down stream industry and rural development are the essential ingredients of any plan for the future.  We will continue to get help from the European Community in developing a more rounded approach to our main industry if we are serious ourselves.  In other words, there is never the time when we should be congratulating one another, slapping each other on the back, or wasting time in abusing each other over the outcome of any negotiations.  The future for Irish agriculture starts now.  If all the essential interests are prepared to work together, there is no reason the future should be bleak.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that the Common Agricultural Policy, which is almost as old as the Community itself and the only policy of any signifance in the Community, is underpinned by a number of basic principles which were enshrined in the Treaty of Rome.  These include such aims as sustaining family farms; ensuring a reasonable income for family farms through a guaranteed minimum price structure for produce; and ensuring an adequate supply of food for consumers at a reasonable cost.  Many of these aims are incompatible but they are all aspirations of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>In reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, what has been reformed essentially is the mechanisms through which these aims are intended to be realised.  In examining this reform we ought not to lose sight of what happened to some of these aspirations under the old mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy, mechanisms which some people <Col N="824" /> wanted to remain in place but which all of us realised could not remain in place. For example, over the past 20 years we have lost thousands of people who were previously engaged in agriculture in rural Ireland.  The Common Agricultural Policy in its previous form made millionaires out of intervention companies, freezer suppliers and storage and shipping operators, but it made very few millionaires out of people engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Irish food industry became almost totally dependent on intervention for beef and milk products.  Not only did those cost the European taxpayer billions, but the higher prices thus secured were borne by Irish consumers among others. Finally, under the existing Common Agricultural Policy the incentive to diversify, or to upgrade quality and marketing, was never as great as the incentive to concentrate more and more product in ways that would attract intervention support.</P>
    <P>The new mechanisms will aim to support the producer and not the product. In itself, it is a flawed system, just as the old one was.  Under the old system, farmers were paid to produce goods which had to be kept in deep freezes for years because there was no market for them.  Under the new system, farmers will be paid not to proudce at all or, in the event, to produce a lot less.  We are telling 300,000 unemployed people we will pay them because they have no work, while we are telling farmers we will pay them because we do not want them to work.  What economic system could tolerate a continuation of that philosophy?</P>
    <P>Many questions remain.  Supporting the producer rather than the product could lead to 100 per cent of the cost of subsidisation.  Is this realistic, or is it a false promise?  Who will bear the cost?  Is the European Commission prepared to guarantee compensation to farmers on a permanent basis for producing less and less, and will that compensation be geared to keep pace with the cost of living; will it be index-linked, so that <Col N="825" /> incomes on land stay abreast of incomes generally?</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if the answer to all of these questions is an unequivocal yes. In reality, I believe that this Common Agricultural Policy reform package must be seen as a way of buying time for Irish agriculture.  Everyone involved in the industry has known for years &mdash; even if they were not prepared to say it publicly &mdash; that the intervention system was insupportable in the long term.  By the same token, everyone in the industry has known that abuses of the system were widespread and that sooner or later someone would have to cry halt.</P>
    <P>In a sense, therefore, these reform proposals, whether we like them or not, are an opportunity to look afresh at Irish agriculture; to look at its methods of production; to look at its efficiency; to look at the range and the quality of products and to look at the marketing and selling and true export potential of the industry.</P>
    <P>Anyone following the reports of the Beef Tribunal over the last month or so will have noticed innumerable references to the national interest as the basis for all decision-making in relation to Irish agriculture.  The bottom line is this.  An agricultural industry that produces no added value would be contributing very little to the national interest over the long term, because it simply could not survive as an industry.</P>
    <P>Our job now is to stop talking about Common Agricultural Policy and Common Agricultural Policy reform as if they were the only buzzwords and start turning added value into the buzzwords of the nineties for our biggest industry. One of the other things that is clear from the Beef Tribunal is the enormous sums of money we have spent over the years &mdash; both at the level of the State and the level of the private entrepreneur &mdash; in finding markets for raw meat all around the world.  That was based on a policy of developing value added.  If we are serious about value added, is it not time we stopped spending so much money on freezing and shipping great lumps of raw meat to Africa and the Middle East where at times they will not pay for it, unless we <Col N="826" /> want to divert it to the Third World where need for it has already been identified. It is time we started figuring out how to get what is virtually an organically-grown product into the environmentally conscious markets of Germany and the United Kingdom.  It is not time we began to develop away from a beef industry and towards a proper food industry?  Value added means planning.  There are many other things we need to do in the time available to us, such as the introduction of new products, market research and development, the development of agri-tourism and a total concentration on ways of import substitution.</P>
    <P>In short, I firmly believe that instead of recriminating about Common Agricultural Policy reform, or blandly assuming that our worries are over, we should see this development as a window of opportunity which will remain open for a very short time.  We should be prepared to grasp that opportunity with both hands.  It is, as I have said, an opportunity to examine our major industry in a whole new light and to bring together all of the interests which are important to the industry.  We should begin to plan a new future because the national interest is at stake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford):</i> I compliment Deputy Ferris on a very positive contribution and on facing up to reality within the EC at present.  I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, and his negotiating team for the enormous work they put into achieving this agreement on Common Agricultural Policy reform. There has been much hysteria over the last year to 18 months that farmers would be sold down the river and that there would be no opportunities for farmers in the future.  I am glad to say that the Minister and his team have secured a very good deal for the farmers and for the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement ends the uncertainty which had clouded the attempts of farmers and the food industry to plan effectively <Col N="827" /> for the new arrangements which will exist with the advent of the Single Market.  While we all expect that the international food industry will become a more competitive arena in the short to medium term, it helps enormously to have this agreement on future support arrangements in place for the agricultural sector.  It means, in short, that we know where we are going and can plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>Our long term objective has always been to develop a strong indigenous food industry which can compete internationally. For this we need to maintain a vibrant domestic agricultural output and this in turn must be underpinned by a realistic, though not excessive, support system.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement offers such a system.  It is different from that which operated in the past in that it is based on a partial redirection of support from market support towards direct payments to farmers.  The compensation, which includes some really dramatic increases in cattle premiums, is aimed at offsetting any income losses arising from reduced market support.</P>
    <P>The agreement presents both opportunities and challenges to the Irish food industry.  It will prompt a trend to lower prices for inputs to the processing sector which will allow it to become more competitive. I welcome, as I am sure industry also welcomes, any cost reducing measures which allow industry to increase its competitiveness.  This is the only sustainable route forward.  Indeed, it is the only way forward if we are to develop our food industry in the way it should be developed in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Our high degree of seasonality has always been one of the key problems for our food industry.  Our highly seasonal production of beef in particular has funnelled producer thinking excessively towards a commodity product range which invariably has been support led.  In this, producers and processors behaved with short term rationality but with no long term focus on product or market <Col N="828" /> development.  Obviously, this could not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the single most important aspect of the agreement from the point of view of the food industry is the matter of the arrangements for the beef sector. This is the first time ever that the Community has actually funded a member state to overcome a seasonality problem. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, deserves great credit for his perseverance for his ability to persuade his EC counterparts to agree to this new arrangement to offset the seasonality problem that exists here. The need for such arrangements was patently obvious.  With the proposed gradual reduction in intervention, Irish producers will, of nesessity have to sell product on the commercial markets.  To do this, will require not only improved quality and product innovation but also a much more even supply pattern.  The counter cyclical arrangements which were agreed for the beef sector will encourage a more even supply to factories throughout the year. In turn, retail outlets and consumers can be provided with a steady flow of Irish products.  The opportunities are, therefore, being created to build up retailer and, equally important, consumer loyalty. Markets can now be developed and kept much more steadily than in the past. A consistent and reliable supply of quality products is a prerequisite for processors aiming to do this.</P>
    <P>While I have singled out the beef sector for particular mention, the other elements of the agreement will also serve to make market-led processors somewhat more competitive through reduced input prices.</P>
    <P>In recent days there has been much debate about the impact the agreement will have on the price of food to consumers. It seems that the extent of the price fall varies depending on which and how many assumptions are made on how these measures will be translated into consumer markets.  In the medium and long term perspective in which Common Agricultural Policy reform is framed, it is not only pro farmer but also pro consumer. Its intention is to shift the weight of supporting farmers away from market <Col N="829" /> supports and the eventual result should be lower consumer prices.</P>
    <P>I hope and expect that this move to lower consumer prices will be a powerful help in restoring and increasing consumption of our main consumer products, especially beef and butter.  We all know of the major decline in the butter area over the past number of years, which in turn has severe consequences for farming generally and for the return to farmers. Increased domestic demand should be a valuable and welcome outcome of this price movement.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ferris said, it is very important that these lower prices are passed on to the consumers.  Independent economists suggest that the benefits to the consumer should amount to £100,000 million.  We in the House have a duty to ensure that these benefits will arise.  I must admit that they have not happened too often in the past.  For example, at present, lamb prices to the farmers are reasonably low but it is certainly not reflected in the price of lamb to our housewives who are very angry and who feel ripped off, because reduction in lamb prices to farmers has not been passed on to them.  This is an area that we must monitor.  We must ensure that consumers will benefit as is their entitlement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Trade and Marketing are to tackle this problem together.  I understand that they are meeting on Friday to have discussions and to put in place a proper system of monitoring to ensure that the benefits to which the consumers are entitled will be passed on, and that there will be no sidetracking or no major profits accruing to processors or to other individuals.  It is essential that a monitoring committee or a monitoring board will be set up to ensure that this happens.</P>
    <P>For our part, we are now looking to the future of the food industry.  In this regard, the Minister, as recommended in the Culliton report, has set up a group of experts headed by the Secretary of his Department.  The group will be drawing up a plan of action which will take all <Col N="830" /> the new features into consideration.  The group which is widely based has been asked to draw up such a plan within six months.  In the past, we had too many plans and too many analyses of the food industry, but nothing happened.  The Minister and the Department are now putting a time limit on it, and saying that within six months we want a proper national food plan, and that many of the suggestions that have been made for the development of the food industry will be taken into account and action taken immediately.  To the forefront will be the opportunities offered by the Common Agricultural Policy agreement.  We will need to develop new markets.  We have top quality raw materials produced by the farmers in a clean environment. Obviously, it is an opportunity for our processors within the food industry to develop further, to expand, and for new processors to come on to the market and to develop our top-class raw material into value-added products and make them available to the 350 million people in the EC.</P>
    <P>I welcome this agreement as a means for the Irish food industry to develop further so that it can continue to contribute in the future even more substantially than in recent years, to the economic wellbeing of the country.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has got a good deal for this country.  It is up to all of us to ensure that this deal is reflected over the next number of years in the betterment of this country and particularly in the creation of jobs for our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the sense of realism that has been pervading this House with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy in recent weeks.  The decision by EC Farm Ministers last week on a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy represents the most fundamental change in the 30 year history of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The changes introduced were long overdue and have been advocated by myself in the Dáil and in public statements for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> The Common Agricultural Policy had deviated a long way from its initial objectives. The consequences of guaranteed high prices had become a chronic tendency to over-production at a very high cost to the taxpayer.  Butter prices, for instance, had reached over four times world market prices, beef prices almost five times greater than on the world market.  This was a particularly heavy burden for families on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The agreement falls far short of the radical surgery proposed by Commissioner MacSharry in his first set of proposals made last year; but it represents a significant advance.  Given the statistics I just quoted about butter being four times the world price and beef five times the world price, it is not surprising that there would be no market for the quantities produced.  A policy which added up to £15 per week to consumer food bills, which soaked up 60 per cent of the total EC budget and which channelled 80 per cent of all price supports to the 20 per cent richest farmers was always a liability that the Community would have to face up to and deal with.  This agreement opens up new possibilities for the future.</P>
    <P>I note that while the Irish Farmers Association initially lodged the strongest of objections to any substantial reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, they have more recently accepted the necessity for tackling the inequities and inadequacies of that policy.  The agreement reached allows for reductions in cereal, milk and sheep quotas, and a substantial lowering of intervention levels for Irish farmers.  It has been predicted that Irish consumers stand to gain £100 million annually from the reforms.  However, how these changes will work out in practice remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>I note for instance that up to 72 per cent of Irish land is being classified as disadvantaged.  I hope that this may not become a new mechanism by which some farmers who manipulated the Common Agricultural Policy scheme will now be able to exploit the disadvantaged areas payments, to the detriment of truly needy <Col N="832" /> farmers.  This issue will need to be monitored closely as I have no doubt that those who made easy profits under the old Common Agricultural Policy will seek to find new ways to earn easy subsidies.</P>
    <P>I have many doubts over the impact of Common Agricultural Policy effort on food prices.  Commissioner MacSharry has said he hopes it will lead to food prices cuts.  There is no clearcut mechanism for ensuring that reductions at farm gate level are passed on to the consumer. The Minister responsible for trade and marketing, Deputy O'Rourke, expressed considerable optimism that food prices will fall if the decreases are to occur; more than optimism will be required; the Minister should establish a formal mechanism for monitoring and controlling food price changes arising from Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
    <P>The reductions will not come into effect immediately, but will be phased in over a number of years.  In addition the first reductions, according to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will not be coming on stream for at least nine months.  When the effect of inflation is taken into account, then it may be impossible to determine or challenge just where, how and if prices are being reduced.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of reform of Common Agricultural Policy, of course, is the effect it will have on the overall farming sector, on the related food processing industry and on the general economy.  I note that the Minister intends to establish a review body to include several groups involved in the Irish food sector to assess and plan marketing and expansion of the Irish food industry.  This is a welcome concession to the fact that the Irish food sector has failed abysmally to establish a worth-while niche in the European market, despite two decades of EC membership.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will refuse to listen to those who attempt to explain away the failure of the Irish food sector to market and sell successfully on the international market. <Col N="833" /> The cold facts are that year after year the Irish food sector not just relied but actively geared itself to the intervention market only to the extent that many shoppers in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other EC cities, were more accustomed to New Zealand lamb than to Irish lamb. The television advertisement of the French tourist who has actually heard of Kerrygold butter is more a parody of the inadequacy of our marketing strategy than a mark of its success.</P>
    <P>This failure was pointed out recently in the Culliton report where it highlighted that the continued dependence on intervention was entirely unrealistic.  I would therefore urge the Minister to do more than set up a review group.  Such reviews have a habit of gathering dust.  What is required is an agricultural and food authority, which would bring together State agencies and interest groups involved in the sector to compile and implement a long term development plan for Irish agriculture and rural development.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seek a substantial proportion of the savings at EC level from the reform of Common Agricultural Policy to fund such an authority. Adequately funded, it should ensure creation of a vibrant and self-sufficient farm sector requiring less long term funding from EC sources, whether from the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, disadvantaged areas scheme or wherever.</P>
    <P>Such an authority would also seek to expand the range of agricultural foods available such as fresh dairy produce, specialised cheeses and boneless meat, cooked and convenience meat products, all of which are taking an increasing share of the consumer market.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the latter approach alone would add £200 million to the value of our meat and dairy exports.  The Common Agricultural Policy reform package is in fact an added incentive for the Irish food industry to move along the added value path.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals also identified a considerable trade deficit in wood and wood products.  The EC Commission has <Col N="834" /> already committed itself to higher grants for both public and private sector expansion in this area.  Greater efforts should be made by the Government to develop the economy in this area.  The aim should be to win more than piecemeal improvements in funding, but to press for realistic assistance, both financial and industrial policy related, for Ireland as a peripheral region of the Community.  Greater emphasis than heretofore should also be placed on use of low interest loans from the European Investment Bank for development of our agricultural, food and forestry sectors.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a need for the implementation of a comprehensive rural development policy by the Government. Recent years have seen the departure of thousands of people from Irish farming. This process will continue following the reform of Common Agricultural Policy. Indeed throughout the developed world the tendency has been towards greater economies of scale.  However, I do not accept that small farmers, no more than workers in any industry, should be simply left to the mercy of the marketplace in recession.  Farmers in difficulty should be either assisted to become commercial, through diversification to new crops and agri-tourism, or they should be assisted to leave farming in an orderly way, rather than hanging on in poverty indefinitely.</P>
    <P>If these developments follow on from the Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement, then there will be real hope for a vibrant Irish agricultural and food processing sector before the end of this century.  In that event the Minister for Agriculture and Food will deserve all the praise he gets.</P>

      <P>The farmers in Ireland and indeed throughout Europe heaved a great sigh of relief at the successful conclusion to the negotiations on Common Agricultural Policy reform.  When the <Col N="835" /> Agriculture Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, made his proposals there was widespread hysteria.  This was not helped by very misleading statements by people who should have known better.  The major fear was that Common Agricultural Policy reform would result in Common Agricultural Policy destruction. Farmers felt that no matter what the outcome, it could not be good for Ireland.  The Minister has not only managed to execute a major limitation exercise but has brought home a package which will be of great benefit to farmers and consumers.  As the President of the ICOS, Billy Nagle, aptly put it, the Minister was handed a poisoned chalice and has succeeded admirably in minimising the damage.</P>
      <P>The package agreed is a major improvement on what had originally been proposed.  Now that it has been agreed, it removes all the uncertainty that had been hanging over farmers for the past two yars.  Everyone knows where they are going for the next three to four years, which is probably the longest level of certainty farmers ever had.  It is important that the Minister succeeds in persuading the Commission to make sure that the £620 million in direct payments and premia which are now available to Irish farmers should be exempted from erosion under any GATT agreement. Given the circumstances under which the Minister successfully negotiated this package, I am confident that our vital national interests will be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any standards this package was a major achievement in a very difficult situation. Nowhere more so than in the beef sector where for the first time in 20 years there has been an acknowledgment by the EC of the fact that the beef industry was vital to Ireland's national economy. It must be noted that the contribution of beef production is nine times more important in Ireland's economy than in the overall EC.  Milk production in Ireland is seven times more important. The special spring slaughter premium secured by the Minister will be a major <Col N="836" /> incentive for the beef sector to become more market oriented.  It will lead to a more even distribution of beef production. It will create more permanent jobs in meat factories and will focus the minds of beef exporters on the vital necessity to become widely established by lucrative Community markets of over 340 million consumers.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the dairy sector the Minister is to be congratulated on the fact that there will not be any reduction in quota or prices this year.  Milk prices have already increased by 8.4 pence per gallon over this time last year.  Butter will be more competitive because of the price cuts which take effect next year and the year after.  It is significant that any quota reduction in milk proposed for the next year and year after will only be made after the council assesses the market situation before the beginning of these years.  It is not a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>The outcome in the cereal sector is also far better than what the Commissioner had originally proposed.  The price cuts are less severe and the compensation measures had been significantly improved for both price cuts and set aside.  I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has also protected the position of established grain producers by negotiating an option to have arrangements implemented at an individual farm level as well as at regional level.  The scrapping of the co-responsibility levy is also to be welcomed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, I am sharing my time with Deputy Leonard. On behalf of the sheep farmers in Leinster, who are under strong pressure at the moment because of falling lamb prices, I particularly want to congratulate the Minister for achieving an increase of 150 &mdash; making a total of 500 &mdash; in the number of ewes in respect of which premium can be paid outside the disadvantaged areas. Also, the concession that bigger farmers with more than 500 ewes will be able to get 50 per cent of the premium is a major concession and the Minister is to be congratulated on this.</P>
      <P>The performance of the Minister in last week's negotiations has been intelligent, effective and forceful.  Most thinking people, including many of his critics, have been forced to acknowledge that progress has been achieved and a good deal secured.  The Minister has had a most enterprising and productive first 100 days and if as John Gummer says, Commissioner Ray MacSharry gets a full chapter in history when the history of the Common Agricultural Policy is written, I have no doubt that Minister Joe Walsh will figure prominently in that book, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, their officials and all those involved in the very successful negotiations.  I would also like to congratulate Commissioner MacSharry.  About nine months ago a number of us, members of a British-Irish parliamentary body, met the Commissioner in Brussels and had a lengthy discussion on Common Agricultural Policy, GATT, etc.  He gave us an assurance that the family type farm would be safe as far as he was concerned. We took him at his word.  We had confidence in him and in our negotiating team and we thank them sincerely for their work.</P>
      <P>We must realise that never before was there as much criticism in advance of proposals from every area, from foreign bodies, from Teagasc, from agri-economists right across the board, crying for the last nine to 12 months.  They got their answer in the most effective way in Brussels during the past week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points I would like to comment on which were made here earlier in the debate, one, by Deputy Deasy, about our ability to sell our products.  I could not agree with him on that issue. It is generally accepted that we have the best agricultural products of any country in Europe.  The area I come from produces two products, namely, poultry and mushrooms which are not within the terms of the Common Agricultural Policy but these producers have given their answer in the form of having increased their market share on an on-going basis over the past couple of years and by breaking into the export market for poultry, something that was unheard of up to four or five years ago.  The poultry <Col N="841" /> producers are yielding £41 million this year from that one product alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned milk and beef specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points related to our ability to sell while another related to the flight from the land.  I believe in this case that there will be ample opportunities to provide extra jobs on the land and in processing plants.  In relation to the beef sector, since we joined the EC we have failed to penetrate the Community market.  However we will now have an opportunity to do so.  In addition we have been faced with the problem of seasonality, particularly at our processing and slaughter plants, of which there is a number in my own constituency.  Year after year men have worked for three or four months of the year, for anything up to 18 or 19 hours a day.  They are then let go for the remainder of the year. While the system is unbalanced so far as the workers are concerned, it is balanced in the eyes of the State in that they are making contributions to the State and are in receipt of a substantial sum in overtime.  We are confronted with the same problem in the dairy industry which I hope will be resolved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the milk sector, initially the Commission proposed a 10 per cent reduction in the quota but following negotiations it has been agreed that there should be a reduction of 2.5 per cent over a two-year period.  We will not be affected in 1992.  In addition before any reduction may be imposed in 1993 and 1994 market conditions will have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important point should be made that the subsidy will be paid to the primary producer.  We have claimed down the years rightly so, that about 80 per cent of EC funding goes to only 20 per cent of producers and that small producers are denied funding.  However, primary producers will now be in a position to avail of funding while processors and traders can work in the knowledge that they will receive the product between January and April and that there will not <Col N="842" /> be a glut in the autumn as was the case in other years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the team who negotiated this package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to comment on the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  I cannot share the laudatory comments made by Deputy Leonard and his colleague about Commissioner MacSharry because when the Commissioner was a Deputy in this House he said that if the Common Agricultural Policy was interfered with we should leave the Community. That is what he said in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that Commissioner MacSharry has interfered with the Common Agricultural Policy.  That is ironic given his advice to us to leave the Community if such interference occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that all the fear about this package was generated by Commissioner MacSharry although it was he who put forward the proposals.  I am afraid therefore that I cannot agree with the self-congratulatory comments made by the Minister that he used his influence to have the proposals modified because if one reads any journal published outside this country or indeed many of those published here in relation to the progress made during the negotiations, one will find that it was the French, the Spanish, the Germans and others who exerted most influence on Commissioner MacSharry to modify his extreme proposals which would have led to the agriculture industry being almost dismantled as a major component of our economy.  I am sorry that the Minister is not in the House to hear me say this but he should not make self-congratulatory <Col N="843" /> comments or accept all these congratulations for the changes which were by no means all his own doing.  While I agree that he exerted some influence, I submit that this led to some very minor changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that there will be a cut of 15 per cent in the intervention price for beef over the next number of years but he failed to tell us that there will also be a significant reduction in the volume of beef allowed into intervention.  It will be halved in the four year period 1993 to 1997 &mdash; from a figure of 750,000 tonnes in 1993 to 350,000 tonnes in 1997.  I submit that this will depress the price of beef but this has not been acknowledged.  All the experts agree that when the increased subsidies, the price reduction and market conditions &mdash; and one can accurately predict what these will be over the next three or four years &mdash; are taken into account beef farmers will only be compensated for 75 per cent of their losses.  That will put an additional strain on that sector of agriculture.</P>
    <P>According to a recent NESC report, 36 per cent of farmers are at risk of poverty. This was confirmed by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in their pre-budget submissions over the last three years.  The farmers most affected are dry stock farmers and farmers in the west. These farmers find that their economic status and wellbeing are under attack.  A small farmer in the west is twice as likely to be poor as any self-employed person and six times more likely to be poor than any employed person.  We have heard laudatory and glowing comments about what the new reformed Common Agricultural Policy will do for this country, but these are the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also conveniently forgot to mention that heifers make up 20 per cent of the beef produced in Ireland and that all these subsidies will be payable in respect of male animals.  Indeed the figure is higher than 20 per cent in certain parts of the area I come from.  Does this not amount to a betrayal?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, again in a <Col N="844" /> self-congratulatory way, that there will be no quotas this year.  However, next year the market balance will be looked at strictly and if it is out of joint by even the smallest amount, quotas will be the answer according to Commissioner MacSharry.  Therefore we need not congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is also a great pity that Ireland will receive only a small portion of the total budget devoted to the Common Agricultural Policy, about 27 billion ECUs in the current year; this figure will rise in the coming years, probably as high as 34 billion ECUs by about 1995 and then start to dip fairly sharply.</P>
    <P>In relation to reorientation &mdash; the buzz word used by the Minister tonight &mdash; this means that funding will be reoriented from the major producers, who were able to avail of guaranteed prices, towards small producers but the amount of money that will be available under this heading is absolutely ridiculous.  At present grants are available for alternative farming, deer farming, agri-tourism etc.  However a circular, No. 26 of 1992, on the grant aid available for alternative enterprises was issued by the Minister's Department on 16 May, which said to all the staff operating it that &ldquo;due to the budgetary position, it is now decided to suspend all these schemes.&rdquo;  Is not that a scandal, that this range of schemes which were meant to last from 1989 to 1993 are the subject of cancellation in the first half of 1992 on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Food because he simply failed to negotiate enough money to fund them to the end of their term?  I submit that that is a disgrace and a scandal.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Light Rail Transit System for Dublin: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on 26 May 1992:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and <Col N="845" /> Communications to commission a light rail transit system for the greater Dublin area on a phased basis in order to resolve the current congestion problems, particularly in the inner cordon area of the city; further calls on the Government to seek EC funding for such a project so that it is constructed within a seven year period on an established timetable for implementation; and further calls on the Government to re-establish the Dublin Transport Authority to oversee these improvements in public passenger services in the capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the commitment of the Government in its programme to addressing the traffic congestion and public transport problems of the Dublin area through the establishment of the Dublin Transportation Initiative; commends the comprehensive approach which has been adopted in the context of that initiative; and supports the declared intention of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to seek, from the next tranche of EC Structural Funds, significant EC financial support for the development of all the options for public transport, including light rail in the Dublin area.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan was in possession.  I gather he wishes to share his time with Deputy Taylor. Between them the Deputies have 11 minutes remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining to me, I should like to place on record once again the Labour Party commitment to a light rail transit system for the greater Dublin area.  The Labour Party made a <Col N="846" /> submission to Brussels on this proposal in which we suggested we would look after major growth areas around Dublin, stretching from the city centre through Phibsboro', to the centre of Blanchardstown, also from the city centre to Ronanstown, to Tallaght and to utilise the old Harcourt Street line to Dundrum.</P>
      <P>I might refer also to the necessity &mdash; this was incorporated in our proposal also &mdash; to provide a connection to Dublin Airport.  Indeed, it would be remiss of me as a public representative for that area not to place on record the advantages of such a proposal.  I think CIE and Iarnród Éireann have certain proposals in that regard also and will be favourably disposed to funding them.  If we could achieve that goal or overall package hopefully it would not cost that much extra to connect the system to Swords, providing a link to that area.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister's commitment to this project can be realised, that she will be able to convince her Government colleagues of the necessity for the people of Dublin of this proposal.  I assure her that she and the Government will have the full support of the Labour Party in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Ryan for agreeing to share his time with me.  I want to deal particularly with the transport needs of the people of the western suburbs.  The new town of Tallaght, consisting of some 100,000 people, is at present served by a totally inadequate, unacceptable level of public transport for such a large town, built, provided and planned in the western suburbs of Dublin.  When the plans for the town of Tallaght were being drawn up Dublin County Council were particularly careful to preserve a route from the centre of Tallaght, at The Square, into the centre of Dublin for the provision of a public transport system, preferably like the DART.  That land reservation was very thoughfully and with great foresight preserved and stands ready and available for an extension of the DART system or, alternatively, a light rail system of some description to serve the people of <Col N="847" /> Tallaght into the centre of Dublin.  I wish the Government, and their predecessors, had the same foresight as the planners of Dublin County Council in advancing this project.  I hope it will be advanced now before its costing gets totally out of hand. The longer such a project is left, the more the costs escalate and the more impossible it becomes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Fine Gael Party's motion to highlight this issue, but in all fairness, they have exhibited somewhat of a conversion in this regard.  When Deputy Jim Mitchell was Minister in the relevant Department I was a member of a deputation to him from people in Tallaght to discuss this issue.  I am sorry to have to say that, as a matter of principle, he turned it down flat, saying it was entirely inappropriate to have a public transport system of this nature to Tallaght. This is to be deeply regretted; I have to say that although the Labour Party formed part of that Coalition Government.  Deputy Jim Mitchell was not sympathetic to that deputation.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party support this project and advocate it in the strongest possible terms.  The land for the central railway station in Tallaght Square has been reserved.  Such a facility is essential.  The people of Tallaght require and demand the provision of that public transport.  If I may say so, they need it more than the periphery on the north/south access served by DART.  Those people for the most part are well served with motorcars and vehicles of all kinds while most people in Tallaght do not have private motorised transport.  The provision of an extension of DART or a light rail system to serve them would transform their lives and it is no exaggeration to say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How foolish can we be when we have at our disposal the expertise, the engineers and the builders who have the ability to construct a railway line and did such a magnificent job on the construction of the DART line along the north/south access?  Those experts &mdash; builders, engineers, electrical and metal workers and so on &mdash; are still available.  Their task was finished when the DART line construction <Col N="848" /> was completed.  Would it not make a great deal of economic sense to re-employ those people, and set them the task of extending the DART line or constructing a light rail system to serve the 100,000 people of Tallaght?  What do we do instead?  We leave the skills of those constructors unused; we leave the reserved land idle and we run motorised vehicles, using petrol and causing fumes along our roads wrecking havoc on our environment.  Where is the sense of it? Why do we put this off year after year, thereby escalating its cost with every year that passes?</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Ryan, said, the Labour Party have prepared a detailed submission on this issue.  They travelled to Brussels and presented it to the Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Millan. We are asking the Minister and the Government to give this project top priority so far as Structural Funds are concerned.  If the Minister and Government do that the project will succeed.  I hope that they will not bend to the roads lobby, which is as powerful here as in other countries.  There seems to be an endless supply of money available from one source or another to build motorways and roads, thereby contributing even more to road traffic conjestion, to the destruction of our environment and so on.  We have the opportunity to serve 100,000 people and their families at Tallaght by providing them with this rail link.</P>
    <P>Every major city of Europe has rail connections into and out of the city centre except Dublin.  Why are we to be denied that facility when the plans for it exists, when the land has been reserved, and when major centres of population namely Tallaght and the Clondalkin complex are ready and anxious to use it?  Would people not be delighted to use a public transport system if it was reliable, fast and cheap?  What a contribution we could make to the economy of this city and country if we sat up now and recognised where our priorities should be.  We could serve the interests of job creation, do wonders for the entire city of Dublin which would be reflected to the advantage <Col N="849" /> of the economy of the country at large.  It is a Government decision, and they can do it if they make up their minds to give it the priority that we in Dublin know it needs.  It will create jobs, encourage investment, purify the atmosphere, stimulate interest and will be warmly welcomed by the people of Dublin.  I trust, a Cheann Comhairle, that what I have said and what has been said in the House in the course of this debate will be heeded and that we will achieve the result which is so strongly needed on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted there is a consensus now among all political parties in support of the development of a light rail system for Dublin as part of an overall programme for tackling the very serious and growing congestion problems in the city.  Dublin is suffering from a very acute traffic problem.  There are parking problems and a huge volume of traffic in streets that are too narrow to carry this volume of traffic.  The street network in the city is definitely inadequate; there are problems for people travelling across the city and for people travelling from one suburb to another; there are problems for people commuting from the northside to the southside and there are also problems for people travelling from rural areas into various parts of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Perry conducted one study into this problem entitled &ldquo;Mass Transit as a Policy Instrument&rdquo;, and which was referred to repeatedly last night.  Professor Perry points out that the average speed of vehicular traffic in the centre of Dublin is now significantly less than ten miles per hour during peak traffic times and that the situation is getting increasingly worse.  He has posed a number of serious fundamental questions as to how this problem should be addressed.  Quite <Col N="850" /> a significant proportion of the flow of traffic, both private and commercial, through the city centre has nothing to do with the city centre whatsoever and we need to address this.  We have to decide what should be done to alleviate the serious problems that are concentrated in the city centre itself.</P>
    <P>A survey was conducted by Dublin Corporation as far back as 1989 &mdash; the situation has worsened since &mdash; which showed that approximately 145,000 persons crossed the canal ring in the period between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. each day. When vehicular passenger ratios were analysed it highlighted another problem as it showed the average occupancy ratio for cars over that period was 1.4 persons per vehicle whereas it was 37.6 persons per bus.  Buses are 14 times more efficient than private vehicles on the basis of that study.</P>
    <P>While I differ from Deputy Yates in a number of respects on this motion I strongly concur with his view on the absence of an overall authority in the greater Dublin area for the planning, management, implementation and enforcement of traffic and transport policy.  That is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Last night the problem of Dublin port and how it suffers because of the serious and increasing congestion throughout the city, particularly in the inner city area, was referred to.  Detailed analyses was given by a number of Deputies in relation to this problem but nobody came up with solutions.  I am happy that we have a consensus on the need for a light rail transit system.  We are faced with very fundamental questions at this time because of the damage being done to the environment, the deterioration of the quality of life in the city and the very serious negative effects of traffic congestion on Dublin port.  We have to ask ourselves how far we are prepared to go in challenging the perceived rights of the private motorist and in adopting a programme to wean the commuter off using the private car in favour of public transport. I am against coercion but nevertheless I believe we are faced with a very serious challenge and we have to take <Col N="851" /> definite comprehensive action to deal with it.</P>
    <P>We are told by all those who have researched light rail transit and its development over the past decade that it is increasingly seen throughout the world as the white knight in the battle against traffic congestion and its associated evils. It is certainly much more flexible and we are told it can operate at half the cost.  It travels fast and easily on its own line and on city streets.  I understand the trains are ultra-modern, quiet and comfortable to travel in; as they use electricity they are environmentally friendly.  Among its other advantages, we are told the light rail system guarantees punctuality with guaranteed journey times, has visible presence of the traffic which inspires confidence and gives a degree of security to the pedestrians in its vicinity and moves smoothly.  Certainly those characteristics are highly recommended.</P>
    <P>Various route networks were suggested last night.  The satellite towns, the railway stations and Dublin Airport would have to be linked into the light rail transit system in the city.  Dublin Airport is central to this as it would be a fundamental mistake to leave it out of the development as it is an integral part of the programme for tourism, economic development and employment creation in the city.  It is an integral part of any network that is to be developed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Dublin port and I am standing beside Deputy Stafford, the former chairman of Dublin port.  Dublin port has suffered greatly because of this terrible congestion.  The heavy commercial industrial traffic going through narrow streets around the city centre servicing Dublin port is causing noise pollution and other problems.  We have to address this.  I have to say that of all the proposals put forward last night by the Opposition, not one of them &mdash; although there was considerable sympathy for the dilemma of Dublin port &mdash; addressed the serious problem as to how we would sort out Dublin port, the major port in this country, or suggested what we should do to address that problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> I know Deputy Yates said the light rail transit system would take a great deal of traffic off the streets but it would still permit heavy duty vehicles to trundle along the quays &mdash; where they should not be &mdash; and to trundle along all the narrow streets leading into the city centre.  Where do we put them?  That is the fundamental problem we are faced with when we try to entice private motorists to leave their cars at home and take a mass transit system to their destination.  I agree with the Deputy that it should be a light rail system.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that the light rail transit system on its own is not the solution; considerable developments will have to take place in relation to bus services. I commend the Minister's approach, a much wider view is required so that an overall, comprehensive, strategic and integrated approach be taken to this overall problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnStafford" hpid="Mr. Stafford Mr. Stafford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>While this motion is excellent in many respects, I will not be supporting it for the obvious reason that I cannot and for the good reason outlined by my colleague that it is too restrictive. One cannot say that a light rail system will solve all the traffic problems in Dublin.  I say this because of the costs and problems involved in removing present services which would need to be carried out before a light rail system could be installed.  This would cost a huge amount of money and entail a great deal of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grants we receive from Europe will enable us to give financial support to Dublin Bus who have a major role to play in this area.  At a recent meeting with Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus outlined measures which I believe should have been acted on years ago, for example, the introduction of up-to-date buses which will run every five or ten minutes on clearways on designated routes with no unnecessary stops.  If it is possible to put in place a light rail system I do not understand why it is not possible to introduce an efficient bus service.  I have no doubt that the people of Dublin would use any proper transport system <Col N="853" /> which was clean, modern and run by well trained staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates said a light rail system could be in operation within seven years. I believe it would take seven years before such plans could be finalised.  However, it would be possible to have an efficient bus service within six months.  For example, commuters could buy special tickets to travel from Clontarf into town, from Clontarf to Donnycarney or on another route along the way.  At present it is almost impossible to travel by bus from Clontarf to Donnycarney to Finglas.  I think there is one bus every hour.  We need to sort out these issues.</P>
    <P>The DART system has been a huge success.  It proves the point Deputy Yates made about a light rail system.  When the Minister is looking at the DART system she should consider building a station in Clontarf, as this would cut down on the amount of traffic using the roads in that area.  As my colleague Deputy Fitzgerald said, a relief route to Dublin port also needs to be built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. However, the route being taken to solve our transportation problems is paved with too many reports and studies. The Minister said that a final report on phase 2 of the Dublin Transportation Initiative was due in April 1993.  I was pleased to hear her say she hoped the socio-economic cost benefit analysis on a commuter rail system would be concluded shortly.  The provision of a commuter rail catchment to North Kildare, Lucan, Clondalkin and Ballyfermot, the provision of a commuter platform at Heuston Station and the opening up of a link under the Phoenix Park to connect the DART service are very decisive and pragmatic measures which need no further study but just a commitment and decision to proceed.  I sincerly hope Commissioner Bruce Millan and his staff will respond speedily to the proposals which has been submitted to the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any merit in building an access route to Dublin port without looking <Col N="854" /> at the possibility of having a rail connection to the port which would be linked to the motorway network.  I agree there is a need for a proper access route to the port.  I cannot see any justification for allowing heavy 40 foot commercial tankers, trucks and container traffic to trundle through Dublin city.  Because there is no proper access route to Dublin port, exporters in the midlands and the west use ports such as Greenore and Larne and ports in Counties Wicklow and Wexford. CIE are examining the possibility of building a rail connection to Dublin port.  This would be very desirable from an environmental point of view and would minimise the costs involved in port access.  I trust this option will be included in the study.</P>
    <P>The national primary road network through County Dublin to the south, south east, midlands, north west or north needs to be completed.  I do not think there is a difference of opinion about a proper rail system and a proper road network.  It is a matter of striking the right balance in terms of limited resources.  We have a piecemeal road network.  As I said time and again to the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, we need to build a proper motorway network throughout the country if we want to decentralise services and ensure a more equitable balance among the population. This is a national requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates's motion is very timely. Nobody could disagree with the provision of a light rail facility.  However, I do not want to see the debate centre on one solution to our transportation problems.</P>
    <P>One assumes that the light rail system would operate in major residential areas that are inadequately covered by a road network, by the diesel commuter rail service or by the DART system, areas that are not served by a national primary road.  Access to the city by road from the west side of Dublin has been improved. To strike the balance, as Deputy Stafford said, we must improve the bus service. Study is taking place into environmental improvement and reducing the number of cars on the roads.  This can be achieved on the basis of an improved commuter <Col N="855" /> rail service, or a very reliable bus service. I note in the Minister's speech that Blanchardstown, which is in my constituency, is to get a new bus lane.  That is absolutely essential because the 45,000 to 50,000 people living in Blanchardstown, 10,000 or 15,000 of whom commute to the centre of the city every morning, will not use the public transport system as they get caught in traffic jams.  If they use cars they can travel through back streets thereby arriving at their destination sooner. There is usually only one or two people per car but people will not use the bus service as it is inadequate.  Dublin needs this study urgently but it also needs decisive decisions.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say last evening that it is suggested that development of the commuter rail service on the south-west rail corridor, including Clondalkin, will take place within the lifetime of the current operational programme on peripherality.  I sincerely hope that happens.  I am led to believe that the Commission consider that these projects should be interconnected with the international airport or the international port, so that there is access to member states.  Not only would we be providing an internal transport system with our own jurisdiction but we would be improving access to other countries. That is very desirable and I sincerely hope it can be accommodated in the study.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that while the studies and programmes are being considered, financial targets will be met. There should be a study as to how we will fund the recommendations of the group. Ingenuity and experience is not necessary to anticipate the likely outcome and the cost involved.  The Minister stated last night that extensive visits have been made to European capitals in considering the light rail option.  There is a potential to have speedy decisions made.  The greater Dublin area and part of Kildare, Wicklow, Meath, Ashbourne.  Leixlip and Bray, are on a commuter belt.  There are population projections for the next 20 years and all that is needed is a study <Col N="856" /> to determine the areas most in need of a transport network and the cost of providing such a network.</P>
    <P>I represent two of the new satellite towns on the perimeter of County Dublin &mdash; Clondalkin-Lucan, where there are 60,000 people, and Blanchardstown where there are just over 50,000.  A limited rail service is provided to Blanchardstown but the connection to the city centre is inadequate.  An improved bus service is also being considered.  I hope that speedy decisions will be made on these matters and that the Minister will give them priority.  High cost, lengthy studies should not delay decision making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Fitzgerald, Stafford and Lawlor for sharing their time time with me and for enabling me to make a very brief comment on behalf of the Progressive Democrats on this Private Members' motion.  The Progressive Democrats are fully committed to the building of a comprehensive light rail network to help overcome the traffic congestion problems in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister with responsiblility for environmental protection, Deputy Mary Harney, produced a comprehensive transport policy for the Dublin area exactly a year ago and highlighted the vital importance of developing a light rail network for the capital.  She and the Progressive Democrats based the case for such a system on the fact that to enable public transport to compete with the private car in the city it is necessary that there be full access to the central business district, a high frequency level with guaranteed punctuality and a high quality travelling environment.  We can all see the extent to which the DART service meets these requirements and how successful it has been on the corridor ringing Dublin Bay.  That quality of public transport service needs to be provided more extensively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already over 300 cities throughout the world have adopted a light rail tram system which is electrically powered and runs on existing roads on a fixed rail system.  The Progressive Democrats favour the introduction of a light rail <Col N="857" /> system, with a series of spurs ranging from the city centre, along the old Harcourt Street line to Stillorgan, another to Kimmage and on to Tallaght town centre and another to Clondalkin, with spurs to Blanchardstown and Dublin Airport.  I realise that the cost of this overall project would in the order of £400 million, but I believe that the project could receive significant EC Structural Funds aid and could also generate private investment. Moreover, the Progressive Democrats believe that moneys already tentatively earmarked for the eastern by-pass motorway could be redirected to a light rail system as the eastern by-pass motorway project is unacceptable on environmental and community grounds and at the end of the day it will not solve Dublin's traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Following on my party's commitment, we argued the issue with our partners in Government in the joint programme and in the review of that joint programme that took place last autumn.  As a result of these negotiations, the Programme for Government makes it clear that this Government are committed, as part of the Dublin Transport Initiative which is concerned with the ongoing planning of transport in the Dublin area, to carrying out a full study of the possible introduction of a light rail system.  Therefore, the Progressive Democrats fully endorse the commitment in the Government's amendment here this evening by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to seek significant financial support to develop the Dublin public transport system, including a possible light rail network, the case for which we believe to be overwhelming.</P>
    <P>I would be very encouraged if a similar study could be undertaken in relation to Cork city, a city in common with most other cities in that it has suffered severely from congestion and pollution caused by the private car.  The response to date has been to erect highrise car parks, which only add to the unsightly aspect of the city.  They go only part of the way to solving the problem created by the excessive use of the private car.  The principle behind this motion and the principle <Col N="858" /> behind the Government amendment is a good one.  It points the way forward for the development of public transport in this city in the decade ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Alan Shatter, Deputy Mary Flaherty and Deputy Pat Rabbitte.</P>
      <P>Dublin is choking and the daily increase in traffic congestion is bringing Dublin's commercial life to a halt.  Comparing Dublin's traffic counts with traffic counts in other European capitals, we see that Ireland has approximately 200 cars per 1,000 population.  The European average is approximately 350 cars per 1,000 population.  We can reckon from these figures that Ireland will equal the European average within the next ten years or even sooner.</P>
      <P>In the last 30 years Dublin has doubled in size with new and large housing estates.  This ribbon belt development, which in some cases is poorly planned and has created a large population in Dublin's outskirts, has increased the demand for transport services to the city centre.  The population of Dublin city centre has declined over this period, and most of the large centres of population are six or eight miles from the centre of the city and they are still growing.  Most of this population rely on several different authorities, including Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation, to plan and provide for their transport needs.  We in Fine Gael call for the re-establishment of a Dublin transport authority to coordinate and plan Dublin's transport needs into the next century.</P>
      <P>Dublin port adds to the traffic problem, and port users tell us that due to traffic congestion it is cheaper to use ports in Northern Ireland to transport goods from this country.  This problem contributes to a serious loss of income to the Irish economy amounting to £56 million per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin commuters now have an over-reliance on cars for transport and we witness daily single passenger cars delayed in never-ending traffic jams, with the occupant endeavouring to get to their workplace or business.  A recent Dublin <Col N="859" /> Corporation survey informs us that at peak hours the average car occupancy is 1.4 persons.  As well as the traffic chaos that this over reliance on cars creates, this ever-increasing problem is causing havoc to the environment and to Dublin city.  Car exhaust emissions are a serious danger to a city dweller's health and does untold damage to buildings in our city. The problem has become so acute that the Government should now, as a matter of urgency, appoint a transport ministry to cater for Dublin's transport needs. Traffic management and traffic planning must be given top priority by such a new ministry.</P>
    <P>The other major contributing factor to Dublin's traffic congestion is the ongoing problem of road openings of long duration created by An Bord Gáis, the ESB, Telecom Éireann and the local authorities. Some of these openings cause serious traffic delays and they seem to be completely unco-ordinated.  What is urgently required, is a body such as the Dublin Transport Authority, who would have powers to impose penalties, set down proper deadlines for completion of such works and oversee the satisfactory completion of reinstatements.  Today we are told that wear and tear on cars, increased fuel costs, pollution, stress and time lost in traffic jams is costing the economy £500 million per year.  It is a lot of money and it is something that has to be addressed very quickly.</P>
    <P>Dublin's commerce is also grinding to a halt.  Deliveries of goods to retail outlets by truck and other means contribute to the problem, but it is essential that retail outlets have regular deliveries of their stocks.  Dublin has 6,000 retail outlets and it is serviced by over 2,000 commercial vehicles.  Research into delivery time should be undertaken and a special provision made to ensure that, where possible deliveries are carried out before 7 a.m. and after 7 p.m.  This would help to reduce overheads and distribution costs.</P>
    <P>The provision of car parks beside DART stations with proper security to promote the park and ride concept, which has proven so successful in America <Col N="860" /> and in other European cities, would be a major contributing factor in reducing Dublin's critical traffic bottlenecks.  In my own constituency there are large car parking spaces beside such stations as Sutton, Bayside and Kilbarrack.  DART should provide proper security and fencing around these car parks so that people could put their cars there in the morning, get the DART into town and be able to collect them in the evening.</P>
    <P>We in Fine Gael feel sure that the solution to Dublin's transport problems is the construction of a light rail transit system.  With proper planning, proper investment and political will, this system should be in operation within the next five to seven years.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that she will be seeking funds from Europe in the autumn.  However, my fear is that the Minister will be paying lip service when what is required now is action at home and in Europe to secure the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>The DART system from Howth to Bray has been a great success and its success has ensured that approximately 7,000 cars are left at home each day.  It is successful because it is run efficiently and it is not competing on congested roads along with buses and other means of transport.  DART users can plan when to leave home, and when to arrive for meetings without having to allow for loss of time due to traffic hold-ups.  People can plan their day in a stress-free, free way, and, according to the medical people, stress shortens our lives.</P>
    <P>Light rail benefits from the latest technology. Vehicles on steel wheels are propelled electrically.  Such vehicles are environmentally friendly and would be ideally suited to Dublin's needs.  Light rail would be cheaper to instal on its dedicated tracks, and would prove most efficient and cost effective.  It would not require tunnelling and would therefore be much cheaper than the heavy rail system.</P>
    <P>Without a good, reliable public transport system no city, and certainly not Dublin, could run efficiently.  A light rail system would improve public transport <Col N="861" /> usage and would reduce the number of car journeys.  The present DART system should have spur lines to Dublin Airport and on to Swords.  Extra DART stations should be provided at Fairview and Clontarf. Deputy Stafford mentioned Clontarf, which has a very big and growing population.  A DART station there would be most welcome.  In my constituency, we had the magnificent Howth tram.  The property is still there and I would ask the Minister to consider the feasibility of bringing back that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to support the motion calling on the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to commission a light rail transit system for the greater Dublin area.  I do not want to go over the points that have been dealt with by our spokesman but I welcome what seems to be an emerging consensus, that we have given insufficient attention, time and investment to the public transport element of Dublin city's transport problems.  I say that as a person who is far from being anti-roads and who feels that our roads system throughout Dublin needs much greater development.  I wholeheartedly support the growing recognition of the need to invest very substantial sums in our public transport system if we are to get the proper balance.  Deputy Yates pointed out yesterday that along the corridor where we have the DART system in operation, public transport is extremely successful and there is far greater use of public transport along that corridor and indeed, it is generally a pleasure.  We have set aside, in our development plan and in various plans we have considered over the past decade, the lines along which future similar systems should be developed.  One which I know is very close to your heart and mine, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is the line out to Finglas. We would hope as a result of this motion that increased priority would be given to this.  It is now being given adequate place in the context of possible European funds which traditionally were seen as only being utilised in the narrow roads area.  That is a very welcome <Col N="862" /> development and we hope to have major breakthroughs in that area in the context of the Clondalkin line and an extensive Dublin-based system of light rail.  It is absolutely vital that we achieve this for the sake of jobs and life in our city.  The Dublin city business people are very well organised.  They speak for the commercial heart of Dublin.</P>
      <P>We would like to see the heart of Dublin substantially residential.  They make very valid points in relation to their needs.  High on the list is the need for a light rail system.  Deputies Stafford and Fitzgerald argued that it seemed to be an either/or choice.  If you go for light rail you cannot go for the development of CIE and for improvement of access by road into the port.  We see this as a priority but as part of a total package for solving the Dublin transport problem.</P>
      <P>I very enthusiastically welcome Dublin Bus's new initiatives, their new &ldquo;Imp&rdquo; buses which are very successful on the routes which they run.  There are commitments to attempt special designated corridors.  I look forward to that.  If everything Fine Gael are proposing here tonight was implemented within five years there would be many other corridors not yet served.  All these other initiatives would be welcome.</P>
      <P>In a week or two at Rio the world leaders will be looking at the problems of global warming and the threat to the environment.  High on their list would be concerns to reduce the level of global warming and the damage to the ozone layer.  In an Irish context the transport sector contributes hugely to our own consumption of fossil fuels and damage to the environment as a result.  The transport sector in Ireland uses about 1.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year, which is about 20 per cent of Ireland's total energy requirment.  As well as emitting carbon dioxide, automobiles, trucks and lorries also emit nitrous oxide and hydrocarbons, which are also greenhouse gases.  We need a massive programme to deal with that problem which has been inadequately addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this debate a great contribution could be made by providing <Col N="863" /> fast, reliable and extensive public transport as an alternative to private cars.  In that context, I welcome this increasing emphasis on public transport because it is going to be one of the great challenges, not just for this country but right throughout Europe, if we are to face up to the limited amount of fossil fuel available. That issue is the one which I most wish to add to this debate.  I do not think it has been adequately addresed to date. I hand over to my colleague, Deputy Shatter, to join in supporting this motion. Despite the need for the Government side to take an opposing view, there is clearly behind all the shenanigans a clear consensus in relation to the importance of this element and the need to give substantial public funds to it in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank my colleagues for allowing me some of their time.  I welcome this motion.  When I was environment spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party some four years ago we were advocating a light rail transit system for Dublin.  We were not taken seriously.  It has now reached the stage where it is very much part and parcel of Fine Gael policy and has been for some time.  My colleague, Deputy Yates, has done an enormous amount of work in the area and I welcome the fact that we have the opportunity to take this motion this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to make a shameless plea on behalf of my constituents.  Deputy Yates has addressed the issue very well in the context of the entirety of Dublin.  I represent Dublin South constituency where we have huge traffic problems.  People leaving my constituency in the mornings to try to get into the centre of the city, and coming back in the evening, experience long queues, going through Deputy Doyle's constituency, Dublin SouthEast. Sometimes one feels it is some type of a miracle if one gets home in any sort of reasonable time.  In Dublin city and county we are on the verge of suffering what has been well described in some American journals as gridlock.  Eventually a minor accident will happen on some <Col N="864" /> street in Dublin which will bring the entire city traffic system to a halt.  We have been on the verge of that a number of times.  I have seen minor vehicle contretemps taking place in O'Connell Street which have resulted in traffic being fouled up for well over an hour.  We have huge difficulties.</P>
    <P>People in south Dublin have long been promised that the Harcourt Street line would be reopened.  Various proposals have been suggested, one being a busway, the other a rail system, then, more recently, a light rail transit system. What is required in south Dublin in the reopening of the Harcourt Street line is a light rail transit system.  What should be installed there for cost, environmental and efficiency reasons is a light rail transit system.  In the context of easing the traffic problems in my part of Dublin, I have no doubt that if we installed a light rail transit system substantial numbers of people who currently use their motor vehicles to get into the centre of the city would use it.</P>
    <P>We are told that large numbers, that is to say, 50 per cent, coming in from the north side use the DART system.  I predict that in the region of 60 to 70 per cent would use the light rail system.  It would enormously reduce the traffic on our roads, improve the suburban environment, reduce the level of accidents, reduce the numbers of people injured and killed on our roads.  It would reduce the expenditure that we have to incur on our roads systems.  Those who have to use the road in inter-suburban journeys, would find they could travel a good deal quicker in the sense of getting from point A to point B without being locked into traffic jams.  We would also find that the general overall environment would be substantially improved.</P>
    <P>We are told how costly it is to provide a light rail transit system but we rarely calculate the cost of maintaining the current system.  An estimate has been done by someone well qualified to do it that in the context of the entire city and county of Dublin the cost involved by the current transport system, a mixture of pollution, stress resulting in health problems, fuel, <Col N="865" /> wear and tear, time wasted and road costs can be estimated in the region of £500 million a year.  When we are talking about the cost of establishing light rail transit, we need to look at the cost of not establishing it: the business inefficiencies, wear and tear on our roads, the impact on people's health, the accidents which are occurring.  All of these costs are rarely calculated.</P>
    <P>So far the performance of the Government in this area has been little short of deplorable.  Deputy Brennan, the former Minister for Transport, some months ago announced that the decision had been made that we were going to have light rail transport on the Harcourt Street line. We then discover with the appointment of the new Minister, that he had been engaged in a shameless piece of constituency politicking.  No blueprint had been put in place, no funds had been allocated, no final decisions had been made, no application had been made to Europe for funding.  What the Minister was doing in the dying days of his sojourn in that Department was basically selling a political fairytale to our constituents in Dublin South.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this debate on the Fine Gael motion has brought us somewhat further in looking at light rail for Dublin in the context of what the Minister said.  I am deeply concerned that there is a need, not just for interim reports, for a final report from the Dublin Transport Initiative.  There is a need to have a plan in place to look for the funds that are necessary to provide the type of system we suggest in the tranche of Euro funding that should be available in the period 1993-98.  I am concerned that the lethargy of the Government, the lack of political commitment and the tendency on the part of Fianna Fáil to engage in nod and wink politics for election purposes rather than get on with the job and implement the decisions, could result in the transport problems of Dublin not being resolved but merely discussed endlessly without final decisions being made.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have a light rail transit system on the Harcourt Street <Col N="866" /> line.  It is essential that we do not have the second best alternative which is a busway system which will not be as efficient, as environmentally sound or as speedy and will not resolve many of the problems in the context of the roads problems in south Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am informed that if we open the Harcourt Street line to provide a light rail system with an extra link to Cabra, it would cost in total, including stock, £95 million.  It has been estimated that we can get 75 per cent of that amount from European funding, that is, £71.25 million and that, domestically, we would have to find £23.7 million which could come from State funding or private funding.  There is no reason we cannot find such money to provide a more efficient, safer and better transit system.  The people of south Dublin deserve that type of system.  One of the worst planning decisions made by any Fianna Fáil Government was that made many years ago when I was still a schoolboy in short trousers, about 1965, when the then Chairman of CIE, Mr. Andrews, closed down the Harcourt Street line.</P>

Unfortunately, the few minutes available <Col N="867" /> to me do not allow for a discussion on the economic and environmental considerations, but I want to devote my time to the disparity that has grown between the treatment of citizens on the west of Dublin and the citizens fortunate to live along the bay and enjoy the DART system.  This is a very serious discrepancy in this city.</P>
      <P>West Dublin, including Clondalkin, Tallaght and, indeed, the Kildare dormitory towns of Leixlip and Maynooth, are the most seriously discriminated against in terms of the provision of public transport. Unnecessary hardship and expense, not to mention adverse environmental considerations, are inflicted on people living in these densely populated areas by the neglect of successive Governments. This neglect culminated, as Deputy Shatter said, in the period of office of the former Minister, for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Seamus Brennan, who avoided every conceivable decision that confronted him, not just the question of the provison of transport infrastructure but the whole question of An Post rationalisation, the Shannon stopover and the recapitalisation of Aer Lingus.  He managed to get out before he made decisions on any of them.  The only decision he seems to have been able to make was to manage to find time to assist Larry Goodman in Baghdad.  Indeed, while lecturing workers in An Post on the merits of productivity the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, seemed to be blissfully unaware that if he was depending on getting paid by productivity he would probably starve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister Brennan told me in this House on 7 March 1990 that CIE had submitted transport investment plans to him, including plans for a new commuter rail service to Clondalkin, involving the improvement of commuter rail services on the Dublin-Maynooth line.  He said the estimated cost of the Clondalkin project was £27.3 million and qualified for assistance from EC Structural Funds. When I met the Regional Commissioner, Mr. Bruce Millan, in Brussels in September <Col N="868" /> 1990 he confirmed that as far as he was concerned the Clondalkin project would qualify for up to 70 per cent funding. Although the plans did not involve a rail link to Tallaght, there seems little doubt that the demand for a spur line to Tallaght, once the Clondalkin service was up and running, would be incapable of being resisted.  That was more than two years ago and when Minister Brennan left the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications he still had not made up his mind.</P>
    <P>The transport neglect of west Dublin is part of the planning discrimination that is rapidly producing two Dublins: the first Dublin is the middle-class belt of high earners, a high number of car owners per head of population and a super de luxe DART system; the developing Dublin, based on the three new western towns with a lower income profile and fewer cars per capita are told to make do with a bus-based solution which is inefficient, ineffective and expensive.  Why should the residents of Clondalkin, Tallaght and Blanchardstown continue to be so disadvantaged on the critical issue of transport?</P>
    <P>In June 1991 the Fianna Fáil election news document entitled, &ldquo;The Future of Dublin Transport&rdquo; included the following:</P>
    <P>Funding has been reserved for a commuter link between Clondalkin and the City Centre, serving 12 stations including Ballyfermot, Phoenix Park, Cabra and Drumcondra.</P>
    <P>Nothing happened on foot of that commitment except that Minister Brennan managed to discover £10 million the day before he left the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications which enabled him, cynically, to do what he is best at, that is, to manipulate the media by announcing phoney plans to reopen the Harcourt Street line.  Deputy Shatter made a reference to that issue.</P>
    <P>I have a letter in my possession from a constitutent who closed the letter with a PS, saying that just as he was about to send this letter to me, he saw that in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of that day, Tuesday, <Col N="869" /> 25 February, on page three, that Mr. Oliver Doyle, of Irish Rail had informed Dublin Corporation's traffic committee that despite the assurances given by the former Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Brennan, CIE had received neither ministerial instruction nor cash funding to proceed with the refurbishment of the Harcourt Street line.  He said we have had a plethora of committees and it was about time we had a little positive action and honesty.  He asked me to bear this in mind at any opportunity which presents itself.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is opportunism and opportunism in it and Minister Brennan has made a very successful career out of opportunism and promising action. However, like a good wing three-quarters in rugby, he has managed to get rid of the ball every time he was about to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The disgraceful treatment of Tallaght and Clondalkin in the provision of public transport, and specifically in terms of suitable commuter rail services, must end.  In circumstances where the provision of a rail infrastructure to the western towns will be funded mainly by EC Structural Funds, it is shameful that this Government have reneged on their promise.  I will continue to remind this Government of their responsibility to the people in my constitutency until they enjoy the same public transport facilities as Dubliners from Howth to Killiney.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the new Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, will take this issue on board.  I am not sure whether she fully appreciates the disadvantage involved for people who live in my constituency in Clondalkin and Tallaght, people who, in many cases, do not have access to cars, who may have been relocated from the north side of Dublin or the inner city to the western suburbs and who endure a feeling of alienation because there is not an adequate transport system to the city or the north side. I sincerely look forward to the Minister, in her period of office, making a decision to get that Clondalkin project up and <Col N="870" /> running.  I support the motion and I commend Deputy Yates for bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally) Brendan Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates and I have one thing in common &mdash; Deputy Shatter spoke shamelessly about his own constituency as did other Members tonight &mdash; in that it would be very difficult for either of us to refer to our constituencies when speaking on this motion.  I strongly support the amended motion.  In proposing it yesterday evening the Minister made it clear that the Government are pursuing an innovative, comprehensive and well thought out process of addressing the traffic and public transport problems of Dublin city. These problems have grown up over many years and are not capable of instant resolution.  It is vital that we do not rush into short term, ad hoc attempts at solutions to the problems.  What is needed is a comprehensive assessment of the problems, a thorough evaluation of all the options for addressing them and above all a process of public consultation which will afford the people of Dublin a real chance to give their perspective on the problems and their views on the possible solutions.</P>
      <P>This is the basis on which the Dublin Transportation Initiative has been put in place by the Government.  The Minister has already outlined in some detail the basis for the Dublin Transportation Initiative approach.  I have no doubt that the inherent strengths and attractiveness of light rail as a public transport facility will ensure that it has a prominent place in the eventual report and recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  In itself, light rail is only part of the solution.  Improved bus services and a whole range of other measures concerning traffic management, parking facilities, etc., will also have their place as part of an intergated overall public transport strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be borne in mind also that the introduction of light rail or any other mass transit system on a significant scale <Col N="871" /> would have an impact on the amount of road space available for the private car. There are very few people, however, who would argue against some limitations on private car use in heavily congested city centre areas, particularly where an extensive and reliable public transport service exists as a real alternative.  The actual construction of a light rail system would also lead to some disruption and inconvenience in particular areas in the short term.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we should not lose sight of the important measures taken as a result of the activities of the Dublin transportation task force.  These low cost measures have concentrated on keeping traffic in the city moving, through a combination of practical steps such as the introduction of bus lanes, new technology to improve traffic management, upgrading of the bus fleet and improved bus fleet management systems; these measures have improved bus journey times and made the bus more attractive to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In recent times Bus Átha Cliath have introduced a number of new initiatives as part of a market-led approach based n greater flexibility and responsiveness to consumer needs.  These initiatives include new ticketing arrangements and new types of service involving more frequent service with smaller vehicles.  Bus Atha Cliath are continuing to develop plans to upgrade and improve their services. These measures have helped significantly to contain some of the problems affecting traffic and public transport in Dublin in the short term.</P>
    <P>In addition, there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the DART and suburban rail systems which clearly shows that a modern, efficient and reliable rail-based mass transit system can be very effective in attracting people away from private car use.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative will provide both a long term strategy and a medium-term investment and implementation programme for the period 1994 to 1998.  The final report of the initiative will be available in April <Col N="872" /> 1993.  However, an interim report will be available in the autumn of this year to assist the Government in drawing up proposals for investment under the next phase of EC Structural Funds.  Given the severe financial constraints on the Exchequer, which are unlikely to improve significantly in the immediate future, it is clear that the level of investment which will be required to put in place a modern, efficient and cost effective transport infrastructure for Dublin city can only be contemplated on the basis of major financial support from the EC.  There could hardly be a clearer example of the importance for Ireland of closer integration of the Community and ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  In this context, the Minister has clearly stated her intention to seek EC funding for the development of public transport in Dublin.  She will have my full support and I hope the support of every Member of this House in her efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>The institutional arrangements which will apply in the context of developing and implementing a long term transport strategy for Dublin city are among the issues which are being addressed by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  There are many factors which must be taken into consideration in this regard.  It would be unwise to take up firm positions on single issues outside the context of the total package which will emerge from the Dublin Transportation Initiative process. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>

      <P>When I was first elected to a local authority 13 years ago traffic was a problem but today it is a serious problem and it is on every agenda.  It is on the agenda of every residents' association because of the rat-running through residential areas.  Deputy Shatter spoke about this in Dublin South and it has just passed into Dublin South-East.  Today, <Col N="873" /> indeed, some of my constituents in Dunville Avenue, Ranelagh, blocked the road out of desperation because of the number of commuters that pass by their doors every morning and evening.  I do not agree with what the residents did but I understand their desperation and what they experience there.</P>
      <P>The light rail system for the Harcourt Street line would solve that problem.  It would be very beneficial to Dublin.  I would ask the Minister to give special attention to it.  There is another reason why I would ask that special attention be given to the Harcourt Street line.  Nobody has mentioned so far in this debate the cost of light rail service for the city and the preparation for the light rail service. One would have to remove all the services that run under the road, such as, natural gas, ESB, water, etc., because the area dedicated to light rail would have to be free of these services.  The Harcourt Street line is free of these services.  There would be no initial cost in putting the line in from that point of view.  The Minister should act quickly and promptly in that matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who say that extra roads will not solve our problem because extra roads will, in my view, generate more traffic.  One of the main problems facing Dublin is that 30 per cent of the traffic going north-south or south-north has to go through the centre of the city; there is no alternative route.  The ring road around Dublin should be completed. When it is completed it will give a better service to Dublin.  The space left by the 30 per cent of the motorists who have to go through the city centre now will have to be used for light rail.  That is a very important aspect of this.  If road space is left then it must be used immediately to provide a new service.  If this does not happen then the space that is left by the motorists who go onto the new motorway will be taken by extra motorists and will defeat the whole purpose. The space on the roads should be used for light rail and for an improved bus service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Deputy Yates spoke about the success of the DART system.  The <Col N="874" /> DART system has been a great success. However, I want to illustrate the point I have just made.  Deputy Yates said that 7,000 motorists left their cars at home and used the DART system.  That is true. Dublin Corporation have carried out counts on the roads parallel with the DART system.  It was discovered that there are more motorists on the roads now than before DART was implemented.  The space that was left by the 7,000 motorists who left their cars at home has been gobbled up by another 7,000 motorists.  Once space on our roadways becomes available then it has to be dedicated to public light rail.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will have fond memories of a light rail system in Dublin.  You and I are the only ones in the House who would have memories of the old Dublin United Tramway Company. Indeed, my father was an employee of that wonderful company and I still live in a house built by them for their employees.  The company served Dublin well.</P>
    <P>We have to strike a balance between the need to provide a proper public transport system and the needs of private motorists.  The only way we will be able to do this is by dedicating part of our roadway for public transport, be it light rail or bus, and allowing private motorists to use the remainder.  If private motorists wish to use a scarce resource we can charge them increased parking fees or tolls.  If motorists want to bring their cars into the city, they should have to pay for the facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not remember the last tram I do remember the last tram rails.  On many occasions on a wet afternoon in Inchicore while cycling to school my bicycle got stuck in the sunken rails and I ended up on the cobblestones.  It was an act of vandalism to have laid tarmacadam over those rails.  It would seem also since those rails are still there, that the difficulty in relation to infrastructure and the underground systems may not be quite as bad as some people seem to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> I rise to make one particular point which has not been made so far in this debate.  I represent a constituency which badly needs an adequate public transport system.  A light rail system represents the solution to the problems facing many of my constituents.  In particular, people living in Crumlin, Drimnagh and Walkinstown cannot get on a bus because when one arrives from Tallaght it is already full so it does not matter how long one waits for public transport at rush hour, particularly if the buses are running between Tallaght and the town centre.  As a result people have to bring their cars into town.</P>
    <P>There is a line on the map that is reserved and it is through Clanbrassil Street, Harold's Cross and Kimmage and on to the main road to Tallaght which connects with the main road to Baldonnell which in turn is surrounded by one of the best road networks in the country.  It connects with the road to Dublin Airport.  It is possible that the European Community will provide up to 75 per cent of the cost of a light rail system in this city; certainly a substantial amount of funds would be avaiable.  The question is where we would get the balance? Let me make a suggestion here this evening; and I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>
    <P>I have previously argued in this House that Baldonnel should be developed as a regional airport, in the same way as Galway, Waterford or Sligo airports but taking perhaps a greater volume of traffic than any of the other regional airports.  I have received the support of many business people for such suggestion.  Within easy driving distance of Baldonnel, there are huge industrial estates, for example, the John F. Kennedy Estate, which would use the regional airport to transport freight, as well as for business traffic, charter flights and so on.  In my view if we could incorporate the airports as satellites around which a light rail system would operate, it might be possible to find funding for the light rail system.</P>
    <P>Let me make the following suggestion to the Minister.  CIE are starved of cash <Col N="876" /> while Aer Rianta are cash rich.  Both companies are under the aegis of the Minister.  Aer Rianta have been a very innovative company and have expanded, very successfully into external markets, for example, the Soviet Union.  Such expansion would have been considered impossible a decade ago.  They have excelled in their trading and bartering activities.  I believe that if the Minister were to consider connecting Dublin Airport with Ballymun, Dublin University and Swords with the assistance of Aer Rianta.  In addition to developing Baldonnel as a regional airport, which could be used for charter business and regional flights and to transport freight, it should be possible to persuade Aer Rianta to invest, along with CIE, in the other leg of the rapid light rail system which is badly needed in the Tallaght region.  This would run through Kimmage, Harold's Cross and Clanbrassil Street where, as I have said, the line is already reserved. It seems that that would be eminently feasible.</P>
    <P>The development of a regional airport would be very attractive from the local people's point of view although I accept that some people would have reservations and argue that there would be an increase in the noise level.  When I raised the matter in the House Deputy Liam Lawlor strongly supported it, and I was grateful for his support.  I suggest that we look at this question and try to persuade Aer Rianta and CIE together, using Dublin and Baldonnel airports as satellites, to develop this rapid light rail system which would serve the areas which badly need it.  Together with EC funding and the assistance and co-operation of Aer Rianta and CIE, it should be feasible and absolutely achievable.  I ask the Minister to consider this suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  I understand that in total some 17 Deputies spoke.  I should say that their contributions were extremely constructive, positive and heartening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take up some of the points that were raised.  First, I felt the <Col N="877" /> Minister's contribution was positive and amounted to a substantial step forward on the issue of developing public transport in Dublin.  She made reference to the different structures and dealt with the consultative point by referring to the DTI and the different bodies involved by referance to the task force.  The existence of the task force underlines the fact that there is a structure missing.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transport Authority, which was not picked up on as much as the constituency factors in this debate, is an essential prerequisite to planning coherently, enforcing and overseeing all issues of transport in Dublin.  All the competing constituency interests put forward in this debate and the financial factors will have to be arbitrated on an ongoing basis.  I believe also that there is a need for a Dublin Transportation Authority.  Whatever form of public transport and new transport facilities are put in place, issues such as overall parking policy, taxis, traffic lights and enforcement of regulations will have to be dealt with by more than Dublin Corporation. There is a remit for an authority in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The central problem is that people want to bring into the inner city cordon more people than would fit into Croke Park, when full, that is, 75,000 people, within a finite period.  That issue has to be resolved but it cannot be resolved by way of the use of private cars.  It must be resolved on the basis of public transport which serves the main routes, including the Harcourt Street line and a line which would run to south-west Dublin through Tallaght and Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>I would like to pick up on what was said about Tallaght given that I was my party's spokesperson on Health.  As there is no hospital in Tallaght people have to bring by bus small children and babies in prams to St. James's hospital.  This is a nightmare on a wet day.  Therefore there is a special need to provide a service to Tallaght which, along with Finglas and <Col N="878" /> the Harcourt Street line, would make up the three priority routes.</P>
    <P>In this debate Deputies did not focus to a great extent on the financial issues.  I am sure, however, that Professor Barrett and others, who will ruminate on the details of this debate, will be very critical. I would like to put it on the record of the House that the eastern by-pass will cost £400 million whereas the most expensive light rail system proposed for Dublin would also cost £400 million.  The cost of accidents in Dublin alone is in excess of £120 million per annum while there is no doubt that Dublin Port is losing about £50 million a year to northern ports because the routes in and out of the port are choked with traffic.  Given that it has been agreed that the new Cohesion Fund should have a total sum of £7.5 billion, which is to be shared out between the four poorer member states, and the 64 per cent increase in the Structural Funds, the door has been opened for a new agenda here.  People from outside Dublin must bear in mind that 40 per cent of the population of the Republic live in the greater Dublin area.  Therefore, a superior public transport system must be provided in our capital city if, as Deputy Fennell said, we are to give life back to the city.  I believe the private sector will play a vital role in providing resources to make light rail a reality.</P>
    <P>There must be orderly analysis but consultation, analysis, deliberation and debate are no substitute for decision.  The Minister will be judged, as was her predecessor, not on her beliefs but on decisions taken and implemented by her. On a lighter note I notice in one publication that the Minister is described as &ldquo;Minister Go-Go Quinn&rdquo;.  On this issue I do not want a &ldquo;Stop-go Quinn&rdquo;; I want a go-ahead policy for light rail for Dublin. I want a blueprint available in the autumn of this year with a definite timetable for construction starting next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned I was making a point about the role of agriculture in the economy.  It was alluded to earlier in the speech of my colleague, Deputy Bradford.  It is amazing that any Irish Government would accept a deal that is so adverse to the economy, leaving aside entirely the agricultural economy.  I made the point in the House before, that in the eighties agriculture contributed almost one-third of all economic gowth.  It was a very difficult decade for agriculture, but nevertheless one third of the 20 per cent of real growth which we achieved in the decade came from agriculture.  It is extraordinary that the Government are accepting a deal that will, in the opinion of all the experts, freeze out agriculture from contributing to real growth in the economy in the next decade.</P>
      <P>This country depends for much of its economic activity and for wealth and job creation on agriculture and agri-related industries.  I do not have the figures to hand on the volume of exports or the volume of jobs it generates.  We are at a cross-roads in the development of this country in that we never had a greater need to create employment.  We need to use every possible resource we have and we should shackle or fetter no resource whatsoever, and yet we find that by making this deal the Government are shackling the very resource which is at the very heart of economic activity- agriculture.  We are ensuring that in perpetuity or a least for a decade it will make no contribution towards growth or job creation.  That is an extraordinary situation.</P>
      <P>In the Maastricht Treaty all community policies are to move towards achieving cohesion, including the Common Agricultural Policy.  By accepting this deal we are anti-cohesion.  We need a vibrant, growing, unrestricted agricultural economy in order to participate in the drive for cohesion.  I wonder if the Minister understands the real meaning of cohesion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> When contrasted with the original proposal, the recent adjustment in the Common Agricultural Policy must be accepted as an achievement in view of the considerable difficulties facing that policy.  The latest decision made by the Council of Ministers removes the very real threat to the fundamental principles of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The fact that these principles are to be maintained is very much in Ireland's interests.  The impact of their removal would be unthinkable. <Col N="883" /> It is important that we now take whatever positive steps are necessary to adapt to the changes without delay.  The key words must be &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; in all sectors &mdash; on the farm, at the processing centre and in the marketplace. We will only be successful in gaining export markets if we supply a premium product on time.  This calls for far more effective co-ordination of effort between all sectors than exists at present. Price stability is the only sound basis for sustainable growth.  While this is particularly true in the case of agriculture one must ask at what price, at what quantity and at what margin over costs?</P>
      <P>If Irish agriculture is to exploit fully the advantages of economic and monetary union, it must improve its competitive position, especially in continental markets. If we are to do this we must have an efficient production and processing system for raw material, an unassailable high quality food product and a marketing capability.  The agriculture and food sector accounts for more than 40 per cent of net foreign earnings.  As we all know, 70 per cent of our agricultural output is exported.  The capacity to find markets at the best possible prices lies at the very heart of the future well-being of Irish farming and all who depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk producers faced with reduced quotas must be helped by an extensive advisory system.  This system should be operated in conjunction with the co-operatives. It is as much in the interests of the co-operatives as farmers that co-operatives are supplied with milk of the desired quality which will give producers an attractive price.  There is no point in wasteful duplication.  I welcome the Minister's recent statement that he is examining the future role and future plans of Teagasc, a subject to which I adverted some time ago.  It is almost ridiculous to have to say that a significant improvement in the export marketing of all products is now essential.  This point must be repeated again and again.  Here again there is a crying need for integration of effort.  One has only to look at the multiplicity of public and private agencies <Col N="884" /> involved in exporting beef to understand what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The beef industry is so vital to the national economy that no risk should be taken which might be detrimental to it. The success of this industry in meeting the new circumstances depends heavily on organisational efficiency and co-ordination. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to urgently review the proposals put forwad by the main bodies involved to meet the new challenge. I am not asking for another report &mdash; we have enough of those; rather I am seeking a meeting of minds.</P>
    <P>The reforms have now been agreed. The Minister and his officials have done an excellent job.  I shudder to think what the alternatives would be.  These reforms are now part and parcel of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The time for talking about what might have been is long past. We all have a role to play in making these reforms work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time with me.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, his officials and Commissioner MacSharry on the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  I welcome his remarks about the need for Irish agriculture to adopt a market-led approach. We all know that there is a market of 340 million people in Europe and that the German market, in particular, is very profitable from the point of view of our beef industry.  Unfortunately, many German buyers cannot get sufficient Irish meat and meat products because our market price cannot compete with the intervention support system.  I hope the trend to which the Minister referred, of putting half of our total beef production into intervention, will be reversed so that we can supply those markets and end the uncertainty which has existed, particularly for the last 15 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that premia and grants will be paid during the year in which they are due.  I should say that not alone has there been a problem with the payment of premia but the application forms are too complicated.  I <Col N="885" /> hope the Minister will now simplify the application forms so that mistakes can be rectified at an early date.  This would ensure that people who make genuine mistakes and errors will not be penalised as they have been in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very successful in regard to milk quotas.  He has ensured that there will be no reduction in quotas this year.  Of course, this means that there will be price reductions in dairy products. I would not like small milk producers to suffer through a loss of premia.  If this happened many small farmers in the dairying sector would give up producing milk altogether.  This would be a severe blow to farmers in the west who have been very badly hit over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies who said that farmers' incomes have fallen and that there is poverty on many farms in the west.  I have called on the Government on numerous occasions in this House to introduce a family income supplement for smallholders similar to the family income supplement for the PAYE sector. This system which has worked very well for the PAYE sector must be applied to smallholders if we want to maintain the maximum number of farm families in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know this is a social welfare matter but it is also a matter which the Government should address urgently.  I referred previously to the assessment of smallholders for unemployment assistance. The Commission has been quoted as saying that farmers should produce more food and also protect the environment. If this is so, then surely farmers should not be penalised for increased production. I was glad to hear that the Minister for Social Welfare is looking at this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been successful in the discussions in regard to the sheep sector.  Indeed, he may have been too successful in this respect.  As somebody who represents small farmers, I fail to see why farmers in disadvantaged areas with over 500 or 1,000 sheep should get a half premium. I look forward to the benefits for <Col N="886" /> the consumer in this package, to the proposals to help farmers, and, particularly, to end the uncertainty for small producers. I know that the Minister and the Government are committed to doing that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As my time is very limited I am going to omit the Euro speak and the jargon which has been used today and throughout the country, particularly in the past 12 months.  The future of a number of farmers will be affected by this package.  I would like to know who will get compensation or what sector of Irish agriculture will do well as a result.  Will the Minister give me that information as I cannot see who will benefit?</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform package will not help small farmers, despite the claim that all farmers' birthdays will come together when the new compensation rates are paid.  There are many unanswered questions about the price of cattle, sheep and milk under the new regime, and I do not think any Member can answer them.  For example, there was a nosedive in the last three or four days in the price of sheep, with factory prices now less than 80p per pound, a reduction on last year's price of between £12 and £15 per lamb.  That cannot be denied.  I am told by the industry that it is very likely that the price will drop to between 70p and 75p per lb.  The Minister, and the Commissioner, have said that farmers will get a maximum of £28 per ewe under the ewe premium scheme.  When one considers that the ewe premium was previously £21 and that lamb prices are falling, the compensation for sheep farmers is inadequate.  Do we believe that lambs are likely to make 90p, £1 or £1.20 per lb. in a year's time? Present trading patterns are not taken into account in terms of the ewe premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there is bad news in the package for small dairy farmers.  Farmers with a small quota are trapped.  Maybe that was always the case with nothing but pious platitudes being paid, but there was a chance that farmers would get an increase quota.  However, that is not <Col N="887" /> possible now.  The 2 per cent quota will be reduced.  I agree with the Minister that it will not be reduced this year but there will be a reduction of 1 per cent next year and 1 per cent the year after, which will not make a great difference to farmers with a big quota.  The price of milk will be reduced by between 5p and 7p per gallon in the next year or two, and that will greatly affect the small farmers.  I cannot see how this new package is going to help that category of farmers.  The fact that only £66 per cow is allowed for the first 40 dairy cows is a major blow to farmers.  A great injustice has been done to small dairy farmers, and that should be spelled out here.</P>
    <P>Beef cow grants have been substantially increased.  In 1991 the total beef cow grant was £138.  After consultations with people involved in Irish agriculture, it appears that under the 1993 proposals farmers in disadvantaged areas will receive £207, with an additional £26 for farmers whose stocking rate is below 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  That is a reasonable increase.  However, we learned with dismay that no grant will be paid in respect of heifers which make up 50 per cent of the total cattle population. I cannot understand the logic behind that.  Some years ago farmers received a slaughter premium for heifers.  There are thousands of farmers in that business. I know that some heifers are used as breeding stock but what will be the position for farmers who sell heifers to factories and butchers?</P>
    <P>I understand that the beef cow quota will be related to the 1992 quota.  There are many unanswered questions in this regard.  I welcome the slaughter premium of £52, which has been sought for years. There are also seasonality factors involved.  I would like to know whether any thought has been given to the fact that a farmer who has cattle for sale in January of a particular year will not sell to a factory in the month of December if he thinks he will lose £52 by doing so. Has any thought been given to the continuity of supply?  Much work has to go <Col N="888" /> into this.  Otherwise farmers will end up worse off.</P>
    <P>Over the years I was involved in the store cattle trade.  From experience I believe that if we decide not to put our product into intervention, as the Minister outlined, difficulties will arise.  I believe the price paid for store cattle at our marts will not compare with the compensatory amounts that have been offered.  I hope I am wrong but the signs are that that will be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the present compensation is sufficient, but I believe that changes are necessary.  I cannot understand why in the beef cow scheme, there is no upper limit on the premia paid to farmers.  For example, a farmer with 500 cows would receive the same amount as a farmer with seven cows.  We know why there is no upper limit, because the big boys put in the boot when they got the chance &mdash; I am not referring to the big boys in Ireland but on the Continent.  No effort has been made to help the people in poorer areas who did not produce surplus products. Everyone talks about marketing now and that is the way it has to be.  Can anyone seriously tell me that we will have to double the amount, in volume terms, of products we already sell via the straight marketing system outside of intervention, quickly enough to ensure that there is not a huge price drop?  It is because of our inability to do that I forecast that the people who are selling store cattle and sheep are in for a great shock. I sincerely hope that my words do not come true, but the small farmers of Ireland have been let down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make my brief contribution to this very important debate.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is indeed a matter which has dominated the minds of individual farmers and the agricultural industry and generally over the past 15 months.  Never before in the history of Irish farming, was there a greater dependence on the ability of our negotiators to secure a good deal <Col N="889" /> for Ireland.  As everybody in this House is aware, the talks have been long and difficult but the outcome has been as successful as it possibly could be for our country.  There never was and never will be a time when national negotiators succeed in getting everything they aspire to achieve for their countries.  International negotiations are about compromise and securing the best deal possible for individual member states.</P>
      <P>Since reaching agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, much has been said and written particularly in relation to the outcome for Ireland.  The comments and the analysis have varied depending on their source and on their motivation.  It can, however, be said that the vast majority of impartial and independent commentators have acknowledged that Ireland succeeded in getting a good deal.  For this we owe a debt of gratitude to our Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Joe Walsh and his negotiating team.  We also owe a debt of gratitude to Commissioner Ray MacSharry. I said in this House on many occasions in the past that at the end of the day Ray MacSharry, as the European Commissioner with responsibility for European agriculture, in conjunction with our Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Joe Walsh and his negotiating team, would deliver to Ireland the best deal that possibly could be delivered in relation to Irish farming and to Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome is also an indication of the extent to which the Community is willing to respond to the needs of smaller and weaker economies such as Ireland, which have a unique dependence on agriculture and the food industry.  We all know that in relation to the many debates which took place in this House over the years, we made the case as strongly as we could, that the European Community should recognise the needs of the smaller more dependent economies, particularly those dependent on agriculture.  Many people had doubts as to whether the Community would give that kind of recognition to agriculture.  It is, and should be a source of encouragement and <Col N="890" /> inspiration to all of us as we move into a further phase of European solidarity that in these negotiations, our Minister and Commissioner Ray MacSharry, delivered to this country the best deal that could be got.  Admittedly we would all like to see a situation in which there would be no restriction on agricultural production, where individual farmers could continue to exercise their professional skills in relation to the production of crops and livestock husbandry but the reality is that Common Agricultural Policy reform was necessary particularly, as far as economies such as Ireland is concerned.  It was necessary because there was a gross over-production of food, mainly by the stronger European agricultural economies, which was having a serious and detrimental effect on our farming industry, particularly on the small farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton made a case, as he often does in this House, in relation to the dependence of small farmers on some kind of income support and so forth.  Nobody knows better than Deputy Connaughton, that if we did not have the reform package which has just been negotiated by our Minister and his negotiating team, there would be no future for the small family farm units.  If we did not have the protection provided by the direct income support, which has been negotiated, as distinct from the market support which has bedevilled the industry over the last number of years there would be no hope for the small family farm units of this country.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; farming, in other words, direct payments or a combination of payments from Brussels and national Governments in terms of the direct income support to farmers.  Everybody in this House knows, as it is a matter of debate here day after day, week after week, and will be a matter which will be raised at Question Time tomorrow, that Irish farmers depend on direct income support.  Irish beef and cattle producers in particular, have been totally dependent on European and national cheques because for many farmers over the last number of <Col N="891" /> years the element of profitability in the livestock enterprise has very often been the amount of a cheque which they were receiving from the European Community. I challenge the people on the far side of the House to say what is wrong with negotiating, as we have now done on behalf of Irish farmers, a trebling income support.  The figures are clearly stated and they have been negotiated.</P>

      <P>What price would they get for a bullock in an open, free market situation anyway?  I understand the point Deputy Connaughton is making in relation to the decline in the price of sheep at present but that is a marketing situation, where Irish farmers have to go out into the market and sell their products.  The ability to sell our product on the European market very often depends on the ability of our exporting industry.  It is wrong to say that the decline in sheep prices has anything to do with what we are talking about here in terms of Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  The prices which will be available for any of our products will inevitably vary in terms of market conditions prevailing at the time.  What would the position be for the farmers if we had not negotiated positive, definite income support in relation to all these enterprises? I would have to say that the fate and future of many of our smaller farmers would be very bleak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not, through statements in this House, undermine the confidence of our farmers in the future development of the agricultural industry.  I am not making a political point, even though Members on the opposite side of the House would accuse me of it.  I would have to repeat that the people who have carried out <Col N="892" /> an independent, objective analysis of the negotiations which have taken place and the outcome of these negotiations, have been very forthcoming in expressing the view that they have been extremely successful as far as the agricultural industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>I support the outcome of the negotiations on behalf of our farmers.  I realise Deputy Connaughton is very sincere when he talks about the future development of Irish agriculture but it is not a time to make statements which will undermine further the confidence of our farmers, rather it is time, as some speakers have already said in the House, to encourage our farmers to settle down in view of the price negotiations which have been concluded and to plan for the future development of the industry.  I hope that is what all of us in this House, and outside of it, will do in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has described the recent Common Agricultural Policy agreement as a super agreement, but those agriculturalists at the coal face have other views.  It will take some time to define clearly who is right and who is wrong in their assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Connaughton, I am very deeply concerned with the small dairying people who are the backbone of rural Ireland.  The recent NESC report states that the principal objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy are to support the prices received by farmers and thereby support their income, to promote economic growth and employment, including a healthy balance of payments, to ensure food security and to preserve rural society.  Anybody conversant with the facts will recognise that during the period in which the Common Agricultural Policy has operated rural society has been diminishing.  There are parishes in south Kerry where in 1991 there were merely two births.  That is a danger signal for the whole community in relation to schools, churches, voluntary and sporting organisations.  The reason is obvious.  The cutbacks in milk quotas in the past five <Col N="893" /> years have devastated the standard of living of people who are dependent on the cow, the milk and the creamery.</P>
    <P>The Minister will acknowledge that small farmers with quotas of less than 10,000 gallons had anticipated a redistricution of quotas.  On reading this agreement they will find that there is not to be a reduction in quotas this year but there will be reductions in the three following years.  That will give no confidence to that important category in our society. There wil be a loss of productive output in the co-ops, resulting in a loss of jobs. It is absurd to say that the commitment to the preservation of rural society has been lived up to by the Minister, the Commissioner and the negotiatiors.</P>
    <P>We have been calling for years for a proper agricultural plan.  We should be capable of having our people operating independent agricultural units in secure employment.  When we joined the EC we were told that in respect of beef and butter we would have a market of 260 million people, but that market did not develop for us.  The only thing that sustained our beef and dairy industry was intevention.  Now that is being cut off. Would we fare better in the free-for-all open market?  The adequacy of compensation can only be measured by comparing what we were guaranteed under intervention and what the free trade market will return for butter or beef.  We cannot guess at this stage.  To cite any figure as being a tremendous boost to Irish agriculture could be very shortsighted.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago I asked the Minister the total cost of vegetable imports in 1991.  I was astonished to see the figure of £32 million.  Taking account of our fertile ground, our climate and the traditional expertise of our people in producing potatoes and vegetables, this is an absolute scandal.  Let no one assume that those involved in agriculture have lost the expertise.  There is a lamentable lack in presentation and marketing of our produce.  I asked in a second question if the Minister would investigate the possibility of sending a smal number of young farmers to the Netherlands or some other <Col N="894" /> area where they would get expert tuition in marketing and presentation.  That would be a good investment which would enable people to operate small farms successfully.</P>
    <P>Another worrying feature is the transfer of good agricultural land to forestry. Since the twenties we have had a forestry policy for lands at a higher altitude, of which there are plenty.  Now the Department of Energy offer a higher grant incentive for the afforestation of good, fenced-in agricultural land.  This is a tragedy for rural Ireland.  We will be replacing people with trees.  This is the time to stop it.  There is nothing in this agreement indicating a positive policy to restore life to rural Ireland by assisting the small farmer to diversify, encouraging co-operation with the co-ops and eliminating the expenditure of £32 million annually on vegetable imports.  We should be in a position to export vegetables.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to my suggestion about sending farmers for training in the Netherlands that I should consult Teagasc in this regard.  What use is there in going to Teagasc when they have not the necessary funding to maintain an advisory service to farmers?  There is need for a plan.  Compensation is a sensitive issue and can change depending on budgetqary conditions.  We must have a plan to secure the future of our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh and express my wholehearted appreciation for his excellent negotiating skill which have achieved such a positive out come for Ireland on this issue.  The farmers of Ireland, the agricultural industry, the food industry and all those involved on the periphery and, indeed the Irish economy as a whole owe the Minister a great debt of gratitude.  The doubts, indecision and the sheer fear that have prevailed over the past 1 months are at the end.  How wrong those prophets and preachers of door and gloom have been proven.  All the succeeded in doing by their negative approach was to create unnecessary <Col N="895" /> worries for the farming community over a long period.</P>
      <P>I thank God for the positive approach of the Minister and the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry.  Nobody has a greater appreciation of what is required as far as Irish agriculture is concerned than the Commissioner.  Indeed, it is his publicly stated ambition to return to his native shores and to resume his active interest in farming.  I have said on many occasions in the past, and I am more than pleased at this time to be proven right, that Commissioner MacSharry would do all that was necessary to ensure a positive outcome to Common Agricultural Policy reform as far as this country was concerned.</P>
      <P>In the short period of time available to me I would like to refer to a few salient points.  From a national point of view the beef sector is, perhaps, the most urgent aspect that had to be addressed.  Cattle price support mechanisms needed to be put in place.  This is being done.  Phased reductions in the intervention price for cattle will obtain.  In referring to intervention, a Cheann Comhairle, I noted a remark from your good self this afternoon, while the Minister was speaking, when you chastised some Deputies who were interrupting.  In admonishing them your words were &ldquo;intervention is most unwelcome&rdquo;.  Your comments, a Cheann Comhairle, were, of course, in a totally different context, but how accurately they described the motion we are debating here tonight.  It is universally agreed and accepted that the practice of producing food and storing it in vast quantities, as we have been doing, is ludicrous and that it simply had to come to an end. Intervention served a vital purpose as far as Ireland was concerned but it has now outgrown it usefulness.  Compensation to farmers will be phased in <i>pro rata</i> and will be paid directly to them via increases in premia.</P>
      <P>With regard to milk, it is comforting to realise that the national quota level will be preserved for the current year and that some long awaited innovations in this area are in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Sheep form a very important part of the agricultural economy of my own county of Wicklow where a number of sheep farmers have been concerned about the future.  Much of this anxiety was brought about by negative thinkers, negative talkers and negative writers. Sheep farmers were extremely worried about how the sheep quota would be introduced and on what it would be based.  The fact that Ireland can retain its quota at 1991 figures will be a welcome relief to these people.  I eagerly await the finer details as to the actual operation of the quota system.  In this regard, I am comforted by an undertaking which the Minister gave me some time ago when I was tormenting him on this subject.  He assured me that all and everything he would do, and aspire to do, would be in the interests of the traditional Irish sheep farmer.  I fully accept that and I am confident he will deliver.</P>
    <P>It is very important to note that the Irish consumer will benefit from a reduction in food prices but it is even more important to ensure that this actually becomes a reality.  Far too often in the past reductions in prices at farm level failed to percolate through and to be reflected in reductions as far as the consumer was concerned.  That seemingly intangible being, the middle man, or the middle men, always seemed to grab whatever was going by way of price reductions.  It is vitally important that this is not permitted on this occasion.  Proper control and vigilance must be applied. The mechanisms exist; it merely remains to ensure that they are set in motion.</P>
    <P>However, in our gratitude and, perhaps, in our euphoria at the outcome of these negotiations we should not be carried away, we should not assume that Irish farmers are now on to a good thing, that all their troubles are over and that they will be laughing all the way to the bank, because that would be a total fallacy. To bring one back to reality one has only to look at this week's prices for lamb.  Indeed, projections for the immediate future in that regard indicate a further deterioration in prices is on the cards.  We should remind ourselves that <Col N="897" /> any compensation to be paid to farmers is totally meritorious and is geared to make up for the reduction in the output price.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister's statement today regarding the payment of headage premia.  This is a matter on which I have spoken in this House and in other fora over the years and particularly in more recent times.  It is atrocious that farmers must wait for almost unlimited periods before they receive those payments which are their just rights.  No business in the world, and farming today has to be carried out in a business-like way, could possibly survive in these conditions. Farmers must budget the same as those in any other business have to budget.  They must know when cash flow will obtain and when moneys are forthcoming. They must be able to count on and depend on payments arriving on time.  I have no doubt that that will be adhered to and that these farmers can and will get their just deserts in terms of payments that are forthcoming and get them in good time.  The Minister mentioned also the proposed early retirement scheme for farmers and that this would be funded substantially at 75 per cent.  This will facilitate and expedite transfers to young farmers.  We have been talking about this for a long time.  A great deal of lip service has been paid to it, making very small improvements with regard to young farmers taking over.  This is a major step in that direction.</P>

      <P>This Common Agricultural Policy reform package should have been about measures to reduce surplus production and at the same time make European agriculture more competitive. The results are clear.  Minister Walsh and Commissioner Ray MacSharry colluded with the other EC ministers to wreck commercial farming in Ireland and pay people to do nothing. This philosophy is not surprising from two individuals who would not recognise a farmer who still has to depend on the weather and a hand to mouth existence through various headage payments.</P>
      <P>What Minister Walsh has agreed to is a policy that will mean that Irish and European farmers will produce less, export less and import more.  Effectively, we are conceding thousands of jobs to other countries outside the European Community.  In addition, Europe is showing a zealousness for reform that borders on lunacy in the absence of any conclusion on the GATT negotiations. We have put the cart before the horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner MacSharry referred on many occasions to the fact that 80 per cent of the Common Agricultural Policy benefits were going to 20 per cent of the farmers and that he was going to change this policy radically.  Let us analyse the outcome in the light of this statement. The larger dairy farmers will be able to withstand the cold winds of quota cuts and reduction in price due to the reduction in butter prices, but what does the future hold for the 20,000 gallon dairy producers?  They will suffer a 7p drop in the price of their milk and a 2 per cent cut in their quota.  These farmers will soon find themselves in extreme financial difficulty and with very little hope for the future.  They may ask what can they do <Col N="899" /> instead of dairying other than put up with the situation in view of the difficulties in getting into alternative enterprises due to the quota regimes.</P>
    <P>In the beef sector the larger producers will benefit more substantially than the smaller producers from the increased compensation.  However, there is always the threat of a beef price collapse due to the changes in the intervention safety net regime, from 80 per cent to 65 per cent of the guide price.  We have not shown our capacity to find lucrative markets for beef in the past and the changes in the export refunds will not open up the Middle East markets in this regard. Common Agricultural Policy reform proposals will now ensure that instead of subsidising surplus cereal production we will be subsidising all cereal production in Europe which means that the larger producers of plants in Germany will gain rather than the relatively small grain growers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In all the main agricultural areas there is nothing to show that a policy where 80 per cent of the benefits go to 20 per cent of the farmers will change, and thus Commissioner MacSharry has failed in this objective.</P>
    <P>Many speakers on the Fianna Fáil side of the House have said that food prices will fall as a result of these reforms.  It is totally dishonest of any Government Minister to suggest that food prices will fall quickly in response to the recent agreement in Brussels in view of the fact that agricultural product prices have been falling continuously for the past four years while food prices have actually increased over the same period.  The result will be larger margins of profitability for the processing and retail sector with the Government merely acting as spectators in allowing this anti-consumer practice to continue unabated. When I suggested to the Minister for Industry and Commerce recently that the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade could do more in terms of inspection and enforcement to ensure that the price of food falls following this package, I was told by the Minister that there was <Col N="900" /> sufficient staff in the Office of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade to deal adequately with consumer legislation and that he did not intend introducing any surplus staff from the custom and excise area on completion of the internal market into the office of consumer affairs.</P>
    <P>The only effective way in which consumers can benefit from any fall in food prices over a five-year period is by the setting up of regional consumer offices with inspectors to monitor retail and processing outlets thus ensuring that food prices will genuinely fall as a result of these measures.  The history in this regard has been a very poor one.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate on Common Agricultural Policy reform, Fianna Fáil speakers have been telling us that it could have been worse.  What the Minister is saying in this House is like telling a Kilkenny supporter whose team has been beaten by Cork that it could have been worse.  There are only two conclusions one could come to.  One is that one was defeated.  The other is that the margin of defeat could have been much worse.  The lack of any alternative strategy is clear evidence of the absence of any fresh thinking on the part of the Government in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I must submit that the commercial Irish farmer has suffered severely as a result of these changes and future generations of young farmers who are trying to get greater viability from their holdings and to find ways of gaining additional farm income will find it exceedingly difficult to gain access to the agricultural sector and achieve further agricultural viability.  I regret that this Government do not look positively on the contribution of agriculture to economic development; they do not have any regard for the commercial farmer but are merely willing to pay people to stay at home and do nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the brief time at my disposal let me first register my strongest protest at the short time allowed by the Government for discussion on this major topic in this House.  It is they who are responsible because they organise the <Col N="901" /> business of this House.  A full day at least should have been given to one of the most radical and important changes to take place in the agricultural industry in this country from the foundation of the State.  I met the Minister for Agriculture on his return from these negotiations and I congratulated him.  My congratulations were based on independent reports from people who tried to analyse what the Minister had achieved.  On reading the Minister's presentation here this afternoon, I must change my mind.  It is a sellout of our small farmers.  That does not surprise me.  Indeed, I was beginning to wonder if there had been a change of heart.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a well meaning man.  I know him personally and I know what his intentions for farmers are, but I am afraid the Government are not supporting him.  The present Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Administration have thrown their hat at rural Ireland. They are closing down rural Ireland, and this is a further step in that direction. Closure of rural post offices is now on the cards.  The county roads are in total disrepair.  This problem started in my own county and is now a nationwide one. The small farmers are an annoyance to this urban-based Government who want to get them out of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In going into these talks, no groundwork had been done.  The Taoiseach who, when he was elected, was heralded as a rural Taoiseach, the saviour of rural Ireland, did not go to meet the heads of state to lay the groundwork for Minister Walsh.  He never left his desk in his grand new mansion in Dublin.  He seems to be carried away with its grandeur.  That will not last, and when we go to the polls shortly he will get the message that there is more to be done than sitting in grand seats in Government Buildings.  The Minister stated clearly that the build-up of substantial stocks of goods in intervention was contributed to very substantially by this country.  That was a damned lie.  It was outrageous to concede that going into negotiation.  We did not contribute to the stocks in any significant <Col N="902" /> manner.  It was the large big multi-purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo;.  It is untrue, and the farmers that I am speaking for here tonight will understand what I am saying.  That should not have been conceded because it is the big farmers, with their large combines, in Europe who are responsible for creating the food mountains that have now caused the problem.  Furthermore, it was outrageous to state that the small farmers of counties Cavan and Monaghan and the west contributed to the problem.  The Taoiseach had obviously not done his homework.</P>
      <P>There is a number of items to which I take exception.  The Minister in his speech stated that the forthcoming changes in premia arrangements will not affect producers traditionally entitled to headage payments.  That is like a red rag to a bull to people outside the severely handicapped areas.  In that regard the Tánaiste, the former Minister for Health and Deputy Leonard, who spoke on this matter today, did nothing to ensure that counties Cavan and Monaghan, and other regions, would be included.  What is the point in saying to farmers outside the severely handicapped areas that they will get their headage payments?  How will they since they have not been included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the suckler cow premium, this will be confined to those animals in respect of which premia were paid in 1991 and 1992.  How will small farmers be able to increase their suckler cow herds if that is so?  Was any regard had for farmers whose herds have been hit by disease, such as TB?  Given that they may now have only three or four head of cattle how will they be able to build up their stock if they are to be tied to their numbers of 1991-92?  They have not been told that they should try to develop their farms, make progress and that their quotas will be based on their figures for <Col N="903" /> 1994, 1995 and 1996 to give them a chance.  No, they want to keep it a secret and are limiting it to a year when people found themselves in trouble.  Likewise there are many cases where because his parents are in poor health a son has returned to the farm where the stock numbers have been depleted.  Will he have any opportunity to build up his stock?  Is he to be tied to the numbers on the farm when it was run by his parents or an aged uncle?</P>

      <P>I concur with previous speakers from this side of the House.  I regret, however, that Deputies on the other side of the House did not congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh, on his achievement in regard to the Common Agricultural Policy agreement which we are now discussing.  It was a team effort; the Minister of State, Deputy Liam Hyland, Minister of State, Deputy John Browne, together with their departmental officials, went to Europe to negotiate on our behalf and have come back with what I regard as an excellent package for this country.  Indeed, I never had any doubts about the Common Agricultural Policy reform package because I felt we had a friend in court in Commissioner MacSharry.  No Irish Commissioner would be worth his salt if he could not produce a final document that would be of benefit to the Irish people. Commissioner MacSharry held two portfolios here, that of Minister for Agriculture and, later, Minister for Finance. Who was in a better position to know what was required by the Irish people than Commissioner MacSharry?  He had to give the impression that it was being reformed for the benefit of the EC.  He did this but we did very well as a result. <Col N="904" /> It is very easy to be critical but, in this instance, we have got a wondeful package.</P>
      <P>One of my aims has always been to try to ensure that farmers retain cattle between November, when they are taken off grass, and January.  Unless they are offered an incentive there is no way that they will retain cattle until the spring and fatten them between January and April. The increase in the premium from £35 to a maximum of £237 should ensure that beef will be available throughout the year.  That was a great achievement.</P>
      <P>I also compliment Commissioner MacSharry on securing an increase in the suckler cow premium, from £52 to a maximum of £150.  For the first time, these premiums will be paid direct to the farmer.  Again, that should be appreciated.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies referred to the intervention system which was considered to be a safety valve.  This system was to be availed of only when we could not sell our produce at a proper price.  However, most sellers of dead meat placed their product into intervention immediately. Therefore, it was not a good practice to pay so much for it.  For this reason the intervention system had a detrimental effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, and the Commissioner, for the good message.  While the package may not be as good as we might have expected nonetheless it is very welcome.  After 18 months of intense discussions and negotiations in Brussels, the reform measures agreed last week for the Common Agricultural Policy between the Farm Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, and the Council of Farm Ministers represents the beginning of a revolution in the Community's farm policy.</P>
      <P>Happily, from an Irish perspective, some of the more alarming features of the original proposals from the Commission have been modified, and while there are still major concerns and question marks surrounding the latest proposals, nevertheless they do, on balance, represent a real opportunity for growth in both Irish agriculture and the Irish agri-business sector.</P>
      <P>The overall emphasis of the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures could be summarised as follows: a significant cut in the overall volume of intervention; cuts of up to 29 per cent in the Community's intervention and support prices; and compensation for farmers in the form of direct income aids through headage payments and other premia.</P>
      <P>Everyone has come to realise that the intervention system simply could not go on as before, with farmers and agri-business producing dairy products, beef and cereals to be dumped into intervention stocks, which in turn required huge subsidies from the Community to try to sell these goods on to the wider world market where prices were so much lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slimming down of the whole intervention system therefore offers opportunities and challenges for Irish farmers and Irish agri-business.  For a long time we bemoaned the fact that the intervention price was better than the price in the open market.  In those circumstances it was entirely understandable that Irish co-operatives and meat factories would use the intervention system when it gave <Col N="906" /> them a better return than the marketplace.</P>
    <P>For many years we have heard talk about the need for Irish agriculture to become more market-led.  That opportunity now arises.  I believe that Irish food products will have an opportunity to exploit the new Community market conditions.  Of course this will require a major investment in marketing.  But we have the produce &mdash; beef, sheep-meat and dairy products &mdash; produced in natural conditions, not factory farms, in a country with a reputation for being pollution-free.</P>
    <P>In this environmental and health conscious era, when more and more consumers want natural food products, free from additives and so forth, Irish food manufacturers and exporters are afforded enormous opportunity.  When we bear in mind the removal of all remaining trading barriers, this country from January 1 next &mdash; provided the Maastricht Referendum is adopted by the Twelve member states &mdash; the possibilities for growing our food exports become very obvious.</P>
    <P>Of course there is legitimate concern among farmers and farm organisations to ensure that the various compensatory supports in the form of headage payments and new cattle premium payments will continue well into the future.  I realise that Commissioner MacSharry has given such an assurance.  But I can understand farmers' unease at least until the conclusion of the GATT talks.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the European Community, as a whole, does not make any concessions on last week's Common Agricultural Policy reform measures in the GATT talks.</P>
    <P>Whereas there has been some dispute about the real value of the compensation worked out last week in Brussels and the extent to which they will offset the reductions in intervention prices, I am reassured to note that farm economist, Brendan Kearney, has estimated that the overall agreement reached last week should mean an additional £67 million to our agricultural sector.  Provided the compensation mechanisms are maintained <Col N="907" /> well into the future, the new Common Agricultural Policy can offer new hope to our farmers, Irish co-ops and meat factories.  I hope that these opportunities will be exploited to the full.</P>

      <P>Reading through the lengthy statement of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the House this evening, one would be led to believe that our Minister for Agriculture and Food pulled off a major coup in Brussels last week.  I can assure the House that the proof of the pudding is in the eating. When the package has been digested and analysed I predict we will see the real facts unfold.</P>
      <P>The Minister went to great pains to expound this paper package for the betterment of our farming community.  But, no matter what picture he paints, the stark facts remain that thousands of our farmers have been forced off the land under the Common Agricultural Policy. What steps has the Minister or Commissioner MacSharry taken to preserve that policy?  What special benefits are in the package to retain our small farmers on their holdings, particularly those along our western seaboard from Malin Head to Mizen Head?</P>
      <P>The special slaughter premium of £52.75 on all male animals slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April will benefit only a few big operators and will be cold comfort to the average small farmer. It will butter no bread for them.  Will the Minister say why beef heifers are excluded from this special slaughter premium payment?  If the Minister were served a steak in any restaurant tonight could he say whether it was a maiden heifer steak or a bully beef steak?</P>

Taking that into consideration and the Minister's statement that all the proposed direct payments will be increased by £200 million, we find a net gain to the farmers concerned of only £27 million.  Indeed there is no guarantee that, at the end of the day, that £27 million will ever reach farmers' pockets.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say what the prospects are for sheep producers under this package and would he also explain why, as it appears, they were ignored completely in his deliberations?  If the price of mutton and lamb falls in sympathy with the proposed reduction in beef&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;why did the Minister not include the proviso that premium payments on sheep would be increased to compensate for any reduction in the price of mutton and lamb?  Is the Minister completely ignoring the plight of the sheep farmer?</P>
      <P>It is clear that seasonality in beef slaughterings in this country stems from the seasonal pattern of calf births in the dairy herd, the principal source of raw material for the beef herd.  I can assure the Minister that this calving pattern will not change dramatically in the foreseeable future.  The exacerbation of the beef seasonality problem in recent years can be blamed to a large extent on the huge growth in calf prices in the wake of the scarcity induced by the dairy quota. There is also the possibility that competition among winter fatteners may result very quickly in the special slaughter premium being capitalised into the price of the bought-in animal, thus having no lasting impact on the problems of seasonality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the dairy sector I predict the price cut will cost milk producers over £25 million. The combination of the reduction in feed prices and the abolition of the coresponsibility levy may well result in a <Col N="909" /> net benefit of only £10 million to milk producers, most of which will be gobbled up by the big producer with further quota cuts looming on the horizon, with no exemption for small producers of under 30,000 gallons.  The future looks extremely bleak for farmers with small quotas.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention that the package will create a huge amount of difficulty for our agricultural industry. Any long term agricultural policy within the EC must continue to recognise the fundamental role of the family farm as the basic unit of production, the backbone of rural society.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Irish farmers are at a serious disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their European counterparts.  For instance, Holland, whose land surface is as big as Munster only, has a milk quota double the size of ours and a pig production over 60 times greater than ours. Will the Minister say what steps were taken at EC level to curb the output of factory farming on the Continent?  Can he tell me of any factory farm unit closing down on the Continent?  Can he tell me the number of small farmers being forced off the land by the continuation of this policy adopted by the EC Commission?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and agreed to a 30 <Col N="910" /> per cent reduction in EC agricultural output.  Was that the correct attitude to adopt to the agricultural tycoon from across the ocean?  Yes, a 30 per cent reduction in factory farming might be desirable but a reduction of that amount in family farm output is disastrous.  By his actions he has consigned rural Ireland to annihilation.  Does Commissioner MacSharry intend to turn rural Ireland into a wildlife nature reserve?  Does the Minister realise that our greatest asset is our youth?  Let me ask the Minister, Deputy Walsh, what incentives are in the package he has brought before the House to keep our youthful population in their native land?  A letter in the post will not keep the youth in Ireland.  Farmers are still due grants &mdash; even headage payments &mdash; from 1990.  Will the Minister give an assurance that farmers whose lands have been recently reclassified as in designated disadvantaged areas will be paid their headage payments this year?  It is cold comfort for these farmers to hear about a doubling of headage payments and increasing beef premia if they are not to be paid to every farmer throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Rural Ireland is being reduced to a wilderness.  Schools, churches, banks and the shops are closing.  Indeed, another 800 post offices are due to close.  What is the solution to this?  There is very little in this voluminous White Paper which the Minister presented to us this evening to maintain the <i>status quo</i> for these people.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank Fianna Fáil for giving me a few moments to voice my opinion on this very important topic, namely, the terms of the revised Common Agricultural Policy.  I must confess that the terms we read about today are much better than anticipated 18 months ago.  Needless to say, we are very seldom satisfied with everything we get but we must be satisfied with this in so far as it exceeds our expectations of 18 months ago.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, must be complimented on his efforts in bringing home the bacon on this occasion.  However, there is no point in sitting back and complimenting ourselves on what we have achieved, when we bear in mind that so much has to be done in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look critically at what has been achieved.  A new and very desirable beef premium totalling £158, an increase from £35, has been negotiated.  That will be paid twice in the lifetime of an animal at 12 months and at 22 months.  There is also a slaughter premium of £52.75p which will be payable for animals slaughtered between 1 January and 30 June. That is also very desirable.  We had always advocated that any incentives that come to agriculture should be anti-cyclical in order to get away from the cyclical pattern which we have in our dairying and beef industries.  However, not all animals will be eligible for that <Col N="912" /> slaughter premium because if that were so we would have transferred the glut from the autumn to the spring period.  As in the region of 80 per cent of our total slaughterings take place between mid-October through November and December, it would be fair to assume that 50 per cent of that, namely, 40 per cent of the total kill will be slaughtered in the spring months, thereby entitling them to the slaughter premium of £52.75.  When I mention that figure I am bearing in mind that people may be computing the size of the cheque the farmer will receive at the end of the year.  I heard somebody say on the radio that farmers would receive cheques to the value of £20,000 per annum.  Some farmers will receive that amount but most certainly not all.</P>
    <P>There are in the region of 217,000 farmers in this country.  To be eligible for the maximum grant a farmer will need to send 90 cattle for slaughter in the year. In my estimation that would mean he would need at least 130 acres of land. Only 8 per cent of our farmers own in excess of 125 acres of land, so those benefiting from the maximum premium will number no more than 8 per cent of all farmers.  In the region of 133,000 farmers have fewer than 75 acres of land &mdash; a typical farm is 55 to 60 acres.  If a man was devoting all his land to cattle and beef production I estimate he would have approximately 40 animals for slaughter in the year.  When you compute the size of the cheque for 40 animals I reckon he would get £7,300 per annum, a sizeable figure, indeed, and one that cannot and should not be scoffed at but not £20,000 per annum.  Just in case anybody thinks the man receiving a cheque in the post for that amount is on to a bonanza, he should bear in mind what was said today during the debate; &ldquo;the price of lamb today is relatively low&rdquo;.  That Member must have been joking when he said the price of lamb is relatively low; the price of lamb today is scandalously low.  This time last year the price of lamb was £1.20 per pound.  Today it is 82p per pound and unfortunately the indications are that that price will go even lower.  So it is quite obvious that any man getting a cheque in <Col N="913" /> the post would certainly need what is in it if he is to live at all.</P>

      <P>Let us hope the postal strike will be over by then.  I am sure that would be the only reason he would not get it. Some people voiced rather pessimistic views on our ability to market our produce.  I do not share those views.  We did not market our produce on the open market in the past, instead we took the easy option of intervention, but just because we took the easy option in the past does not mean that we had not the ability to find a market.  We have the personnel, they have the skill and we have the products for them to market.  I have every confidence in their ability to do this.</P>
      <P>We need to increase investments in research in markets and at university level to identify new products.  The people working in the research branch of Teagasc are among the best in the world. Research is also being carried out in the agriculture faculty in UCD.  Unfortunately, these departments have been starved of cash for the past few years. This means we are unable to put new products on the market for our European customers.  Even though people have been pessimistic about the state of our agricultural industry, I believe that farming has a bright future.</P>

These reforms will be very important for Irish farmers, particularly those living in the west.  As we all know, we have been over-producing beef for the past number of years.  The IFA and ICMSA leaders were very worried about the Common Agricultural Policy reforms.  However, I believe they are <Col N="914" /> very happy with the outcome of the negotiations; they realise these reforms will be of benefit to rural Ireland.

      <P>Recently I visited Bulgaria, a country which was under Communist rule for a number of years and which is very interested in joining the EC.  The only market this country has for its agricultural products is in Europe.  The Common Agricultural Policy package we have agreed is very important.  Agriculture is a very important way of life in rural Ireland and if farmers cannot put their meat into intervention they should be compensated.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I will confine my remarks to answering as fully as I can the legitimate concerns and doubts expressed by some Deputies.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies queried the decision regarding intervention.  Some Deputies went so far as to say that intervention would no longer be available for beef and that we would have to dump our products within a few years.  That is inaccurate.  Intervention will remain at 750,000 tonnes for next year and will fall over five years to 350,000 tonnes.  In addition, the safety net mechanism will be maintained throughout the period as a back-up measure to normal intervention. Any product sold into intervention under the safety net mechanism will not contribute towards the normal intervention ceiling.  In other words, there will be a gradual reduction in intervention for beef.  The limit of 350,000 tonnes is in excess of what the Council of Ministers agreed only three years before the BSE scare and the Gulf War.  Therefore, there will be considerable intervention available. I was glad to hear Deputy Deasy, and others, say that our meat plants and factories should sell the beef they process to consumers and not put it into cold stores to be disposed of and dumped subsequently at an enormous cost to both consumers and producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the milk sector, there is no restriction on access to intervention contained in the Common Agricultural Policy reform.  With regard to GATT, negotiations will have to take place because the GATT round is still in existence and will probably only be finalised in serious negotiation next year.  There is no question of side-stepping GATT.  I am satisfied that the Community will be able <Col N="916" /> to hold its own in any forthcoming negotiations on GATT and that the compensatory arrangements will not be affected in the GATT round.  Last week's agreement will considerably strengthen our negotiating position in relation to GATT.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the points made by Deputy Deasy in relation to the need for improvements in research and development.  Such improvements are necessary and I accept totally the points made by the Deputy in this regard.  The future of the agriculture and food industries depends on our ability to be as good as our competitors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris, and others, raised the question of the benefits to consumers.  As far as I can recall, no spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture and Food highlighted this point to any great extent, but I know a number of independent economists have put figures on it.  I do not go shopping very often but I occasionally visit Schull, Ballydehob, Bantry, Dunmanway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, and it provides a very friendly service.  I am anxious to ensure that the benefits due to consumers will be reflected in cheaper prices for their shopping baskets every week.  I am meeting my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy O'Rourke on Friday to put in place a system which will ensure cheaper prices for the consumers, farmers as well as urban dwellers.  What is involved here is a reorientation of support, not the elimination of support and I am very pleased about that.  The reality is that we have gained substantial benefit from our membership of the European Community, particularly in agriculture. The bulk of that support was directed towards intervention, storage and disposal. There is now reorientation with <Col N="917" /> regard to farmers and producers which should facilitate a better industry.  It will be more beneficial to employment, particularly in the case of seasonal jobs in factories which opened for intervention kill at the later end of the year. It will also ensure more permanent jobs. Sometimes what we are pushed to do, we do extremely well, and I hope that will be so in this case.</P>
      <P>In relation to accompanying measures which affect young people, I was very pleased to hear Matt O'Keeffe, president of Macra na Feirme, who represent young farmers, welcome these measures. A 75 per cent funded early retirement scheme will be available and this will enable younger farmers to take over the land.  I know that in the past early retirement schemes did not work.  That is why we went to so much trouble to ensure that various benefits would be built into this scheme.  I will conclude by thanking the Deputies who made an extremely constructive contribution to this debate throughout the day.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Safety of Irish Troops in Lebanon.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important issue on the Adjournment.  From listening to the news this evening it appears that this debate is opportune, relating to a matter that is a cause of concern in this country.  The serious incident which occurred last Monday when two Israeli gunships attacked with rocket fire a house adjacent to a United Nations checkpoint manned by Irish troops must be condemned by this House as completely unacceptable and unwarranted. While acknowledging the pin-point accuracy of this type of missile fire, it must be clearly stated that where Irish troops are carrying out United Nations duties this activity must cease.  For some considerable time Lebanon has been a troubled spot.  There is now a build-up of troops from both the Israeli and Hezbollah sides and it is feared that this could <Col N="918" /> become a major flash point in the Middle East.  While obvious moves are being made by international powers to try to defuse the situation it must be the concern of this Government to safeguard the lives of Irish troops in Lebanon.</P>
      <P>In the recent Estimate debate well deserved tributes were paid to our Irish soldiers who served with distinction over many years and in many parts of the world in the service of the United Nations.  They have been renowned for their handling of delicate and sensitive issues and have a reputation for their restraint, despite extreme provocation at times.  The ultimate sacrifice has been made by the Irish Army in their peace-keeping role with the United Nations. Irish personnel know that they are going into a trouble spot which has its dangers but I wish to spell out to this House where these dangers can and must be avoided. I do not think it is beyond the ability of the Israeli military command to warn UN personnel that an attack is imminent.  We know that modern warfare and technology can, with uncanny accuracy, hit a particular target.  It is also a fact that hundreds of casualties resulted from so-called friendly fire in the Gulf War.  Many of us remember the horrible sight of body bags coming back to Britain and the United States.  I do not wish to see bodies returned to this country, with sympathy from either the Israelis or Hezbollah people, because of mistaken identity or human error.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of serious concern that Irish troops are once again in the firing line.  I would request the Minister to call in the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors and outline to them the restraints that are necessary to safeguard the lives of Irish people carrying out their peace-keeping role in Lebanon.  I know the Minister has made strong protests to the various factions involved.  However, much more needs to be done.  This Government should take urgent action to safeguard Irish lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern at the situation in Lebanon in which Irish troops <Col N="919" /> serving with UNIFIL have been endangered as a result of attacks by the Israeli Defence Forces on positions within the Irish area of operations.</P>
      <P>Approximately 750 Irish personnel are serving with UNIFIL.  The UN force occupy a buffer zone along Lebanon's southern border with Israel.  However, contrary to the UN mandate, Israel has not withdrawn completely from Lebanon, maintaining a self-declared security zone within the area which should be occupied exclusively by UN forces. Within this Israeli zone, armed compounds manned mainly by a locally recruited militia force are on occasion attacked by local armed elements leading to Israeli-militia retaliation which is often indiscriminate.</P>
      <P>In recent days Israeli aircraft have struck at a number of targets alleged to be Hezbóllah positions.  On Monday, 25 May, in the course of these operations Israeli helicopters fired two precision guided air to surface missiles at a house located 60 metres from a position occupied by Irish UN personnel.</P>
      <P>On being informed of the attack I immediately requested the Department of Foreign Affairs to convey forthwith the Government's serious concern over the incident to the Israeli authorities.  The protest was made by telephone to a senior official at the Israeli embassy.  It was emphasised that such activities are completely unacceptable to the Irish Government. It was pointed out that two air to surface missiles had been fired from a height of 1,000 metres at a house adjacent to a clearly marked Irish UNIFIL checkpoint and that it was fortunate that no Irish UNIFIL personnel had been killed or injured in what was a potentially life-threatening and irresponsible action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's concern at the build-up of tension in the Irish area of operations in recent days was also stressed. There was an appeal for restraint by all sides and for a restoration of calm in the area.  Israeli authorities were requested to avoid any recurrence of incidents that imperilled the safety of Irish UNIFIL personnel and were urged to cooperate <Col N="920" /> with UNIFIL.  The Israeli official undertook to convey our concerns to his authorities without delay and to advise us of any response they may have.  No response has yet been received.</P>
    <P>The general position in the Irish UNIFIL area of operations remains calm.  The UN Secretary-General has issued a statement expressing deep concern at the recent escalation of violence in the Middle East, in which Israelis, Lebanese and Palestinians have been killed and injured.  The Secretary-General said that he believed that a continuation of hostilities could only heighten tensions in the region, and might even jeopardise the efforts that are presently under way to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.  He urged all sides to exercise maximum restraint so that the momentum achieved thus far in the peace process might be sustained.</P>
    <P>All incidents involving the death or injury of Irish UNIFIL personnel have been the subject of protest by the UNIFIL authorities to the Israeli Defence Forces.  Protests at Government and diplomatic level have also been made as necessary to the Israeli authorities.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the safety of Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL is kept under constant review.  Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. This is very important.  All developments affecting the safety of Irish personnel serving in UNIFIL are closely monitored and security procedures are continually reviewed.  Personnel are issued with a modern range of weapons and equipment and operational procedures in Lebanon are geared to provide maximum safety for our troops, consistent with the carrying out of their mission. Irish positions are defensively fortified and bunker facilities are provided for all personnel.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure the greatest possible protection for our troops on overseas service.  Reports by the media of a build-up of troops in certain areas <Col N="921" /> are not true.  We have no evidence of that as of now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will explain to the House why the Mountjoy Prison report found its way into the newspapers this morning before Deputies had seen it or before it had been placed in the Library of this House.  I raised this issue with you, Sir, but, of course, it is not your responsibility.</P>
      <P>This report could best be described as a damning indictment of our prison service.  It costs £660 per week to keep someone sentenced and convicted of an offence in our prisons.  It seems, from this report, that there are still huge ongoing problems within our prison service and, in particular, within Mountjoy Prison. There is no time this evening to go through the entire report but some of the points raised in it are worth repeating.</P>
      <P>The report states that Mountjoy Prison is grossly overcrowded, that prisoners find themselves in multiple cells contrary to prison rules and that on occasions there are no beds available.  It refers to the serious riots during the year which were caused primarily by boredom, frustration and overcrowding, and refers to urgent steps being necessary from the Government to forthwith transform the prison system into a dignified rehabilitative centre.  It should be noted that the riots which took place last September have cost this State in the region of £2 million.  The report states that there is a rising prison population and that there is need for a fully equipped and trained staff providing an imaginative rehabilitative programme.  It notes that the vast majority of prisoners never work while in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If prison is to serve a purpose, the purpose must be twofold.  The first is deterrent and the second is rehabilitative. This report confirms that those kept in prison are more likely to receive a postgraduate degree in crime and to go on to commit more crimes than to be rehabilitated. For £660 per week per prisoner <Col N="922" /> this State is getting very poor value from its prison service.  Those people who are sentenced to imprisonment are released back into the community with the inevitability of committing further crimes and so adding to the crisis in crime that we now have, with a 16 per cent increase in the number of crimes committed within this State within the last two years &mdash; an enormous increase over a two-year period.</P>
    <P>The report says that the bulk of prisoners never get detailed or proper assessment or any proper training and that those prisoners who are in prison for drug abuse do not have available to them adequate medical services.  An extraordinary element in this report is the statement that owing to administrative problems between the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, the establishment of a drugs clinic which has long since been promised has not yet happened.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that the temporary release programme with which I agree in so far as it is useful, should not be used simply to ease pressure on prison space and should only be awarded to those who have earned it.  I agree entirely with that sentiment.</P>
    <P>This report indicates that within our prison service, and within Mountjoy Prison, we are in for a long hot summer. This report and the Minister's inadequate response to the problems in Mountjoy Prison mean that we will have ongoing problems within the Prison Service.  The Minister's response, as reported in today's papers, is that his Department are examining the criminal justice system and the Prison Service and that a report will be published on prison policy.  We need more than a report.  We need adequate custodial facilities.  Rehabilitative and education programmes need to be put in place and we need an explanation why the majority of prisoners in Mountjoy Prison never do any work or get any training to give them necessary skills for use when they return to the community, that afford them the opportunity for leading a life without returning to crime.  We must provide within the <Col N="923" /> criminal justice system a prison service that works and that acts as a real deterrent and as a rehabilitative institution.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison fails on all these counts and it is quite clear from the report of the visiting committee that they have grave concerns about the facilities and conditions in Mountjoy and the training available there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to deal with the procedural matter that was referred to by Deputy Shatter earlier this morning.  The Deputy complained, on the Order of Business this morning, that I had neglected a statutory obligation to lay the report by the visiting committee before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under the Prisons Visiting Committees Act, 1925, the visiting committees are obliged to report to me as Minister and not to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Under section 3 (4) of the Act every report made by a visiting committee to the Minister should be made public.  It was in this context that I released the 1991 report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee yesterday.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the general Prisons of Ireland Act, 1877, the annual report of all prisons and places of detention is laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a different report which deals comprehensively with all the 12 prisons and places of detention and, in accordance with normal practice, would include reports by the visiting committees attached to the various institutions.  As a matter of courtesy, I arranged that the Library in the Dáil be furnished with copies of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to the substance of the matter at hand, I welcome the visiting committee's report.  The report is a valuable contribution to the whole process of developing a new strategy for the prison service.  I believe I am the first Minister who has taken a personal interest in this for quite some time.  A major policy document is currently being prepared and the document will update the aims and objectives of the prison system, <Col N="924" /> decide on a set of priorities and set out the strategy to achieve them.  There is no doubt that the system requires a new sense of purpose and direction.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to tinker with individual problems in a vacuum.  I am preparing the groundwork for a planned and coordinated approach to getting it right on prison reform.  It will not happen overnight. We are talking about developing a considered policy to improve the conditions which prisoners and, indeed, prison officers, have to contend with.</P>
    <P>Turning to some of the specific issues raised on the visit by the visiting committee, I visited Mountjoy Prison recently and saw at first hand the difficulties under which that prison operates. In my address to the annual conference of the Prison Officers Association on 30 April 1992 I spoke of the poor physical conditions, the inadequate infrastructure and the ad hoc facilities there.  It is my intention to improve the facilities throughout the Prison Service. Mountjoy is one of the oldest of the prisons and, of course, being the only committal prison for adults in the Dublin area, it is the busiest.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to record the work which has been undertaken to improve the physical conditions for offenders in Mountjoy over the past couple of years, and it is as well to put it on the record.  A new electrical system which includes a cell call system, smoke detection and smoke control ventilation has been installed.  A new unit to cater for the special needs of about 60 offenders suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV AIDS, is nearing completion and will be in operation before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Work on the refurbishment of the women's prison is progressing very well and will be completed later on this year. The refurbishment work provides for sanitation facilities in each cell and I regard this as a particularly significant development.  While this work is in progress, the female offenders are being accommodated temporarily in the newly refurbished D Wing of St.  Patrick's Institution. Other significant features will <Col N="925" /> have to be tackled over the coming years. The existing dilapidated kitchen will be replaced by a modern, purpose-built kitchen. This will be tendered for very shortly.  A refurbishment programme will include the provision of in-cell sanitation, and other modern facilities.  I regard that as a top priority.  There will be new workshops where offenders can be provided with the opportunity to acquire a skill to help their rehabilitation into the community on their release.  Deputy Shatter is particularly interested in that element; so am I.  There will be improved visiting facilities, improved recreation and exercise facilities for offenders and improved facilities for the staff.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee referred to the health of prisoners and ensuring proper medical care.  On the recommendation of the director of prison medical services, additional moneys are being provided this year to augment the standard of medical care.  The additional provision will enable general medical and psychiatric care facilities, including clinical arrangements, to be improved.  The number of psychologists for the prison system will be increased from three to six in the immediate future.  Recruitment of the additional psychologists will commence shortly.  The question of the need for further additional psychologists will be kept under constant review by me.</P>
    <P>The lack of training for custodial officers has been commented on by the visiting committee.  A committee comprising departmental and prison service staff has examined the range of training which is required to be undertaken and has prioritised a training scheme, having regard to both needs and the financial resources available.  However, a major problem in providing training is the overtime cost of replacing staff who are on training courses.  The funds available to my Department for overtime working are limited.  Within the available resources every effort will be made to provide development training on the lines recommended by the committee.  For instance, I am arranging with the help of the Samaritans that a two-day training course in suicide awareness be set up in July of this <Col N="926" /> year.  This will cover the way a prison officer would relate to a distressed prisoner, the importance of active listening, being non-judgmental and non-directive, the stigma of suicide, bereavement, depression, sexuality and young people at risk.  Role plays and dynamic communications will be used to make the skills gained by staff as practicable and as applicable as possible.  This type of course is being incorporated into the induction training for new recruits as and from next month.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee expressed their concern about over-crowding in Mountjoy Prison.  I am convinced that imprisonment should be used as a last resort and that alternatives to custody should be applied wherever possible.  At present there are more than 3,200 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service.  That is about one-and-a-half times the number of persons who are actually in custody.  A new system of intensive supervision was introduced last March which provides for the close monitoring and supervision of offenders in the community by the Probation and Welfare Service.  The scheme, when fully operational, will accommodate up to 200 offenders.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on these matters this evening. Obviously, in the course of my reply I have only been able to deal with a few of the items mentioned in the visiting committee's report.  Every effort is being made to improve conditions in Mountjoy Prison.  Many of the prisoners accommodated there will see some of those improvements.  I intend to pursue a planned strategy for the achievement of stated objectives.  This will be a matter of the highest priority for the Department. I have indicated a personal interest in this matter.  I am interested in improving our penal and custodial system.  It is perhaps the first initiative that has been taken in that area for quite some time and some good work is being done.  More needs to be done and I am giving my time, effort and energy to it.</P>

      <P>The decision by Aer Rianta to grant a licence to First Rate Bureau de Change, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank of Ireland, to issue tourist VAT refunds via bank outlets at airports effectively assists them to create a dominant position in the marketplace, to the detriment of the tourist industry and employment in areas such as Killorglin, County Kerry, and Spiddal, County Galway.  It is unacceptable that a semi-State body should assist a large competitor in the marketplace of financial services to create such a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of recent developments in the provision of financial services at Irish airports whereby Aer Rianta have in fact now granted a licence to First Rate Bureau de Change to issue these VAT refunds?  The Bank of Ireland are a totally new entrant into this market, which is already being well serviced by two small established Irish companies.  The Minister will be aware that Aer Rianta allege that the decision to introduce an additional supplier of this service has been taken in the interests of creating competition.  Would the Minister agree that this reason rings hollow in the light of Aer Rianta's long-standing and on-going policy to grant the Bank of Ireland a total monopoly in the supply of financial services at Irish airports?  It is an extraordinary situation and it is an extraordinary reason for Aer Rianta to give when they clearly operate against the same spirit of competition themselves in relation to the supply of banking services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bank of Ireland are currently canvassing the retail customers of the existing suppliers of this service.  From information contained in their sales literature they intend to gain a substantial share of this mature market, which has little prospect of any further growth, through a system of kick-back payments to retailers, funded directly from the tourists' pocket as a result &mdash; let me say this very bluntly &mdash; of predatory pricing. To prove this latter point I would ask the Minister to bear with me while I quote <Col N="928" /> directly from the sales literature of this Bank of Ireland wholly-owned subsidiary: &ldquo;A retailer with 5,000 vouchers receives a payment of £3,075&rdquo;&mdash; it says in ringing tones.  It concludes: &ldquo;What it all adds up to is an absolutely first rate opportunity for you to make more money from tax free shopping in your retail outlet.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely the purpose of the VAT refund scheme was to benefit tourists and not to create profits for Aer Rianta and the Bank of Ireland.  It goes against the entire spirit of the scheme and it is particularly sad that a semi-State company should be involved in such activities and sadder perhaps still that it should have the complicity of one of the largest commercial banks, to the detriment of smaller companies already involved in this service. Is it not difficult to create employment then?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to visit the processing centre of one of the companies currently processing VAT refunds located in Spiddal, County Galway, in Minister Geoghegan-Quinn's constituency.  I would prevail on her, and the Minister of State, to do so as quickly as possible because if the Bank of Ireland and Aer Rianta are permitted to exploit their monopoly position, then a large number, if not all, of the jobs of the 20-plus people employed there will disappear before this summer is over.  Similar jobs in Killorglin, County Kerry, in my constituency, will also be put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Bank of Ireland awarded a prize for business idea of the year to that same company in Spiddal for their innovative proposals in the VAT refund area.  As bankers they assisted and supported the company in the development of its scheme.  When I say as bankers, I mean as bankers to the company and thereby they were privy to much confidential information.  Yet this is the same company that the bank have now targeted for annihilation by their proposed link-up with Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, and the Minister of State, to take action now to ensure that Aer Rianta, as a State body under the Minister's control, do not lend their suppose <Col N="929" /> port to this most undesirable development in the country's vital tourist business. Monopolies in dominant positions represent the greatest disincentive to competition and the most serious obstacle to employment creation.  It is against the spirit of the Treaty of Rome and must be addressed now if smaller companies are not to be swallowed up by large corporations in monopoly positions which are to the detriment of everybody in society, not least the weaker sections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reasons Deputy O'Donoghue raised this matter and I understand his concerns. The present position is that there is one company, Cashback Limited, arranging VAT refunds at Dublin and Shannon airports. Cashback Limited is a merger between Cashback Limited, Spiddal and the Foreign Exchange.  The company's concession expires on 28 February 1993. In the interests of airport users and in order to promote competition, Aer Rianta decided to allow two VAT refund operators at Dublin and Shannon airports in future.  Following public advertisement, the company decided to award the second VAT refund facility to First Rate Bureau de Change Limited, a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland Limited. First Rate's licence, which will be granted shortly, will expire on 28 February 1993. Operational facilities at the airports would not make it practicable to allow more than two VAT refund agencies.</P>
      <P>Before the licence arrangements expire at the end of February 1993, Aer Rianta will review the effectiveness of the arrangements. Under whatever new arrangements are decided from 1 April 1993, exclusivity for VAT refunds would not be given to any one company and there is no risk of a dominant position emerging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the present VAT refund arrangements at Dublin and Shannon airports are satisfactory, and meet the <Col N="930" /> interests of users of the airports.  An element of competition between VAT refund agencies at the airports is in my view very desirable and should be encouraged.  This will be retained in the arrangements which will apply from 1 April 1993.  The Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications cannot interfere in the commercial decisions taken by Aer Rianta in this or other matters and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The five western counties are receiving a mere £9.5 million in funding for the national primary roads in the region in 1992.  This is against £52.8 million spent in just two eastern counties, Kildare and Dublin.  If you look at the breakdown you will see that Kildare gets £33.7 million and Dublin is to get £19.1 million.  By contrast, Mayo will get £3 million this year, Galway £2 million, Roscommon £1 million, Leitrim £1 million and Sligo £2.3 million to improve the entire national road system in the Connacht region.  A sum of £9 million would not put a decent by-pass around a provincial town.  The trend over the past four years has got progressively worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not in any way begrudge eastern counties getting their due share of the EC cake but I would make the point that roads and infrastructure are vital.  They are the lifeline to survival.  If you deprive an area of vital infrastructure then effectively you strangle it to death.  Surely to God it does not make much sense to spend £50 million on a by-pass around Dublin which shortens my journey by five minutes and invites in thousands of additional cars each day to an already strangled city when tonight this House rejected a proposal to introduce a light rail system which would relieve traffic conjestion and, indeed, three to four weeks ago rejected a rail system which would make a cost efficient, clean transport system available to this city.  I urge the Minister, in the allocation of national <Col N="931" /> primary and national secondary road funding from now, to look for a more equitable and more sensible distribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the £9.553 million allocations for national primary roads notified to county councils in Connacht this year represent a fair distribution of available funds having regard to the maintenance needs of these routes and the priority of national primary improvement projects in their areas.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the function of the network of national primary roads, which is to provide major long distance through routes linking the principal ports and airports, cities and large towns, the Connacht region will also benefit directly from investments being made outside the region in the current year on projects at Leixlip-Maynooth-Kilcock, Mullingar and in the Athlone-Moate area.  These amount to more than £17 million.</P>
      <P>I know it is very often the case here, a Cheann Comhairle, that Deputies want to be parochial but as a small economy, exporting 80 per cent of what we produce, Deputy Higgins has a vested interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two-minute statement from Deputy Kavanagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The public relations officer of Dublin Corporation in an article in tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> suggested that they should bottle Liffey water and export it to France and make hundreds of thousands of pounds for Dublin Corporation.  If he had read this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> he may not have rushed in to make that statement because he would have noted that the EC are accusing the Government in regard to laws to protect the environment.  The article stated that Ireland was failing to implement key European Community laws on water quality and was dragging its feet on the implementation of other legislation on the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It went on to say that the Commission said that a significant number of water supplies do not meet EC minimum standards on drinking water quality, while the investigation of several complaints suggest that the bathing water Directive is not applied to enough waters here. Further on, it suggests that the Commission has identified serious flaws in relation to the laws relating to toxic waste, water, household waste, the protection of wild bird life and had opened legal proceedings against Dublin on all these areas.  A further concern is the statement that the Government sources <Col N="933" /> admitted that there had been correspondence between the Commission and Dublin on a number of these issues, such as large combustion plants, shellfish water and ground water.</P>
    <P>My concern is that while we seem to have adopted 91 of the 97 Directives on the environment, the Commission are charging that where Directives were adopted many of them have been defective or inadequate in their application into law.  In that situation we may have adopted laws that are not meeting the required European Community standards. I hope the Minister can allay our fears in this area because a serious charge has been made which requires immediate retraction, if that is the case, by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to tell the House that successive Governments have ensured a very good record for Ireland in the transposition and enforcement of EC environmental legislation.</P>
      <P>Since the Environment became an active part of the EC agenda some 20 years ago, some 86 &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; environmental instruments &mdash; mainly Directives, have been adopted by the Environmental Council and are in force. Ireland has notified implementation measures to the Commission in relation to 75 of these Directives; in other words, we have fully transposed nearly 90 per cent of the provisions involved.  This is a wholly creditable record, and one which stands comparison with other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A real test of a country's performance in this area is the extent to which the Commission legal services, who are very active in this matter, have actually taken legal proceedings for non-transposition of environmental measures.  At present there are only three &ldquo;live&rdquo; EC Commission reasoned opinions in relation to Ireland's performance: two of these concern matters &mdash; emissions from large combustion plant and control of waste <Col N="934" /> oils &mdash; on which draft regulations have been virtually completed in my Department and should be made shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is technically a case against Ireland in the European Court regarding the birds Directive.  In practice, the Commission is not actively pursuing this because it has been negotiating with Office of Public Works on an agreed solution. A press report of today gives a highly misleading impression of Ireland's standing as regards implementation of these environmental measures.</P>
    <P>It purports to represent as a new finding the fact that some Irish water supplies do not comply with stringent EC drinking water quality standards.  All EC member states have problems in this area, and in Ireland's case the environment action programme anounced a £300 million programme to remedy the deficiencies involved within the present decade; this is being actively implemented.  At the same time, we have taken the initiative of publishing a full national report on drinking water quality which will be revised annually.  This report, which was published late in 1991, contains a full analysis of the condition of all main drinking water supplied, including deficiencies where these exist.</P>
    <P>While in no way detracting from the importance of EC environmental legislation, the draft EC Fifth Environmental Action Programme stresses the need to broaden the range of instruments used to implement environment policy away from narrowly defined legal measures. Community strategy will increasingly focus on the quality of enforcement-implementation networks within member states, on the basis more of management than of legal principles.  I welcome this approach and at the same time I am confident that the new Environmental Protection Agency will work to strengthen Ireland's performance and profile in this area.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two minute statement from <Col N="935" /> Deputy Nora Owen addressed to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle,.  In the 1985 policy document of the Fianna Fáil Government for the local government elections, the big boast was that Fianna Fáil would continue to be the builder's friend, would continue to build houses for the people in need. Now the big plank of Fianna Fáil policy and this present Government seems to be the line that there is now no more need to build housing estates in Dublin city or county because that is not the way they want to go forward.</P>
      <P>The policy of the present Government and the previous Government has led to the existence of lists of over 2,000 families and persons in Dublin County Council area.  In 1989 the list was 941 but since 1989 it has grown to over 2,000 families. These are not just statistics but real people living in dire circumstances which are leading to an increase in marriage breakdowns, incest, health costs, wife battering and numerous other problems that exist because of overcrowded and bad living conditions.  It is all very well for the Government to say that they do not want large housing estates, but is a budget of £1.9 million to build 55 houses with lists of that size in County Dublin an adequate response to the needs of Dublin County Council?  It is less than £1,000 for each person on the housing list.  Combined with the ordinary priority list Dublin County Council had to deal in 1991 with 119 families made homeless for all sorts of reasons, including family violence, barring orders, leaving institutional care, family separation, eviction, county council repossession and family accommodation withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real facts of what is happening out there is evidenced by Dublin County Council housing lists.  It cannot be ignored further.  It is not a sufficient answer to say that the social housing policy is the answer.  It is only an element <Col N="936" /> of the answer and I appeal to the Minister to look again at the capital allocation grant to Dublin County Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital available for the Public Capital Programme this year for the local authority housing programme has been fully allocated and it is not possible therefore to increase the allocation to Dublin County Council or indeed any other local authority.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation notified to Dublin County Council on 26 February last for their 1992 housing construction programme amounts to almost £2 million. This provides for expenditure this year on houses in progress at 31 December last and for the commencement of 127 new house starts in 1992, 72 of which were authorised to start in 1991 but did not do so and a further 55 new starts authorised in 1992.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, cognisance must be taken of the casual vacancies arising in the council's existing housing stock and the various initiatives available for social housing under <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i>.  It is a matter for the council to utilise the new measures to the greatest extent possible to meet the housing needs of their area.  It is estimated that all these measures in 1992 will cater for the accommodation needs of over 500 families.  I consider that this is a reasonable response to the housing needs in the county.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently discussed their housing programme with a deputation from Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise, as Deputy Owen has said, that there is still a great number of families in need of housing.  I will be anxiously awaiting the council's reply to a number of issues that were raised at that meeting and I will be going to the limits of my capacity in relation to any available resources in the context of the Estimates to make sure that we continue to programme an enlightened and <Col N="937" /> development programme for Dublin county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>For more than ten years I, and other public representatives, have been campaigning for a decent and adequate health centre for Swords which is a town with a population of nearly 25,000.  If one compares Swords to a town with a smaller population outside Dublin such as Sligo, for example, one will see magnificant services and facilities in that town of 17,000.  A high percentage of the population in Swords are in first time homes and starting families.  On the other side there are many older people living in the town.</P>
      <P>I want to pay tribute to the fine work of the staff in the health centre in Swords. There are about five nurses there, speech therapists, dentists, a dental nurse and other staff who, against all the odds, are providing a service.  The present centre is located in a very old house on the main street.  There is also a nurse's cottage on Rathbeale Road for clerical work and where the speech therapist works.  The old house was partially improved last year at a cost of about £25,000.  The waiting room now holds ten to 12 mothers and children &mdash; one can imagine what it did hold &mdash; provided they leave the buggies and prams out in the hall or on the street in the rain.  On immunisation day as many as 40 mothers can arrive with babes in arms, and small toddlers. The lucky 12 will sit in the waiting room while the remainder queue in the hall or outside minding two or three toddlers mixed in with prams and buggies.</P>
      <P>The dedication and resilience of the staff is to be marvelled at.  An outside old fashioned toilet with a wash hand basin only installed last year is the facility available at the moment.  There is a toilet in the doctor's room but as there is constantly a clinic going on no access to this is available to staff or clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An old shed in the backyard has been renovated to serve as the only storage space available.  There is no such thing as <Col N="938" /> a staff room or coffee facilities for the staff.  There is no clerk or porter &mdash; the nurses do all that work.</P>
    <P>Twenty eight clinics a month are held, including a new clinic which is located in a community centre in River Valley.  This is to be welcomed but it is not adequate.</P>
    <P>There is a site available which is owned by the health board.  Could there be action got on that, perhaps?  I do not want to be told here tonight that yet another committee has been set up to investigate the position.  We know what is required and the Minister should know, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the very substantial growth in the population in the Swords area over the past number of years has placed considerable strain on the existing community health facilities which were being provided in a disjointed manner at different and often unsuitable locations throughout the area.</P>
      <P>In view of the condition of the existing health centre, and as an interim measure, the Eastern Health Board have recently improved matters somewhat in the provision of a second dental surgery, redecoration and an improvement of the central heating and toilet facilities.  The good news is that on 22 May 1992 I approved the immediate establishment of a formal project team which will include representatives of the health board for service and administration together with officials from my Department.  The project team will determine the type of service to be provided in the area and will, of course, be happy to consider any submissions received from interest groups.  I am hopeful that the project team will have completed their deliberations before the end of the year.  Following this a design team will be appointed and on completion of their work the project will go to tender.</P>

I understand <Col N="940" /> that for five years requests were being made for this facility.  When I heard the case last week I decided the project should go ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with Questions Nos. 16, 17, 31, 41, 49, 96 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that £91 million in outstanding taxes was collected by sheriffs in 1991. The figures for previous years are: 1990, £74 million; 1989, £79 million; 1988, £100 million; 1987, £49 million; 1986, £30 million.</P>
      <P>In addition an estimated £100 million was paid direct to the Revenue Commissioners in 1991 after initial action by the Sheriffs.  The direct impact of their operations in 1991 will therefore be the collection of at least £190 million and the indirect effects, though unquantifiable, are likely to be substantially greater.  The actual liability is settled in over 70% of the cases referred to the Sheriffs.</P>
      <P>There are at present 84,000 warrants in the hands of the Sheriffs awaiting collection. The estimated face value of these is £263 million.  However, in many instances the amounts are estimated because of non-response by the taxpayer and, in practice, the estimates will be displaced by actual liabilities of lesser amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>£14.92 million was held on deposit by the Sheriffs at 31 December 1991 which <Col N="665" /> represents about 16% of the amount paid annually to the Sheriffs.  I have no information as to how much of this was held in interest bearing deposit accounts nor how much interest was earned on such accounts.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1986 collection of outstanding taxes was done by the Sheriffs in Dublin and Cork.  Elsewhere it was done by the County Registrars.  In practice, the salaried County Registrars were ineffective because of the burden of their other official duties.  Between 1986 and 1987 new Sheriffs were appointed in the areas outside Dublin and Cork with the exclusive function of collecting outstanding taxes and interest.</P>
    <P>The Sheriffs are officers of the Courts who carry out debt collection work on a professional basis.  The Revenue Commissioners are their clients and in the case of the Dublin and Cork Sheriffs, share access to their services with others. The remuneration of Sheriffs is governed by the Sheriffs Fees Orders 1926 to 1963 under which a Sheriff is entitled to 35p in respect of every certificate lodged with him and poundage of 5% on the first £100 plus 2.5% on the balance collected. Expenses for travel and seizure are payable in certain circumstances.  The fees, expenses and poundage are payable by the defaulting taxpayer.  As is the norm in financial transactions between solicitor and client they have at all times been permitted to retain interest on short term deposits.  In effect, this interest has been a major source of their income.  The operation would have become non-viable had they not been permitted to supplement their income with such interest to defray the substantial costs they incur.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners lay down guidelines concerning the transmission of money collected and the vast bulk of the money is transmitted within the time limits laid down in these guidelines.  Due to the overwhelming response to the 1988 Tax Amnesty it was not possible to immediately implement more detailed reporting arrangements which were developed with the co-operation of the Sheriffs in 1988.  Implementation of the revised guidelines commenced in 1989.  It <Col N="666" /> took some time for all the Sheriffs to set up the computer systems needed to implement the guidelines in full and for the Revenue Commissioners to set up the appropriate monitoring arrangements. Consequently, a number of Sheriffs breached the guidelines in 1990.  However, the number of breaches of the guildelines reduced considerably in the latter half of 1990 and the situation improved even further in the course of 1991.  Detailed statistics are not available of all instances in which money was not transmitted to the Revenue Commissioners as specified in the guidelines, in the month following that in which the Sheriff received full payment of the amount due.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, however, that the amounts involved in these circumstances are not significant in the context of the overall amounts collected, both directly and indirectly, by the Sheriffs.  There is no statutory basis for re-claiming from Sheriffs the interest earned on money held on deposit outside the terms of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>My Department has recognised for some time past that the traditional practice whereby Sheriffs retain the interest earned on money collected pending payment to the Revenue Commissioners was not satisfactory.  A review of the statutory fees is in progress and I will be making recommendations to the Minister for Justice shortly for revised scales of fees. Once these fees have been improved to a realistic level, Sheriffs will no longer be permitted to retain interest on amounts held pending transmission to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the defects of the current system of remuneration, Sheriff action is, from the point of view of the Exchequer, the quickest and cheapest of the options available for the collection of outstanding taxes and is therefore a very important part of the tax collection process.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the decision by four State-sponsored bodies to open an account in a bank in Jersey to facilitate tax-free payments to employees and consultants working abroad; if his approval was sought and given for this move; if he will outline his views on the purpose for which the account was opened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the fact that International Development Ireland Ltd.  (IDI) operate an account in a bank in Jersey.  IDI is jointly owned by four State-sponsored bodies, the Industrial Development Authority, An Bord Tráchtála, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the Industrial Credit Corporation, and was set up to promote, on a commercial basis, overseas consultancy activities by the four bodies.</P>
      <P>The Jersey account was opened by IDI in 1989.  The approval of the Minister for Finance was not sought for the opening of the account, nor was it necessary to seek it.  Central Bank approval was obtained.  The Revenue Commissioners were notified of the Company's intention to set up the account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question seems to refer to Irish residents going to work on consultancy assignments abroad for IDI. Briefly, if the period of employment abroad covers a period including a full tax year, the individual is considered non-resident in Ireland for the period and no liability to Irish tax will arise on the salary or fee earned abroad.  On the other hand, where an individual is working abroad in a country other than the UK on a short term contract for less than a full tax year and is paid from a foreign pay point, liability to Irish tax is in practice confined, under Section 76 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to amounts remitted to Ireland.  An individual liable to Irish tax on such remitted amounts is obliged to declare these amounts to the Revenue Commissioners and pay tax on them in accordance with the self-assessment system.  I am informed that the purpose <Col N="668" /> for which the IDI account was opened was to establish a valid foreign pay point so as to bring such payments through it within the scope of Section 76 (4) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The account is also used to pay non-resident consultants and companies, and to receive some of IDI's overseas receipts.</P>

In addition, interest totalling £0.7 million accrued to the Exchequer on various bank accounts through which the funds received from purchasers of the shares were processed.  The costs, including VAT, borne by my Department in connection with the sale and the restructuring of the company amounted to £7.4 million.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill 1992, which was recently passed by the Dáil and Seanad, provides in section 15 for disability benefit (including occupational injury benefit) and unemployment benefit, and any associated pay-related benefit, to be treated as income for tax purposes.  The yield from this measure is estimated to be up to £20 million as regards disability benefit and of the order of £12 million as regards unemployment benefit.  Both these figures are in full-year terms and are based on the 1992-93 income tax structure: the Government's objective is for further tax reform involving rate reduction, extension of the standard rate-band and increasing the basic personal allowances, and implementation of these objectives would reduce these estimated yield figures somewhat.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides for the making of a commencement order or orders to bring taxation into effect.  I indicated in the budget that for operational reasons bringing disability benefit into charge to tax would not be possible from 6 April, and would have to be deferred until later in 1992, while unemployment benefit would not be brought into charge until 1993.  The operational requirements for taxing both benefits are still being examined. I can, however, indicate the lines on which consideration has been proceeding as regards taxation of disability benefit.</P>
      <P>Taxing disability benefit presents substantial practical problems, because of the potential interaction between employers, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and large numbers of benefit claimants.  My aim is to keep this interaction to a minimum, so as to avoid imposing excessive administrative burdens on those involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed the House during my opening address on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, the essence of the solution <Col N="673" /> being considered by my Department, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners would involve potential claimants' tax-free allowance amounts being notified by Revenue to the Department of Social Welfare.  The weekly rate of tax-free allowance would be used by that Department when making disability benefit payments, with any excess of the payment over the tax-free allowance being subjected by that Department to tax in the normal way at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate.  Where the tax-free allowance exceeded the benefit payment, the intention would be that the excess would be available to the employer for use against any occupational sick pay payments to the employee.  The net effect would be that claimants would have their benefit taken into account in determining their income for tax purposes, and tax as appropriate would be charged accordingly.</P>
    <P>Taxation under this system, and indeed taxation of longer-term disability benefit and disability benefit paid to claimants without an employer, cannot be introduced until 1993.  However, it may be possible to introduce some limited form of taxation of disability benefit for those in employment later this year, by having employers reduce the tax-free allowance of benefit claimants in employment by the amount of the disability benefit being paid to them by the Department of Social Welfare.  The net effect of this would be to curtail availability of tax refunds to employees who are claiming disability benefit; this is an important aspect of treating disability benefit as income for tax purposes.  However, much work remains to be done both in this area and in regard to the longer-term arrangements for taxation and I am not yet in a position to announce an implementation date.</P>
    <P>The operational requirements for taxing unemployment benefit also continue to be examined.  It is still the Government's intention that taxation should begin in 1993.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise to the House that there will be no change in the present <Col N="674" /> tax status of any of these benefits until the commencement date for taxation; I hope to be able to announce a date for this in the reasonably near future as far as disability benefit is concerned.  I would also emphasise that all that will be done will be to treat these benefits as income for tax purposes; the extent, if any, to which taxation will arise in a given case will essentially depend on the amount of other income the recipient has in the same tax year.  In addition, in very many cases taxation will in practice simply take the form of reducing or stopping refunds of tax being made to benefit claimants.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would point out to the House that section 15 of the Finance Bill provides that a positive motion of the Dáil, approving of a draft commencement order to bring taxation into effect, will be required before such an order is actually made.  In this way the House will have a further opportunity for debate before taxation commences.</P>

      <P>EC structural fund assistance in respect of projects funded in 1988 and under the Community Support Framework for Ireland 1989 to 1993 relates almost entirely to projects in the south and would not in general include cross-Border projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main vehicle for structural fund assistance for cross-Border co-operation is the joint Ireland/Northern Ireland programme under the structural funds Community initiative INTERREG.  This programme was approved on 25 July 1991 and runs to the end of 1993.  It involves total expenditure of just over £100 <Col N="675" /> million of which the structural funds will contribute 76 mecu (approximately £58 million) in the total eligible Border area North and South.  Assistance is provided under the programme for both cross-Border projects and projects on each side of the Border carried out within the joint planning framework of the programme &mdash; the great majority of projects would fall into the latter category.</P>
    <P>Since the programme was only approved in late Summer 1991, the great bulk of the expenditure is scheduled to take place in 1992 and 1993.  The latest available estimate for total expenditure under the programme in 1991 is approximately £18 million of which the structural fund contribution would be approximately £10.5 million.  The annual report on the programme for 1991 is not yet available so it is not possible at this stage to give a breakdown of expenditure in that year.</P>
    <P>To date the major cross-Border project that has received structural fund assistance is the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal project.  Expenditure to end 1991 in respect of this project in the South was £8.7 million of which the structural fund contribution was £6.5 million.  The sections of the project closest to the Border are aided under the INTERREG programme and the rest of the project is aided under the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>Apart from the structural funds, the EC contributed 15 million ECU (approximately £11.5 million) in each of the years 1989 to 1991 to the International Fund for Ireland, which assists projects in Ireland, both North and South.</P>

      <P>I am happy to advise the Deputy that the Government, through the Commissioners of Public Works, has in place an extensive restoration and development programme on the Royal Canal.  The Canal, which was closed to navigation in 1961, was transferred from CIE together with the Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation under the Canals Act, 1986, to the Commissioners of Public Works to be developed as a public amenity.  The task facing the Commissioners in restoring a canal which had largely been ignored for over a quarter of a century is enormous, involving as it does the dredging of the canal to navigational depth, removal of spoil, installation of new lock gates and rewatering of levels as required.</P>
      <P>On the transfer of the Royal Canal to the Office of Public Works, they embarked on a three phase restoration programme. Phase I of the programme involved the restoration and reopening to navigation of the canal stretch between Blanchardstown and Mullingar which was successfully completed in 1990. Phase II of the programme commenced at the beginning of 1991 and involved the restoration of the Dublin stretch between Blanchardstown and the Liffey and the final full set of lockgates for this stretch have recently been installed at the North Strand.  The remaining dredging work between Binn's Bridge and the River Liffey at North Wall Quay will be carried out over the summer months.  With the replacement of the railway culvert at North Strand by a bridge, on which agreement has been reached with CIE, the Royal Canal will soon be open once again for navigation between Dublin and Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phase III of the programme consists of the restoration of the navigation from Mullingar to the Shannon at Clondra, Co.  Longford and the restoration of the branch to Longford town.  Work on this phase is also underway.  While there are a considerable number of major engineering obstacles to be overcome on this stretch, including low road bridges, breaches of the canal, leaks and dry <Col N="677" /> levels, progress to date has been encouraging and the commissioners are confident that with a continuation of the tremendous goodwill which has been a feature of this project, all the obstacles will eventually be overcome.</P>
    <P>While of necessity the programme to date has largely concentrated on the heavy engineering works required to reopen the canal to navigation, the commissioners are also developing the ancillary recreational potential of the canal. A detailed plan for the development of the Royal Canal as a top class coarse fishery has been drawn up and a complete ecological survey of the system has been completed which will assist in the management and development of the canal as a natural linear park.  The Commissioners have, where resources permit, undertaken some landscape improvement works along the canal e.g.  Whitworth Road, Drumcondra and have also cooperated with interest groups along the system in undertaking local canal environment improvement works.  Indeed, without the interest and active involvement of these groups and in particular the Royal Canal Amenity Group, the progress made to date could not have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government, through the Commissioners of Public Works, are committed to the restoration of the Royal Canal and it's development as a public amenity for the Irish people and visitors alike.  The potential of our inland waterways as tourist attractions and public amenities, representing as they do particularly fine examples of clean and unspoilt waterways, is considerable and the restoration and development of the Royal Canal will prove a significant step forward in the development of what are national assets and part of our heritage.</P>

      <P>The inland waterways currently under the control of the Office of Public Works are the Shannon Navigation, Grand Canal, Royal Canal, Barrow Navigation and Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal which links two great waterways &mdash; the Shannon and the Erne.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Shannon Navigation, my long term proposals are to continue the developments already in progress to improve the capacity and general facilities of the navigation to Ballinasloe and to Lough Allen and the provision of improved mooring facilities at Banagher and Terryglass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking over the Grand and Royal Canals and Barrow Navigation in 1986 developments of these waterways have been along the lines of the management and development strategy report which was prepared on behalf of the Office of Public Works at the time of the takeover. The level of resources available has determined the progress which has been possible.  The emphasis on the Royal Canal will be on opening access to the Liffey and restoring the sections between Mullingar and the River Shannon.  I expect the Royal Canal will be open for navigation between Dublin and Mullingar early next year.  Work which is in progress between Mullingar and Longford will take some years to complete. The main priorities on the Grand Canal <Col N="680" /> and Barrow Navigation which are already fully open for navigation will be to repair the bog embankments, principally in Co. Offaly and to further upgrade facilities generally on the system.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal was vested in the Commissioners of Public Works under the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990.  Work on restoring this waterway is well underway and due for completion by 1993.  The Office of Public Works will then be responsible for the maintenance of this navigation along the lines of the other canals under its control.</P>
    <P>A report on a National Waterways Strategy for other waterways (including disused canals) has been prepared for the Office of Public Works and is being examined at present.  I hope to be able to make an announcement in relation to this report in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The new powers conferred on the Revenue Commissioners by the Finance Bill, 1992 are designed to support the ongoing drive against tax evasion and avoidance. The powers are needed so as to enable Revenue:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to undertake an effective audit programme as part of the Self Assessment System;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to counter and deter tax evasion, especially in areas where it is suspected that such practices may be extensive;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to ensure that schemes of avoidance come to light more quickly, enabling countervailing legislative action to be taken expeditiously;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to protect VAT revenue receipts in the Single Market when VAT on import and frontier controls will have to be discontinued for intra-EC transactions.</P>
      <P>The powers relate mainly to the mandatory filing of returns by certain third parties and by company Directors, the keeping and inspection of records and an extension of the present powers of search for records and of Revenue's ability to attach the assets of tax defaulters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would emphasise that the bulk of compliant taxpayers have nothing to fear from the new powers.  There is no desire on my part or that of the Revenue Commissioners to impose undue burdens on <Col N="684" /> taxpayers who pay their fair share of taxes.</P>
    <P>Safeguards on the use of these powers are built into the legislation.  For example, the search of a private residence where records may be kept may be undertaken only where the occupier permits or where a warrant is obtained from the District Court.  In general, the powers may be exercised only by officers who have been specifically authorised in that regard by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Board of the Revenue Commissioners that the officers concerned will receive appropriate training and guidance in the use of these powers, particularly as regards entry to, and searches of, premises, and that the use of the powers will be closely monitored by the Revenue Board.  Taxpayers will also be reminded of their rights under the Taxpayer's Charter.  Where a taxpayer feels aggrieved he can ask for an independent review of his case, including a review by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that it is in the interests of all taxpayers that the problem of evasion &mdash; which can involve large sums of money and which can pose formidable obstacles for Revenue officials &mdash; is tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that the Government also will be keeping the use of the powers under close review.</P>

      <P>It is also essential to the proper and effective operation of Committees that the staff available to those Committees should have the background knowledge and expertise to service the particular remit of the Committee and for that reason arrangements have been made from time to time for the secondment to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas of suitable personnel from other parts of the civil service.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, few of the Joint Committees or Committees of either House are standing Committees and the number and functions of Committees have been known to change from one Dáil to another.  In these circumstances, secondment arrangements also make it easier for the Houses which have a relatively young cadre of senior staff to readjust to new situations without resort to measures which might adversely affect the morale of the staff.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Ceann Comhairle, the Management Services Unit of my Department recently carried out a detailed examination of the Reporting Section of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The report has been made available in draft form to the Clerk of the Dáil and a reaction to its analysis and recommendations is awaited.</P>
      <P>It would seem to me imprudent to make any assessment of possible adjustments to staffing levels in the area on foot of announced changes in advance of firm decisions on the main thrust of that report.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to review the tendering process for the decentralisation of Government Departments. I am more than satisfied with the way the decentralisation programme is being handled by the Office of Public Works and with the progress being achieved.  The selection of sites is based on location, suitability, availability and <Col N="689" /> development costs in the City or Town where it is intended to build new offices.</P>

      <P>Direct financial support in the form of allowances to Party Leaders are currently paid to registered politicial parties in Dáil Éireann who have seven or more members.  This results in payments as follows: Fianna Fáil, £125,130; Fine Gael, £248,205; Labour, £123,313.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payments are calculated on the basis set out in the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1973 and the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices <Col N="690" /> (Amendment) Act, 1983.  These Acts provide for the application of special increases by way of Government Order and standard National Agreement type increases administratively.</P>
    <P>As regards indirect financial support this falls mainly under the headings of staff, accommodation, equipment etc. and as such it is difficult to estimate its total value.  The staffing element is, however, estimated at about £300,000.</P>
    <P>Details in relation to funding of political parties in the other member states of the European Community are not available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>Although there is no specific legislation governing the establishment of National Parks in Ireland, apart from the Bourne Vincent Memorial Part Act, 1932, there is legislation available to underpin activities undertaken in pursuit of public policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The position of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, the body to whom this work is entrusted, is provided for under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  Powers to acquire and sell land on behalf of the State are conferred on the Commissioners under the State Property Act, 1954, and earlier legislation. Under the Local Government Planning and Development Act, 1963 the Commissioners may, after appropriate consultations, carry out building developments.  The criteria for the management of parks and the provision thereon of facilities is set out by the World Conservation Association and the United Nations and have been endorsed by successive Governments.  All National Parks are situated on State owned land.</P>

      <Quest>if he proposes to change the terms of the Superannuation (Female Civil Servants) Regulations, 1954 and 1981 so as to allow individuals who decide to remain single and/or choose not to have children to opt out of the scheme voluntarily without receiving a refund for past contributions, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the regulations referred to by the Deputy, female established civil servants were given an opportunity in 1954 and again in 1981 to opt for superannuation on the same basis as applied to male established civil servants. In conjunction with the second option, membership of the Civil Service Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pensions Scheme was extended in 1981 to female civil servants on the same basis as for male civil servants &mdash; membership was voluntary for staff serving on and immediately prior to the date of commencement of the scheme and compulsory for staff appointed after the commencement date.  The scheme operates on the insurance principle and its cost is met partly by the Exchequer and partly by members' contributions.  As in any insurance based scheme the cost of meeting the liabilities which mature is balanced by savings resulting from liabilities which do not mature.  To change the terms as proposed by the Deputy would discriminate against other members and would have a destabilising effect on the membership and financing of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy has in mind the non-availability of the PAYE allowance <Col N="697" /> and the £286 PRSI allowance to farmers and members of their families working on the family farm.</P>
      <P>The PAYE allowance is not granted to family members working in the family business or on the family farm, because such persons are not regarded as being in the same position as ordinary PAYE taxpayers, for example as regards obtaining the employment in the first place, security of employment, prospects of advancement etc.  There is also an anti-avoidance aspect.</P>
      <P>As regards farmers themselves, as the Deputy will be aware the PAYE allowance is not granted to self-employed taxpayers including farmers because of the difference between their tax treatment and that of PAYE taxpayers, who have tax deducted from their income before they receive it and pay tax on the basis of their earnings in the current tax year. By contrast, self-employed taxpayers receive their income gross and are charged to tax on the basis of the accounting period ending in the current tax year; they also enjoy a more liberal expenses regime.</P>
      <P>As regards the £286 PRSI income tax allowance, it would not be appropriate to extend this to the self-employed, including farmers, in view of the relatively low &mdash; 1.8 per cent &mdash; employee element in the rate at which they pay social insurance, by contrast with the 5.5 per cent employee rate to which the £286 allowance relates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Third party&rdquo; information has been a feature of the tax code since 1960.  At present such returns need to be made only when requested by a notice from an Inspector of Taxes.  The Finance Bill, 1992 provides that, in respect of the tax year 1992-93 or in the case of companies for accounting periods ending on or after 6 April, 1993, these returns will have to be made automatically without any notice from the Inspector, that is, on a Self Assessment basis.  Implementation of the provision was deferred for a year, to the periods to which I have referred, in order to allow businesses to adapt their systems so that the information required for the returns will be collected at the same time as the related transactions. Pending the receipt of the first &ldquo;Self Assessment&rdquo; returns the existing powers to request the information will continue to be used in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to clarify points which have arisen in relation to these returns, Revenue will issue a Statement of Practice setting out the types of payment which must be returned without notice and also <Col N="700" /> giving general guidance on how the system is to operate.  This Statement is now being drafted.</P>
    <P>Revenue already has manual and computerised procedures in place for the organisation and use of information and its linking with the taxpayers concerned. These are being further developed to expedite the linking and tracing of large volumes of information.</P>
    <P>As regards the general question of action to counteract evasion, the Deputy will be aware of the progressive increase in the audit programme being carried out under the Self Assessment System and of the new powers in the Finance Bill, including the provisions referred to by the Deputy, which will assist the Revenue Commissioners in this task.  Increasingly, Revenue resources are being freed from traditional work to concentrate on antievasion activities.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's question seems to imply that a &ldquo;true crackdown on evasion&rdquo; is necessary.  It is my view, and that of most commentators, that the 1992 Bill represents very significant progress in the drive against evasion.</P>

      <P>One of the major innovations in the reform of the Structural Funds adopted in 1988 involved the switch from a project-based to a programme-based approach. Information on the Community Support Framework and operational programmes is therefore provided on a programme rather than on a project basis.  Information on expenditure is available in relation to the sub-regions specified in the National Development Plan and also referred to in the Community Support Framework.  However, a breakdown of expenditure on a county basis is not provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme the EC is providing 76 million ECU (approximately £58m) in Structural Funds assistance <Col N="723" /> towards expenditure under the programme in the eligible Border areas in the North and South.  There are no specific allocations of expenditure or aid by county and individual projects are assessed for inclusion in the programme on the basis of the selection criteria established for each of the individual measures.</P>

      <P>In the case of a new motor vehicle, payment of VAT in two EC member states should not normally arise.  The dealer selling the car in the member state of export should apply the zero rate of VAT and the tax would be charged by the revenue authorities in the importing member state at the VAT rate applicable there.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to second hand vehicles is more complex.  Cross-frontier sales involving private individuals are covered by a special scheme of relief whereby the charge of VAT in the importing member state is adjusted to take account of tax previously paid in the exporting country.  Application of these rules effectively preclude double taxation. No such rules have been agreed at community level to cater for sales of used cars between dealers in different member states or between dealers and private individuals situated in different countries so incidences of double taxation can arise.  Discussions are currently underway at EC level to establish a regime which will seek to ensure that double taxation in such cross-frontier transactions is avoided.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the steps he proposes to have taken, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, to consult with and advise the practitioners and the business community of the complex changes which are being introduced as a result of the Single Market and 1993; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to ensuring that the business community and other interested parties are provided with comprehensive information and given every possible assistance to enable them to prepare fully for the various changes being introduced in relation to VAT, excise, customs and trade statistics as a result of the completion of the Single Market on 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>A major publicity and information campaign dealing with the various elements of the Single Market changes has already been launched by the Commissioners and is now well under way. The measures already taken and planned include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the issue free of charge, of information bulletins giving details of the changes in question and signalling the operational implications of these changes for the business community.  The first of these bulletins was issued last year to advise traders of the background to the changes and to give them an overview of the state of play of EC discussions.  Traders were brought up to date with developments in a second bulletin issued at the beginning of this year and further bulletins will be issued as necessary later this year;</P>
      <P>&mdash;consultations with a wide range of trade representative bodies to inform them fully of the compliance implications of the Single Market changes, to ensure that their concerns are taken into account as far as possible in the way the changes are implemented and that there is effective liaison between these bodies and Revenue in preparation for 1993;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;within the framework of the Tax Administration Liaison Committee <Col N="728" /> (TALC), which is a body composed of representatives of tax practitioners and Revenue, the Commissioners have established a special VAT sub-committee made up of senior Revenue and tax practitioner representatives.  The sub-committee has already played an important role in helping the business community prepare for the Single Market changes in the VAT area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a major programme of educational visits to traders to explain the new VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) and the new system for collecting statistics of intra-EC trade (INTRASTAT) which will be introduced from 1 January, 1933.  Under this programme, the objective is that all traders engaged in significant import and/or export activity will be given detailed information on these new systems either during direct visits to their premises or at seminars organised locally;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the organisation of seminars as well as the provision of experts to give detailed briefing on the Single Market changes and their implications for the business community.  This process is already well in train and will continue to be a major feature of the Revenue information campaign over the remainder of this year;</P>
    <P>&mdash;direct consultation with individual traders, especially in excise areas where complete revision of existing procedures is involved.  This trade involvement should help to ensure that the new arrangements introduced will serve the interests of both the trade and Revenue.</P>
    <P>During the remainder of this year the Commissioners intend to continue to liaise with practitioners and the business community about the operational implications of the Single Market changes and to provide them with advice enabling them to meet the challenges presented by this development.

      <P>Tenders for the remedial works to Agriculture House, Kildare Street, Dublin 2 have been invited and are due back this week.  The cost is likely to be in excess of £1 million. It is expected that work will commence in July 1992 and take twelve months to complete.  As the execution of the work may well require removal of the hoarding it is not proposed to paint it at this stage. However the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to change the tax treatment of either the inheritance or lifetime transfer of farms in 1992. However, in the course of the Committee Stage of the current Finance Bill, I indicated that the question of the tax treatment of the lifetime transfer of agricultural property would be studied prior to the 1993 Budget.  In the case of such life-time transfers, there could be a liability to both gift tax and stamp duty. The study will examine whether current tax arrangements regarding lifetime <Col N="730" /> transfers are a disincentive for the life-time transfers of farms, and thus an incentive for delaying farm transfer until the death of a farmer.  As indicated in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government considers that the early transfer of farms to young, trained farmers is required for efficiency and necessary structural changes in the farming sector.  The study will bear these specific, targeted objectives in mind, as well as the ongoing need to preserve revenues from capital taxation.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;Safeguards&rdquo; is used to describe actions to ensure that nuclear materials meant for peaceful use are strictly accounted for and not diverted from that intended use.  International law in implementing safeguards is governed, as far as EC member states are concerned by both the separate Safeguard Regimes of Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty, and the UN Non Proliferation Treaty which is implemented on a global basis by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  This situation has given rise consistently to duplication of inspection effort which is difficult to justify.</P>
      <P>On 28 April, 1992 a text was initialled by Commissioner Cardosa e Cunha, acting for Euratom and its 10 non-nuclear weapons States, and Director General Blix of the IAEA aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards implementation through collaboration. The new approach will be based on the use of commonly agreed and shared inspection procedures and techniques which are intended to eliminate the duplication which currently exists.  It is also intended to make increasing use of technologies to replace wherever possible the physical presence of safeguards inspectors.</P>
      <P>The detailed implementation of this arrangement will be established by the Euratom/IAEA Liaison Committee. Both Parties (Euratom and IAEA) will have to ensure that their existing criteria, guidelines and responsibilities will be fully met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised arrangements have no significant direct effects on Ireland.  In accordance with our consistent support for strong safeguards at international <Col N="732" /> level, we will continue to watch developments in the implementation of the arrangements to see that there is no deterioration in the quality or effectiveness of inspections in EC member states.</P>

      <Col N="745" /> In addition there is the Registration Council for Secondary Teachers.  This is a professional body prescribing regulations for the registration of secondary teachers.  Its composition by statute comprises representatives of the universities, school managements, teacher organisations and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been encouraged to include parental representation on Vocational Education Committees and the response has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> formal recognition has been given to the promotion of parental involvement as an essential strategy of education policy and practice.  The programme provides for an annual grant to each tier &mdash; primary and post-primary &mdash; of the National Parents' Council.</P>
    <P>In 1991, my Department circularised all schools encouraging those schools which had not already done so to ensure that a parents' association in connection with the school be formed.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the forthcoming Green Paper on Education will have greater participation by parents in the education of their children as one of its objectives.</P>
    <P>Higher Education Sector</P>
    <P>The concept of parental representation does not arise in relation to universities as the students themselves are represented on the governing bodies.  Also, in the forthcoming RTC and Dublin Institute of Technology Bills provision is being made for student representation on the governing bodies of these institutions.</P>

      <P>The main radiology departments for the North-Western Health Board are based at Letterkenny and Sligo General Hospitals.  In addition, there is a local radiology service based at Sheil Hospital, Ballyshannon, County Donegal which serves the catchment area of Donegal Town.  There is no x-ray equipment lying idle at either Letterkenny General Hospital or Sligo General Hospital which would be suitable for use at Donegal District Hospital.</P>
      <P>I understand that the North-Western Health Board have plans for the development of facilities and services at Donegal District Hospital and that these developments will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources and the board's priorities for new developments.</P>

      <P>It has always been accepted by all sides of the House and by the various interest groups that the provisions of the Child Care Act 1991 would have to be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> envisages such a phased implementation of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The sections of the Act relating to care proceedings are by their very nature the most complex provisions and a considerable amount of preparatory work must be done before they can be brought into operation.  New rules of court are required to give full effect to them.  In addition, various sets of inter-related regulations must be made governing the arrangements which health boards may make under the legislation for the accommodation and maintenance of children committed to their care pursuant to the new court order provided for in the Act. The relevant interest groups must be consulted in relation to the preparation of these regulations, in accordance with commitments made on behalf of the Government during the passage of the Bill through both Houses.</P>
      <P>The new procedures set out in the legislation for taking children into care will become much more complex, time-consuming and labour intensive for health boards.  New provisions in relation to supervision orders, the involvement of health boards in custody disputes and access for parents to children in care will impose new demands on health baords. It will be necessary for health boards to recruit and train additional social workers and other front-line staff so as to enable the boards to operate the new procedures.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the new care proceedings will be commenced as soon as practicable in the context of a structured programme for the implementation of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Cystic fibrosis patients are provided with intravenous antibiotics as part of their treatment.</P>
      <P>Where the patients are children, the parents are educated and trained to administer the drugs by a cystic fibrosis nurse.  This allows the child to live a normal lifestyle outside of the hospital setting.  The cystic fibrosis nurse acts as a liaison between the parents and the hospital, and can be contacted immediately if the patient experiences any problems. There are at present four special nursing posts associated with St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, National Children's Hospital, Harcourt Street and the Cork Regional Hospital. I understand that certain issues have recently arisen in relation to the funding of two of these posts and my Department is discussing the matter at present with the hospitals concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the EC Regulations govearning the suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers the person named was deemed to need 17 cows to produce his quota of 11,607 gallons. Therefore, as the total of 17 cows listed in his 1990 application was considered necessary to produce his milk quota he has been deemed ineligible for grants under that year's scheme.</P>

      <Col N="759" /> His application for grants under the 1991 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers is being processed and payment will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named was deemed ineligible for grants under the 1991 special beef premium scheme as twelve of the thirty one animals on which he applied for premium had already qualified for the scheme.  Under the EC Regulations he will also be debarred from the scheme for twelve months from 9 August 1991.</P>
      <P>Arising from difficulties in relation to the 1991 special beef premium scheme a Departmental Task Force made a number of recommendations in February last.  These were immediately accepted by me and have resulted in the clearance of most of the problem cases at this stage. However, applications seriously in breach of the regulations such as this case which is way outside the tolerance allowed by the EC cannot be paid.</P>

      <P>Details of the EC Directives for which my Department is responsible and are not in force in Irish law are set out in the following tabular statement.  As the Deputy will understand, the drafting and preparation of the necessary legislation is a complex and time consuming operation which requires a high degree of consultation between my Department, the Office of the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General. There is a total of 43 Directives not yet implemented.  Some are at the finalisation stage and I expect that 7 of these <Col N="761" /> will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>As regards the remaining 36, it would involve an excessive expenditure of time to describe for each the various difficulties encountered in providing for implementation.  I can say however that 10 of these instruments have already been drafted in full in my Department and are currently under examination by the legal offices of the Government or are being revised by my Department following such examination, or are in the process of parliamentary drafting.  In the case of the remainder, detailed preparatory work is being carried out by my Department and every effort is being made to expedite this process.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to put down a more specific question or questions about any particular Directive or Directives in which he is interested I would be happy to give him more detailed information.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no effort will be spared by my Department to ensure the earliest possible implementation of the outstanding Directives.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is an increase in pension for recipients of social welfare pensions who are aged 66 years or over and who are living alone. It effectively forms part of the pension and it would not be appropriate to apply it to pensions from other countries.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance is a weekly cash payment of £5 per week made during the heating season to households dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork who applied for social welfare benefit was refused this even though she was entering hospital for the third time in six months and two consultants and her GP have confirmed her ongoing and severe illness; and if he will investigate the circumstances of this case.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned claimed and was paid disability benefit from 20 December 1990 to 9 May 1991 at which point her claim was disallowed following examination by a medical referee. Subsequently she claimed and was paid unemployment benefit up to 2 September 1991 when he applied again for disability benefit.  As the certified cause of incapacity was the same as on the previous claim, no decision was made pending an examination by a medical referee.</P>
      <P>Medical referee examinations were arranged for 8 October 1991 and 15 November 1991 but the person concerned was unable to attend because she was hospitalised for short periods on both occasions.  She was paid disability benefit during these periods of hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She was examined on 28 January 1992 and the medical referee expressed the <Col N="767" /> opinion that she was capable of work. Her claim was subsequently disallowed. She appealed this decision and was examined by a different medical referee on 14 April 1992 who, having taken account of additional medical evidence received during March 1992, expressed the opinion that she was incapable of work from 2 September 1991, the date of her latest claim to disability benefit.  A deciding officer accordingly allowed her claim with effect from 2 September 1991.  She claimed and was paid unemloyment benefit for the period 6 February 1992 to 15 April 1992.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is not entitled to disability benefit from 17 April 1992 as she has less than 260 paid contributions since her entry into insurance.  According to the records of the Department only 105 contributions were paid on her behalf in the period 1983 to date and she is therefore only qualified for disability benefit for a maximum duration of 52 weeks.  In calculating the duration of entitlement for the current claim which commenced on 2 September 1991, account had to be taken of her previous disability benefit claim covering the 20-week period 20 December 1990 to 9 May 1991 which links with the current claim under the legislation governing the disability benefit scheme.  Her current claim was therefore paid for the maximum permissible duration of 32 weeks.</P>
    <P>To qualify for further disability benefit she requires a further 13 employment contributions paid at the appropriate rate.</P>
    <P>If she finds that her means are insufficient to meet her needs she should apply to the Community Welfare Officer at her local health centre with a view to claiming supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>Because of the unusual circumstances involved, it is not clear that the person concerned was made adequately aware of the availability of unemployment benefit at the point (in September 1991) where it was decided to postpone a decision on her disability claim.  The procedures in my Department are being revised to ensure that more explicit and <Col N="768" /> timely advice is issued in cases of this nature.</P>

      <Quest>if an old age pensioner who is living alone, and receiving a living alone allowance, a free telephone rental allowance, a free electricity allowance and a free TV licence, but is now incapable of caring for herself, would lose all those allowances if a daughter returned home to live with her and look after her; and whether that daughter who has no income of her own, would be entitled to a carer's allowance.</Quest>

      <P>Since the Deputy has not given details of the particular case he has in mind, I can only outline the situation that applies generally in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>In order to receive a living alone allowance, a pensioner must reside alone.  In the circumstances described, the old age pensioner would lose her living alone allowance if her daughter came to live with her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> The qualifying conditions for receipt of the free telephone rental allowance require the pensioner to live alone or only with children under 15 years of age or with persons who are so permanently incapacitated to be unable to summon help in the event of an emergency. Assuming that her daughter is over 15 years of age and is capable of summoning help in the event of an emergency, her mother would lose her free telephone rental allowance.  In relation to free electricity allowance, the old age pensioner will not lose the allowance provided she is an invalid or a semi-invalid and provided her daughter gives her constant (full-time) care and attention. A person in employment or getting unemployment benefit/assistance cannot be regarded as giving constant (full-time) care and attention).  Recipients of free electricity allowance automatically qualify for a free black and white television licence.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low incomes who live with and look after certain social welfare pensioners who need full-time care and attention.  The maximum weekly rate of carer's allowance is £50.00 rising to £53.00 from next July.  Means of up to £50 per week are allowable for the purposes of eligibility for this allowance. The main items which count as means are <Col N="770" /> cash income, investments, savings and property but not the applicant's home.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to investigate the circumstances of a particular case if the Deputy lets me have more details.</P>

When the person concerned applied to my Department on 23 March 1992 for payment of his statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund enclosing a copy of the Tribunal order in his case, my Department discovered an error in the order and was obliged to seek an amending order from the Tribunal.  This was received by my Department on 17 April 1992 and the statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement of the person concerned is now ready for collection from the Redundancy Payments Section of my <Col N="772" /> Department which he should contact regarding arrangements for collection.</P>

    <P>The current number of directives requiring implementation in the social affairs area reflects the rapid acceleration in the volume of directives generated by the Community since the advent of qualified majority voting in 1987.  It is also an indication of the expansion of the social dimension of the European Community and the commitment to meeting the social requirements associated with the completion of the single market by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>Naturally the task of transposing these directives into national legislation has created a considerable additional workload for my Department, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and the legal services of the State. <Col N="776" /> Notwithstanding this, considerable progress has already been made in implementing the directives and it is my Department's intention to meet our European Community obligations in this regard.</P>
