The Tánaiste as well as every Member of this House is aware that a High Court action is taking place in relation to the taking of evidence at the Beef Tribunal.  Perhaps the Government at their meeting tomorrow will consider this situation of having this House resume in the event of the High Court or Supreme Court making certain decisions in relation to proceedings at the Beef Tribunal.  In saying this, I am not setting a precedent.  As Members of this House well know, this House was recalled for emergency session in relation to the beef industry.</P>

However, let me ask the Tánaiste, in view of the information supplied to me now that it is not anticipated that any of the Bills in the Programme for Government will be published before the end of this year, if not at the beginning of next year, why the Minister for Justice has been making statements to the effect that we are going to deal with the confiscation of property of criminals as a matter of urgency, and about the family home legislation?

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that we have agreed to conclude this Bill by 12 <Col N="1029" /> noon but I want to put a more formal request to the Minister for Finance in relation to the points I made before we adjourned on Tuesday last.</P>
      <P>People in business have commented that the dominance of the two major banks which have 80 per cent of market share is squeezing any real sense of competition out of the domestic banking sector.  The Minister for Finance has a unique opportunity to bring forward proposals to create a significant third force in the banking sector if we could harness the synergy created by the three banks ACC, ICC, Trustee Savings Bank and the retail section of the post office banking system operating together.  I suggest the Minister should publish a Green Paper or a discussion document outlining the need for a third bank in the Irish economy and the need for the existing two main banks to strike up strategic alliances with other continental based banks within the framework of the European Monetary Union.  I made these points before, and I will not repeat them as they are on the record of the House. However, I wish to stress that this should happen soon as I do not believe that this should be left exclusively to random market forces.</P>
      <P>A combination of direct State intervention as well as allowing tenders from the different interested parties in either the domestic market or elsewhere is the best way to proceed.  The Minister should prepare a prospectus of the possible options of a third banking force based on the analysis by me, and others outside the House, and put this to the financial institutions and the markets generally. The Minister could then stand back and see the bids that would come forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit controllers in the Department would like to pursue a treasury approach and dispose of the assets as quickly as possible.  If the Government managed to dispose of all the assets, essentially the three banks, the Trustee Savings Bank, ACC and ICC, the amount realised would be in the region of £100 million to £150 million.  Welcome though the £150 million would be, in terms of our overall economic needs, and <Col N="1030" /> the need to reduce the debt-GNP ratio it would not make a significant impact, whereas a strong third bank in the Irish economy would strengthen competition between the other two major banks and also encourage linkages with other continental banks in the European Monetary Union market.  Our economy needs this and the Minister for Finance should vigorously pursue this option instead of bringing in a technical repackaging of the ACC and ICC banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see no reason for opposing what has been described by Deputy Quinn as merely a technical measure to increase the borrowing limits, albeit in a curious way, of ICC by £300 million.</P>
      <P>The two issues that have been raised during the course of the debate relate first, to the question of privatisation and, second, the potential use of ICC, either alone or in conjunction with other financial institutions that have been mentioned, as a vehicle for badly needed venture capital to the domestic economy. These two points have been raised in the debate and I want to comment on them.</P>
      <P>On the question of privatisation, having examined the Bill and the Minister's speech, it is clear he is keeping his options open.  However, he does not indicate any clear or alternative strategy on whether that will be the position.  The Minister gave the impression during the course of the ICC Bill that he would deal with the type of points that have been raised again by Deputies Quinn, Noonan and myself in this debate.  During the Order of Business I read the Minister's reply to the debate on the ICC Bill and it is my opinion he does not address the issues at all.  He threatened to deal with it at a number of stages but backed off when precise questions were put to him. Whereas the legislation is preparatory to a possible privatisation situation, nonetheless is it the case now that the Minister is not finding it easy to get takers for the ICC and if so, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set out what he described as the ICC developing along satisfactory lines.  He went on to indicate profitability <Col N="1031" /> and dividend payments in recent years.  I wonder whether they are that satisfactory and if not, why?  Would the Minister indicate the bad debts position in respect of the ICC?  I feel that the ICC is in a particularly good position to attract deposits.  Many small investors would be interested in that particular dimension but the loan book of the ICC is not so attractive.  Traditionally, as I understand it, the ICC have had to function in a fairly rotten environment in that they had to deal with traditional indigenous industry and were sometimes left with the wrong end of the stick.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to an article by James Morrissey in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 28 June.  I mention James Morrissey because I suspect the Minister would appreciate a reference to a man who very nearly had the task of presenting the Government's decisions to the people and may have done so far more fairly from the Minister's point of view had he got the job.  On the question of the privatisation of the ICC he had the following to say:</P>
    <P>Two other State companies are, however, currently well positioned for privatisation.  Last year, a detailed study of the Industrial Credit Corportion was carried out by accountants Stokes Kennedy Crowley and some 50 prospective purchasers were circulated with information about the bank but it is understood that no acceptable offers were received, despite a high level of interest.</P>
    <P>One of the stumbling blocks to a successful sale is likely to be the additional requirement for an equity injection so that the institution's capital adequacy ratios can be maintained at appropriate levels.  Michael Quinn, ICC's chief executive, has stated that ICC is worth around £75 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn had a different valuation and I am sure he had some sound basis for his remarks.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>James Morrissey, in his article, continued:</P>
      <P>ICC achieved pretax profits of £7.4 million for the year to the end of last October.</P>
      <P>At one stage a merger between ICC and ACCBANK, formerly the Agricultural Credit Corporation, was rumoured. ACCBANK has embarked on an expensive marketing programme as part of its strategy to increase market share.  Over the past year the bank further developed its banking services for small to medium-sized businesses, launched new products for personal customers and updated its range of products for the farming sector.  In 1991 pretax profits increased by 25 per cent to £6.5 million.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister when concluding to comment on this failure to find takers in the marketplace.  It is a fact that 50 prospective purchasers were circulated but that no acceptable offers were received.  I want the Minister to deal with that as I believe it is folly to go down that road if that is the case, because as Deputy Quinn said, the yield will be buttons from the point of view of the domestic economy. For short term gain and whatever boost it will give to the Minister when announcing his end of year figures, I see no merit in it.  There is particularly no merit in it when there is manifestly a need in this economy for what Deputy Quinn described as a third force in the banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-committee of which I am a member, the Job Creation Strategies Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Employment, identified this question as a major issue that requires to be addressed if we are to review and revamp industrial policy and arrive at recommendations that are likely to have any short term, palpable effect on the problem of unemployment.  It is acknowledged by both the experts who have given evidence, and by members of the committee, that there is great dissatisfaction in the Irish economy with the availability of venture capital to allow for the kind of risks that will facilitate <Col N="1033" /> industrial expansion.  I do not believe the Minister challenges that view.  Commercial venture capital companies are, to put it mildly, extremely cautious and conservative about the options they are prepared to support.  The business sector frequently complain that necessary venture capital for what are deemed to be good ideas is not available, that banking institutions are more conservative than ever and that recent experiences in the Irish economy have made that situation more difficult.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the banks are now arguing that because of the enactment of the Companies Bill in terms of some of the impositions of that Bill, including the examinership process, they are less interested than they previously were.  I am sure the Minister is under no illusion about to whom the banks see their primary responsibility.  As far as the banks are concerned, their priority is to make a profit, to pay a dividend to their shareholders and, if that coincides with a contribution to job creation in the domestic environment, so be it.  If it does not, tough luck.  They are not going to make philanthropic decisions to facilitate Government policy.</P>
    <P>If privatisation in any event will represent a short term minimum gain, the Minister should look to this alternative strategy.  One thing that worries me about this debate on industrial policy &mdash; which has finally started after three years of this Dáil &mdash; is that we have continued to take a series of <i>as hoc</i> measures which seem to constrain the possibility of our agreeing on a comprehensive redirection, refocusing and retargeting of resources in any revamp of industrial policy that might get a mandate from this House.  The major advantage of the jobs committee is that there is the possibility of getting a radical mandate from this House &mdash; to which all parties would be committed&mdash; to go forward in a certain direction.  We no longer have NADCORP.  In any event, I do not believe NADCORP were ever allowed function in the manner in which the legislation envisaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA, in terms of the manner in which they have absorbed that function, are not adequate for the needs and purposes of this economy. Finally, I should like to refer to the schizophrenic approach to lending in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would explain it in more detail because I have some difficulty in understanding the provision in the Bill to increase the borrowing limit by £300 million when the guarantee limit remains unchanged at £1 billion.  I am not sure how this dual approach will segregate the £1 billion from the £300 million which is being provided for now and which will not be underwritten by the State.  What is the thinking behind that? If £1 billion is at &ldquo;risk&rdquo; what is the point in not having £1,300 million at &ldquo;risk&rdquo;? What is it indicative of?  Are we trying to get out of the business altogether?  I cannot see any overall strategy in it.  It is difficult to understand how it will work in practice.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made &mdash; and it is time the Minster addressed it&mdash; that there are possibilities here for the development of a venture capital organisation, institution or whatever that would necessarily be underwritten to whatever extent by the State as an engine for the development of economic growth and industrial expansion.  Institutions have been mentioned such as the merger to which I referred earlier.  Deputy Quinn mentioned &mdash; either in this debate or in the previous debate &mdash; the Trustee Saving Banks, the ACC and the ICC.  There is total confusion about the future of the Post Office.</P>

      <P>Anybody who thinks the recent dispute that caused so much disruption in the post office is the end of the road for problems in An Post is not living in the real world.  There are major matters to be addressed there.  It seems to me we could address them in this kind of overall restructure consistent with maintaining <Col N="1035" /> industrial peace and maintaining employment and at the same time giving a better service to industry and so on. Unless something like that is examined the prospects for people seeking venture capital are very slim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be brief because on a previous occasion we discussed the ACC Bank Bill and I can see a similarity between that debate and this debate.  That is understandable because the situation has not changed dramatically since we discussed that Bill.</P>
      <P>In the ACC Bank Bill we were dealing with a core business in the agricultural community; in this case, we are dealing with a core business in relation to small to medium sized businesses &mdash; usually industrial as well as retail type businesses. We discovered in the recent Dun and Bradstreet report that the level of closures is increasing and our level of unemployment is gradually increasing. Therefore, there has to be something wrong with our banking services in general. Frequently closure of business is due to a lack of finance and in many cases, as previous speakers have said, it is due to a lack of venture capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Industrial Credit Corporation is to enhance their profit margins each year.  Therefore, in that particular segment of business they will concentrate on where they can identify good quality business propositions.  It is in identifying good quality business propositions that many ventures fail and they do not get encouragement.  The National Development Corporation was discontinued. I wonder whether in providing venture capital for many businesses we can do anything to eradicate our high level of unemployment.  It is ironic that we have a committee meeting and considering &mdash; as Deputy Rabbitte said &mdash; all kind of strategies in relation to employment.  A fundamental cause of unemployment is the lack of venture capital, and caution on the part of the banking institutions to lend to people.  As long as that remains the situation I do not think we will resolve our unemployment <Col N="1036" /> crisis.  Many people say that our domestic rates which remain stubbornly high are responsible, yet our economists say our interest rates will not improve until we see a reduction in the German interest rates.  We all know what is happening in the German economy and the difficulties they have in merging East and West Germany and the constraints put on their budget.  Therefore, we wonder whether we will see any easing off in relation to the interest burden and the unemployment burden as such.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would explain the borrowing requirement from £1 billion to £1,300 million and the removal of State guarantees and how this impacts on the overall situation.  I do not think there is anything further I can say on this Bill as it is simplified legislation and is similar to the ACC Bank Bill.  In relation to employment and in an effort to create those magical jobs, which is everybody's objective, I wonder whether a new departure is required, whether there should be a new departure in relation to banking circles, whether there should be an element of gamble and whether we need something similar to the National Development Corporation.  If the ICC and the ACC and the normal banking institutions cannot provide financial sustenance for these companies who will provide it?  If not, will we ever do anything about the high unemployment situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate.  The ICC have contributed to the economic development of the State for over half a century and that must be acknowledged. The Deputies who have contributed recognised their contribution.  The proposals in the Bill will add to their capacity to continue that good work.  There is no doubt ICC have helped many small and medium sized businesses to expand and prosper over the years.  As I said at the outset.  ICC are close to their statutory borrowing limit.  Without the increase proposed in this Bill, company development would come to an abrupt halt.  ICC <Col N="1037" /> are constantly involving their services in the light of the changing needs of the economy.</P>
      <P>ICC are a merchant bank of some standing, particularly in the small and medium-size business sector.  Perhaps somebody listening to the debate would not understand that but that is where practically all of their base is.  The inclusion of the word &ldquo;bank&rdquo; in the title and the measures for the supervision of ICC by the Central Bank and for the application to ICC of the technical measures are particularly appropriate, given their more commercial orientation and the possibility of a future sale of the Minister's shareholding, should a suitable purchaser emerge at some stage. ICC are already dealing with the Central Bank on many issues and welcome these provisions.</P>
      <P>In opening, I dealt with the question of guaranteed and unguaranteed borrowings. I said that there should be a clear understanding that existing depositors and lenders with ICC are not affected by the change; their position remains fully guaranteed within the existing limit of £1,000 million.  ICC are proposing, after the passage of this Bill, to establish a subsidiary company specifically to take deposits on an unguaranteed basis.  I want to assure the House, and particularly Deputy Quinn, that this was the ICC proposal and they did extensive research in the market place to see what would be the right and proper way to do it.  It is very much what ICC want to do.  The Deputy will appreciate that the one thing the banking world cannot cope with is uncertainty and confusion as between guaranteed and unguaranteed money. Therefore they intend to have a subsidiary so that it will be clear what is guaranteed and what is not guaranteed, so that in a doomsday scenario people would know precisely where they stood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte wanted to know if it made any difference. In the maket place it does make a difference in the eyes of those people who <Col N="1038" /> invest money.  It is easy for those of us who are not investing substantial amount of money to talk.  In the eyes of those who are investing substantial sums of money, or even small sums of money, there is a distinction between what is guaranteed and what is not guaranteed by the State and people must know which category their money is in.  ICC have researched this at some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I was making.  The point I was making was if there was a difference to the State between guaranteeing £1,000 million and £1,300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, and Deputy Quinn would probably be more expert about that than I, because he was part of the Government that studied that issue and made policy decisions which we have now been following since the middle of 1985.  I have to say I agree with the decisions made at that stage but there is a major distinction.  Under this there is a clear distinction between deposits with ICC which are fully guaranteed and deposits with the subsidiary which would not be fully guaranteed by the State.  The subsidiary company will, of course, be fully underpinned by the resources of the parent company.  ICC will thus be able to continue their growth on a commercial basis and without recourse to the State for the backing of a guarantee.</P>
      <P>Deputies Noonan and Quinn wanted to know if this structure was necessary. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned this just a few minutes ago.  I accept the views of ICC.  They are the ones who have to operate the arrangements on the ground. It is essential to adopt a structure that their research and considerations have shown to be the most suitable way to avoid confusion as between guaranteed and unguaranteed investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would add that this arrangement is not part of the Bill itself but I thought it would be of interest to Deputies to know how ICC propose to adapt to the change in the guarantee arrangements.  It is a credit to ICC staff, management and board that they are now confident of <Col N="1039" /> being in a sufficiently strong financial position to make a success of this change. It is not something they would do if they did not believe they were in a strong financial position to do so.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Credit Act, 1933, establishing ICC, envisaged that the predominant function of the company would be the giving of credit while also investing in equity shares and debentures.  There is no departure from the fundamental principles enshrined in that original Act of 60 years ago.  ICC have been involved in equity financing since their inception. In fact they have operated through a specialist equity division since November 1986.  Their basic strategy is to build up a solid portfolio of both quoted and unquoted shares with a view to ensuring a steady flow of profits each year, and this strategy has been successful through judicious management of the portfolio and an active policy of acquisitions and disposals.  As far as unquoted shares are concerned, investments are generally confined to profitable established companies with good growth prospects. Apart from Government paper the value of investments at the last balance sheet on 31 October was about £16 million.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised about the availability of capital, including working capital from the banks, particularly for small and medium sized firms.  We had some discussion about this yesterday at Question Time.  Deputy Noonan referred to the arguments made by the various sectors. Opposition spokespeople and I myself have the opportunity, almost on an hourly basis, of meeting people from the different sectors.  The Central Bank, who investigated the matter at the Department's request, carried out a detailed investigation and have assured me again and again that there is no evidence that the banks are operating a credit squeeze.  That is the official statement of the Central Bank.  Because I had a long debate in the Seanad recently on banking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They have assured me that there is no evidence that the banks are operating a credit squeeze. Bank lending is not constrained by capital requirements or liquidity conditions. However, both borrowers and lenders have become more cautious.  There is no doubt about that and that is what everybody here has said today.  I have repeatedly exhorted the banks to act in a positive way to assist Irish business.  I have been keen to monitor the banks' ongoing response in this area.  It is my belief that there are ample funds available for sound, viable projects.</P>

I have gone to great lengths, with the help of my departmental colleagues, to talk to individuals and have even checked with some projects around town.  I have seen projects that had no difficulty whatsoever with the banks and I have seen other projects which are not so lucky.  I had the pleasure of visiting a project here in the city which involves a substantial number of millions of pounds.  It was not, maybe, in the top ten but a project does not have to be in the top ten.  The bank's statement to the developer of that project was that if he built the first two phases of a five phase development with his own capital, funded them and let them, the banks would talk to him about doing phases, three, four and five.  My retort to him was that I would consider funding phases three, four and five myself if he could manage to let the other two.  A smaller developer on a site almost adjacent to him told me the banks could not have treated him better.</P>

      <P>This is the difficulty. The Central Bank's position has to be taken into account.  The Central Bank have assured me that they are not operating a credit squeeze and that lending is not constrained by capital requirements or liquidity conditions.  I ask Deputies to carefully note what I am saying.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that I will continue to exhort the banks to act in a positive way so as to assist Irish businesses &mdash; I know this is something the House and the Government wish me to do &mdash; and I will monitor the response of the banks in this area.  I will have an opportunity during the summer recess to meet the banking institutions.  While ample funds are available it may be difficult to obtain finance for high risk type ventures.  The definition of &ldquo;high risk ventures&rdquo; is always a matter of much debate.</P>
      <P>The provision of working capital and equity finance for small and medium sized enterprises is a commercial matter for the individual banks concerned.  I am glad to note the recent initiative by the Small Firms Association in securing a scheme for their members with one of the main banking groups.  This is an excellent scheme and one which I would certainly recommend.  Deputies will recall that the banks have made available a sum of £25 million under the scheme for young entrepreneurs and other schemes which offer loans at a reduced rate of interest and do not require personal security from suitable applicants.  I welcome these schemes as many good projects were stifled because people did not have adequate security.  To date over 200 projects have been assisted under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated to the House my officials have been engaged in discussions with the life assurance and unit fund industries regarding the impact of the changes in the DIRT on their products and the importance of equity investment for small and medium sized Irish industry. This is one of the major factors which has to be taken into account in this regard. Deputy Quinn has been following this issue very closely.  I met the financial <Col N="1042" /> services people recently and agreement was reached that progress could be made in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised some very broad questions in relation to the availability of capital by Irish banks, the development of the Irish banking industry, their competitiveness, the implications for the industry of full economic and monetary union and the place of the State banks in the industry.  I have already referred to the availability of capital.  The reason I did not refer to these issues in my Second Stage speech is that they are not relevant to this Bill.  I wish to assure Deputy Quinn that I have not forgotten about these matters; I have devoted a good deal of time to these issues over the past few months and my Department have been following up the undertakings I gave on 1 April.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I will follow this with the publication of a Green Paper.  Discussions are continuing in the matter.</P>
      <P>The second EC banking directive will open up the Irish market to further EC competition.  Deputy Quinn asked about this issue previously and I know he is following developments in this area. Even if we were not doing so, this directive will require us to look at the issues involved.  Some steps have already been taken in this area, for example, the lowering of the primary and secondary liquidity requirements, the adjustments to the DIRT tax and the new arrangements for the bank levy.  My Department and the banking industry have been working on these issues for over a year. There has been no shortage of joint meetings between my Department and the banking industry in this respect.  All these measures are aimed at improving the competitiveness of the Irish banking industry in the new environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more stable economic and monetary conditions which will result from European Monetary Union will help Irish businesses, including the banks.  The <Col N="1043" /> completion of the Internal Market and greater economic and monetary integration in the Community will create opportunities as well as challenges for every sector, including the banks.  The more competitive Irish banks are in the domestic market the more competitive they are likely to be in the broader European market.  Therein lies the challenge facing them.  The financial institutions, not least the ICC, seem to be keenly aware of the need to increase their competitiveness in the light of the challenges ahead.  I have had discussions with banking and other financial institutions.  I want to assure the house that if all businesses were as geared up to the changes which the Single Market will bring as the financial institutions are we could be very confident; they have examined all the issues involved.  The size of an institution is not necessarily a major impediment. Success in this area will depend on the segment of the market being sought by our financial institutions, including the ICC, the ACC and the Trustee Savings Bank.  Despite their relatively small size some of our financial institutions have made good progress in the markets abroad.  This point should be noted by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to refer to all the issues involved, but I wish to point out that the changes, some technical and others not so technical, which have been introduced during my seven months in the Department of Finance have been of benefit to the ICC and the ACC.  Changes have also been introduced in the Trustee Savings Bank.  Consideration has also been given to what is known as the &ldquo;third force&rdquo;.  A considerable amount of work has been undertaken in this area.  I am very keen to ensure that the concessions given in the Finance Act will give a return to our industries.  I am not paranoid in thinking that all profits generated here tend to move abroad, but liquidity, openness and freedom in the market make it attractive for people to move profits and investment out of the State.  This will have to be taken into account in the context of any concessions which are given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> I do not accept that there is a lack of strategic thinking in the banking industry. Much work is being carried out in this area.</P>

      <P>With regard to the &ldquo;third force&rdquo;, this relates to amalgamations.  I wish to point out to Deputy Quinn that, like him, I have spoken to a number of people about this issue.  I have learned that no two people agree; even some of the arguments put forward in favour of the &ldquo;third force&rdquo; are very different.  Some of them argue that (a) I should amalgamate all the banks, (b) do a joint venture with a European bank and (c) sell the lot.  One needs to be very careful about the measures taken in this area.  Some of the figures given as to the value of the ICC are very low.  This is done for their own benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the transfer of the NADCORP portfolio to the IDA, who already have a substantial equity portfolio.  The Culliton report recommended that the IDA should take more equity capital in Irish firms instead of grants.  This is being done.  With regard to the bad debts provision, the figure for last year was £6.9 million while the figure for the previous year was £3.4 million. The value of ICC has been put by some people at between £20 million to £30 million.  This is much too low.  The value of their net assets in 1991 was £54 million. This company could not be sold for less that the net asset value.  I could speculate <Col N="1045" /> about how much more than that would be acceptable, but we are certainly talking about a figure substantially in excess of the net asset value.  I have already outlined that the consultants recommended sale of the State shareholding.  I have not been following that with vigour in recent months while I have been looking at the issues.  The market was sounded and there was no great pull from any of the players.</P>

      <P>There may be some concern about that.  Deputy Quinn claimed that the staff level in ICC was 650, but they have cut back to just over 300.  There are players in the market who, if they acquired ICC, ACC and Trustee Savings Bank, would solve the problem. It is a matter for consideration.  I have listened very carefully to the different views of four or five players.  In the meantime all these banks are making money and employing staff.  All these issues have to be balanced.</P>
      <P>The options are full or partial sale of the State shareholding, full or partial amalgamation or mergers, or the option of each developing on a stand alone basis. I am not ruling out any of the options in this debate.  They will be considered on their merits.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in the Minister's views on the future of ICC. There is a strong case for the amalgamation of ACC and ICC.  My experience <Col N="1046" /> in the Department of Industry and Commerce has indicated to me the lack of finance for small industry.  The Culliton report outlines the shortage of finance from existing financial institutions.  The Minister and the Department should study the section of that report dealing with finance for industry.</P>

      <P>Section 1 deals with ICC Bank.  This is the key.  It is quite in order to say that small industry is being starved of finance.  I am not in favour of the privatisation of these banks.  The banks can be the instrument of Government industrial policy.  I recommend that the Minister should strengthen the State banks by amalgamating ACC and ICC to form a development bank to provide finance for industry, tourism and agriculture. It would be an instrument of Government policy to provide risk capital for people who want to start their own enterprises and create jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are effectively giving ICC, by extending the objects of the company, full range to be a multi-faceted bank.  I would suggest that if there is a strategy in the Department of Finance, there is a political contribution to be made.  We have just heard one such contribution from the Minister's party.  We should discuss that strategy.  The Committee on Employment will certainly do so.  My preference would be for a link <Col N="1047" /> with some large continental bank such as Credit Lyonnais.  The two other banks went in the wrong direction and became involved in a north American disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report states that recent pressures on the capital base of the banks and their apprehension during the 1991 economic slowdown have resulted in increased lending caution. There is great difficulty in obtaining finance from the banks, irrespective of what report they may give to the Department of Finance.  I am satisfied from my personal experience that the commercial banks are not prepared to take the risk with industry or job creation.  They are prepared to finance major financial services in Dublin, major building developments and so on; but they have failed dismally in relation to industrial development. Their demand for security can put a person's whole future in jeopardy.  They are not prepared to take a risk.</P>
      <P>The ICC should redirect their focus towards small industry.  I am delighted that Deputy Quinn is a member of the employment committee.  It is a major failure on the part of Fine Gael that they are not participating in this forum. Government policy, informed by this forum, could be implemented through a State bank.</P>
      <P>I am not enamoured of privatisation. It is designed to generate money rather than jobs.  That has been the experience to date.  We are moving too far too fast in regard to privatisation.  It should be remembered that there is a return to the State from the banking industry.  If we give up ACC and ICC to private enterprise we will be without an instrument for the implementation of Government policy.  The Government can direct policy through ICC, not through Bank of Ireland or AIB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has brought strength and innovation to his Department.  In the circumstances we should move away from the concept of privatisation.  People in the market want to buy those banks at a small price and make major profits.  We need a strong Irish banking enterprise <Col N="1048" /> system.  ICC and ACC together would have the strength to face the new Europe in 1993 and beyond.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ireland is surrounded by unrivalled expanses of natural beaches which form a fitting setting for the emerald gem.  Our heritage of sands, sand dunes and cliff systems and the ecological systems they support is in our care.  It is our privilege as well as our duty to preserve our heritage intact, to hand it on to our children and, in turn, to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> In introducing this Bill I should like to thank Opposition spokespersons for their support and co-operation in having it brought forward quickly, before the summer recess.  Towards the end of the year there will be a much larger, substantial Bill introduced but at this stage we considered it important to take powers to enable us act in this area quite urgently.</P>
    <P>It is my aim under the provisions of this Bill to emphasise the value of this wonderful resource of ours for the benefit of all people who know and use our beaches to so that neither thoughtlessness nor greed will spoil them.  I am sure the very substantial penalties provided for in this Bill will act as a real deterrent to those who would despoil our sands.</P>
    <P>When the original Act was passed in 1933 the maximum fines of £5 and £10 were regarded as substantial, if not very substantial, which they were.  I might illustrate what the purchasing power of money was in those days.  For example, a full glass of whiskey cost one shilling, or 5p; 20 cigarettes cost half a penny and a pint of plain porter cost seven old pence, less than three new pence.  Wages were equally modest in that a tradesman could expect £3 2s. 6p. per week, that, in today's money, is £3 12½p.; a factory worker could earn six old pence, 2½ new pence per hour.  Therefore, the House will see that, when these rates were set, the value of money was quite different.</P>
    <P>The new penalties being provided for in this Bill are up to £1,000 and six months' imprisonment on summary conviction and up to £200,000 &mdash; £100,000 for the first offence and up to £200,000 for a second or subsequent offence &mdash; and five years' imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  Therefore, it will be seen that they are substantial, tough penalties, but are necessary to underline the message that we have a valuable asset we must preserve and safeguard.  In setting these penalties it was necessary to consider much more than inflation.  For example, in 1933, two men with shovels, a horse and cart would have made only small inroads into any beach but modern <Col N="1050" /> earth-moving machinery can change a landscape physically in hours.  There is need now for the Minister to have at his disposal a fast and effective means of protecting our seashore from the pillaging of sand and gravel.  I must emphasise that this Bill will not interfere with any legitimate use of the shore.  In particular, there will be no change in the existing patterns of seaweed harvesting, which is particularly important along our west coast.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated thus far on the substantial increases in penalties for contravening prohibitory orders and notices. I might now go on to deal with the matter of disturbance of the seashore, a new concept I have introduced because it was very clear to me that taking beach material from the shore is not the only way of damaging our beaches.  For example, the sheer weight of heavy equipment can destroy vegetation.  Once the root systems break down, the sand is at risk of being eroded by the elements. This takes me back to my early days in agriculture when I studied eco-systems, the performance of roots in various conditions, including visits to places like Dollymount to see the effects of the marram grass.  Circumstances also arise when concentrated traffic by lighter vehicles would do untold damage not only to the seashore flora but also to the fauna.  By the prohibition of specified disturbance I will be able to prevent this kind of damage. There have been recent examples also of people moving sand dunes to find a site for a caravan, an extension to a dwelling or whatever, without realising the damage they were doing to the overall beach system and, very directly, the kind of damage that can be done to the movement of sand on the beach.</P>
    <P>Equally it is important that there be a local voice in protecting local beaches. For this purpose the Bill provides that, in addition to the Minister, a local authority would have recourse to the courts to prosecute for offences, or to gain injunctions to prevent further damage to a beach or dune system.  The Bill provides also that the court may order that the works necessary to make good, or prevent further <Col N="1051" /> damage, be undertaken within a specified time limit.  Henceforth not alone shall we have a method of preventing damage to our shores but it will be possible to reverse or remedy such damage as far as human ingenuity will permit, and as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>I might summarise the main provisions of the Bill.  First, they give the Minister power to ban sand removal from any beach or classes of beaches; to ban any method of sand removal &mdash; we are thinking here particularly of mechanical diggers and large removals &mdash; to ban any way, or ways, of disturbing sand and so on; to get an order from any court to compel an offender to stop and make good the damage within an allowed time. I might add that a relevant local authority or any individual or body would also be able to obtain such an order.  If an offender fails to carry out the order of the court, the provisions of the Bill allow the Minister to have remedial works carried out and the relevant offender billed for the costs.  The Bill also allows for the prosecution of an offender in the District Court.  A local authority would have that power also.  The Bill also provides that the Minister may licence, or refuse to licence, removal or disturbance of sand and so on, and to set conditions on quantities, methods, vehicles, times, giving notice and other related matters.  The Bill will also give the Minister power to include damage to flora, fauna and other amenities in the criteria for reaching a decision on whether to ban or allow any sand removal.</P>
    <P>We have 52 European blue flag beaches which rank among the finest in Europe and 27 beaches were recently awarded national green flag status.  We plan to protect and maintain these valuable national assets and to provide effective deterrents to those who knowingly and wilfully &mdash; or perhaps unwittingly &mdash; damage our beaches, sand dunes and seashore eco-systems.  We must take action in this respect.  It is my conviction that the action we are taking will be effective and helpful, strengthening the democratic process, allowing any individual to <Col N="1052" /> have right of recourse to the courts and to halt the illegal removal or disturbance of sand.  Our blue flag beaches are to be found all over the country in counties Louth and Dublin, in Bray, County Wicklow, in County Wicklow generally, Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, Clare and Galway.  All over the country we have wonderful beaches.  We have recognised their value as a national resource and we plan to maintain and protect them.  This Bill will strengthen the Minister's powers to protect the heritage of our coastline for present and future generations. I commend it to the House.  I thank the draftsmen and the officials of the Department for speedily bringing the Bill forward and the Opposition spokespersons for their courtesy and co-operation in ensuring that the Bill could pass through the House before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome this short but very important Bill.  I thank the Minister for informing us that this legislation will be introduced before the end of this session.  I understand that this Bill will not interfere with another Bill to be introduced which will deal with much more than the beach and beach material that the Minister has dealt with in this Bill.  We look forward to the other marine legislation that was promised. This Bill will go a long way towards protecing our marine environment.  Our seashores in general are for the public's enjoyment and should not be abused and this Bill takes account of that.  The Minister and we, as legislators, have a great responsibility to protect our beaches for future generations.  This matter was discussed at the recent Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.  Under this legislation we can ensure that our beach environment is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past few years Members on all sides voiced their concerns regarding the protection of our beaches during Question Time and marine debates.  The removal of beach material and the use of modern earth moving equipment were not envisaged when legislation was introduced initially.  When he mentioned the <Col N="1053" /> consumer prices of that time the Minister reminded us that life was much simpler and less complex with regard to the preservation of the environment.  The people who drafted that legislation did not anticipate that large machinery like sand diggers, tractors and heavy removal equipment would be capable of doing damage to some of our most beautiful and finest beaches.  Members expressed particular concern about Ballybunion beach and I, and other Members who are not privileged to be from Kerry, expressed concern.  We pointed out that whilst this may appear to be a local concern, the beach at Ballybunion was a national asset and we must all ensure it is protected.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has put the protection of flora, fauna and the seashore amenities at the top of the agenda in this legislation.  These may not have been dealt with in earlier legislation but they are specified in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The definition section in the Foreshore Act, 1933, states:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; means the bed and shore, below the line of high water of ordinary or medium tides, of the sea and of every tidal river and tidal estuary and of every channel, creek and bay of the sea...</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;seashore&rdquo; means the foreshore and every beach, bank and cliff contiguous thereto and included all sands and rocks contiguous to the foreshore.</P>
    <P>As the title of the Bill includes the word &ldquo;foreshore&rdquo; I would like the Minister to clarify if the Bill provides for measures to be taken when damage is caused to the seashore.  The &ldquo;seashore&rdquo;, as defined in the Foreshore Act, 1933, means a further part of the beach other than the bed and the shore below the tidal line, the bank, cliff sands and rocks contiguous to the foreshore.</P>
    <P>We should ensure that damage to our seashore is covered under this Bill whilst our biggest concern is damage to our beaches, the greatest damage to our <Col N="1054" /> beaches has been caused by excavation works and the removal of sand.  At the same time we should also take into consideration that there may also be large amounts of rocks and stones removed from beaches which may alter tidal flows or cause damage to beaches in some other way.  I hope that as this Bill is titled, the Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, 1992, that the seashore will be protected also.  I hope that any damage to the beach or to the flora and the fauna on the cliffs, rocks or sand will be covered under this Bill which provides for the protection of beaches.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that beach disturbance is covered in this Bill.  The Minister is right to anticipate that in the future disturbance may be caused to beaches. If large sand buggies and two and four wheeled machines are allowed on our beaches, as is the case in other countries, they could cause damage.  I do not believe that our beaches are threatened by such machines to any great extent at present but they might be in the future.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say how public are our public beaches?  We all hope that our beaches are publicly owned but have claims of ownership been made in regard to certain beaches or areas of a beach? Would they also come under this legislation or would they be exempt?</P>
    <P>Section 8 states that where a corporate group commit an offence under this legislation a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the body corporate may be found guilty.  Will the Minister indicate if a person will be named so they may be sued for damage caused?  Does the Minister consider this section workable? I understand that if an offence is committed section 5 provides that the Minister or the local authority concerned may take an action in the High Court. Section 5 also provides that any other person whether or not that person has an interest in the seashore concerned, may also take an action in the High Court.  If it is left to an individual to take a case, would the High Court costs be prohibitive and would there be any way to assist with such costs through the local authority?  If an individual had to take <Col N="1055" /> out an injunction perhaps on a Friday night when the local authorities were not in a position to move to do that, would there be some fall back so that the individual would not have to carry the total cost and the local authority could take it up on behalf of the individual who took the first action?</P>

      <P>The Labour Party support the Bill.  Our spokesman, Deputy O'Sullivan, is on another mission on behalf of the all-party delegation to an unnamed embassy.  Our spokesman fully supports the Bill, as does the Labour Parliamentary Party.  This short Bill is long overdue, but it is effective and easy to understand.  Much of the legislation which comes through the House is cumbersome and difficult to understand.  This Bill is very precise and gets the message across very clearly.</P>
      <P>There is wholesale interference with the sand dunes and beaches for commercial purposes.  Many people seem to think they have acquired a right to take sand, having regard to long standing arrangements with local authorities; but these arrangements have never been defined and there are constant disputes. It is one thing for a person with a horse and cart to take a few shovels of sand for a specific purpose, but there is now a question of selling sand which has been illegally removed from beaches and sand dunes and this must be stopped.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill said that he intended to introduce a major Bill later in the year.  I am glad of that because this Bill does not go far enough in many respects.  I say this as a former chairman of a port authority and a long serving member of a port authority and as a member of two local authorities with long coastlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill in a number of sections refers to disturbance.  I would like clarification of that.  The Bill refers only to the seashore. In my constituency and in other areas there has been illegal reclaiming of foreshore, mainly in estuaries and along tidal rivers.  Tidal rivers and estuaries are very important in relation to the operation <Col N="1056" /> of ports.  When the Minister speaks about the seashore or foreshore is he including the foreshore of rivers like the River Boyne, which is tidal, and other tidal rivers which depend on the tidal activity for the control of shipping into various ports?  My Parliamentary Question No. 136 yesterday related to a specific matter to which the Minister replied. I have been appalled at the length of time it has taken the Department of the Marine to process that.  It goes back to a time long before I became chairman of that port authority.  Similar problems exist elsewhere with regard to the definition of the foreshore.  Many foreshores are on sublease from the Department. The Department are dealing inefficiently with subleases as it takes an inordinate amount of time to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There is wholesale plundering of sand from our dunes and beaches and it must stop.  This Bill will give the local authority more force in implementing regulations under the 1933 Act which govern this. The fines were ridiculous and I agree with the Minister in updating them.  I am sure that those who have engaged in illegal activity will think twice before they engage in it again.  Who will police the implementation of the regulations?  Much of this activity occurs outside the normal working hours of local authorities.  I know that the Act provides for any member of the public to take action.  The main policing of this Bill will effectively rest with the general public rather than the local authority or the Garda Síochána. If a person makes a complaint to the local authority, will he have to provide the names and addresses of the people concerned?  There is obviously no power of arrest in the Bill.  On foot of a complaint by a member of the general public to the local authority, will the local authority be empowered to take the necessary proceedings against the offending person or persons or corporate body?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if consideration will be given to coastal erosion in the Bill to be introduced later this year?  Coastal erosion is causing more damage than the illegal taking of sand from beaches.  Coastal erosion is affecting <Col N="1057" /> all our coastline and it will continue to occur because local authorities do not have the finance and will not have the finance, except perhaps through EC funds, to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party welcome the Bill.  There are other matters which should be dealt with at a later stage &mdash; for instance, rights of way and the illegal fencing of coastal areas, beaches and parts of beaches.  Will the Minister indicate if it is his intention to deal with the very important subject of the illegal reclaiming of foreshore, particularly in estuaries and tidal rivers?  In welcoming the Bill we will ensure its speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>Democratic Left welcome this Bill, which is urgent, because it is designed to protect the seashore from the damage caused by the removal of beach material, sand and gravel.  It is evident that down through the years there has been wholesale abuse of the coastline by people who seemingly have no regard for our beaches as great amenities and who remove sand and gravel without adequate thought or planning.</P>
      <P>In my own county of Cork, which includes the entire south Cork coastline and the west Cork coastline, the Cork County Council have imposed prohibition orders.  The removal of sand from our beaches has been a contentious issue down through the years.  The council had the power to make prohibiting orders in relation to the removal of sand from our beaches, and that is the position with very few exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy that the penalties proposed under the Bill are very substantial. However, as has been pointed out by a previous speaker, a question arises as <Col N="1058" /> to the implementation of the legislation. Frequent mention has been made of local authorities.  I could draw an analogy between this Bill and the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  I am amazed that now the Minister for the Environment disclaims any responsibility for that legislation &mdash; it is entirely a matter for local government.  I draw that analogy to show that very clearly enshrined in this Bill must be designated responsibility to the local authorities.  I am sure that the Minister will refer to that in his reply.  I also question whether the Garda Síochána will have any involvement, a matter that has been mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 5 states that application may be made to the High Court by the Minister, a local authority or any other person.  I point out to the Minister that section 4 makes no reference to the local authority. Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following for section 7:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7&rdquo;.&mdash;(1) Whenever the Minister is of the opinion that the removal of beach material from, or the disturbance of beach material in, any area of foreshore belonging to the State in respect of which no prohibitory order is in force should be restricted or controlled, the Minister may serve on any person a notice...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give consideration to the non-inclusion of local authorities in that section and to clarify the position in his reply.  Sometimes when legislation is passed very speedily through the House provisions may seem to be satisfactory, but when the legislation is enacted anomalies begin to appear.  In that regard I would instance the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the local authority in my own area and I recognise the great effort that has been made by the authority through the years.  Very often certain interested parties mount a <Col N="1059" /> strong lobby for permission to remove sand and gravel from our beaches.  We must protect our beaches as amenities. The only way to do that is by the enactment of legislation and the only way to make such legislation effective is to provide for the imposition of severe penalties. The penalties proposed in this Bill are very severe.  The only question that might arise concerns the mechanism under which the legislation will be enacted and under which such penalties will be imposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Sherlock for giving me some of his time. I certainly welcome this very important Bill.</P>
      <P>In County Kerry we have had first hand experience of the damage done to a coastline by the removal of beach material.  In our county we have more than 350 miles of coastline, over half of which is now threatened by the sea as a result of the removal of beach material in the past.  A recent audit of our coastline commissioned by Kerry County Council indicated that it would take more than £10 million to properly consolidate and secure our coastline.  That illustration gives an indication of the seriousness of the problem in County Kerry.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the beach in Ballybunion.  For those who are interested, I should like to point out that an enormous improvement has taken place in Ballybunion.  I acknowledge the intervention of the Minister and the responsibility of the farmers in question. As a result of the responsibility shown, Ballybunion beach regained its two blue flag award this year.  The beach is reviving itself; it will take years to restore but it is reviving.  Very positive developments have taken place at Ballybunion and I certainly welcome them.  It is heartening to be able to talk of the improvements that have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No longer are sand and beach material attractive to farmers.  Indeed it is nonsensical that either sand or beach material should be removed at this stage. There are plenty of sand and gravel pits <Col N="1060" /> throughout the country from which gravel and sand are available at very reasonable rates and it makes no sense that they should be taken off the beach. Sand has very limited agricultural use and it is certainly not suitable for building. Farmers should be made aware of that information.  Sand removal is still taking place at an unacceptable level in parts of our county and nationally.  I hope that the Bill will convince people that they should not take sand from our beaches and discourage them from doing so.  I welcome the penalties suggested in the Bill.  I hope that they will be enforced.</P>
    <P>We must consider our beaches not only as recreational amenities but also as areas that need protection.  Our beaches will become major economic assets as we become more involved in tourism and as we place more emphasis on outdoor activities.  Our beaches must be protected now so that they can be used more in the future.  We must also aim to protect our coastline.  It makes very little sense to give money to organisations such as the Ballybunion Golf Club so that they can erect gabions to prevent coastal erosion while farmers are taking away the natural protection.  Thankfully, the removal of sand has finished and it is to be hoped that it will not recommence.  I stress the nonsense of spending large amounts of money on coastal protection on the one hand and then on the other hand not stopping farmers and other commercial interests from taking away the natural protection.  I hope that in the future commonsense will prevail, that people will realise the value of our beaches and recognise the fact that it takes years to restore one load of sand.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this very positive legislation which has received enthusiastic support from everybody in this House, as it should.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I welcome this long awaited Bill as far as it goes.  This Bill was promised in the Government's environmental action programme published on 26 January, 1990 and was to be introduced before the end of 1990.  It is <Col N="1061" /> interesting to note that in the environmental legislation promised to be introduced before the end of that year were such important Bills as the National Parks and Heritage Areas Bill, the National Heritage Council Bill and the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  With great regret I must put on the record of this House that these Bills have not even been published.  I ask the Minister to press at Cabinet level to have these Bills introduced as early as possible in the new session.  The Government's failure to progress this Bill and the other Bills I have mentioned indicates once again the need for a proper Minister for the Environment at Cabinet level with sole responsibility for environmental matters. I have made this point many times in the Dáil with no reasoned response from the Government.</P>
      <P>This short Bill is now being rushed through the House and I have grave misgivings about trying to deal with quite a complex matter in an hour.  However, as the legislation is very urgently required and as the Bill appears to be sound basically, I do not wish to appear to be halting progress.</P>
      <P>Of course, this Bill deals with only some of the problems in the foreshore area and the Minister has indicated that a further Bill will be required to deal with many other matters which need amendment. The problem of removal of sand and stones for beaches is very serious. Since my election to the Dáil three years ago I have received complaints from all over Ireland, including County Kerry.  I am pleased that Deputy Deenihan can report some improvement in the catastrophic situation in Ballybunion and he is a great ally of mine down there in that regard.  I have received complaints about Roundstone beach, various beaches in Donegal and, nearer home, Portrane in County Dublin, where only a couple of weeks ago a large quantity of sand was removed.  Other Deputies have referred to the horse and cart.  The Principal Act was enacted in that are in 1933.  The beaches are now being attacked by JCBs and ten ton lorries &mdash; a very different kettle of fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> One of the principal purposes of the Bill is to increase the level of fines substantially. I welcome this provision wholeheartedly.  However, even in these times of relatively low inflation, fines should be index linked.  I am pleased also that there is provision for imprisonment, which clearly should be imposed without compunction on deliberate and persistent offenders.  Sometimes I think the wrong kind of people go to jail.</P>
    <P>There is a major defect in that the Principal Act of 1933 has not been revised once the Planning Acts of 1963 and 1976 were enacted.  Obviously an amendment will be needed to provide a proper link between the foreshore legislation and the planning legislation dealing with foreshore licences.  There is a need for more public involvement in the foreshore licensing procedure on a transparent and open basis, as is provided for under the planning legislation.  There is a need to provide for an appeals system in regard to determination of foreshore licences should the applicant, the local authority or any member of the public feel aggrieved by the decision on the granting of such licence.  The conditions under which a foreshore licence is granted should also be made available publicly.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of problems with the Bill itself and I hope there will be time for a very short Committee Stage because I have three amendments ready to be circulated.  The first deals with habitats. There is reference in section 3 of the Bill to flora or fauna.  This should be extended to the area of habitats.  I would define habitats as including Machair sand systems and such other habitats as are included in the EC Habitats Directive. With regard to the definition of fauna, I feel it would be useful if the definition of habitats as provided for in the EC Birds Directive is incorporated in this Bill.  Also I am not very happy about section 5, which provides for powers of the High Court.  I wonder if this could not be derogated to the Circuit Court in appropriate cases in view of the extreme urgency there sometimes is to prohibit sand removal.  An application to a lower court would probably be heard more <Col N="1063" /> quickly.  Accordingly, I hope an amendment can be taken on this.</P>
    <P>In the hope that there might be time for a short Committee Stage, I will not use my full time allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments.  Deputy Barnes started off with the whole question of the environment and the areas which are privately set off or where private rights have been established.  The Principal Act provides for a prohibitory order even in the private cases, but section 6 of the Bill provides for realistic powers and penalties. These would apply as well to sections which would be in private ownership. That point is covered and the Deputy can rest assured about that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The seashore includes the banks, cliffs, sand, rocks and all that area.  That is why the seashore is included in addition to the foreshore.</P>
      <P>Another aspect is that this Bill provides remedies.  It provides for remedial action, a particularly important aspect.  The Deputy talked about sand buggies.  I have seen them in operation.  It would be possible to control their operation if they were causing damage of the kind mentioned. To refer to what Deputy Garland said, action could commence through the District Court or the Circuit Court; that is covered in section 6, so there is no need for that amendment.</P>
      <P>On another point Deputy Garland raised, the habitats can be taken in under the regulations covering flora, fauna, etc. I have noted the point and I am advised that it can be covered.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for the welcome they gave to the Bill.  I think they appreciate that rather than wait for major legislation, probably at the end of this year or the beginning of next year &mdash; and I am trying to get it as quickly as I can &mdash; it was urgent that we moved this stage.  This Bill will give a great deal of power and will be very effective and useful at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Deputy Bell was concerned about disturbance. Here it is a new concept and the powers are widened to include even the moving of sand apart from its removal and taking away from the beach.  It can be moved on the beach and this is what happened in Portrane, as Deputy Garland mentioned, where a dune was moved and set aside.  That affects the whole system.  In other cases depressions can be left in the beach which when the tide is in can be very dangerous for swimmers, especially young swimmers but also older swimmers.  One is walking out and suddenly is into a depression.  This can be highly dangerous and a major factor in relation to safety.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell recognised and welcomed the powers given to local authorities regarding fines and the amounts of fines, but was concerned about the policing. Previously the fines were so derisory that even when local authorities had a case it was hardly worth their while taking it. However, one of the most important aspects of this Bill is that the fines will make it very worthwhile for the local authorities to take action when incidents are reported to them.  I believe a great many people will report cases to them &mdash; indeed, any member of the public can report cases either to the local authority or to the Minister.  The lifeguards and officers responsible for the environmental protection of beaches will also act as contact points.</P>
    <P>I will undertake to get out fact sheets so that the provisions of this Bill will be generally understood.  Deputies may well remember co-operating with the Department of Social Welfare in this regard and we will do something similar so that people will be made well aware of the position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell was concerned about coast erosion.  While we have the powers to deal with this, we need more money to deal with the problem.  We are already doing a great deal of work on coast erosion but more money is required.  The wider review of the legislation will deal with illegal reclamation.  However, once a person puts up a structure or does something else in order to reclaim land, it <Col N="1065" /> could come under the provisions of disturbance and we would be able to do something about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Deputy Sherlock is now back in the firing line.  He has made a tremendous contribution over the years and I am very glad to see him back in the front line again.  I hope he will enjoy the best of good health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>While Deputy Sherlock is very happy with the level of penalties, he would like to be reassured that they will be applied.  I will certainly give that a great deal of attention.  Section 4 provides that the Minister may pursue the issue but this also includes provisions for the local authority and individuals to pursue the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan outlined what happened to Ballybunion beach.  I am very glad that Ballybunion has again been awarded the blue flag and I hope that we will all learn a lesson from what happened there, as it serves as a very important warning of what can happen.  I am very happy that the situation has improved but we will have to keep a close watch to ensure that it will never happen again. Deputy Deenihan also stressed that it required the co-operation of all to restore the beach.  Farmers generally understand the value of land and the value of the seashore and in Ballybunion they worked in conjunction with the local authority, the Department of the Marine and everybody else concerned, to bring the beach up to standard and they must be given great credit for that.  It is our job to ensure that everybody realises the damage that can be caused.  Excessive removal of sand or stones can unwittingly lead to damage and people may not realise the effects of what they are doing.  We intend to put an end to such disturbances and the Bill gives us the powers to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Deputy Garland believes that major legislation was long overdue and I take this opportunity to reassure him that I am working on the major Bill.  A great deal of work needs to be done on the Bill but I will be working to bring it to fruition.  While he welcomed the increase in fines he would like to have the 1933 Act reviewed in the light of the developments that have taken place since that date. That will be covered in the major Bill. The other matters he was concerned about are covered under the powers of this Bill.  Finally let me thank Members for their contributions.</P>

For example, if this amendment is passed I could not make regulations regarding the quality standards of condoms, as the <Col N="1068" /> amendment specifically states that they are not contraceptives.

      <P>The Minister seems to regard it as traumatic that condoms would not be regarded as contraceptives. This is the first time that condoms are to be defined as contraceptives in relation to family planning legislation.  The principle I seek to address in this amendment is that we should legislate in relation to the quality and standards of medical preparations that are used as contraceptives, but in relation to devices such as condoms we should have as little legislation and control as possible. Unfortunately, the legislation is in place; therefore, we can only seek to amend that legislation in the best possible way. The question of spermicides has not been addressed by the Minister.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that before we withdraw this amendment.</P>

To include them in this legislation might create confusion and lead to the supposition that they provide protection against infection, whereas they only protect against conception.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;(1)  Section 2 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following for paragraph (a):</P>
      <P>`(a) provide a comprehensive family planning service,'.</P>
      <P>(2)  Section 2 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following:</P>
      <P>`(c) provide in consultation with the Minister for Education, a Health Education Programme, involving parents and educators, which would seek to promote an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the purpose of this amendment is to try to bring the 1979 Act into a more acceptable modern context. Section 2 of the 1979 Act provides that the Minister shall secure the orderly organisation of family planning services and provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  The distinction in the original Bill between family planning services and natural family planning services is not appropriate.  It can only be interpreted as a sectarian provision in that it indicates a particular view in regard to family planning.  My amendment proposes that the Minister should be obliged to provide all types of family planning services that are appropriate and lawful.  I believe that principle is supported on all sides of the House.  The Minister should take the opportunity in this Family Planning Bill to deal with this issue as it is unlikely that this Bill will be back in the House for many years.  I take it that the purpose of the Minister's amendment is along similar lines, but I would like him to explain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of my amendment calls on the Minister to provide, in consultation with the Minister for Education, a health education programme, involving <Col N="1071" /> parents and educators, which would seek to promote an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality.  It is clear that many young people are coming under peer pressure to enter into sexual relationships at a very young age without a proper understanding of what is involved in the commitment they are making.  Therefore it is appropriate, when we are introducing legislation to liberalise the availability of condoms, that we should at the same time put down a marker that we want to see our young people much better equipped coming out of the education system &mdash; as I said yesterday, equipped with the ability to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to sexual advances if they do not want to make such a commitment.  If we can promote greater self-respect and respect for partners we could also be tackling the public health problem which the Minister and all Members are so keen to address.  I hope the Minister will accept that we do not have an adequate programme to equip our young people in this vital area of their lives.  We should, at this juncture, avail of the opportunity to provide a legislative framework under which the Minister for Health, with his colleague, the Minister for Education, would put together an effective programme that is appropriate to the age of the children.  That is the purpose of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment, No. 41a, which to some extent supersedes a number of the amendments I tabled.  The purpose of the amendments I sought to make to the Principal Act was to broaden the concept of family planning services and to eliminate the sectarian definition which obliged the Minister only to support so-called natural family planning methods. The Minister's amendment seeks to <Col N="1072" /> delete sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act which essentially eliminates the reference to natural family planning methods and I welcome that.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 4, in my name, I sought to include tubal ligation and vasectomies as part of the services which would be provided under a family planning service.  When the Minister seeks to replace sections 2 and 3 with a reference to being obliged to organise in an orderly way the provision of comprehensive family planning services, has he in mind the provision of services such as vasectomies and tubal ligation as family planning methods?  I am aware that hospitals in some health board areas provide tubal ligations but, as I understand it, in most cases, they are provided only on medical grounds and not for the purposes of family planning.  Does the Minister have a definition in mind for &ldquo;comprehensive family planning&rdquo; because it is not defined in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important group of amendments setting out the obligations of the Minister in regard to the whole issue of family planning.  We seem to be making an improvement on the position that pertains to date.  Under this amendment the Minister is required to &ldquo;secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services&rdquo;. What exactly does that mean?  It sounds like a traffic policeman.  Will he be required to provide family planning services and ensure that they exist or will he organise those that exist by way of regulation?</P>
      <P>The import of the amendments I tabled is to amend the Principal Act in a number of ways.  Amendment No. 45 seeks to provide &mdash; not to organise &mdash; a comprehensive family planning service; a point I hope the Minister will clarify when replying.  Amendment No. 46 seeks to appeal the licensing requirement for family planning services.  That is now being done by means of the Minister's amendment No. 41a which repeals sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act. Amendment No. 47 in my name reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> In page 4, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;In section 3 of the Principal Act, the words `that do not relate to the use of contraceptives' are hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a misprint in amendment No. 47 which should read, &ldquo;section 9 of the Principal Act&rdquo; rather than, &ldquo;section 3 of the Principal Act&rdquo;.  The import of that amendment is to change section 9 of the Principal Act to broaden the terms of the Minister's ability to fund research into the use of contraceptives and not simply into areas of so-called natural family planning.  That is an area on which the Minister had expressed views and I hope he will clarify the methodology he will use to ensure there will be adequate research to the use of contraceptives generally in the country.</P>
    <P>I support the notion in the amendment put forward by the Fine Gael Party in relation to the provision of adequate education programmes.  Certainly, a parallel education programme should be available. A comprehensive family planning service is a euphemism because the whole issue of family planning is not only relative to families any more, it is relative to anybody who is sexually active and who does not want to have children.  The education is extremely important and should be addressed in a Bill and a debate of this type.</P>
    <P>When responding to his amendment No. 41 (a) perhaps the Minister will outline clearly what he proposes to put in place.  I am a little taken aback by the phrase, &ldquo;The Minister shall secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services&rdquo;.  That does not strike me as being an obligation on him to provide comprehensive family planning services.  As Deputy De Rossa said, the definition of &ldquo;comprehensive family planning services&rdquo; needs to be elaborated on.  Can the Minister assure me he will have powers to fund research into contraceptives and that he will not be confined to funding research into natural family planning methods alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to amendment No. 2 which seeks the provision of a health education programme. When I spoke on a similar Bill in the Seanad in 1984 I emphasised the relevance of a sex education programme. I have repeated time and again the importance of a proper sex education programme both in primary and post-primary schools.  Nothing has happened to any great extent regarding the provision of sex education programmes in our schools.  If anything the reverse is the case and we have not as many sex education programmes in our schools as we had in the early eighties.  Health education programmes in our schools are almost non-existent for a number of reasons.  They are being squeezed out because of pressures from exam subjects. There is no time for programmes on sex education, on substance abuse, alcohol abuse, smoking and so on.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants an effective Bill, if he wants to prevent unwanted pregnancies and if he wants to control the level of sexually transmitted diseases it is of the utmost importance that this Bill be accompanied by proper well thought out sex education programmes in our schools.  I appeal to him to discuss the matter with the Minister for Education and to make it a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sex education programme should be part of a general programme on health education and on human relationships. As my colleague, Deputy Bruton, said it is very important nowadays to impress upon young people that they must respect each other.  The traditional respect that existed has diminished.  One of the reasons we have unwanted pregnancies is the lack of respect people have for each other.  Through my experience as a teacher I am convinced that young people can be educated to be more responsible. However, in this country we are not doing anything about that.  There is no national commitment and it is left to principals and teachers, who appreciate the benefit of sex education and health education, to implement programmes. Teachers and boards of management are <Col N="1075" /> not encouraged to make provision for sex education programmes in their schools.</P>
    <P>We must have a comprehensive health education programme.  It is not good enough to bring an expert into schools one day of the year to address the whole school in the assembly hall, perhaps using a few slides; sometimes it is the local priest who does this.  This area must be treated in a totally different fashion. There must be a continuous education programme beginning in primary school and going through post primary schools. It must be part of everyday education. It must be continuous and it must be reinforced.  Only then will we get results.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we are discussing this Health Bill here today because yesterday the Department of Health in England launched a White Paper on health and improving the status of health of the British people.  Health education is one area on which they put major emphasis. It would be a good initiative if the Minister, together with the Minister for Education, were to bring forward a new White Paper on the improvement of the health status of Irish people which would deal with the type of education programmes I speak of.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is listening.  I realise there are certain constraints upon him in regard to what he can do, but this is one area that will prove most beneficial for young people and the health of the nation in general if progress is made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to address amendment No. 2 (c), which is extremely important.  It brings much needed balance into this whole debate about family planning.  One cannot legislate for morality, but one can certainly educate for it and that is what this amendment seeks to achieve.  The amendment seeks to put an onus on the Minister to provide, in consultation with the Minister for Education, a health education programme involving parents and educators which would seek to promote an understanding and appreciation of responsible sexuality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan has covered <Col N="1076" /> adequately the situation as it exists.  In most schools, because of examination pressures, there is no space whatever in the curriculum for sex education/life skills studies.  There have been pilot schemes and individual health boards introducing their own programmes, but there is no mandatory curriculum space for education in life skills, sex education and so on.  There are people out there watching this debate who are convinced that the only solution this Chamber has to unwanted pregnancies is to throw condoms at the issue.  This amendment brings much needed balance to the whole debate.  Condoms are only a part of the answer.  This legislation is but a safety net for people whose sexual activities are probably at variance with what would be deemed by society to be desirable.  This amendment provides for education for morality and I appeal to the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education, on the whole area of sex education.  I quite agree with the Deputy that there is an urgent need for this and it has been overlooked and neglected for far too long.  It should not be a once-off thing.  It should commence in primary schools and continue right through into post-primary schools and it should be part of the curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to AIDS specifically, my Department are already involved in promoting AIDS awareness in schools.  If this programme were to be changed or widened it is only natural that this should be done in consultation with the Minister for Education and also involve parents and educators.  This section simply describes normal policy making progress and nothing can be gained by adding what is in effect simply a statement of intent to review existing policy.  It would be most unusual to include such a statement of intent in legislation, but the House can be assured that I will initiate discussions as quickly as possible and will come out with a proper policy for full sexual education in the schools.  This is important and this is what I will be impressing upon <Col N="1077" /> my colleague, the Minister for Education. I feel he would be at one with me on this.  It is apparent that the Dáil in general feels there is an urgent need for this to be done.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other amendments.  I very much agree with them.  I am very pleased that Deputy De Rossa adverted to these.  As Deputies will know, I am bringing in my amendment here.  A number of Deputies have asked that the words &ldquo;shall secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services&rdquo; be included.  The health boards may not be the only ones providing this. The lead was taken by private family planning organisations in this country.  I would like them to have a place in providing this family planning service.  I phrased the section like this purposely to allow them to also participate in providing a family planning service.  Otherwise these people could be left out and, as everybody knows, they have done great pioneering work in this field and a tribute is due to them on the work they have done &mdash; against all odds, if I may say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's clarification of his amendment. A number of questions arise.  First, he makes no reference to section 9 of the Principal Act, which he is not proposing to repeal and which confines the making available of money for research to natural family planning methods.  It would seem the Minister's new section cannot supersede section 9 unless he deletes that section or accepts our amendments.  The other issue is that he is proposing to provide by regulation the making available of a comprehensive family planning service and remove the very archaic licensing procedure that was here.  Perhaps the Minister could outline to the House what precisely he has in mind by way of his new regulatory framework for the provision of family planning services.  He is taking unto himself the right to make regulations but he has not given the House much of an inkling of his thinking in this area.  I fully accept the need to give non-health board agencies a role in this area.  As the Minister correctly said, <Col N="1078" /> they have often had to provide services in the face of considerable adversity.  The Minister should give recognition to that role and be in a position to fund the work carried out by them.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to be neglecting our amendment which proposes giving him a new general duty in relation to education.  He seems to dismiss this amendment by saying there is nothing to be gained from a statement of intent.  I contend that the general duty section of any Bill is a statement of what the Legislature wants the Minister to do; it is a statement by this House as to what his duties are.  It is appropriate that such a statement should be included in this Bill, particularly when, as he accepts, there has been great neglect in this area.  An assurance by the Minister that the normal system of policy-making will rumble on is not very reassuring to the House when he accepts that there has been neglect in this area.  While it was encouraging to hear that he will meet the Minister for Education, I do not think it removes the desire of the House to see a legislative duty imposed on him in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has addressed my amendments; he certainly has not addressed amendment No. 47.  I ask him to give us an assurance that his amendment will place a responsibility on him to ensure that a comprehensive family planning service is provided by the health boards, private individuals and private concerns.  I do not think any of the amendments which have been put down would preclude individuals, doctors or private groups from organising a family planning service. That is certainly not the intention of any of the amendments.  I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that his amendment No. 41a will place a responsibility on him to ensure that a comprehensive family planning service is provided throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on amendment No. 47 which deals with his ability to fund research into the use of contraceptives.  The Minister did not address this issue in his initial comments <Col N="1079" />&mdash; maybe this was an oversight.  I welcome the deletion of the licensing procedures. I sought to change these procedures in my amendment No. 46.  I welcome the repeal of this section by the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the education aspect, we accept the Minister's bona fides in relation to the ongoing discussions.  I think everyone in the House accepts the amendment but it may not be necessary to include it in primary legislation if we accept the Minister's assurance that an educational programme in our schools will be an intergral part of the provision of comprehensive family planning services.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes to delete sections 2 and 3 of the Principal Act.  I do not think it should go unremarked by Members on this side of the House that in many respects this is a quiet revolution in terms of attitudes to contraception.  The question of the type of family planning service which should be provided gave rise to much argument in the past.  It was contended that the Minister was obliged to support so-called natural family planning methods by way of finance and research but was not obliged to support any other form of contraception. That position derived specifically from the view of the Roman Catholic Church that contraception is wrong, any deliberate act which prevents conception is sinful and wrong.  It is disgraceful that this House ever incorporated that view in legislation; it was wrong for us to do that as a national Legislature.  The Minister should be congratulated by all concerned on this quiet revolution.</P>

      <P>We did not receive any notice that he was going to do this &mdash; the amendment was only circulated this morning.  He may have his reasons for putting down this amendment.  I hope it was as a result of the strength of the arguments made by Members on this side <Col N="1080" /> of the House and some of his backbenchers on related issues during the course of the Second Stage debate.  This is a watershed in our dealings with this extremely controversial issue.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of the Minister's amendment obliges him to secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services.  Family planning services are defined in the Principal Act as services for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation. It does not refer to the service itself.  I referred to vasectomies, tubal ligation, the pill, etc.  I am concerned that the amendment does not extend the definition of family planning services and seems to delete the obligation on the health boards to provide the service. Section 3 of the Principal Act specifically provides that the health boards are obliged to provide a service.  As a former member of the Eastern Health Board I know that section was particularly important in terms of getting over the reluctance which existed among some members of the boards to get involved in that area.  I know that the majority of members in some other health boards would not be anxious to get involved in this area.  It is important for the Minister to clarify that his amendment will not provide an escape hatch for health boards who do not wish to get involved in this area.</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 41a proposes that he shall secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services.  This is the same as the wording in the 1979 Act.  The Minister said he recognises the role of the voluntary agencies in this area. I wish to point out that a number of these agencies are in dire financial difficulties. The agency in Tralee provide a very comprehensive service.  However, they could be forced to close down because of a debt problem and lack of adequate funding. The Minister when replying might state whether he will make provisions in this Bill to help those agencies survive and to maintain their current level of services. If these voluntary agencies, who are performing <Col N="1081" /> such a valuable service, are forced to close that will defeat the purpose of this Bill.  It is important that we have responsible voluntary agencies to provide essential counselling services and they must get greater financial resources. Does the Minister envisage increased support to those agencies?</P>

      <P>I did think the provision that the Minister &ldquo;shall secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services&rdquo; would enable the Minister to deal with a case where the health boards were not complying with the obligation to provide such facilities. If, for example, the health board could not provide the service in a particular area, the Minister would be enabled to ensure that a comprehensive family planning service was organised in the area by other organisations.  I am very much opposed to paying grants for research into natural family planning methods only.  I would be prepared to accept the amendment on that.  As regards funding, I will have to look into the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is linked to amendment No. 31.  This is a positive move which will remove a sectarian element from the Bill.  The Minister has chosen to abandon the original phraseology which stated in respect of natural family planning that the Minister &ldquo;shall provide a comprehensive service&rdquo;. It would have seemed simpler to approach this by way of my amendment or Deputy De Rossa's amendment, stating that the Minister &ldquo;shall provide a comprehensive family planning service&rdquo;. This makes it clear that there is a statutory obligation on the Minister without any provision which would enable the <Col N="1082" /> Minister to sidestep the health board if necessary.  It would be quite possible to contract that job to voluntary agencies or health boards, but it is his responsibility to ensure it is done.  The Minister's formulation does not impose that clearcut responsibility on him or his successors. He uses the old phraseology relating to securing the orderly organisation of a service.  This provision was in the old Bill and did not deliver a family planning service across the country.  I should like to be reassured that the obligation to secure an orderly organisation of this service means more now than it did under the old Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not touch upon the regulations he had in mind to replace the licensing scheme.  It would be of interest if he had some approach in mind.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not indicated a willingness to accept our extension of the general duties of the Minister in the area of education.  The House would be much better served by a statutory obligation in this area rather than relying on the policy approach that has failed in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to impose somewhat more on the Minister's generosity in his amendment No. 41a.  In reply to my question with regard to the obligation on a health board, the Minister indicated his purpose in proposing a new section 7, subsection (1), which reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall secure the orderly organisation of comprehensive family planning services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was with a view to ensuring that if health boards did not provide, were unwilling or unable to provide such services, others could provide them.  That is not really an acceptable position in that the various health boards are the statutory bodies responsible for public health. They are responsible for organising the delivery of services in a whole range of areas, particularly for people who cannot provide a service from their own <Col N="1084" /> resources.  It seems to me that if private organisations &mdash; no matter how good they may be in terms of the services they may wish to provide &mdash; are asked to pick up the slack because X health board for policy reasons decides not to provide a family planning service, it would be virtually impossible for private organisations to substitute for a health board.</P>
    <P>Let me cite the example of the Eastern Health Board, who have been very good in terms of providing services within the Act as it has obtained to date; that is why I have chosen them rather than identifying others that have not been so good. But if a health board decide not to provide a service &mdash; as they may well decide to do under the Act as we now propose to amend it &mdash; then it would be extraordinarily difficult for the Minister to secure a service in the Eastern Health Board area through private organisations, general practitioners and so on, and it would be extremely expensive.  A way out of this dilemma I foresee arising would be to add a number of words to the new section 7 (2), which would then read:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of section 2 of this Act, the Minister may, without prejudice to the generality of this section, provide by regulations for the purposes of this section for the making available of a comprehensive family planning service by health boards and others.</P>
    <P>That would clarify that there would be an obligation on the health boards to provide this service and would also include others in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would be very much in favour of that.  But the Minister does not provide a comprehensive family planning service.  This would augment any family planning service that would be provided by a health board.  I think the addition of the words &ldquo;by health boards and others&rdquo; would meet Members' wishes and ensure that a comprehensive family planning service is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to clarify a point.  The Minister says he does not provide any service whereas in the original Act it is quite clear that he did in that it says: &ldquo;The Minister shall provide a comprehensive natural family planning service&rdquo;.  The formulation there is absolutely clearcut.  Even with Deputy De Rossa's addition, there is room for confusion as to whether there is a clear statutory responsibility on the health board or whether it is an enabling provision only &mdash; that a health board might do it if they so chose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, in respect of the Minister's amendment No. 41a, what the Minister has indicated in response to what was proposed by Deputy De Rossa is that the new section 7 (2) shall read:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of section 2 of this Act, the Minister may, without prejudice to the generality of this section, provide by regulations for the purposes of this section for the making available of a comprehensive family planning service by health boards and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before that is agreed I want the Minister to clarify the point I raised in that, to my mind, this does not place such a clearcut statutory obligation on a health board to provide this service. The subsection still contains the phrase: &ldquo;.... the Minister may provide by regulations&rdquo;. I take it that a health board may or may not choose to take action under those regulations.  Therefore there is still some slight confusion as to whether the new formulation imposes a statutory obligation on health boards.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment across <Col N="1086" /> the floor of the House because it does help to clarify the obligation which will be on health boards by way of regulation. I take the point Deputy Richard Bruton is making.  However, the subsection, as amended, would still read:</P>
      <P>...... the Minister may, without prejudice to the generality of this section, provide by regulations for the purposes of this section for the making available of a comprehensive family planning service by health boards and others.</P>
      <P>It would be nonsense for the Minister to introduce a Bill, provide for regulations and then not provide a service.  I would be satisfied with the Minister's acceptance of the inclusion of the words &ldquo;by health boards and others&rdquo;.</P>

I consider the words &ldquo;shall secure the orderly organisation&rdquo; are less clear than they should be.  While I accept that it would be the intention of the present Minister that such would be the case, I would prefer that the statutory imperative were included as clearly as it was for a natural family planning service in the original Act.  We are caught in a cleft stick here. We know what are the intentions of the present Minister, but when drafting law we should ensure that it would be there in the long term because we do not know who may be the incumbent of that great office in the future.  I do not think we can push the point any further.  I would hope that the regulations the Minister will draw up will provide that the type of service required will be available to all citizens across every health board area.</P>

      <P>All Deputies recognise that this has not been done in the past and, therefore, to place an obligation and a duty on Ministers is eminently reasonable.

      <P>In supporting the amendment we do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister when he says he will initiate discussions with the Minister for Education, but we now have an opportunity to place a statutory obligation, through legislation, on the Minister to provide that educational service.  It is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.  As I mentioned earlier, we have had pilot programmes carried out by individual health boards but there has never been a comprehensive, nationwide, obligatory health education programme.  This is a useful amendment and it is appropriate to include that obligation on the Minister in the legislation.  I accept that the Minister would personally intend to proceed with developing policy on this issue but this is a legislative opportunity which cannot be ignored.</P>

The Minister for Health cannot be bound to undertake education programmes which may bring his Department into conflict with the Department of Education.  We are addressing two totally separate issues and whilst both are equally important, one comes under the aegis of the Minister for Health, that is the supply of family planning devices etc., but the education of children is a matter entirely for the Minister for Education.  I do not understand how a Minister for Health can be made responsible for ensuring that sex education is provided in schools.

We are not creating a precedent because the precedent has already been established.  Deputies will be aware of occasions in the past when legislative provisions <Col N="1089" /> were made and enshrined in our Constitution, commitments of a nature that were never followed up with an adequate policy response subsequently. The pro-life amendment, in particular, was never backed up with proper pro-life provisions from this House.  We now have a golden opportunity to implement that which all of us wish to see, that we do not simply provide for the liberalisation of the availability of condoms but also provide a statutory obligation for the more important task which will match the reform in our laws.  This is the only opportunity this House will get to provide for such an obligation and it is not breaking new ground because the Minister for Health already provides education programmes for schools.</P>

      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 1 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of ` &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; means a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to any one or more of the following;' and by the substitution therefor of the following:</P>
      <P>` &ldquo;family planning services&rdquo; means a service for (i) the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation, or (ii) the supply of devices or drugs, in relation to any one or more of the following:'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> This amendment seeks to amend section 1 of the Principal Act of 1979, which defines family planning services.  I already referred to this in my earlier remarks on the question of the precise meaning of a family planning service.  My amendment seeks to expand the definition of family planning services beyond the provision of instruction, information and consultation to include the supply of devices or drugs.  My amendment No. 4 also seeks to extend the definition of contraceptives, and amendments Nos. 3 and 4 should be seen together, although they are not being taken together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of my amendment No. 43 is the same.  It also seeks to broaden the definition section of the Principal Act with regard to family planning services to include the provision of contraceptives.  Anyone who goes to a family planning service would expect more than information, instruction, advice and consultation.  They might also expect to be provided with contraceptives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to any one or more of the following; (a) family planning, (b) contraception, (c) contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply of drugs and medical provisions is being removed from this legislation by the Bill.  These continue to be the subject of medicines legislation.  I thought there was agreement in the House on this course of action.  The supply of medicines will continue to be subject to the normal doctor/patient <Col N="1093" /> relationship.  While the Bill does not provide for the supply of contraceptives, there is provisions in sections 3 and 4 of the Bill for the widespread sale of contraceptives.  There is also provision for their supply other than by way of sale. It is not necessary to amend the Bill here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister is not accepting the amendment, because the 1979 Act defined a family planning service as a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to family planning, contraception or contraceptives.  A health board which would provide the service will not be able to provide the services on contraceptives or other forms of family planning if we do not define the family planning services in the way I am suggesting.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in the Bill there is provision for the sale of contraceptives. However, there is no provision in it for other forms of family planning or other forms of contraception &mdash; for instance, tubal ligation and vasectomy, which are mentioned specifically in my amendment No. 4. In many cases they would be the most appropriate form of contraception. The condom is not always the most appropriate method.  There are many circumstances where because of the nature of the relationship the woman would not be in a position to oblige her husband to use condoms and she may already have perhaps seven or eight children.  Tubal ligation might be the only effective way for her to avoid a further pregnancy.  It is important, if we are going to provide a comprehensive family planning service, to have a means whereby a health board would be in a position to provide for family planning purposes the services to which I refer.  That is why it is important to more broadly define family planning services in a way which obliges health boards to provide a service which is not simply confined to information, advice and consultation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clarify what he said in rejecting this amendment? The Minister indicated that the <Col N="1094" /> Bill already provides for the supply of contraceptives by way of sale or otherwise. This came up yesterday and the Minister, in very hurried words at the end of his Second Stage speech indicated, that the Bill provided both for the sale or gift of contraceptives and that it did not, for example, debar a health agency from deciding that they would provide condoms as a matter of public policy to certain &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups without charge.  That should be an option under the Bill.  There has been some doubt as to whether &ldquo;supply&rdquo; as interpreted allows supply by any means other than sale.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>

I am seeking to ensure that it will be regarded as a contraceptive method and therefore cannot be refused by a health board on the basis that there is no specific medical prognosis involved, that there is a family planning need, a contraceptive need.</P>

      <P>We might make some progress if we realise what the Minister is trying to do.  This is not family planning legislation, it is a &ldquo;condoms&rdquo; Bill.  The Minister is trying to sort out the <Col N="1095" /> Irish solution to an Irish problem, even though this is not a solution for any problem. The Minister is simply seeking to regulate the availability of condoms.  The Minister has not dealt with any of the issues that have been raised so far such as sex education, or family planning services other than the supply of condoms.</P>
      <P>As time is running out, we might as well accept that this is a simple &ldquo;condoms&rdquo; Bill and therefore we should address the question of who should have access to them and where they should be available.  I presume other amendments will be required to deal with the family planning services that are required.  I think the Minister should get straight to the point and say what his intention is.</P>

      <P>Let me say to Deputy Mac Giolla that we have advanced some way in this Bill and that it also provides for family planning services.  We have agreed to reform some aspects of the 1979 Act &mdash; I am almost tempted to refer to it as the iniquitous Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa said that tubal ligation and vasectomy operations are not available for those who cannot afford to pay but sterilisation and tubal ligation operations are carried out when considered necessary.  Indeed I can list the hospitals: St. James's, The Rotunda, the Adelaide, The Coombe, Holles Street, and the service is available in the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards.  I agree with the Deputy that we have a long way to go yet, but it is only through the process of education and enlightenment that this will come.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given a list of hospitals and health boards that have the capacity to provide the service but the issue that arises in this amendment is the availability of the service. Could the Minister direct his attention to that question?  He is in a better position than most to know that while the capacity exists in hospitals to provide services it is definition of the circumstances and the lack of means that <Col N="1096" /> prevent people who need the service gaining access to it.  As I understand it, this is the point the amendment addresses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy slipped in there unnoticed.  The Deputy's presence certainly adds colour to the scene.  The point he raises is covered under the doctor-patient relationship and it is a hospital matter which is totally different from the question of family planning. Where the doctor advises that this is necessary for the patient, the person goes to hospital to have the operation.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 3 I seek to extend the definition of family planning services to include the supply of devices or drugs.  In other words the health board would be obliged by ministerial regulation to provide information, and consultation as presently defined as well as being obliged to supply devices or drugs.  I tried to hasten the discussion by referring to my amendment No. 4 which deals with tubal ligation and vasectomy as they are important methods of contraception.  It would be a mistake to assume that the condom is the only method other than the contraceptive pill which is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier in many cases a vasectomy or tubal ligation are the only appropriate methods of contraception.  I accept the Minister's point that they are surgical procedures and must be carried out in a clinic or hospital.  As this requires the intervention of a doctor, the doctor-patient relationship comes into play. However, certain hospitals and health boards are reluctant to provide this service. As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, while hospitals have the capacity to provide this service, the service is not provided <Col N="1097" /> except in certain circumstances. The Minister said that this procedure would be provided where appropriate but the question is what are the appropriate circumstances?  It seems to me that is where the problem arises.  Some people would consider sterilisation of men or women as inappropriate except in the most grave circumstances where there is a threat to the health of the man or women.  I am trying to establish that tubal ligation or a vasectomy as a form of contraception would be available through our health boards for family planning purposes and not simply for other medical reasons.  I am seeking an undertaking from the Minister that he will ensure that each health board will provide that men and women can avail of a vasectomy or tubal ligation for family planning purposes and that people who cannot afford to pay for this will be able to avail of them under the normal criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Where tubal ligation or vasectomy is considered necessary for medical reasons, the operation is provided. One cannot allow a tubal ligation operation to take place without proper consultation or where the operation may not be justified for medical reasons; but where it is deemed necessary for medical reasons, it comes under hospital policy, like any other surgical procedure, and the same criteria with regard to eligibility apply.  I will list the public hospitals that perform these operations, the Rotunda, St. James's, the Adelaide, the Coombe, Holles Street, Portlaoise, Mullingar, Limerick, Monaghan, Cavan, Letterkenny, Sligo, Cork, Tralee, so the operation is widely available.  When either is considered necessary it is provided under the same eligibility criteria.</P>

      <P>I seek further clarification of the term &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  If a man or woman attends a consultant at St. James's Hospital and tells him or her that as they have six children and they do not wish to have any more and the only realistic way they can achieve this for a variety of reasons is that the husband has a vasectomy or the wife has a tubal <Col N="1098" /> ligation, will the service be provided on that basis?</P>

      <P>We do not want everyone going around the country to get a snip.  There would have to be proper justification, otherwise anyone could opt out and say that no other method suited.  If that happened all the beds in our public hospitals would be occupied by people having a vasectomy.  A certain amount of wisdom will have to be applied.</P>

      <P>Vasectomies would not be freely available but could be provided when considered medically necessary. That is an important point.  Again the consultant-patient relationship would be involved.  It may be that the various options would be explained to the patient. A vasectomy might be carried out when a doctor, in consultation with his or her patient, feels that the usual methods of contraception are not available. I hope Deputies will believe me when I say that the final word on vasectomies has not yet been written &mdash; I speak from a medical point of view.  Due regard must be had to all other methods available and to whether a vasectomy is medically necessary.  It might not be the best thing to leave it to a patient to say that he will not consider any other method of contraception.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1, 3, 40 and 54 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with what I indicated during the Adjournment debates in the Dáil and Seanad on 24 June last, I raised the question of the lower ewe premium for 1992, resulting from its calculation for the first time on the basis of a single region for the entire Community, at last week's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Luxembourg.  At the Council I pressed for an additional premium to compensate farmers in member states, <Col N="1100" /> including Ireland, where market prices are particularly low.  I received the support of some other Ministers who had similar concerns.  The Commission noted my concern and agreed to examine the matter and to monitor developments closely over the coming months.  I can assure the House that I will keep in frequent touch with the Commission on this issue and that I will raise the matter in the Council again should that prove necessary.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the current marketing difficulties facing sheep producers and the need to pay the first advance of the 1992 ewe premium and the rural world premium at the earliest possible date, I have decided to make an <i>ad hoc</i> payment to 1992 applicants on the basis of their 1991 approved ewe numbers.  This advance payment, and the additional special rural world premium in disadvantaged areas, will amount to close on £39 million.  This, together with the payment last April of the final balance of the 1991 premium, will bring the total ewe premium payments for 1992 to approximately £84 million for the 52,000 sheep producers in the country.</P>
    <P>During the Adjournment debates, I referred to the recent demonstrations at Agriculture House, which involved the intimidation of some of my staff and the forcing of unfortunate ewes into the foyer of my Department.  I have said those actions were deplorable and that such behaviour would not be tolerated.  In addition, immediately after the demonstration, I issued a press statement condemning those actions.  I wish to reiterate my strong feelings on this issue and to assure the House that behaviour of that kind is not acceptable at any time.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are currently problems in the sheepmeat market and that the new method of calculating the ewe premium is not adequately addressing those problems in some member states, including Ireland.  That is because market prices in the Community have not come together to the extent expected when the new arrangements were agreed in 1989.  I have been drawing attention to the likely emergence of this problem for many <Col N="1101" /> months.  Now that the recent decision on the ewe premium has confirmed that my anxieties on this score were well founded I will increase my efforts to have the problem solved.</P>
    <P>Apart from my efforts to secure increased premium payments, which form an important part of sheep producers' incomes, and the satisfactory outcome of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations for the sheep sector, my Department have already taken a number of initiatives to improve competitiveness and profitability of the Irish sheep sector.  These include the provision of generous State and FEOGA grant aid for establishment of modern slaughtering and processing plants, the upgrading and modernisation of existing plants and the upgrading of facilities at livestock marts.  Furthermore, a code of practice was introduced which was supported by all sections of the industry. This code has resulted in improvements in quality and presentation of the product. At farm level, my Department, in co-operation with the main sheep breed societies have intensified the breeding programme to improve productivity, growth rate and carcass quality.  In addition, the extension of the EC producer group regulation to the sheep sector should be of benefit to producers in their marketing efforts.  A proposed EC sheep carcass classification scheme which should greatly facilitate intra-Community trade to the benefit of producers is under discussion at present. Finally, CBF, on which farming organisations are represented, is involved on an ongoing basis in the promotion of sheepmeat both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I believe that all of these measures have contributed and will contribute further to the development of a strong, vibrant and competitive sheep industry.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the number of breeding ewes.  In 1991 there were 4,622,000 breeding ewes and the total sheep number was in excess of nine million.  It is expected that the ewe numbers for 1992 will show an increase.</P>
    <P>As regards milk, a decison was taken in principle by the Council of Ministers <Col N="1102" /> to reduce national quota levels by two successive cuts of 1 per cent applying from 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994. However, before these reductions can be implemented the Commission is obliged to present reports to the Council of Ministers on the market situation, accompanied, if necessary by proposals to revise these decisions.  If the present favourable trend in the market for dairy products continues it will be very difficult to justify any reduction in quota in 1993-94.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If the present favourable trend in the <Col N="1103" /> market for dairy products continues it will be very difficult to justify any reduction in quota for 1993-94.  It is my intention to approach negotiations on this basis, as I successfully did in relation to the proposed quota cut for 1992.  In the event, however, of agreement on quota reductions producers will be compensated at the rate of 4 ecu-100kg or approximately 20.5 pence per gallon for ten years and provision will be made for a voluntary buy-out scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm or deny that the real cut in the ewe premium has been £6 in both disadvantaged areas and those that are not disadvantaged? The cut is not, as we were told by the Minister on 24 June last, 45p&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House was grossly misled on that occasion.  We were given advice relating to 45p as an element of the first payment, which is 30 per cent of the calculation of the ewe premium.  Is it true that the Minister also said in recent weeks that the new ewe premium system we are operating under has backfired on Ireland?  I appreciate the original mistake was made in 1989 when the entire Community was taken as a single entity and our price system was based on the prices within the Community.  Will the Minister agree that this is the base cause of the problem and that it has been further exacerbated by the collapse in the price of lamb and exacerbated further by the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are all related. Whereas we realise the Minister was not personally responsible, there is a drop in <Col N="1105" /> income for sheep producer farmers of approximately £1,000 per year.  Does the Minister agree that this has been made up by a collapse in the market and by the fall in the ewe premium?  Whereas I welcome the fact that the Minister has given a commitment now that he is going to pursue this, does he agree that hopes have been raised by officials in his Department who have stated publicly that he is going to continue his efforts to ensure that this drastic situation is not going to continue?  I have a further supplementary to the second part of Question No. 3.

      <P>I reiterate that the 1989 decision has caused this problem.  The problem then was manifested in Ireland by the decision of 19 June of the management committee to implement that decision.  At the meeting last week in Luxembourg of the Council of Agriculture Ministers I had a motion on the agenda to ask the Commission to make up the shortfall in Ireland in the next two advances, the one in November-December and the one in March.  As I said in my reply and I was supported by two other Ministers representing member states, the Commission agreed to examine the matter in the light of market developments and to get back to me.  I will keep up the pressure on the Commission to ensure that the shortfall which has occurred in Ireland will be made up in the next two advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the market situation, which is extremely difficult with prices <Col N="1106" /> extremely low, I have been in contact with CBF, who are the promotion and marketing agency, and next week they are carrying out three major promotions for lamb in the French market area to try to increase the throughput and make some impact on the price situation there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What has occurred in relation to the premium so far is a drop in disadvantaged areas of 45p, which accounts for two-thirds of the sheep numbers in the country, and £1.76 outside disadvantaged areas.  I raised this matter and had the item on the agenda last week at the Council of Agriculture Ministers to have the position redressed for the next two advances.  The Commission agreed to have the matter examined and to get back to me in the light of market developments.  I cannot anticipate what is going to happen in the next two payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the figures he is quoting are applicable only to disadvantaged areas and would not necessarily apply to the whole sheep population?  Although he has expressed regret about the demonstration, will he not agree that one can share the frustration of people who had to protest in this manner?  Will he not agree that the figures he is quoting are relevant to only one section of the amount and repayment and that the reduction in the ewe premium is based on a European average and an Irish average and in between we <Col N="1107" /> are the sufferers?  The 1989 decision did not produce that kind of equation.  It is no fault of the Minister.  We welcome his support, but we need his intervention to get a change in this attitude; otherwise, sheep producers will be in real trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Hyland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 29 together.  I appreciate the concern of Deputies who continue to raise the public health aspect of this matter.  I want to say that the problem has been resolved satisfactorily by the Department.  The cause and source of the contaminated cucumbers has been identified and appropriate action has been taken.  It was an isolated incident and I am satisfied that Irish horticultural products coming on the market are, as they have always been, of the very highest quality.  The regrettable incident has highlighted the importance for the utmost vigilance in terms of crop management.  There was no avoidable delay within the Department in dealing with the complaint which was first received by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>On 25 May the pesticide unit in my Department was requested by the Dublin city analyst to take samples of cucumbers suspected of causing illnesses.  As similar requests are received by the unit from time to time these cannot in themselves be taken as indicative of a widespread problem.  These samples were received on the evening of 26 May and were tested for contamination by a range of pesticides. The results were conveyed to the Dublin city analyst on 27 May.  No pesticide contamination had been identified at this stage.  A joint statement from the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health was issued on 29 May.  No prosecutions are being planned by my Department in relation to the recent incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Quality standards for fresh fruit and vegetables are laid down by EC regulations. Inspections are carried out by officers of my Department at all stages of the marketing chain in order to ensure that the statutory standards are being observed.</P>
    <P>Maximum permitted levels of pesticide residues in fresh fruit and vegetables are statutorily prescribed in the European Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Fruit and Vegetables) Regulations 1989, S.I. No. 105 of 1989.  The maximum residue levels, fixed for the main range of pesticides sold for use on fruit and vegetable crops, are based on the results of detailed supervised residue trials.  Full account is taken of the toxicological implications, and a strong emphasis is placed on safety factors for the consumer of the products.</P>
    <P>The regulations apply to all produce on the market, whether home-produced or imported.  In the event of an excess of pesticide residue being found, my Department have power to seize the produce or to restrict further sales from the same origin and/or to prosecute the person engaged in the sale.  Department officials regularly inspect and take samples from consignments at wholesale and retail market levels.  The results of testing over the years give no evidence of cause for concern about the safety to the consumer of fruit and vegetables.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister state the date on which his Department first became aware of the incident and the date of the first public warning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the afternoon of 27 May the first reported suspicion of cucumber-related illnesses was received in the Department of Health.  On 29 May it was apparent that the problem was widespread.  We had received reports of approximately 30 cases in all.  A joint warning was issued by the Departments of Health and Agriculture and Food on the evening of 29 May advising people, for health reasons, not to use cucumber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Departments of Health <Col N="1111" /> and Agriculture and Food and the supermarkets who sold the product were slow to respond and reluctant to accept there was a problem despite the fact that in the iterim guinea pigs at the Department's laboratory died after being fed with the cucumber while the product remained on sale?  Because of the time lag between 25 May and 28 May, the date of the public health warning, would the Minister agree there was a reluctance to issue that warning in this vitally important matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there was a reluctance in regard to issuing the public warning.  The Deputy will appreciate that all these complaints had to be investigated.  It must be remembered that the unit receives complaints on an ongoing basis in relation to health hazards in food.  Therefore, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health had to be extremely careful in relation to issuing a public statement which would have the inevitable effect of damaging the industry. No time was lost.  The first complaint was received on 27 May so that we are talking about a time span of a little more than one day before it was clearly established that there was a health hazard and the consumer was advised not to use cucumber until the matter was resolved. It would not be fair to suggest that there was any undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister suggests there was not an undue delay in issuing the public health warning would he agree that when the announcement was made literally all Irish cucumber producers were put out of business for the sake of a group, who were not deliberately involved?  The whole cucumber industry has been devastated as a result of this incident.  What action will the Minister of State take to compensate the genuine people who were not involved in the scare and who are Irish producers of cucumbers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true to say, as a result of what was necessary in the interest of <Col N="1112" /> the health of our people, that a public statement was issued jointly by the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Health which had the inevitable result of affecting the sale of cucumbers in this country.  I should point out that public health was the first consideration. It had been reported to us that people were becoming ill.  We acted as quickly as possible, we issued a statement which had the consequences which the Deputy has correctly identified.  It is regrettable that one producer could put the entire horticultural industry at risk.  I have met with representatives of the growers and I will continue to meet with them in relation to the matter which the Deputy has raised.  It has to be accepted that the action we took was in the interests of public health.  The problem was not created by the Department of Agriculture and Food but rather by a producer who acted irresponsibly, jeopardised his own fellow producers and put the whole industry at risk.  We did not create the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris asked a very straight question.  Will the producers who did not break the law be compensated for the huge losses they have suffered and are continuing to suffer because of the refusal of the public to buy cucumbers since this incident?  Did the Minister really say that the person who broke the law by his over-use of pesticides will not be prosecuted?  If that is the case surely the Minister is weakening the case of people who became ill taking civil action against that person or against the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's first question, I clearly indicated that the Department of Agriculture and Food did not create the problem.  Therefore there is no legal obligation on the Department to pay compensation.  I did, however, say that I have a lot of sympathy for the innocent producers who have been affected by this problem.  It is for that reason that I agreed to meet with the representatives of the producers.  I am not in a position to say whether compensation <Col N="1113" /> will or can be paid because there are legal complications and a wide variation of side issues which have to be taken into account.  What I am saying is that I have met with the producers and will continue to do so for the purpose of resolving the matter, bearing in mind that there is no legal obligation on this Department to pay any compensation.</P>
      <P>In reply to the second supplementary question asked by the Deputy, the reality is that under existing regulations it is not possible for the Department to issue prosecutions in terms of the offending party.  The existing regulations do not extend that far.  However, under new EC regulations, which will come into force in July 1992 under Directive 414, that loophole in the present regulations and legislation will be closed.  In the meantime I have asked officials of the Department to seriously examine the present inadequacies in the regulations to see if we can close that loophole nationally because I am concerned that we would have a repetition between now and 12 months' time when the EC regulations will come into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that we had the power to withdraw produce from the market if it is a health hazard, which is basically what happened as a result of an announcement from the Minister's Department and the Department of Health.  Likewise I would say that there are innocent people out there who suffered as a result of that joint announcement.  I am pleased that the Minister met them and I will also keep in touch with the Minister directly to make sure that common justice is done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am so aware.  It is our view that when the matter of the future of suspended quantities comes before the Council of Ministers they can only be decided when the Council agree to the reference quantities applying from 1 April next.  There will be a total review of the milk quota regime in the context of the regime which will apply from 1 April next.  At that stage I will be arguing at the Council of Ministers that producers have a legal entitlement to compensation for this year as temporary suspension remains in force this year.  We will also seek to ensure that for the future the quantities temporarily suspended are not definitely lost.</P>

With regard to the fruit and vegetable sector, An Bord Glas are implementing development plans which aim at a combined market share recovery and export expansion of £60 million and the creation of 1,800 full time and 1,500 part time jobs. Already considerable progress has been made in this regard and exports of fresh vegetables now exceed imports.</P>
      <P>Imports of animal feedstuffs amounted to £151 million in 1991.  The greater proportion of this consists of corn gluten, soya bean meal, etc., which is used in compound feed production in the cattle, pig, poultry and sheep sectors.</P>
      <P>In relation to the food processing industry, the IDA policy for all sectors of the industry is to grant aid projects which, among other things, are either export oriented or contribute substantially and directly to providing home produced alternatives to imports.</P>

      <P>I take it from the Minister's response that no effective action has been taken by his Department over the past five years.  We had an <Col N="1117" /> increase from £317 million to £772 million. This is an indictment of the Department's approach to this problem resulting in job losses and the loss of revenue to the economy.  Do I take it that the Minister has no further plans?  He is suggesting for instance, that some of the products that have been imported cannot be produced here.  Is he referring specifically to bananas, oranges and things of this nature?  I am referring specifically to vegetables which should be readily available here.  Does the Minister not agree that it is both an indictment of his Department and an absolute outrage that the farming community in this country cannot provide the vegetables for which there is a ready market?  Why can we not treat them as we do the dairy industry and set up some kind of co-operative?</P>

      <P>I outlined what is being done by Government Departments and State agencies.  I refer particularly to our progress in relation to vegetables.  It is true that imports of food products are increasing and that can only be true if Irish people are buying imported products. If the Deputy wishes, I can go through the sad litany of the amount of imported goods bought by Irish people but in any event I will circulate the details in a tabular statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>The Labour Force Survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office give annual data on employment by industrial sector in Ireland as well as data on the number of farmers in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of people at work in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector has declined from 267,000 to <Col N="1123" /> 155,000 from 1972 to 1991.  The number of farmers in the country since 1987 has varied from 120,000 in 1987 to 122,000 in 1990.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Labour Force Survey is based on a self-classification of activity.  The above figures relate to persons classifying themselves as farmers.  While the number declaring themselves to be farmers has actually risen from 120,000 to 122,000 since 1987, there is no doubt that in the longer term the number of full time farmers has declined significantly; and that there has been a significant shift to part time farming. This has been part of a worldwide trend in developed economies in recent decades and is related to improved farming technology and greater efficiency in agriculture generally.</P>
    <P>The EC Farm Structures Survey of 1985 estimated that the holder/manager of one-third of holdings had a gainful activity other than farming.  The more recently published household budget survey for 1987 also indicates that many farm households have income sources other than those from farming.  This survey showed that on average farming represented some 54 per cent of gross farm household income.  This trend towards greater diversification in the income sources of farm and rural households is likely to continue, reinforced by our new emphasis on rural development programmes.</P>
    <P>However, I have also at all times in Community negotiations stressed the need for the maintenance of a strong commercial farming sector which will be able to adapt and compete in a new agricultural environment, a point which is very largely accepted by the EC Council and by the Commission.  In this context the recent agreement on the Common Agricultural Policy reform measures has ended the uncertainty about future support arrangements that had existed in the agricultural sector for more than 15 months.  Farmers will therefore be able to plan on the basis of known market supports and premium arrangements and this in turn should have some stabilising <Col N="1124" /> effect on the numbers working in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the very low level of new entrants to farming and would he agree that there are two factors which militate in this respect, namely, the continuing high level of stamp duty on land transfers and the inadequate level of, and difficult application procedure for, farm installation grants?  Does he intend to raise this matter with the Department of Finance with a view to alleviating the position for new entrants to farming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that both those aspects cause problems and I will be making renewed effects to try to resolve them in the context of the Estimates which will be debated between now and October.  During the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations, under the heading of accompany measures, I sought to have a credible early retirement scheme funded substantially by the EC.  I hope that measure will help towards getting younger trained farmers into the business much earlier and that this proposed early retirement scheme will work in Ireland, where all previous early retirement schemes were absolute failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that a drop of 112,000 people in agricultural employment since we joined the Community is some sort of an indictment? Although the Minister recognises that there is a slight increase in the number engaged in agriculture, he also admits there is a drop in the number of fulltime farmers.  Has the Minister separated these two figures?  Is the first one applicable to agricultural employees as opposed to farmers?  Has this made a major impact on the numbers of unemployed, now at almost 300,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantial drop in the number working in agriculture from 267,000 to 155,000.  That represents the number engaged in agriculture.  The number of farmers has increased from <Col N="1125" /> 120,000 to 122,000.  It is a problem of definition.  The sad reality is that people are leaving farming areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of interpretation. In a number of areas there is an increase in the number of part time farmers, but the reality is that people are leaving rural areas.  We are trying through the Leader programme and various other programmes to retain as many people as possible in the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Another major structural problem attached to the 122,000 farmers is their age profile, which is the worst in the Community.  I am delighted the Minister has said that he intends to introduce additional measures such as a farm retirement scheme with which to tackle that problem.  Can the Minister tell us how many of the 122,200 are of retirement age, 60 years and over?  I would imagine there would be quite a few Would the Minister be able to predict the effect of such a farm retirement programme on farmers in the first year or two of its operation, or of transferring land from older farmers to younger farmers who would be a great deal more productive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be helpful to Deputy Connor if I could.  My interest in the accompanying measures &mdash; early retirement scheme &mdash; is to have a scheme implemented in Ireland which will work. I am conscious of the fact that previous schemes just did not work.  I know, as I am sure do many other Members of this House, of many people who availed of early retirement schemes who came back to us asking whether they could cease their participation and apply for the noncontributory old age pension because the payments were less than those that would be forthcoming from social welfare.  I do not want that to happen again.  If it is a <Col N="1126" /> scheme that will give people an incentive to retire early, a satisfactory and guaranteed income, index-linked, then I predict there will be many participants.  There is a substantial number of people &mdash; I do not have the precise figures &mdash; within the categories Deputy Connor spoke of who would be prepared to retire and put their farms into the hands of younger people.</P>
    </Speaker>

What steps will he take to redress this trend in that it is evident from what the Minister has said this afternoon that the small farmer is a vanishing species that will have disappeared over the next decade if that trend is allowed to continue?</P>

Does he foresee this trend continuing in the immediate future?  In addition, how does he perceive farming as a livelihood in future years if this trend does continue?  Surely the Minister must have some views on that, whether at Government or European level?</P>

      <P>The Government, and the Department of Agriculture and Food in particular, in recent times have been endeavouring to counteract this trend. The House will have noted that my colleague, Deputy Hyland, has been given specific responsibility for rural development. In that regard there are a number of important programmes, including Leader programmes and others which hopefully &mdash; for the first time since the foundation of the State &mdash; will reverse the trend of people leaving rural areas.  I am more hopeful than ever before that, with the redirection of investment and support for rural activities generally that will be the case.  In fact in this very House yesterday President Robinson referred to the very good work of rural communities and of community associations generally. It is possible when the will is there to do so.  Therefore, we should support them to the greatest possible extent.</P>

      <P>My supplementary refers to the latter part of Question No. 14.  The Minister has mentioned some steps to be taken by the Department in response to Deputy McGinley.  Will he say whether the newly-announced scheme at local authority level &mdash; to be administered by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Hyland &mdash; through the county development team is the type of scheme he has in mind which might address some of this flight from the land in that such a project could be prepared by a county development officer?  The Minister will be aware of the scheme announced just this week, not the Leader programme, but the other <Col N="1128" /> dimension at county development team level; is that what he has in mind?</P>

      <P>With regard to the 54 per cent of gross farm household income to which the Minister referred, would he agree that in areas which might be described as non-industrial, the income would be comprised mainly of social welfare? Has he any figures in that regard? Would he agree that the overall reorganisation within agriculture is likely to push people in the areas to which I referred out of agriculture with no place to go because there will be no jobs available, which is what worries me most? Would the Minister have the relevant figures on the social welfare input?</P>

We all know there has been a dramatic decrease but the Minister is not prepared to acknowledge that.  Would the Minister not accept that the policies of successive Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; of closing down three-teacher schools, rural post offices and the like has added to the decrease in the numbers of farmers on the land?  Furthermore would he agree that the imposition of a 12.5 per cent VAT rate on alternative enterprises, in <Col N="1129" /> which many farmers were encouraged to engage as and from 1 July 1992, will exacerbate the overall position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Wexford</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 37 and 148 together.  The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may only be removed humanely for research purposes, strictly in accordance with conditions specified in licences issued by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that wildlife, including badgers, have a role in the transmission of bovine TB.  A strong and growing body of scientific evidence supports this view and a number of projects undertaken have demonstrated that removal of infected badgers facilitate the reduction in TB levels in cattle.  It is also recognised that wildlife is just one of a number of sources of TB infection. Therefore, the removal of badgers is undertaken where infected badgers have been identified in areas with high levels of bovine TB.  In the longer term research is in progress on the development of a vaccine designed to protect badgers and other species from tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>My Department have neither directed nor obliged the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works to issue licences, nor are they empowered to do so.  The current limited degree of badger removal is licensed because of the scientific evidence to which I have referred.</P>

I am not saying <Col N="1135" /> that the badger is the sole cause of bovine TB but it is one of the causes.  To what extent it is not known.  A research project is currently under way at University College, Cork, to develop a vaccine which will resolve the problem when it comes to hand.  It is not in anyone's interest to have a wildlife population infected with TB.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 1 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of `(c) contraceptives;' and the substitution therefor of the following:</P>
      <P>`(c) contraceptives,</P>
      <P>(d) tubal ligation or vasectomy'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I referred to this amendment when we were discussing developing the definition of a family planning service.  I had already raised the question of vasectomy and tubal ligation with the Minister, who rather quaintly referred to vasectomies as the &ldquo;snip&rdquo; and I accept his superior knowledge of that matter.</P>
      <P>Some people who are in the best of health have decided they have completed their families and for a variety of social reasons the condom does not suit, and perhaps for medical reasons the contraceptive pill does not suit.  In the circumstances either a vasectomy for the man or a tubal ligation for the woman would be the most appropriate way of ensuring there would be no further pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to add one further point to what I said.  In recent months there has been a great deal of talk about abortion and the need to permit abortion in Ireland in certain circumstances.  Indeed, the Supreme Court has defined certain circumstances in which a woman is entitled to an abortion.  There is the further controversy about the right to information and to travel for abortions.  It was difficult to get statistics on this issue.  It is clear from <Col N="1234" /> the figures available &mdash; and they are not all that reliable &mdash; that the number is understated, but one group in the Dublin area who provide information and counselling on abortion have indicated that of the 900 women who approached them seeking information on abortion, 300 already had children and 100 of those women had three or more children.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there are women who have, as far as they are concerned, completed their family.  It seems to me that sterilisation would be a much more effective and humane method of dealing with this problem.  I am quite certain that if sterilisation were available for women for the purpose of avoiding further pregnancies rather than simply on the basis of some related illness, there would be a reduction in the number of women travelling to Britain for an abortion or seeking an abortion in Ireland.  My other statistic is again not easily verifiable in that it is based on declarations made by women who have already travelled to Britain for an abortion.  The figures are provided by the clinics themselves and it is believed that the figures are grossly understated, perhaps by 100 per cent. The available statistics seem to indicate that at least 20 per cent of the women who have travelled to Britain for an abortion are married.  Although this information is not available through the statistics, one must assume that a significant proportion of them would already have children.  It seems to me that we could certainly avoid the use &mdash; even the unintentional use &mdash; of abortion as a contraceptive method if our health boards were able to provide female sterilisation and also vasectomies as means of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Yesterday one of my colleagues jokingly said that if the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare were to get together on this issue they could perhaps save the State considerable sums of money in children's allowance payments by providing vasectomies.  That comment was offered purely in a jocular fashion but in any event there is a need to emphasise the responsibility of men in <Col N="1235" /> the area of contraception and the avoidance of unwanted pregnancies.  If our health boards were able to advertise and provide such a service, emphasis would be placed on the fact that contraception is a dual responsibility and is not a so-called women's issue.  Contraception is the responsibility of all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister's acceptance of the amendment I propose would first help to broaden the understanding of who is responsible for the whole question of contraception and would also help to alleviate the stress on many thousands of women who become pregnant not through choice.  For many of those women it is not that they do not want to have children but that they are perhaps in a relationship, whether or not it be a married relationship, in which the man refuses to have a vasectomy or refuses to use condoms and her own health does not permit her to take the pill.  I do believe that we have to grow up.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there may be religious problems among the staff of some hospitals, but I think that may have been overcome to a significant extent in recent years and I hope that that is not a significant difficulty.  Nevertheless, as legislators we have a responsibility to ensure that the widest forms of contraception are made available.  It would be a mistake to move on from this Bill without having addressed that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy De Rossa.  It is important that every citizen should have available to him or her the total range of contraceptive options.  One of the factors that has circumscribed the availability of contraception in the past has been ability to pay.  It is clear that for those who have money in this country the option of tubal ligation or vasectomy has existed.  There are private clinics who carry out those operations happily.  For those who do not have the wherewithal to either travel to those clinics or pay private fees the operations are not generally available.  I should welcome the broadening of the definitions section of the Principal Act to <Col N="1236" /> encompass those areas.  This is an important issue and the case made by Deputy De Rossa is very fair.  I hope that the Minister will act upon it.</P>
      <P>I wish also to address myself specifically to amendment No. 8, in my own name, which is being taken with that of Deputy De Rossa.  The object of my amendment is to broaden the definition of the term &ldquo;contraceptive sheath&rdquo; to include a condom intended for use by either a man or a woman.  In my second stage contribution yesterday I mentioned that there is a condom for women, femadom, currently available on the market in the United Kingdom and in the United States.  It is likely that the product will become available in this country shortly. The female condom has to be at least defined in legislative terms because it is not covered by any definition, either as a contraceptive or as a condom, under the current legislation.  We should prepare ourselves for the availability of that device by including it in the definitions of this Bill so that it would be available without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept both the broadening of definition of the Principal Act suggested by Deputy De Rossa and the inclusion of female condoms as required by my amendment No. 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy De Rossa spoke on amendment No. 3 the Minister's response seemed to indicate that his view was that there should be a right to tubal ligation or vasectomy only when it was established that such an operation was medically necessary and when a consultant could be found to state that either a tubal ligation or a vasectomy was medically necessary.  It would seem to me that this is a matter of personal choice and a person should not be obliged to find a consultant who would deem such procedure medically necessary.  In that context Deputy De Rossa has a valid point in pressing his amendment.  The amendment emphasises that under family planning legislation people have a right to make personal choices in the area of contraception and that should be recognised as part of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall first provide Deputy De Rossa with some figures on Irish women who travelled to Britain for an abortion.  In 1991, 69.3 per cent of those women were between the ages of 20 and 34, 13.9 per cent were over 34 and 16.8 per cent were 19 or under.  Those figures do not bear out Deputy De Rossa's statement.</P>
      <P>Tubal ligation is an operative procedure and is not without its own risk.  I do not wish to start laying down the law as a doctor, but there is a distinct risk attached to tubal ligation.  It could not be a device made available freely, as would condoms.  The issue would have to be one for a patient-doctor relationship within a hospital.  It would have to be discussed and perhaps presented as an option, but there are simpler options.  I would like to take this away from this field into the field of hospital procedure, like any other medical procedure which a patient would consider.  We cannot just say they want it.  It is not necessarily what they want, it is their best interests that matter.  It is a laparoscopic surgery but there is an operative risk and I would like the public to know that.  There are simpler methods available where it is medically jusified and in the best interests of the patient.  I believe the consultant will recommend it and, as I said, it is available and becoming more so.  The Coombe Hospital declared recently that that would be available for patients there as an option.  That was a very good decision on their part.  It must be considered within the hospital setting and nothing else for the time being.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Howlin regarding the female condom, as a doctor I would look at the anatomical structure and say it is a cap.  It is available, has been so for a long time and there is nothing new about it.  It is a sheath like the contraceptive sheath, so it cannot be defined separately.  The diaphram is provided for under a separate heading, so we need not include it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa mentioned abortions. There are a multiplicity of reasons why abortions are sought.  I have listened to thousands of my patients and some of the reasons they have given for seeking <Col N="1238" /> abortions are mind boggling.  For instance, the husband is away at sea and there is no chance of getting him back.  I could go through such stories all day. Various risks are taken and not just to prevent pregnancies.  I am not saying I am opposed to tubal ligation but I feel we would be very wrong to hold that it should be available freely for everyone.  If I were advising a patient I would suggest seeking the simpler way first.  Only in cases where there would be problems, where the danger of pregnancy might seriously impair the person's general health, would I agree to it but it must not be resorted to too freely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to pursue the matter much further because there are other issues we want to reach in this debate.  I am not proposing that female sterilisation be freely available across the counter, so to speak, because it has to be on the basis of consultation with a doctor and involves the hospital operation.  You cannot just walk in off the street, demand and get it.  My amendment proposes that the definition of a family planning service should include the provision of sterilisation both male and female.  Unlike female sterilisation, vasectomy is available virtually on a walk-in-off-the-street basis if you can afford it.  Counselling and a great deal of advice are involved; time is needed to think it over and so forth.  Given the nature of our society and the psychology of men and women, it is not something most men and women will consider as a first option.  In the nature of things both men and women shy away from surgery of any kind no matter how simple, especially when it is concerned with the reproductive organs.  Men certainly shy away very quickly from the idea of vasectomy. I still believe we should acknowledge it as a valid way of ensuring pregnancies do not occur.  As I have said, it is important to encourage the idea that men have a responsibility.  A problem in the campaign for safer sex as it relates to men and condoms is that of persuading men to believe it is not less masculine to use a condom.  There are all sorts of <Col N="1239" /> psychological barriers to be overcome in this area.  It is not a question of saying that if my amendment is accepted it is a walk-in-off-the-street, on-demand, service, but it would provide a clear statement that sterilisation for both men and women is an acceptable form of contraception and is and should be available in the comprehensive family planning service, the Minister intends to provide under regulations through our health boards.</P>
      <P>The Minister could easily overcome his fear about the cost by imposing restrictions of one kind or another on such a provision by way of regulation.  It would be quite simple to do that.  By accepting the amendment the Minister would establish the principle of what I am talking about.  He would assist a considerable number of men and women, particularly women who currently have no other effective or appropriate means of avoiding a pregnancy, who cannot afford it at the moment, whose medical condition is such that they are not entitled to it in the medical sense, or there is no threat to their health as the result of not having sterilisation but there may be a threat to their mental health or the stability of the relationship they are in if they do not have such sterilisation.</P>
      <P>The Minister came back to me with some statistics on abortion.  He said 69.3 per cent of women who in 1991 had abortions in Britain were between the ages 20 and 34.  I may have missed some other point the Minister made.  I did not refer at all to ages.  I said that of the 900 women approximately who approached a counselling service in Dublin for information on abortion 300 had children, 600 had no children and of the 300 who had children 100 had three or more children.  One can draw the conclusion that at least some of those are women who are seeking abortion simply because the pregnancy is unwanted and they have completed their families.  It seems that the provision of sterilisation in cases like that would avoid the necessity for women to seek an abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other statistic I referred to was in <Col N="1240" /> relation to the number of married women who had an abortion in Britain.  Approximately one-fifth of the women who had abortions were married.  The statistics are not very reliable and that figure is probably quite low in terms of the real figure. There are probably many reasons an abortion is required or requested but it seems reasonable to assume that a significant number of those married women sought an abortion because they had completed their families.  They did not wish and may not have been in a financial position to have another child.  Therefore, this issue of sterilisation is important.</P>

    <P>This is a fairly standard amendment that I have put down to many Bills over the years.  Where important regulations are being introduced the Dáil should have an opportunity to address and discuss them and propose amendments.  In the normal course of events regulations are made by what is called a negative order; they are put before the House and if they are not rescinded within 21 days they are deemed to have been carried.  I am proposing a positive procedure under which they would have to be brought before the House and discussed.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment particularly in view of the fact that a significant proportion of the development in this area will be made by regulation.  It would be useful to give the House an opportunity to discuss those regulations; perhaps some Friday morning or afternoon could be set aside for this purpose.</P>

I can understand the fears of some Deputies in this regard but they can rest assured that their views will be taken into consideration.</P>

If I, or Deputy Howlin, have an objection to some regulation the Fine <Col N="1243" /> Gael Party may not share their time with us or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>The present system is not really an effective way of considering or approving regulations.  It is a formal way of getting the approval of the House without the House having any input into the framing of the regulations.  I have put forward this view on numerous occasions.  There is a need to change the method of dealing with regulations.  We make many laws by way of regulation and we must find some way to deal with them.  They could be dealt with through a committee system, for example.  We need to devise some system under which the Deputies on this side of the House will have some input into the form, nature and extent of regulations made by Ministers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment refers to the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 which was brought into the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979.  The deletion of the table, as suggested in the amendment, is one of the reforming measures I would have expected the Minister to introduce, as in my view it is an unnecessary provision in a family planning Bill.  On Second Stage I drew attention to the fact <Col N="1244" /> that it could be argued that the Department's own advertising campaign on the question of AIDS could be deemed to be illegal under this section because the section specifically prohibits advertising in relation to sexually transmitted diseases arising from sexual intercourse and, as we know, AIDS, not in all cases but certainly in some, results from sexual intercourse.  It appears to be an unnecessary restriction on the capacity of the Department, the health boards and others to advertise products which could help to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and eliminate the anomaly in the health boards' own advertising campaign which could be deemed to be in breach of the law if someone were to challenge it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 32 in my name and that of Deputy Creed is of similar import.  Essentially, this is an archaic provision in our legislation whereby advertisements which refer or relate to any disease affecting the generative organs of either sex, or to any complaint or infirmity arising from or relating to sexual intercourse, or to the prevention or removal of irregularities in menstruation would be deemed indecent and obscene.  That provision is outdated and no one could conceivably take the view that that should continue to be the law.  The Minister should avail of the opportunity to deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our proposed amendment is more applicable than that proposed by Deputy De Rossa in that his amendment seeks to remove parts of the section that dealt with procuring abortion or miscarriage. As matters now stand I presume we would have to amend the Constitution before we could pass legislation that would change the law in that area.  Therefore, we would need the proposed amendment in the autumn to the existing Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution before we could deal with that element of the table to section 17 of the Censorship of Publications Act.  The Minister should deal with this matter.  It is not a major issue and the House should not delay unduly long on it.  The Minister should <Col N="1245" /> also avail of this opportunity to indicate his intention in relation to section 7 of the Principal Act which deals with the control of advertising and display and notices.  At the conclusion of Second Stage he indicated his intention to change substantially the 1980 regulations in relation to advertisements, notices and display.  Perhaps he would inform the House of his intention in that regard because at the end of Second Stage yesterday he did not make his intention clear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 37 in my name is largely the same as that tabled by Deputies Bruton and Creed.  They seek to amend the section under the Principal Act whereas I seek to amend the initial Act &mdash; the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929.  Section 17 (1) of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, makes interesting reading.  It says that the reference contained in section 3 of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889, to printed matter which is of an indecent or obscene character should be deemed to include advertisements set out in a prescribed list.  Section 3 of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889 states:</P>
      <P>Whoever affixes to or inscribes on any house, building, wall, hoarding, gate, fence, pillar, post, board, tree, or any other thing whatsoever so as to be visible to a person being in or passing along any street, public highway, or footpath, and whoever affixes to or inscribes on any public urinal, or delivers or attempts to deliver, or exhibits, to any inhabitants or to any person being in or passing along any street, public highway, or footpath...</P>
      <P>Therefore anybody making public any of the issues referred to in section 17 of the Censorship of Publications Act would be committing an offence.  The offence could carry imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month with or without hard labour.  It is time we addressed these issues and used the opportunity of this Bill to repeal that section, which has no place in contemporary society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 in my name seeks <Col N="1246" /> to repeal section 5 of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889, which states:</P>
    <P>Any advertisement relating to syphilis, gonorrhoea, nervous debility, or other complaint or infirmity arising from or relating to sexual intercourse, shall be deemed to be printed or written matter of an indecent nature within the meaning of section three of this Act...</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, that is ludicrous in the times in which we live.  I hope the Minister will accept that this legislation is a useful vehicle by which to repeal this legislation which is Victorian in its content. As other Members have said, the real issue here &mdash; while not only bringing the law on these matters into the 20th century but also preparing ourselves for the 21st century &mdash; is to get an indication from the Minister of his intent as regards the possibility of advertising of condoms and contraceptives generally.  We have not reached the section but the Minister indicated on Second Stage that he might be willing to change the legislation so as not to have the blanket prescription that is currently in place.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendments which parallel one another and which have been tabled by Opposition Deputies.</P>

Because of time constraints I was rushed when delivering my speech yesterday and I would like to say something to the Minister now, which I had intended to say yesterday, but did not get an opportunity and which is relevant to this amendment.  For many years Deputy O'Connell aspired to being Minister for Health.  He is a person for whom I have always held, and still hold, a very high regard.  It has always been my belief that Deputy O'Connell should have been made Minister for Health many years ago.

      <P>For many years the Minister and I have been of the one view as to the somewhat ludicrous nature of our legislation in relation to family planning. In the context of bringing this Bill before the House and in the context of changes made he has travelled part of the journey which he would have liked to travel in this area over many years.  This Bill may be the only opportunity we will get during the lifetime of this Dáil to complete that journey.  So far the Minister has been open to constuctive amendments from the Opposition side, and in the context of what I think he personally would like to achieve with the Bill before the House, I invite him to accept Deputy Bruton's amendment.  It is intended to be constructive. Yesterday I raised the issue of anomalies in the law which could remain after the Minister's Bill is enacted.  It is my reading of the position that if this amendment is not adopted part of the campaign the Government have run to date on the AIDS issue will be illegal and possibly open to criminal prosecution for being obscene and indecent.  Indeed, future advertisements by the Government could be similarly open to challenge. This is the only opportunity during the lifetime of this Dáil that we will get to address this issue.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I criticised some comments on the Bill in that Members were dwelling on the issue of AIDS and sexually transmissible diseases &mdash; they are serious and I do not want to diminish that &mdash; and not addressing the simple fact that people make love, happily in the vast majority of cases, without the risk of any disease. They use a condom purely to make love responsibly and to ensure an unwanted pregnancy does not occur.</P>

    <P>Of course, the issue of AIDS, as the Minister and the Minister of State emphasised, is very serious.  I could envisage &mdash; I hope it will happen under this Minister &mdash; the television AIDS campaign that we have stuttered through on and off, becoming a great deal more explicit than it has been to date.  The <Col N="1248" /> Minister's predecessor was somewhat reticent in the way he dealt with the issue which has been far more forthright on British television.</P>
    <P>We may reach the stage &mdash; I would argue that we reached it some time ago &mdash; at which the Government may have to ensure that advertisements on television encouraging people who are engaging in sexual relations to use condoms, describe the dangers of AIDS and the need to ensure that problems do not arise from sexual intercourse.  Legally, with this provision remaining in place, it may not be possible for such advertisements to be carried on the airwaves.  If RTE, for example, are asked to run them they may say they had legal advice to the effect that they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at this amendment in that context.  If Report Stage was taken on another day the Minister would be able to consider this amendment.  However, we are taking all Stages today.  I invite the Minister to take on board amendment No. 32.  I do not think it would get the Minister into any great difficulty or controversy.  I invite him to accept it as a further step along the road to achieving what I think he would like to achieve in this legislation.</P>

      <P>Let me say a few words. The Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889, as amended by the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 is designed to prevent obscene advertisements.  These Acts do not prevent advertising <i>per se.</i>  The amendment proposes the removal of control from the 1979 Act over advertisements in respect of treatment for sexually transmissible diseases and in respect of products designed to prevent or remove irregularities in menstruation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of irregularities of menstruation, I am satisfied that there is no demand at present for the advertising in general of products of this <Col N="1249" /> nature.  These are medicinal products the advertising of which is covered by the Medical Preparations Regulations of 1958, and subsequent amendments to the regulations, and amendments made in 1989 to the Health Act, 1947.  These regulations provide for the appropriate level of advertising to, <i>inter alia</i>, members of the medical profession, the pharmaceutical profession and the nursing profession.  I am satisfied that they meet the general thrust of the Deputies' amendment bearing in mind that the Indecent Advertisements Act, as amended by the Censorship of Publications Act, to which Deputy Howlin referred, is designed to prevent the use of obscene materials in advertising and is not intended to prevent responsible and relevant advertising.</P>
    <P>In regard to advertisements relating to the treatment of sexually transmissible diseases the 1889 and 1929 Acts are not designed to control advertisements by health authorities.  &ldquo;This was reflected in the Dáil debates on the Censorship of Publications Bill when it was stated that the purpose of these Acts is &ldquo;to see that persons suffering from this class of ailment are not at the mercy of quacks who take advantage of their possible reluctance to attend respectable doctors&rdquo;.  It is clear that there is a distinction between the intention of these Acts which does not impinge on the medical or the legitimate and responsible advertising.  If the Deputies' amendments were accepted the way would be open for the possible use of obsence and distasteful material in the advertisements.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the Venereal Diseases Act, 1917.  I remember looking this up in the Library at a time when very few Members knew what we were talking about.  When I first put a question down about the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, 1935 I referred to the fact that I did not see the advertisements in public toilets which should have been there about the availability of sexually transmissible diseases clinics.  The Venereal Diseases Act, 1917 enables the health board to advertise in respect of the treatment of persons suffering from <Col N="1250" /> a venereal disease.  I see no reason for deleting the reference.  However, it is time we insisted on the health boards putting up notices in every public toilet in regard to the availability of these clinics.  I could not understand the reluctance of health boards to do this up to now and I will be making sure that this is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify that point.  The reason this was included in the Health Family Planning Act, 1979 was, persumably, because the promoter of that Bill felt the existing prohibitions prevented any advertising relating to the prevention of conception and decided to remove the notion of deeming advertising that related to preventing conception as being indecent or obscene.  It was for that reason that it arose in the original Act of 1979.  From a layman's reading of the Table in the 1979 Act, it would seem that the mere fact that the advertisement related to or referred to any disease affecting the generative organs or could be reasonably supposed to relate or refer to such was deemed by that fact to be indecent or obscene.  It was not the manner in which it referred to them that was obsene.  The Minister's interpretation does not seem to gel with what was stated in the 1979 Act.  I have not had the opportunity to go back to the earlier 1929 Act to see if that is the case but the extract that was brought into the 1979 Act would certainly suggest that any advertisement that referred in any way to a disease affecting the generative organs and so on was, <i>ipso facto</i>, indecent and obscene.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Minister is not accepting the amendments.  Table 17.  &mdash;(1) in section 12 (2) of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 says quite clearly:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference contained in section 3 of the Indecent Advertisements Act, 1889, to printed matter which is of an indecent or obscene character shall be deemed to include advertisements which relate or refer or may be reasonably supposed to relate or refer to any <Col N="1251" /> disease affecting the generative organs of either sex, or to any complaint or infirmity arising from or relating to sexual intercourse, or to the prevention or removal of irregularities in menstruation, or to drugs, medicines, appliances, treatment or methods of procuring abortion or miscarriage.</P>
    <P>It seems obvious that it should be deleted.  I do not understand the Minister's resistance.  It does not make sense to have it there.  If we want to seriously open up society &mdash; the Minister said yesterday that we have to stop regarding sex as sinful &mdash; we have to get away from the notion that the matters referred to here are automatically deemed to be obscene.  It does not make sense to retain this table.</P>

I looked at the 1889 Act, as amended by the 1929 Act and as incorporated in the 1979 Act, and I am still not sure why this table is being retained.  The Minister said that under the 1917 Act, which I do not have, health boards are empowered to advertise products for the treatment of venereal diseases. Why is this Victorian phraseology, which was dragged into the 1979 Act, being left in place?  Why should individual companies, subject to the ordinary obscenity laws, not be allowed to advertise products if they wish to do so?  As I said, this Victorian phraseology &mdash; I have read it out already and I do not wish to repeat it &mdash; was dragged into the 1979 Act and it is now proposed to leave it in place.  I am at a loss to understand why this is necessary.  The Minister has given no cogent reason why this phraseology should be left in place.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief as I am conscious that there are other matters with which we want to deal.  I wish to point out to the Minister that a condom is not a medical preparation; under this legislation it will not require a prescription unless a person is under 17 years of age.  I believe there is a misunderstanding in the section.  The point I am making is that an advertising campaign which encourages people to use condoms as a protection against AIDS will fall foul of this provision because by its very nature it will be deemed to be indecent or obscene.  In effect, this is what will criminalise the campaign.  It may very well be decided to make health boards immune from this provision.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill the Minister can, so to speak, farm out functions.  In some cases other groups might perform these functions. There seems to be a problem with this proposal.  I do not want to labour the point any further; I merely want to say to the Minister that he should look at this provision between now and the time the Bill goes into the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to delete lines 8 to 12 of section 3 (1) (b) on page 3 and substitute the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 13, in the names of Deputies Bruton, Creed and De Rossa, is basically the same.  The only net difference between the two amendments is the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; which would make the section read better.  The net impact of these amendments would be to remove the proposed age limit.  Section 3 (1) (b) (i) (V) provides that:</P>
      <P>the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is over the age of 17 years or married or is named in a prescription or authorisation in writing for the contraceptives of a registered medical practitioner....</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of agreement on both sides of the House about this issue, which was debated at length.  I think we all agreed that contraception should be available to those who are sexually active.  I do not think anyone argued against this point.</P>

      <P>This very important amendment should be taken on board by the Minister.  The age limit will be unenforceable in practice.  It could be counterproductive in that it could be interpreted as meaning that when people reach the age of 17 they have a licence to adopt a less responsible attitude to their sexual behaviour.  The notion of age limits in our criminal law relating to how young people should address their sexual responsibilities is inappropriate and could be counterproductive.</P>
      <P>The age limit will mean that sales of condoms will have to be conducted over the counter because there will be a responsibility on the shop owner to assess the age of the purchaser.  A supermarket owner would have some difficulty in putting condoms for sale on a shelf because he would have to see that purchaser, eyeball to eyeball.  The whole thing is foolish and will be unworkable, putting barriers in the way of young people who are sexually active acquiring contraceptives. It will drag back the whole purpose for which the Minister introduced the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important amendments to this Bill. The idea that one can regulate sexual activity by way of some artificial age cutoff point is not valid.  Boys and girls mature at different ages.  There is no point at which we can say that a boy or girl is mature enough, by reference to chronological age.  To introduce an age limit in relation to the supply of a contraceptive is mistaken.  It will certainly not improve the sexual maturity of the individual.  We all know men who are twice or three times 17 years of age and are sexually immature in their attitude. Some people under 17 may be regarded as more mature in their attitude to sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age restriction does not apply to married people.  This means that a young person under the age of 17 going into a supermarket or a newsagent will have to prove he or she is married to be entitled to purchase condoms.  It is likely that the person serving in the shop will be older <Col N="1256" /> and the situation could clearly be embarrassing. The whole thing is a nonsense. We cannot hope to regulate the sexual activity of young people by applying an artificial age limit.  Responsible attitudes to sex must be developed by way of education, primarily in the home.  We should not necessarily lay the responsibility on the teachers in schools.  The schools can do very little to reverse a bad attitude developed in a home environment.</P>
    <P>The application of this age limit is foolish for a further reason: to a large extent it will be unenforceable.  I cannot imagine that a garda will prosecute a young person who misrepresented his age or marital status to a shopkeeper.  It is wrong to include provisions in our laws simply for the optics, to satisfy the view that young people are promiscuous.  According to the Irish Family Planning Association, only 15 per cent of people who go to them in relation to pregnancy are teenagers.  The myth that our young population are extraordinarily promiscuous is not borne out by statistics.  It is wrong to incorporate this age limit in legislation.</P>

      <P>I am a little concerned about the policing of this section.  The Minister might indicate the number of prosecutions of 18 year olds since condoms became available for sale in pharmacies. Today I called to a pharmacist to find out what her reaction would be in relation to policing the age of 17.  She replied, &ldquo;An old one like me is not going to ask any young girl or fellow what his or her age is.&rdquo;  If they ask for a condom she will serve them regardless.  That begs the question as to who will police this regulation.</P>
      <P>The section also refers to authorisation by way of a GP's prescription.  Would this mean that a sexually active person under the age of 17 could avail of a condom with such a prescription?  If the Minister wants to achieve the objectives he laid down on Second Stage, why include the age restriction?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Minister also agrees but he has probably put in this age limit to keep some foolish people happy, whether in his own party or elsewhere.  It will be impossible to regulate it.  People under the age of 17 who are not sexually active will not be wasting their money on condoms or any other contraceptives.  But, if they are sexually active, they will need them and the Bill should provide for that.  This Bill is ruined through the exclusion of certain people who would require the use of contraceptives from being able to avail of them.  For health and other reasons that destroys the Minister's own case.  If he excludes one person he is destroying his case on health grounds.</P>
    <P>I expected a ministerial amendment to be tabled in regard to this.  The case hadbeen made so strongly I thought the Minister would have taken it on board, particularly when a Member of his own party made such a strong case, and is making quite a strong case here again today on behalf of quite a number of people in his party.  I should have thought the Minister would have dropped the inclusion of any age limit.  I do not see the need for such or for the reference to any age limit at all.  The Minister's stated purpose in introducing this Bill on Second Stage will be lost to a certain small number of people, by the inclusion of an age limit.  Indeed some 17, 18 or even 19-year-olds could be denied contraceptives in that they might well appear to be 16 years of age to some pharmacist or whoever.  We are supposed to be making contraceptives available to people who require them which will serve the purposes the Minister had in mind in introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to re-examine this and delete any reference to an age limit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this at some length on Second Stage and will not repeat myself other than to point out a number of realities.  The first reality is that in the period 1981 to 1990, inclusive, a total of 5,818 children were born to mothers of 17 years of age and under outside marriage; that is 550 children a <Col N="1258" /> year.  Some of those were born to mothers of 17 years of age but, of their very nature, they would have been conceived when the young teenage girls concerned were 16 years of age.  Indeed the statistics cover even younger girls; I think the youngest births were to girls under 14 years of age.  I do not want to go into it in any greater detail than to point out that there is a reality, the reality being that there are a substantial number of children being born outside marriage to young girls who either do not have the information available to them to take responsible decisions or do not have the facility to implement the decisions they may wish to take.  I do not think any of us would encourage our 15 or 16-year-old daughters to engage in sexual intercourse but, if they did, I would prefer that at least they would have the facility to take precautions.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that there is a fantasy element about all of this.  As the Minister well knows &mdash; and I think he said himself &mdash; the age limit is unenforceable in any case.  How can one stop a 16-year-old getting a condom?  If he goes into a chemist shop will he have to produce his birth certificate?  If an 18-year-old buys a condom and gives it to a 16-year-old will the Garda investigate the matter?  We all know this age limit is ludicrous.  Why do we have to retain it in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least there would be some consistency if it were totally unlawful for persons under 17 years of age to obtain contraceptives.  I want to deal with the issue of condoms, which appear to constitute the most simplistic issue but, of course, they do not.  For some years persons under 18 years of age have been able to obtain condoms lawfully if a doctor issued a prescription for them.  I would be astonished if there were a single doctor anywhere in this State who has ever written a prescription for contraceptives for someone under 18 years of age, or ever been asked to do so.  Now it is proposed to lower the age limit to 17, when the position will be that anyone over 17 can get a condom by walking into the local pub or grocers and asking for one but <Col N="1259" /> someone under 17 can get one by way of medical prescription.  What is the point in that?  Why maintain a legal fantasy or fiction that just holds us up to ridicule, which I suggest does not allow the Minister complete the job I feel he wants to do.</P>
    <P>The position would be even partially understandable if we said: all under 17-year-olds always had to get prescriptions for condoms if they wanted them.  I would think that was nuts, but some people might think there was an element of rationality in it.  What happens when the average 15 or 16 old is fortunate enough to be able to go off with his local schoolboy soccer team on a trip to England? He might play a match, see Spurs, Manchester United or Liverpool play on a Saturday afternoon.  Before or after the match that 15 or 16 year old can walk into Boots chemists in Manchester, London, Birmingham or wherever he is, buy a condom, bring it into this State and do what he wants with it.  What happens if he is stopped at customs?  He is a traveller and travellers have had a special position under the terms of this legislation since 1979; because he is a traveller he does not require a prescription.  In fact he could bring in a suitcase of condoms at the age of 14, if he wished, when the only action a customs officer could take would be to ask him whether they were for his own use and, if he said they were, on he would go, condoms and all.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows it makes no sense to retain this provision in this Bill.  From the enlightened contributions &mdash; and in the context of my past experience of the Minister's party I would have to say the surprisingly enlightened contributions coming from behind him &mdash; it is quite clear now most Members of his party accept social reality.  Let us delete this subscription from the Bill.  Let us provide education for life to discourage young people from engaging in sexual activity at too early on age.  If they persist in behaving in a way that they deem appropriate, that perhaps older adults do not deem appropriate, at least let us facilitate them in taking precautions.  Let us <Col N="1260" /> remove the fictions from the Bill.  Why should the 14 or 15 year old schoolboy league soccer player, returning from England, be able to travel into Ireland with a suitcase full of condoms while his compatriot, who lives next door, who is not perhaps as successful a soccer player, who may have managed to get on the reserves of the team only, who was not taken away, have to go to his doctor to get a prescription legally to obtain one?</P>

      <P>I agree with the observations of previous speakers in relation to the age limit.  The inclusion of an age limit in this Bill is daft and is completely out of touch with the views of the public at large.  This is probably the only assembly in this country which would insist on such an age limit, if that is what it does.  For example, one could walk into any community hall, take a random sample of any group of people, when I believe their view would be that the age limit is unenforceable, unnecessary and should not be included.  Of course, it is a product of a point of view rapidly losing currency, which is that if one excludes an age limit in some way one is conferring some kind of State approval on sexual activity under the age of 17.  The fact of the matter is that one cannot legislate one way or the other for sexual activity. It is a fact that many young people under the age of 17 are sexually active.  That fact is very evident from the numbers of young girls under the age of 17 who become pregnant.</P>

    <P>If we are to do something by way of legislation it should be to encourage a responsible attitude to sexual activity. We may have differing views about the question of responsibility of 15 and 16-year olds.  Whether it be responsible of them to be sexually active in the first place, it is irresponsible of them to be sexually active without using contraceptives. Whether or not they are irresponsible by being sexually active in the first place, they are certainly irresponsible if they do not use contraceptives. The State is being irresponsible by attempting to prevent access to contraceptives by people who <Col N="1261" /> are sexually active.  We are creating a climate in which people under 17 years, who are becoming sexually active for the first time, will engage in unsafe and unprotected sex because the State says they cannot have access to contraceptives. It is irresponsible of the State to encourage that and it is out of touch with the views of the majority of Irish people.  This House should respond to the mood of the people on this issue and not insert a provision in legislation that relates to a different age and a different perception of morality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>This area has been well covered and I appeal to the Minister to take on board the views that have been expressed.  I made the point on a previous amendment that we must legislate for reality; and one of the glaring realities in the statistics which have been highlighted throughout this debate is that, whether we like it or not, young people under 17 years are sexually active.  Are we prepared to expose those people to the risks involved in unprotected sex or to provide them with access to contraceptives which will reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases? That is the fundamental question facing the Minister in deciding whether he should accept the amendment before him.</P>
      <P>We have another important duty in regard to this amendment.  We often despair of the levels of cynicism and apathy displayed towards politics and politicians but; if we persist in passing legislation which is clearly farcical in its content, we will bring oursleves into disrepute and generate further cynicism, apathy and disrespect for this legislative Chamber.  It is pointless passing laws which are patently unworkable and which cannot be policed.  We have ample evidence of this in the area of alcohol abuse and teenage drinking in that the law which makes it illegal to sell alcohol to people under 18 years has proved to be totally unenforceable.  We are now heading down the same road with regard to access to contraceptives for people under 17 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1262" /> We must ask ourselves what sort of signal this will send out to young people. Will they assume that in some way we are saying it is correct and proper to embark on sexual intercourse and sexual relationships at 17 years?  We are all aware that when one reaches the age of 17 one can apply for a driving test and that at 18 one can legally purchase alcohol. If we persist in enforcing an age limit of 17 years in this legislation it will register in young people's minds that the State is giving legal access to contraceptives at 17 years and the peer pressure mentioned earlier will come into play.  It would be far better if this legislation made contraceptives available to all those who are sexually active.  As proposed in a previous amendment which the Minister did not accept, we should, in conjunction with the Department of Education, embark upon a proper life skills, sex education programme which would educate people for a proper and healthier attitude towards their own sexuality.</P>

      <P>We have advanced a good deal since then and I think most Members would agree with that.

Deputies should reconsider this matter, but I am aware of the negative attitude of some Members.  What would have happened if I had deregulated all contraceptives?  I am not legislating for Dublin 4, Dublin 6 or County Dublin.  It is understandable that parents have fears for their young children.

Most of this debate has been conducted in a very constructive manner with people congratulating the Minister on the concessions he has been willing to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility, as a Minister in charge of public health, to educate people.  If parents approach the Minister with fears, he must educate them and tell them that one will not create sexual responsibility through the criminal law.  The Minister must teach them that sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, do not respect age or regulations that a Minister may like to impose.  Young people, whatever their age, are at risk.  They are sexually active, are having unwanted pregnancies and are <Col N="1268" /> contracting sexually transmitted diseases. The Minister has not defended his position today.</P>
    <P>The only voices I have heard from Fianna Fáil have advocated change in respect of vending machines and in respect of the age limit.

      <P>I am quite taken aback by the response of the Minister who has put no cogent reasons before the House as to why there should be an age limit.  A great number of people fit into the category whom the Minister describes.  I represent a rural constituency.  It is not a Dublin 4 or an urban clamour to have this change made in the Bill.  Not one speaker on either Committee or Second Stages argued in favour of the retention of this age limit, so why is it there?  The Minister's heart is not in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated to the House that we would take it step by step and that we could have another Bill next year to reduce the age to 16.  It is wrong to signal any age.  Many people fit into the category of whom the Minister talks. They would be concerned about any age being put in, because of the signal that gives, that sexual activity at 17 or 16, or whatever age the Minister puts in, is permissible.  It is better to have no age. The only criteria should be that young people who are sexually active would have condoms or other contraceptives available to them, particularly in the light of the Minister's argument from the outset that his primary motivation is the battle against AIDS.  Why should anyone be vulnerable to AIDS?  Should somebody under 17 be made vulnerable because we have some difficulties or <Col N="1269" /> hang-ups in relation to removing the age barrier in other legislation?</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the history of this.  I quoted the 1985 contributions from the other side of the House the last time we discussed this issue.  They were nothing short of cynical and disgraceful. Today's debate has been characterised by a different ethos.  There has been consensus and support from this side of the House.  We have asked the Minister to address a few fundamental issues and this is one of them.  In the six minutes remaining I am sure all Members want to address the vending machine issue.  Will the Minister give us a commitment that he will consider this between now and bringing the Bill before the Seanad?</P>
    <P>The consensus from every Member who spoke on Second and Committee Stages &mdash; and I have been here throughout &mdash; was that we make this change. The Minister believes in making it.  The Minister in his light-hearted story about his trip to America said the Taoiseach said he would allow vending machines in certain circumstances.  If the Taoiseach is the problem, or if any other member of the Cabinet is the problem, let us identify that, otherwise the Minister should act on the consensus expressed in this House on this issue.</P>

Deputies should not give the impression that, if we do as Deputy Mac Giolla suggests and abolish the age limit, we will be free of the problem.  That is not true.</P>
      <P>In Ireland in 1990, 697 girls under 16 years of age gave birth.  Are the Opposition Deputies saying that if contraception were available to everybody that figure would be wiped out?</P>

      <P>No, it would not.  We must take account of everybody's views. Deputies expressed the view that there should be no age limit, but I represent a great many people who would not agree with that viewpoint.  As I said yesterday, I support this Bill on health grounds.  I agree that if contraceptives were available to people of 17 years and upwards this would reduce the problem but it certainly will not wipe it out.</P>

      <P>The last speaker's contribution was extraordinary.  I represent the same constituency as Deputy Barrett and never in the ten years that I have represented the constituency did a <Col N="1271" /> single parent come to me demanding there should be an age limit for those wishing to buy condoms.  Hundreds of parents have told me &mdash; and I am a parent of teenagers myself &mdash; they would be very pleased if their children acted responsibly and used condoms when sexually active. No parent wants his or her child to become pregnant or make a young girl pregnant.  They would prefer that the young person would use condoms if sexually active.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says that the metropolis is more decadent than the rest of Ireland, let me remind him of the notorious case of the 15 year old girl from Granard who died giving birth in the middle of a field. Let us not assert that sex does not exist outside Dublin.  As far as I can see, there is only one person in the Chamber who lives in Dublin 4, I live in Dublin 11 and the remaining Deputies come from outside Dublin city.  It is not a question of Dublin <i>versus</i> the rest.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Deputy &mdash; there are two Members present from Dublin 4.  May I appeal to the Minister to drop this hypocritical nonsense of limiting condoms to those of 17 years and upwards.  May I also appeal to the Minister to drop this nonsense of not making condoms available through vending machines.  It is nonsense.  The argument the Minister made yesterday that it would help us to mature if we had to ask for a condom across the counter is too much. We have a great deal more to do in terms of having a mature attitude to our sexuality than simply asking people to purchase a condom across the counter. While we do that there are young, middle aged and elderly people who are sexually active but will not ask for a packet of condoms across the counter.  They should be provided with a simple means of purchasing condoms in private.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 19: In page 15, between lines 10 and 11, the following subsections inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a) Section 31 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph after paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>`(c) A notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be served after&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) if the permission to which the condition is attached is a permission other than of the kind referred to in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the date of the expiration, as respects the permission, of the appropriate period (within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982) or, as the case may be, of the said period as extended under section 4 of the said Act,</P>
      <P>(ii) if the permission to which the condition is attached is a permission for the retention on land of any structure, the expiration of a period of five years beginning on the day of the grant of the permission.'.</P>
      <P>(b) Section 32 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraph after paragraph (b):</P>
      <P>`(c) A notice referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection shall not be served after the expiration of a period of five years beginning on the day of the grant of the permission referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection.'.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) This subsection shall have effect as respects a condition referred to in section 31 or 32 of the Principal Act which is not complied with before or <Col N="1277" /> after the commencement of this subsection.</P>
    <P>(2) (a)  Section 35 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsection after subsection (9):</P>
    <P>`(10) An enforcement notice shall not be served in relation to any development authorised by a permission granted under this Part of this Act which has been commenced but has not been carried out in conformity with such permission after the expiration of a period of five years beginning on the expiration, as respects such permission, of the appropriate period (within the meaning of section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1982) or, as the case may be, of the said period as extended under section 4 of the said Act.'.</P>
    <P>(b) This subsection shall have effect as respects development referred to in the subsection inserted in section 35 of the Principal Act by paragraph (a) which is carried out before or after the commencement of this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Whips of all the political parties for their co-operation in facilitating me in getting time, despite the pressure of business, to conclude these amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>These amendments are concerned with two matters.  In the first place they seek to bring about greater uniformity and consistency in relation to the time within which enforcement action may be taken by planning authorities by putting a time limit on the use of those powers which are open-ended at present.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the warning notice procedure under section 26 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, will be strengthened by allowing a planning authority to serve a notice where they believe that an unauthorised use is likely to be made of land.  At the moment a warning notice can be served in relation to unauthorised <Col N="1278" /> use only where the use is actually taking place.  Looking first at time limits for enforcement action, I should say initially that these proposals take account of the desire underlying an amendment which Deputy Brendan Howlin put forward when the Bill was before the Dáil, that it should not be possible to challenge a development's validity after an unduly long time.  I had hoped to bring forward amendments on the matter when the Bill was before the Dáil but it was not possible to finalise them in time.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain that certain powers which planning authorities can use against unauthorised development or development which does not conform to the terms of relevant planning permission are already subject to a time limit.  For example, an enforcement notice under section 31 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, can be served against an unauthorised development only within five years of the carrying out of that development. However, other enforcement powers such as the application to the High Court for an order under section 27 of the 1976 Act are not subject to any time limitations. There is no doubt that the open-ended nature of some of the enforcement powers gives rise to serious practical difficulties, particularly in the area of property transactions.  This led the Law Reform Commission to recommend in their report on land law and conveyancing law that a five-year limit should be put on the bringing of applications for court orders under section 27 of the 1976 Act.  These amendments propose that the five-year limit currently applicable to some of the enforcement powers will be extended to the open-ended power.  I believe this will bring about greater clarity and consistency.  I am satisfied also that this will not adversely affect the ability of planning authorities to police the proper planning and development of their areas if an unauthorised or non-conforming development or use has not come to attention or been the subject of enforcement action within five years.  It is most unlikely to be problematical from the <Col N="1279" /> point of view of the proper planning and development of the location concerned.</P>
    <P>I should add that it is my intention that these new time limits generally will not come into operation until the start of 1994, so that the planning authorities can take action in the intervening period in relation to any long-standing planning infringement of which they may be aware or which is brought to their attention before then.</P>
    <P>As for the proposed strengthening of section 26 of the 1976 Act, the present position is that a planning authority can serve a warning notice where it appears to them that unauthorised development of land is likely to take place.  However, they can serve a notice in the case of an unauthorised use of land only if the use is actually occurring.  The amendment will change matters by also allowing a notice to be served where the authority consider that an unauthorised use is likely to be made of land.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 will put a five year limitation running from the expiration of the planning permission and the time within which a notice under section 35 of the 1963 Act can be served where development has not been carried out in conformity with the permission.  This amendment also proposes related changes to the existing time limits under sections 31 and 32 of the 1963 Planning Act for taking action against development which does not comply with the terms of a condition attached to a planning permission.  The current formulation of the time limit in those sections means that they are effectively open-ended so far as conditions are concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a minor consequential drafting change arising from these other amendments.  Amendment No. 3 proposes that it will be possible to serve a warning notice under section 26 of the 1976 Planning Act in relation to unauthorised use of land only within five years of when the unauthorised use first commenced.  Amendment No. 4 will place a time limit of five years on applications to the courts for orders under section 27 of the 1976 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments which, as the Minister said, are in response to an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage when it was a cause of concern to me, and my party, that there was an open-ended provision for enforcement orders by local authorities for unauthorised developments.  This meant that great difficulty was being experienced by persons wishing to buy or sell property to obtain clarification that there was no problem with planning permission. As each year passed since the original planning Acts those difficulties were being compounded.</P>
      <P>I originally sought to have a 12 year limit.  The Minister has introduced a much shorter limit today justified, no doubt, by the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and also his wish to dovetail limits so that there would be uniformity and there is certain merit in that.  I hope the Minister has not gone too far by reducing the limit to five years. Certainly a limit was required and I had hoped that my suggestion of a 12 year timescale would have been adequate to provide sufficient scope for local authorities to police planning applications and any unauthorised developments and, at the same time, enable people buying and selling property to prove that they complied fully with the planning requirements without resorting to exorbitant expense or facing insurmountable difficulties. I do not oppose the suggestion put forward by the Minister.  I welcome the fact that he kept to his commitment to me that he would reconsider the amendment despite the fact that it was not formally moved in the House due to the guillotine imposed on our debating time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise two further related matters. One issue which causes me and many people concern in relation to planning is the use of the retention mechanisms by developers who seek to circumvent proper planning by building without authority and then applying retrospectively for retention.  This feature is all too prevalent in planning authorities across the country.  Unfortunately, the embargo on staff recruitment to local <Col N="1281" /> authorities over recent years has meant that every Department, but particularly planning, has suffered.  Thankfully in my own local authority there has been a huge growth in planning applications which is a sign of development and growth but, unfortunately, there has been a reduction in the staff available to process those applications.  On 1 June last new planning regulations were introduced which are very complex and comprehensive.  As we introduce more regulations, more legislation and as we move toward closer integration within the European Community, additional powers will be devolved to local planning authorities who will require staff and resources.  It is unfair to expect planning personnel in many counties to come in early, work overtime and through weekends in order to meet the statutory deadlines involved in determining planning applications.  I have no doubt that even the most enthusiastic, dedicated and willing public servants at local level will frequently be required to take short cuts in relation to the full investigation of planning applications if they are to comply with the statutory limits we are imposing upon local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes that are being put to the House.  I am cautious, however, about the proposed five year limit rather than my suggestion of 12 years but I accept the principle that there should be a finite time in which enforcement orders require to be acted upon.  I urge the Minister to examine the staffing problem in all planning departments. Proper planning is an absolute essential in relation to the future development of our country.  We are now environmentally sensitive and aware.  Most planning authorities have produced plans of the type of developments they require and are trying to meet the needs of people who wish to discuss proper developments with them.  However, they do not have the time, the resources or the facilities to discuss developments and proposed plans with people in advance of the submission of planning applications.  That is a mistake.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the <Col N="1282" /> possibility of establishing planning clinics, an issue that I raised during the debate on this Bill, and authorise and staff a facility in planning authorities for citizens making planning applications to discuss those applications and their implications with professional staff in advance of submitting them and before being required to pay a fee.  This would save a great deal of bother and, ultimately, much expense.  I thank the Minister for remaining true to his word in accepting the spirit of the amendment tabled by me on Committee Stage, sending it to the Seanad and returning it to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be brief. These amendments to the principal Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and the 1976 Act are broadly welcome.  Deputy Howlin has dealt with the first amendment which introduces the five year limit in relation to actions taken under the powers in these Acts.  I share his concern about the limit not being sufficiently long.  Unfortunately, due to my late arrival, I did not have time to read the Law Reform Commission's report on this issue.  In Finglas, which has both new and old developments, we have a very old industrial estate containing buildings that have stood for quite a long time.  It is only as time passes that we realise some of the difficulties we have with developments there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the implementation date is being deferred until 1994 will allow a reasonable time, provided local authorities are aware that there is a need for a thorough review of all outstanding actions or potential actions which they may wish to bring forward in advance.  It will also put pressure on them to be more professional and efficient and to realise that they must act within a reasonable time.  I welcome the other substantial amendment which ensures that they may act in anticipation of an authorised development.  It can become very difficult if one has to wait until a problem arises before taking action, when all the indications are that one is heading for a problem. <Col N="1283" /> For example, it had been publicised in our area that a snooker hall was being developed and, until it was actually commenced, we could not initiate the proceedings to close it down.  This development was to take place at my parents' back door and was very close to the house of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's sister in what had been a quiet industrial estate. This provision will be a welcome additional power.</P>
    <P>By and large we are happy with these amendments.  We need to watch how the five year rule operates in practice.  If the Planning Acts are to operate efficiently, one of the most important requirements is that they protect people.  People should have sufficient information on what is being proposed in their areas because they are the best policers of the good development of their area.  While I gather the Minister did not accept the Fine Gael amendment in relation to notices on adjoining properties, this is the single most important concession to give to people.  I understand he has indicated a willingness to do that by means of regulation.  That is something that will greatly improve the application of the Planning Acts.</P>

I accept there must be some time limit but I do not agree that it should be five years; rather it should be 12 years, in spite of what the Law Reform Commission said. On balance, in view of the huge difference between five and 12 years, it would be much better to leave the Bill as it is.  This Bill is being described as a retentionist charter.  The Bill failed to address the problem of retention.  I feel the question of retention will become considerably worse, because amendment No. 1 (a) (ii) states:</P>
      <P>... the expiration of a period of five years beginning on the day of the grant of the permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The Minister is aware that planning permission does not have to be taken up for a period of five years.  Surely, whatever time limit is to be imposed under this section should run from the date of completion, not from the date of the grant of planning permission.  If this requires a register of completions to be commenced by local authorities to record when planning permissions are actually completed, then so be it.  To make it five years from the granting of planning permission is a nonsense.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Howlin and Deputy Flaherty for their strong support for these amendments.  In regard to retention of planning permission, clearly it is a provision we should retain and I am sure we do not disagree on that point. People can from time to time inadvertently carry out development for one reason or another and we want to continue to allow for that.</P>

      <P>I take it Deputy Howlin is referring to what one would call the flagrant abuse of the planning code. Nobody is suggesting there should be an automatic amnesty in these situations. Clearly, applications for retention of planning permission in such situations must be rigorously examined and prosecutions may take place for unauthorised developments.  As Deputy Howlin is aware, I have made provision for very substantial fines for offences of that kind in the future.</P>

      <P>The provision we are dealing with indirectly helps staff in the planning authority because it means they are not subjected to pressure to go back to 1964 to check out improper transactions or whether there had been absolute adherence to planning permissions.  In some way that is helpful.  I take on board the suggestion with regard to facilitating the public on advice before applications are made for planning permission.  As recently as last January a further circular <Col N="1285" /> was issued to local authorities advising that as far as possible the conslutative process before applications are made should be widened to the greatest possible extent. I am very interested in monitoring such developments because it can ensure that applications requiring detailed attention could be dealt with and errors made at the beginning could be rectified at an earlier stage, thus satisfying the conditions and everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the reference on both Second and Committee Stages to the regulations on public notices, Deputy Flaherty can rest assured that I want the most transparent system possible.  Over the next couple of months I will try to ensure that the new regulations take account of broadly held views to ensure that people in the locality know exactly what is taking place and will have a reasonable opportunity to assess it in good time and take appropriate action. Deputy Garland and I can differ and we will probably continue down that road. He too will appreciate that in a great number of areas we have improved, and will continue to improve, the system by way of regulation to ensure that it is an open, fair and balanced one.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 will add a new paragraph to subsection (3) of section 24 of the Bill, which deals with commencement matters.  This is a technical drafting change.  The purpose is to make it clear that the various elements of subsection (6) of the new section 27 being inserted into the 1976 Act can be brought into operation on different days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should first explain that up to now enforcement action under section 27 (1) (a) of the 1976 Act could only be taken in respect of unauthorised development which is actually in progress.  I refer here to development which has no planning permission.  This Bill extends section 27 (1) (a) to enable action to be taken against unauthorised development completed after the passage of this Bill.  I intend to introduce the five year limitation on that kind of enforcement action right away.  However, in respect of enforcement action which could have been taken before the passage of this Bill <Col N="1286" />&mdash; that is, seeking court orders in relation to unauthorised use of land or development which does not comply with planning permission &mdash; I intend to bring these provisions into operation after 1994 so that planning authorities can take action in the intervening period against any long standing planning contraventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very serious matter.  On 30 June I asked the following question of the Minister for Education: &ldquo;if he will outline the circumstances in which a 17 year old person (details supplied) has not received any formal education since before his thirteenth birthday and if he will make a statement on the matter.&rdquo;  The reply was: <Col N="1289" />&ldquo;I am having the matter raised by the Deputy investigated and I will advise him of the outcome as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, let me give the facts as I understand them.  My constituent was born in December 1974, so he will be 18 years old in December 1992.  The last time he received formal education was in December 1987, just short of his 13th birthday. That was over four and a half years ago and more than two years short of the compulsory education age.  My constituent has suffered from epilepsy since he was four or five years old.  At first he was assessed as mildly handicapped, then as moderately handicapped.</P>
      <P>The letter to his parents from his last school, dated 21 December, 1987 stated:</P>
      <P>At our school board of management meeting today, December 21st, 1987, the situation regarding ... was discussed at length.  Many factors were taken into consideration &mdash; his needs, the safety and welfare of students and staff in the school, the existing staffing of the school.  It was the unanimous decison of the board, having considered each of the above, to discharge him from the school.</P>
      <P>I would like to say that this decision, was only reached after a lengthy discussion of all aspects of his case.  We are notifying the Department of Education and the school inspector accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His parents have made strenuous efforts over the years to have him placed in suitable education and continue to this day to make strenuous efforts, including coming to me just over two weeks ago.  I have a letter, dated 11 March, 1988, from the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Difficulties in reply to a letter from the mother.  She was constantly writing to the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, and to another Deputy in this House.  For example, I have a letter here from the Minister, dated 30 November, 1988, where reference is made as follows: &ldquo;your further letter of 22 November, 1988&rdquo;. Over that long period of time she was <Col N="1290" /> being informed by a Minister and a Deputy that &ldquo;the Minister is having inquiries made and a further letter will be sent to you as soon as possible&rdquo;. Indeed, it is no different really from the reply I received last week.</P>
    <P>The State, Sir, has responsibility to provide education, to make education available, and education is compulsory up to 15 years of age.  I accuse the State of being negligent in its responsibility to provide education for my constituent and in so doing I also lay responsibility on the Department of Education, the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and now the current Minister, Deputy Brennan. As a so-called caring society we have a special responsibility to look after the less fortunate in our society and this includes those who are handicapped.  I want an explanation and I want the situation remedied on behalf of my constituent and his parents, even at this late stage.  He and his parents are determined that he should receive the education to which he was and is entitled.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am conscious of the fact that unfortunately my time is running out and I am not able to say at this stage what I strongly feel I should be saying in relation to this matter.  I will just say in conclusion that no matter how severely handicapped a child is, he or she can be educated and is entitled to education in the same way as any other child.  My constituent was and is only moderately handicapped, so there are no excuses at all.  I demand justice for my constituent from the Minister and his Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The boy in question was originally a pupil in the Presentation Convent Primary School, Lucan.  Following assessment by Stewart's Hospital, Palmerstown, in 1981, he was enrolled in St. Joseph's Special School, Tallaght, as <Col N="1291" /> a child with mild mental handicap.  After attendence for some time at St. Joseph's, the school authorities sought a more suitable placement for him as his aggression was not manageable and was a source of danger to staff and other pupils.  Accordingly, Stewart's Hospital were asked to re-assess him in July 1986.</P>
    <P>Following that assessment the boy commenced in Stewart's Hospital Special School in January 1987.  His aggressive behaviour continued and medication was prescribed to control his behaviour.  In November 1987 he drew a knife in the school and arrangements were made for a nurse to be in constant attendance with him.  However, he continued to pose a danger to staff and other pupils and was discharged in December 1987.</P>
    <P>In January 1988 the boy was referred to St. Loman's Special School for emotionally disturbed children, but I understand that the parents declined the offer.  I further understand that Stewart's Hospital wrote to the parents with a view to arranging a meeting in January 1990 to discuss the boy's return to the special school there.  It appears, however, that the parents were unable to attend.</P>
    <P>In February 1990 a social worker from Stewart's Hospital visited the parents to see what arrangements could be made to have the boy reassessed with a view to having him re-enrolled in the school.  His mother expressed the view that she would like him to be placed in a workshop type environment.  She did not see any point in his return to formal schooling.  Usually those attending workshops are aged 18 years or over.  It is understood that Stewart's Hospital have been considering the possibility of the boy's placement in their workshop or vocational training centre as he will be 18 years at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Department's inspector has been requested to ascertain the current position and I will advise the Deputy when this has been established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity, before the House goes into recess, of raising this very important issue of the problems associated with the shortage of cars for hire during the peak periods of July and August.  This crucial component of our tourism strategy has failed us again this year.  I would like to ask the Minister how it is possible not to have successfully tackled this problem, which has recurred over the last three years.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to agree that it is not good enough, when all the other sectors of the industry are working all out to attract visitors to our country, that this effort should be jeopardised because tourists, having had Ireland sold to them successfully as a destination and having confirmed their intention of coming, cannot be guaranteed a car for hire.  The problem is affecting French and Italian tourists very badly.</P>
      <P>This is a disgraceful situation which cannot be allowed to continue.  I ask the Minister to explain how he can attract the number of tourists required to fill our hotels and guesthouses, in which millions of pounds have been invested, if tourists cannot find a car in which to travel the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter with the Minister before and I was assured that the problem would be under control this year, that £1 million was being set aside in the budget to address the car hire shortage during the peak tourist months of July and August this year.  It clearly has not worked in so far as it has not solved the problem.  Every year that this problem is allowed to continue and be highlighted in Europe the more difficult it will be in the future to interest tourists in even considering Ireland as a holiday destination. For every disappointed tourist, thousands of potential tourists, because of word of mouth, are being turned off Ireland as a holiday destination.  It is now clear that the Irish tourist industry faces substantial losses this summer due to the serious shortage of cars for hire.  It seems that the only way these losses can be avoided is for the Government to agree to allow the temporary importation of <Col N="1293" /> cars for the peak periods when the problem is at its worst.</P>
    <P>The fly-drive holiday has become an increasingly important element of our tourist industry.  The truckers' blocade in France and the frequent disruption of ferry services means the fly-drive holiday which gives people a guarantee that they can collect a car when they arrive at an aiport here has proven to be a very attractive option for continental tourists. It is also a very important element in attracting Italian tourists here &mdash; the number of Italians coming to Ireland increased from approximately 39,000 in 1989 to approximately 97,000 last year. These tourists usually spend a lot of money when they are on holiday and if they are able to hire cars they can spend it in different areas.  A substantial part of this market is now under threat because of the shortage in the number of cars for hire.  It is possible that long term damage will be caused to our tourist industry as the word of this shortage spreads.  The fact of the matter is that no cars will be available for many tourists who booked fly-drive holidays, paid their deposits and are due to arrive in a few weeks.  Unless urgent action is taken many of these tourists will cancel their holidays and go elsewhere. Casual tourists who do not book fly-drive holidays will also be affected. Thousands of such tourists arrive in the country on the expectation that they can rent a car.  These cars are not available.</P>
    <P>I agree that many factors have given rise to this shortage in the car hire sector &mdash; it is not possible to go into them all in the time available.  I should point out that while this is not a totally new problem it has never been as severe as it is this summer.  The Government introduced a special grant in the budget to encourage car hire firms to acquire more vehicles. Unfortunately, this scheme has not worked for whatever reason.  There is now a shortfall of approximately 900 cars in the car hire fleet.  This will affect 5,000 to 6,000 tourists during the peak holiday season.  The loss in revenue will amount to millions of pounds.  The industry cannot afford this loss.  The only possible solution to the problem is for the Department <Col N="1294" /> of Tourism, Transport and Communications to introduce a scheme for the temporary importation of cars by car hire firms.  I understand vehicles are available in Britain and Northern Ireland and can be acquired fairly quickly.  The Minister has already turned down a request for the introduction of such a scheme based largely on objection by the Department of Finance.  I urge the Minister to review this decision so as to ensure that valuable tourist business and revenue are not lost to the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mr. Kenneally)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need to provide for extra cars for hire to cater for this year's peak tourist period was anticipated by the Government as early as last January. Having regard to the tourism growth targets, the Government noted the need to expand the car hire fleet not just for this year but also in the years ahead to cater for the anticipated growth. Having considered a number of options, the Government decided to allocate £1 million in the budget for an initiative to boost the supply during the peak season. Details of the scheme were subsequently agreed with the Car Rental Council.  The scheme was launched in March to allow firms and tour operators the maximum amount of time possible to plan and secure supplies for the peak season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, which is being administered by Bord Fáilte, provides grant assistance for the acquisition by firms of additional cars on top of their normal fleet during the peak months of July and August and into September.  To date, car hire firms have agreed to supply over 1,300 additional cars for this period.  Bord Fáilte estimate that the total number of cars available for hire during July and August now stands at 13,300, over 2,000 more than in the same period last year. Bord Fáilte were made aware as late as mid-June that some tour operators who had not contracted for sufficient cars specifically to meet bookings for the peak visitor period, 21 July to 15 August, were having supply difficulties.  The board immediately arranged for negotiations <Col N="1295" /> between these operators and the car hire firms to see if further cars could be secured with the assistance of the scheme.  In an effort to facilitate the sourcing of cars, Bord Fáilte were authorised to increase the standard grant to £600 per additional car supplied.</P>
    <P>The Car Rental Council have stated that firms are meeting their contractual commitments where contracts exist. They add that shortages appear to exist only where tour operators have not contracted for all their requirements.  This has left firms with the difficult task of trying at very short notice to find a commercial solution to the sourcing of cars for little more than a three-week period. I understand from the board that the car hire firms have managed over the past three weeks, with grant assistance, to secure over 500 extra cars for supply to tour operators.  Bord Fáilte are now satisfied that most of the difficulties experienced by tour operators in supplying cars have been resolved and do not anticipate a shortage for booked fly-drive packages except perhaps to a small degree during the second weekend in August.  They are still working with tour operators on possible solutions.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to express my appreciation of work done by officials in Bord Fáilte, the car hire firms and the tour operators to find a solution to this problem.  If this problem is to be avoided in future it is obvious that there will have to be closer co-ordination between those involved in the sale of fly-drive holidays and car hire firms in the sourcing of the necessary car element. This will require firmer contractual commitments early in the season to meet the projected demand.  I will be asking Bord Fáilte to address this fundamental issue with tour operators, handling agents in Ireland and car hire firms this autumn with a view to ensuring that similar problems do not arise in future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the need for the implementation of a temporary importation scheme for the season.  It is obvious from the foregoing that I do not believe such a need arises.  Furthermore, <Col N="1296" /> while temporary importation would, on the face of it, appear to be an attractive and easy solution it has its negative aspects.  For example, it poses a threat to the Government's stated objective of increasing the core domestic car hire fleet both in the short and longer term.  It would also have implications for the motor trade in Ireland, which is currently going through a tough period.  Car hire shortages such as those reported in recent weeks can be overcome only by good sound advance planning and a proper commercial, businesslike approach on the part of all the interests involved to secure adequate supplies of services to meet projected booking levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of fundamental importance to many people, particularly those in receipt of unemployment assistance.  These people are glad to be able to help in their local community on a voluntary basis. However, under the Social Welfare Acts, they have to immediately discontinue this voluntary work once paid work becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the Department of Social Welfare operated a voluntary work scheme which was reasonably successful. I have made representations to the Department in recent weeks about a specific case.  If I have the time, I will refer to other cases.  This case involves a girl who, under a FÁS scheme, worked as a secretary in St. Michael's girls school in Tipperary town.  She built up a relationship with the teachers and pupils during her time in the school.  At the end of her course she was obliged to sign on for unemployment assistance.  The school asked her if she would work with them on a voluntary basis to help raise funds which they badly needed as a result of the restrictions imposed by the Department of Education.  She would have been involved in fund raising, charity work, etc.  Because this girl was in receipt of unemployment assistance she decided that she would notify the local office of <Col N="1297" /> the Department of Social Welfare as to her plans.  During an interview with an officer of the Department she stated what she wanted to do and was told that it would be quite in order but that it would be some three weeks before written approval would issue.  By that time the project for the school would be over. The girl, in the belief that she was doing everything correctly, worked voluntarily in collecting funds for the school, always on the understanding that she would be available for work as required.</P>
    <P>She made her claim for unemployment assistance during that period and was refused on the basis that she was not available for work.  I made representations and produced documentary evidence from the school that she had worked in a voluntary capacity and was not compensated for her work.  I have given the Minister the reference number so that he can check the file containing my representations to confirm that she was available and that the work was voluntary. The reply I received this morning from the Department confirms that this lady was employed on a voluntary basis at St. Michael's girls school but the reply goes on to state, contradictorily, that this employment is not considered voluntary under the social welfare voluntary work scheme.</P>
    <P>That is one case.  There is another case in Monard where an unemployed person with a family took part in a project in the local hall.  Everybody in the community, including the parish priest, was helping. The person to whom I refer was discovered by a social welfare officer to be working voluntarily in a parochial hall and benefit was disallowed completely on the usual basis that evidence was not produced.  There is an anomaly in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I am arguing the case that the girl in question was told by an officer of the Department that the work in which she proposed to engage would be accepted as voluntary.  She was then notified in writing that it was not.  We should have a positive response in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will first outline the voluntary work option scheme and then deal with the case to which the Deputy refers. The voluntary work option scheme allows unemployed persons who engage in voluntary work within the State to continue to receive their unemployment payments provided they continue to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the scheme are twofold: to make opportunities available to the unemployed to become involved in voluntary work and encourage voluntary bodies to involve the unemployed as much as possible in their existing activities and to create new opportunities for voluntary work.  If an unemployed person wishes to take up voluntary work or a voluntary agency wishes to take on an unemployed person, the contact point is the local social welfare office.  The unemployed person completes an application form which is also completed by the voluntary organisation.</P>
      <P>A number of factors are taken into account by a deciding officer in determining whether the work involved is voluntary within the meaning of the scheme and whether a claimant would continue to satisfy the conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance/benefit.  These factors include the aims and standing of the voluntary organisation, the nature of the work involved, the weekly hours worked and the amount of any payment received by way of out-of-pocket expenses.  The deciding officer must be satisfied that the unemployed person is not doing work which would normally warrant payment and liability for PRSI and that he or she remains available for and is actively seeking employment while engaged in voluntary work.</P>

    <P>While it is not possible to lay down hard and fast rules as to what constitutes voluntary work, the position in most cases should be clear.  Examples would be assisting the old, the ill or the handicapped in their homes or in institutions. It may also involve working with community-based groups such as local development associations, residents associations, sports/youth clubs, cultural <Col N="1299" /> organisations or church groups.  Ideally the nature of the voluntary work should benefit the unemployed person in terms of developing social skills and work preparation which would be of assistance in securing paid employment and would also benefit the community as a whole. Under no circumstances, however, can the scheme be used in respect of work normally undertaken by a paid employee.  I am sure Deputy Ferris and his colleagues would agree with that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 9 June 1992, when she applied for the voluntary work option with a local school.  The employment concerned was not considered voluntary within the terms of the scheme for the following reasons: a national or secondary school would not be considered to be a voluntary organisation; the secretarial work involved was not considered to be voluntary work as it is normally done by a paid employee.</P>
    <P>I regret that, due to an oversight, the person concerned was not paid her entitlement to unemployment assistance for the period 10 June to 19 June 1992.  I have arranged that she will be paid her arrears for this period shortly.  She continues to be in receipt of a weekly rate of unemployment assistance of £55.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has raised a point which is not known to my Department, the fact that the girl was involved in fund raising activities.  That information was not available to the deciding officer, who was of the opinion that she was to be involved in secretarial duties.  She participated in social assistance schemes in that school for two non-consecutive yearly periods, doing secretarial work.  I will check whether fund raising could be construed as voluntary activity.  The information given to the Department was that this girl was going back to the school to do secretarial work, which is what she had been doing in the past.</P>
    <P>I will have the matter checked out for the Deputy and contact him as soon as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the considerable nuisance caused to urban communities all over the country by travellers who are also traders.  They are not by any means poor people but people of considerable wealth.  They cannot be compared with itinerants, but travel in huge numbers and cause immense difficulties for people living in housing estates in urban areas and also for the general public.  At times the number of caravans involved can be as high as 100.  Recently in Portlaoise the number was 200.  A month ago they came to Dungarvan in County Waterford and took over all the spaces adjacent to the community centre.  There were about 100 caravans in all causing considerable difficulty to the local authority and the adjoining housing estates.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to bring in legislation to stop this type of activity. These people are traders.  They sell furniture, consumer goods, agricultural implements and gates.  They also buy antiques.  They stay for quite a time and the local authorities do not have the resources to remove them.  The bylaws are insufficient to have them removed. The Garda authorities appear to be powerless because of the numbers involved.  Provision should be made in the Roads Bill, 1991 on Committee Stage to ensure that these people cannot congregate or travel in large numbers.  I suggest that they should not be allowed congregate in numbers greater than five at any one location at any given time and that such congregations be limited to a radius of one mile.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is probably aware of the nuisance these people create which is unacceptable, unsociable and I ask him to ensure that their activities are curtailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1301" /> thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter and allowing me an opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>Section 31 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, empowers a local authority to prohibit, by order, the parking of caravans and temporary dwellings in a specified area.  Maximum fines for illegal parking are £1,000 and £200 a day for continuing offences.  In addition, the road traffic Acts provide a comprehensive range of parking controls on vehicles generally, including power to remove vehicles left on a public road in such a manner as to cause danger to, or obstruct, traffic.</P>
      <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980, of course, is also relevant in so far as the travellers to which the Deputy refers may be engaged in trading activities.  This legislation, for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible, provides for a licensing and permit system for casual trading and empowers local authorities to restrict casual trading to designated areas.</P>
      <P>My Department are also promoting a number of legislative proposals which have a bearing on the issue raised by the Deputy.  The Roads Bill, 1991, which is currently awaiting Committee Stage in the House, will prohibit temporary dwellings on national roads, motorways, bus-ways and protected roads and will make it an offence to erect or retain on a public road any caravan, vehicle or other thing for the purposes of advertising, the sale of goods or the provision of services, without the consent of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, Second Stage of which was completed in the Seanad today, will empower a housing authority to remove a caravan or other temporary dwelling which is parked in a public place within five miles of an official halting site on which there is suitable space.  As more sites are provided, this provision should have wider application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that these new provisions <Col N="1302" /> will enable more effective action to be taken, particularly in regard to parking along national roads.  Active enforcement of these and existing legislative provisions, including those relating to motor taxation and insurance, will do much to ameliorate this difficult problem. However, the real solution is for local authorities to provide adequate halting sites and other accommodation so that the enforcement powers can more readily be used in relation to illegal parking.</P>
    <P>I make a strong appeal in the House this evening, as I did in the Seanad today, to local authorities who have not faced up to their responsibilities to do so so that we can tackle this problem in a humane and responsible manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing crisis has been raised frequently in this House in recent weeks.  For example, we have had the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1992, but there is an obligation on all of us to continue to bring to the Minister's attention the appalling crisis, with almost 30,000 applicants on our waiting lists nationwide, that is 30,000 families, living in bad conditions.  They have been let down badly by local authorities who are not providing houses for their needs.</P>
      <P>In my city alone there are 2,000 applicants on our housing lists, the worst figures since I became a member of a local authority in the seventies.  Only this week in Cork a family was evicted from their home by a building society.  That husband, wife and three children are now living in a car on the side of the road and the wife is expecting a baby in two months time.  Even though they are now homeless they have not been offered any house.  This means they are at the mercy of the health board to provide them with the necessary finance for short-term board and lodgings.  The reality is that the local authority have neither the resources nor houses to meet present needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repossessions are an ever-growing problem, of which the Department of the Environment are washing their hands. <Col N="1303" /> I asked the Department to carry out a national survey on repossessions and evictions nationwide.  They continue to say it is not a matter for them but rather one for the relevant local authorities. There is a responsibility on us all to quantify the scale of that serious and growing problem.  The example I have given is just one of many in recent times.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;cop-out&rdquo;&mdash; I call it that advisedly &mdash; being publicised by the Department and relevant Ministers is that the time is past for building large housing estates. That is an excuse for doing very little. There is a case for housing estates being built in our cities with the necessary back-up services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to respond to the matter raised by Deputy Allen. Indeed, his contribution this evening was an example of how little attention he has paid to this problem.</P>
      <P>The most recent statutory assessment of housing needs, under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, was carried out on 31 March 1991.  I readily acknowledge that the number of applicants seeking local authority houses in Cork and other areas since then has increased.  However, to keep matters in perspective it should be remembered that, in the early eighties, there were up to 300,000 on the waiting lists nationwide.  Deputy Allen gave that figure off the top of his head this evening without the necessary statistical back-up. Furthermore, assessments now carried out under section 9 of the 1988 Act are much more thorough than any similar exercises previously undertaken and require local authorities to include categories of need not previously included, for example, homeless persons, travellers and single persons who are not elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress that, since the publication of the social housing plan, the response to social housing needs cannot be viewed solely in terms of local authority house-building. Account must be taken of progess <Col N="1304" /> made under a wide range of other measures, such as shared ownership, mortgage allowance, rental subsidy, improvement works and so on.</P>
    <P>I am already on record as saying that if local authorities make full use of the measures and resources at their disposal nationally they could cater for in excess of 6,000 households in 1992, representing a substantial increase on 1991.</P>
    <P>In regard to Cork Corporation I expect the housing needs of more than 400 people will be catered for in 1992.  Since assuming office I have given the go-ahead for a major rehabilitation of two blocks of flats at Mayfield and Bakers Road, bringing more than 50 flats back into occupation.  Deputy Allen should look also at the other action being taken to meet the housing needs of Cork.  These include a whole range of measures, including 60 local authority housing completions; 40 houses in Douglas being provided by Respond under the provisions of the rental subsidy scheme; 54 applications for shared ownership which were approved up to the end of March 1992 and in excess of 120 units to be provided by way of voluntary housing projects this year.</P>
    <P>We must all be responsible in our approach to community needs.  Deputy Allen referred to the building of large housing estates.  These are no longer feasible. We must think in modern terms of the people seeking housing and in that way tackling the problem.  Deputy Allen, in what he said this evening, has shown that he is totally insincere and has not even studied the position with regard to people's needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The very good weather we have experienced in recent weeks raises spirits all round especially amongst members of the farming community. Sadly, in west Sligo, we must always have reservations at such times because of an abominable water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In about half of the Tireragh area, from the outskirts of Ballisodare to the <Col N="1305" /> outskirts of Ballina, there is no piped water.  More than 500 homes, mostly of farming families, are involved.  The most exasperating factor of all is that, running right through the middle of that whole area &mdash; from Corownagh Church to Corballa Church &mdash; is a pipeline capable of supplying half a million gallons of water per day, located there with a great deal of Government money.  What the area has not got, and what the Government refuse to give, is funding for a group water scheme to deliver water to taps; it is that ridiculous.  It is rather like the building of a major new roadway with no exits for cars.</P>
    <P>The group water schemes at Castleconnor, Culleens, Kilglass and Skreen/ Dromard are all ready to go, local money has been collected and all preparations have been completed.  The Minister for the Environment knows about the awful conditions now obtaining and of the special problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> funding for the Castleconnor group water scheme.  He has met these people concerned face to face, but has done nothing since his meeting except to issue soothing words.  As Members know, soothing words will not put water in the taps or ensure a decent pot of tea on the table.  What is needed is action, immediate action.  This part of Tireragh has some of the best land in County Sligo, but farming development is thwarted by the lack of piped water.  For instance, what is going to happen when the new milk hygiene regulations become operative? How can the dairy farmers there, without a good piped water supply, meet the strict criteria?  This is also a very beautiful part of the country, bounded on one side by the Ox Mountains and on the other by the sea; but, again, tourist development is curtailed by the lack of a good water supply.  These are all major additional arguments why the group schemes should be funded and funded immediately, but, even if these arguments never existed, how can we justify the failure to provide the basic necessity <Col N="1306" /> of good, clean water to a large slice of a county as we reach the dying years of the 20th century?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has been there; he has seen and heard all the facts for himself.  He knows there is no exaggeration in what I have said.  The pipeline with the source supply is in place.  The people are extremely angry, understandably so.  We are now on the second last day of this Dáil session, maybe the second last day of the 26th Dáil.  I hope that the Minister of State will avail of this opportunity to announce that he is finally providing the funds to turn on the taps in Tireragh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, for allowing me to share his time.  Deputy Nealon forgot to mention that in 1982 the then Fianna Fáil Government approved phase one of the scheme and it was completed. In 1987 the then Government and Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, approved phase two of the scheme, and that has also been completed. Deputy Nealon is correct when he says that the water is in the pipes and that we are now awaiting finance for the group water scheme.  I am confident that we will receive this finance, but I do not know if the Minister has good news for us this evening.  We mentioned this at our parliamentary party meeting yesterday, but I will not disclose private minutes from that meeting.  If we could obtain £40 million we would be able to finance the application for group water schemes pending.  At present in County Sligo we need £2 million to complete group water <Col N="1307" /> schemes in Castleconnor, Skreen/ Dromard and other areas.  Unfortunately, there are a number of group water schemes in every county and I sincerely hope that we will receive the necessary finance in the very near future to complete the Castleconnor and Skreen/ Dromard group water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Nealon for putting down the question.  The Deputy can rest assured that he has nothing to worry about.  The Deputy will know that these proposed group water schemes have been designed so that the whole area can be served by Stage II of the Lough Easkey regional water supply scheme.</P>
      <P>The four groups have a current estimated membership of 475 houses and 360 farms.  The total estimated cost is almost £2 million.  The design capacity of the schemes far exceeds this current demand. The additional capacity is needed for the many existing households which have not yet joined the scheme and for the future development needs of the area.  Except for Culleens, the schemes are extremely costly due mainly to the requirement to lay large diameter watermains, plus the need for extensive rock excavation.</P>
      <P>Because the density of housing is relatively low for an area of this size, group water scheme grants of £700 per house and £500 per farm are insufficient and the schemes would not be an economic proposition.  Considering current budgetary circumstances, it would be difficult for my Department to provide funding for such high cost schemes from the Exchequer alone.  However, the possibility of obtaining further EC funding for schemes of this sort to maintain the economic and social fabric of rural communities is currently being explored.</P>

      <P>This House is within 24 hours of rising for the summer recess and it has already been suggested that this Dáil may not reconvene, but there is <Col N="1308" /> one question only that my consituents in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Rathcoole and the surrounding region are concerned about and that is: what are the conclusions of the Kennedy report?  Will they be published and, more particularly, what is the decision of the Minister and the Government regarding the construction of the Tallaght Regional Hospital?  When can work commence on this desperately needed project?  The rumour is around the House that the Government have decided to give the Tallaght Regional Hospital the go-ahead.  I have raised this matter on many occasions in this House; it is the most important issue confronting my constituents, and the Minister for Health has expressed his full commitment in this regard.  I accept the Minister's good faith.  I mean no slight to the Minister of State, but the Minister for Health should be present to reply this evening.  The rumour is around the House that the Government have given this project the go-ahead, but I am reminded that the rumour was around the House today that prophylactics could be dispensed through vending machines in the future.  The Health (Family Planning) Amendment Bill, 1992, has been enacted today, and as far as I can see it does not provide for such vending machines.  I hope that is not the type of rumour that is circulating about the Tallaght hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For three years, on every conceivable occasion that the rules of this Dáil permit, I have raised this urgent question of the building of Tallaght Regional Hospital.  I sincerely hope that the Minister of State is in a position this evening to give a positive reply to what is the most important issue that faces his and my constituents. I hope he is in a position to make an announcement here this evening that the Tallaght Regional Hospital has been given the go-ahead by the Government, that work can commence within months and the concern of mothers of young families and of people generally in Tallaght, Clondalkin and the surrounding <Col N="1309" /> region can finally be put to rest.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Hospital Advisory Group, chaired by Professor David Kennedy, carried out a review of the function, scope and scale of the proposed Tallaght hospital and on the possible methods of funding its construction.  The group submitted their report to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. O'Connell, recently and it is at present under active consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking my question.  I will not mention the family's name or the location of the institution where the person is placed as I do not want to cause any embarrassment to the family.  Suffice it to say that this 27 year old person suffering from Downes Syndrome had a very happy family life living with her parents and family.  As the family grew up family members moved out of the family home, got married and set up their own homes. The girl's mother died over a fortnight ago following a very sudden serious illness. The girl was sent to a health board institution.  Notification has been given to the family that the girl is being returned to her parent's home tomorrow.  Her widowed father lives in the family home, he is 71 years of age and in poor health. He would not be in a position to care for his daughter who has Downes Syndrome. This girl is quite placid, but she can become aggressive at times.  Great strides have been made in recent years in treating people with Downes Syndrome and we must compliment all those involved in caring for those people.  They are now being trained to care for themselves at an early age and young people with Downes Syndrome will be able to <Col N="1310" /> care for themselves when they are 27 years old.  Facilities were not available when this person was a child, but she was very well cared for at home.  This girl is in need of constant care.  Her father cannot care for her: her brothers and sisters are married and have young families of their own.  Her family are very concerned and distressed about her future.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that this girl is accommodated in a State institution.  Her family are upset about this arrangement but have no alternative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the person referred to was accommodated in Clogher House residential unit from 26 June last.  The North Eastern Health Board are aware of the family circumstances and, as such, it was never the intention of the board to send this person home.  She will continue to reside in Clogher House until a group home placement can be found for her.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that an additional £5 million revenue and £1 million capital has been made available for the development of additional mental handicap services this year.  The North Eastern Health Board have been allocated a revenue grant of £140,000 which will be used to provide a group home in Monaghan catering for eight persons, a group home in Athboy catering for five persons, day care facilities in Cavan which will cater for 25 persons and home support services which will cater for up to 30 families.  In addition, a capital grant of £150,000 is also being provided towards the cost of the development of a day care centre in Cootehill.</P>
      <P>These developments are a major step forward and will result in a considerable improvement in the level of services available in the region.  I accept that more needs to be done, but I want to assure the Deputy that the service will be maintained at this higher level and it is my intention that this will be built on and further improved in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Deputy is pleased with the <Col N="1311" /> assurance I have given him with regard to this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>While progress on the GATT negotiations has been slow in recent months, following the conclusions of the G7 meeting in Munich yesterday there is renewed optimism that a GATT agreement can be concluded by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the Director-General of the GATT, Mr. Dunkel, presented proposals to conclude the negotiations last December.  The proposals on agriculture are unbalanced and do not represent an acceptable basis for a final solution.  These views are fully supported by all of my colleagues in the Council and the Commission, which negotiates on behalf of the Community, has been mandated to negotiate improvements to the text.  The Commission has held discussions with the other parties concerned particularly the US, but while no breakthrough has yet been achieved, there have been signals from the US side that they are now prepared to adopt a more realistic approach to the negotiations and discussions are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Common Agricultural Policy reform agreement, although undertaken for internal market management reasons, represents a significant contribution to the Round.  It is now up to other Contracting Parties to take the next step and to show the necessary flexibility to enable these long-running discussions to be concluded.  I would stress that the Common Agricultural Policy agreement was achieved with great difficulty, involving sacrifices on the part of all member states.  The Community, as I am, is determined to ensure that these reforms are not undermined by an <Col N="1139" /> eventual GATT agreement and that the compensatory payments, which are an integral part of the package, are fully protected.</P>
    <P>My priorities in the negotiations are to ensure that whatever commitments are entered into will not prevent the Community from continuing to operate support measures to the benefit of the Irish agri-food sector and the wider economy and I will be pursuing these objectives with the utmost vigour in the Council.  I would add that the Council mandate on agriculture, negotiated in November 1990, would enable these objectives to be met.  The Council will of course have to approve the final package negotiated by the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 17, 43, 145 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy reform arrangements agreed for the beef sector provide for substantially enhanced payments under the special beef premium and suckler cow premium systems within certain limits.</P>
      <P>In the case of the special male beef premium a national ceiling will be established based on the number of animals which have qualified for the existing premium in a reference year.  Member states may choose 1990, 1991 or 1992 as the reference year.  If the number of animals qualifying for the premium in a particular year exceeds the national ceiling then the number of eligible animals per producer shall be reduced proportionally.  Within the national ceiling it is open to member states to impose individual producer quotas.</P>
      <P>In the case of the suckler cow premium individual producer quotas must be applied.  These too are to be based on a reference year which may be 1990, 1991 or 1992.  Each member state will be obliged to establish a national reserve equal to between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of the total number of animals on which the suckler cow premium has been granted in the chosen reference year. This reserve shall be used for the benefit of priority category producers such as young farmers and others who, due to exceptional circumstances, have no quota.  An additional reserve of 1 per cent will be created for the exclusive use of such producers in disadvantaged areas. Similar national reserve arrangements would apply for the male beef premium should we opt for individual producer quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> Where individual quotas apply, member states are not empowered to allow producers to build up quotas over a period of years.  Quotas must be based on the selected reference year.</P>
    <P>I am at present consulting with farming interests as to the most appropriate arrangements in implementing the discretionary aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy Reform package.  I will be announcing my decisions on these issues at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances it is difficult, at this stage, to predict with any degree of certainty what effect the new arrangements will have on the national herd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 39, 45 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The total number of cattle sold into intervention in Ireland to date in 1992 was over 202,000 head valued at approximately £165 million.</P>
      <P>As at 30 June 1992 the total book value of dairy product held in intervention was £97.5 million while at the end of May 1992 the book value of beef held in intervention was £158 million.  During 1991 some 265,000 tonnes of beef and 148,000 tonnes of dairy products were taken into intervention in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There has been no intake of skimmed milk powder into intervention since July 1991 and butter intake has been minimal, 3,000 tonnes since January 1992.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals from the European Commission to reduce intervention beef stocks by 250,000 tonnes less than in 1991.  However, during the course of the recent Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations, it was agreed that a ceiling on beef intervention purchases be fixed at a level of 750,000 tonnes in 1993, gradually reducing to 350,000 tonnes in 1997.</P>
      <P>Provided Irish beef processors use the five year period over which these reductions will be effected to increase their penetration of EC markets for change, there need not be any adverse implications for the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special spring slaughter premium for male cattle which I sought and obtained during the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations should, through its beneficial effect on the seasonal variations in Irish beef production, contribute significantly to the necessary switch from intervention sales to commercial sales.  Also State and FEOGA grants will be used to assist only <Col N="1143" /> those projects in the beef sector which are aimed at and are capable of increasing commercial sales.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the changes resulting from Common Agricultural Policy reform, and with a view to our beef sector becoming less dependent on EC supports and adopting a more market orientated approach, the Government provided for a doubling of the CBF grant-in-aid last year to £1.5 million.  This level of aid has been repeated in the current year.  Meat producers in turn agreed to increase their contribution to match the increased commitment from the Government and this together with other receipts including EC aid has brought the total CBF budget to a projected £8.1 million for 1992 compared to some £5.05 million in 1990.  This increased funding has enabled CBF to launch a quality assurance scheme for Irish beef and to undertake a major promotional campaign in Europe which has targeted the premium end of the market. The campaign includes promotion of Irish meat and meat products in key retail outlets and at international food fairs in Germany, Italy, Spain, France and the UK.</P>
    <P>A modest but welcome feature of the Common Agricultural Policy reform package is a provision for part financing by the Community of beef promotion and marketing measures undertaken in Member States.</P>
    <P>The framework has now been put in place on which the industry can plan and develop its long term strategy.  A combination of adequate EC market support arrangements, generous compensatory premia for producers and a greatly enhanced promotion effort should lead to a more satisfactory and secure position all round for the entire beef industry. I am confident that all concerned will respond positively to the new scenario and take full advantage of the opportunity which is being offered for the successful development of this important sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years the pig industry, at both producer and processor levels has evolved from a fragmented, and at times an uneconomic and uncompetitive, enterprise into a concentrated and efficient industry capable of competing successfully on all markets.</P>
      <P>The Government programme for the modernisation of the industry has been an important contributory factor to this change which has resulted in increased sow output, higher pig numbers, a greater volume of exports and reduced dependence on imports on the home market.</P>
      <P>This programme in essence is based on the need to have a smaller number of large processing plants in order to maintain and develop the industry in the highly competitive EC and world markets. In this context, I do not regard the proportion of weaners in the hands of co-ops and millers, estimated at about 26 per cent, as excessive.  The largest processor in the country accounts for about 32 per cent, not 40 per cent, of slaughterings at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> The inevitable but necessary trend the industry has taken over the past few years may put pressure on some smaller family farm pig producers.  However, it would be open to these producers to engage in group purchasing of inputs and group marketing in order to improve their viability.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The recent Council decisions on Common Agricultural Policy Reform contain a number of provisions, such as the spring premium for male cattle slaughterings, which should help sectors of the food industry to adapt to changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  In pressing for such provisions during the negotiations, I had in mind the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> referred to by Deputy De Rossa, among other factors.</P>
      <P>I nevertheless have under consideration what further measures will be needed for adaptation of the food industry to the new circumstances now that the Common Agricultural Policy Reform has been adopted.  It is my intention to take the matter further with the European Commission and to take full account of the food industry's requirements in the context of the forthcoming negotiations on the EC structural funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no agreement on the Italian request for additional quota.  The overall agreement on Common Agricultural Policy reform did include a decision in principle to adapt the milk quota levels for Spain and Greece from 1993/94 onwards subject to full and rigid compliance with the quota regime by those member states in the current year. As regards Spain, the decision is expected to reduce national milk production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two main considerations which made this decision acceptable in the context of the general Common Agricultural Policy agreement.  Firstly, opposition by Ireland and other member states prevented adoption of a Commission <Col N="1150" /> proposal for reductions in quotas for all member states.  Secondly, the adaptation of quota levels especially for Spain will involve the implementation of buy out schemes.  This, along with a more rigid application of the quota regime in the countries in question will effectively reduce the production of milk from the levels pertaining in recent years.  This can only lead to further strengthening of the Community's dairy markets.</P>

      <P>When a milk quota holder ceases milk production, he/she retains the benefit of the milk quota.  That producer may however decide to transfer the benefit of the milk quota.</P>
      <P>This can be done by means of a permanent sale or transfer by inheritance of the land to which the quota attaches. Leasing of quota land is also an option. In the past, quota holders ceasing production could avail also of cessation or restructuring schemes.</P>
      <P>No decision has yet been made on a cessation or restructuring scheme for the current year and indeed none is even possible before the regulations to apply the milk quota arrangements for future years are adopted by the EC Council of Ministers later this year.  In the event of a restructuring scheme being put in place, smaller producers, as has been the case up to now, will be given special consideration.</P>

      <P>As far as rabies is concerned, agreement has been reached at the Council of Ministers to harmonise rules for trade in commercial dogs and cats from July, 1994 which allows Ireland to maintain its quarantine regulations where a degree of risk is involved.  Further proposals as regards the rules for pet animals are awaited and the existing quarantine arrangements continue to apply until alternative controls are agreed by the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any proposal by the Heinz Company to invest in the Killeshandra region.  However, as I announced on 13 May, the Company, through its subsidiary, Custom Foods, is to establish a chilled and frozen food products plant at Dundalk, Co. Louth. Subject to the grant of planning approval that plant is expected to be completed and in production by early 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The position at present is that 91,960 applicants under the 1991 EC Special Beef Premium Scheme and 81,806 applicants under the EC Suckler Cow Premium Scheme have been paid their grants.  These figures compare with 88,168 and 80,088 payments under the 1990 Beef Premium and Suckler Cow Premium Schemes respectively.  It is estimated that a further 2,000 applicants for special beef premium who applied in December, 1991 will be paid in the coming weeks bringing the total number of payments under this Scheme to 94,000 &mdash; some 6,000 more than under the 1990 scheme.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of applicants receiving payment under the Special Beef Premium Scheme while in part attributable to a greater number of applications submitted in 1991 was greatly facilitated by the new arrangements for dealing with problem cases involving genuine accidental error which I put in place earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>As a number of the Special Beef Premium applications are still the subject of query it is not possible at this stage to give figures for disqualifications.  All but about 1,100 applicants for the 1991 Suckler Cow Premium have been paid to date.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 42 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the Common Agricultural Policy reform in relation to the introduction of a quota for the sheepmeat sector are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;A producer quota based on ewe premium applications for the 1989, 1990 or 1991 marketing years, one of these to be selected by the member state and notified to the Commission by 31 October 1991; member states to decide on the management of the quota arrangements, within the framework of detailed rules to be decided by the Commission under the Management Committee procedure.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Maximum flock sizes for purposes of full premium to continue at current levels (1,000 in the Disadvantaged Areas and 500 in the non-Disadvantaged Areas).</P>
      <P>&mdash;Continuation of the payment of 50 per cent of the premium for animals in excess of the maximum flock size and within the individual producer quota.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Creation of a national reserve, under detailed Commission rules to be adopted, from 1 per cent of all applications in the quota year.  The calculation for individual producers may vary between 1 per cent and 3 per cent.  An additional 1 per cent reserve will be created for producers in Disadvantaged Areas.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Quota system to apply from the beginning of the 1993 marketing year.</P>
      <P>I have not yet made a final decision in relation to the quota year to be chosen by Ireland.  However, in 1991 the Irish ewe flock was at its highest level ever and the maximum benefit to Ireland would appear to accrue from choosing that year.</P>
      <P>Measures to facilitate producers who have received premium for the first time in respect of the 1992 marketing year will be decided by the Commission through the Management Committee procedure.</P>

Confidence in the future potential of the industry has been apparent by the unprecedented level of uptake of grants under the Operational Programme for Rural Development and FEOGA Processing and Marketing Schemes over the past 18 months.  In addition, the production and value of horticulture, excluding potatoes, <Col N="1159" /> increased by almost 10 per cent last year and the value of output of potatoes increased by almost 30 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The CBF Annual Review and Outlook for 1991, which was published in January 1992, estimates that beef exports fell marginally and I presume that it is to this report that the Deputy is referring. However, actual figures for beef exports published in the CBF Trade Report in May 1992, show that beef exports in volume terms rose by 9 per cent in 1991 to 405,300 tonnes in carcase weight equivalent and by 2 per cent in value terms.</P>
      <P>In general the market situation in the beef sector remains difficult due to continued difficulties on international markets and indeed exports outside the Community in 1991 were almost 4 per cent lower than in 1990.  However exports to the United Kingdom and continental markets have shown increases of 5 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.  This is a welcome demonstration of the continued success of Irish exporters in finding market outlets for our beef.</P>
      <P>Actual sheepmeat exports rose by 5,268 tonnes valued at about £16.5 million &mdash; an increase of about 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The volume of pigmeat exports rose by 18,000 tonnes or 28 per cent while their value increased by about £30 million or 29 per cent.</P>
      <P>The outlook for 1992 in beef is more positive.  Exports should increase over 1991 levels because of a continuing recovery in UK consumption and better prospects for trade with the Middle East and North Africa.  Following recent exports of beef to Libya the authorities there have informed us that Irish traders are free to put in bids for the supply of Irish cattle.  This would, indeed, instill confidence in producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lamb exports should continue to grow in 1992.  Because of continuing difficulties on the French market which takes over 90 per cent of our lamb exports, it is very difficult to anticipate price trends for the remainder of this year.  It is clear that competition will be very keen from UK and New Zealand suppliers.  This will <Col N="1161" /> keep prices under pressure as we in Ireland approach our peak slaughtering period.</P>
    <P>Both volume and price increases are expected in the case of pigmeat exports mainly because of an expected decline in overall EC production.</P>
    <P>While there are many factors beyond our control in international trade, the expansion of our markets will not take place without a firm commitment to a quality product throughout the year and to the allocation of resources to the marketing of that product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>A decision was taken in principle by the Council of Ministers to reduce national quota levels by two successive cuts of 1 per cent applying from 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994.  However, before these reductions can be implemented the Commission is obliged to present reports to the Council of Ministers on the market situation, accompanied, if necessary, by proposals to revise these decisions.  If the present favourable trend in the market for dairy products continues it will be very difficult to justify any reduction in quota in 1993/94.  It is my intention to approach negotiations on this basis, as I successfully did in relation to the proposed quota cut for 1992.</P>

      <P>The Government are aware of the concerns of the farming community in relation to third party risks during trespass on their properties.  This area of law is complex and involves a wide range of interests, some conflicting.  As has already been indicated by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, the Attorney General has decided to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission for examination and report.  That is a desirable first step towards the formulation of new legislation in this area because of the many interests involved who need to be consulted and have their views taken into account.</P>

      <P>Statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office show that Aggregate Farm Income, or income from self employment, and other trading income fell by an estimated 2.2 per cent in 1990 and by an estimated 10.1 per cent in 1991. These statistics exclude farmers' incomes from non-farm activities.  The figure for 1991 is a preliminary estimate and the final figures will not be available until the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the fall in income during 1990 and 1991 was the weakness of world and EC markets for our main <Col N="1164" /> products due to surpluses, animal health problems in other countries and other factors in those years.</P>
    <P>Preliminary estimates suggest that overall farm incomes in 1992 will at least be maintained, if not improved, on the 1991 levels.  The market balance for dairy products is relatively healthy and stocks at world and EC level have decreased. There has also been an improvement in the overall supply and demand position in the beef sector.  The modernisation plan for the pigmeat industry has now been completed and this should result in an increase in both the volume and value of output during 1992.</P>
    <P>The combination of these factors together with an increase in the level of subsidies being paid should lead to some improvement in farm incomes during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>I addressed this issue in the Dáil on 11 June.  As I stated then, the publication by the US of a retaliatory list threatening the suspension of tariff concessions on European Community agriculture produce was deplorable and without justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The threatened measures are linked to a longstanding EC/US dispute in relation to oilseeds in which the US challenged in the GATT Community subsidies to EC <Col N="1165" /> producers and processors of oilseeds. The US unilaterally published the retaliatory list even though the matter is being dealt with through the dispute settlement procedures of the GATT and despite the fact that the EC had agreed to comply with its GATT obligations.  The US action has no legal basis in the GATT and has been strongly condemned by the EC.</P>
    <P>The measures, if implemented, could have a very serious impact on many Irish industries and in particular, on the manufacturers of casein, cream liqueurs and cheeses.  Almost $2 billion of EC agriculture products are targeted and Ireland's share of the list is slightly in excess of 10 per cent of the total value. The level of the threat to Irish products is totally unjustifiable and in terms of our volume of trade to the US we would be the hardest hit of all EC countries.  I have expressed my views on the retaliatory list in the strongest terms to the US authorities and in particular the potential adverse impact on Ireland.  I have also been in contact with the Commission on the issue and the Irish Embassy in Washington is, at my instigation, lobbying various parties seeking to have the threat to Irish trade removed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the oilseeds dispute, I am pleased that the GATT Council recently authorised the Community to enter into negotiations to compensate the parties concerned, including the US.  This process will take a few months to complete and, in the interim, the proposed measures will not take effect.  I am optimistic that the negotiations will result in an equitable solution to the problem and in removing the threat to EC and Irish interests.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that I am doing all in my power, both bilaterally and within the Community framework, to ensure that this treat does not become a reality.</P>

      <P>The general supervision of the accountancy profession, including chartered accountants, is not provided for in legislation; rather the approach has been to permit self-regulation and this is effected by the different accountancy bodies of which individual accountants are members.</P>
      <P>The Companies Acts provide a framework for the supervision of accountants, including chartered accountants, in the area of statutory audit of accounting documents, but here too, as a matter of policy, actual supervision of the activities of practitioner is entrusted to the accountancy bodies.</P>
      <P>In so far as audit supervision is concerned, Deputies will be aware that Part X of the Companies Act, 1990 enhances my powers to require adherence to the highest of standards.  In this context, I believe that the accountancy bodies are acutely conscious of the need to satisfy me that they are performing their supervisory role effectively.  My Department are at present examining submissions from the five recognised accountancy bodies with a view to establishing how they meet the requirements of section 191 of the Act.</P>
      <P>For my part, therefore, in so far as auditing matters are concerned I do not see a need to introduce any new measures at this stage.  However, I will not hesitate to introduce new measures as appropriate in the future if I feel that the bodies concerned are not exercising sufficient disciplinary control.</P>

      <P>The EC Commission gave its final agreement to the RETEX Initiative at its meeting on 13 May 1992 and it was published in the Official Journal of the Community on 4 June 1992. The relevant statistical information required by the EC Commission has been submitted in support of Ireland's eligibility for RETEX funding.</P>
      <P>Since the draft RETEX Initiative was originally announced my Department have had in depth discussion with the Commission and obtained full clarification of the matter, with a view to maximising its impact for the benefit of Ireland.  My Department have also had discussions with the CII to appraise them of developments on the initiative.</P>
      <P>The initiative is applicable to regions heavily dependent on both the textiles and clothing sectors.  Its stated purpose is to accelerate the diversification of economic activities in these regions to render them less dependent on textiles and clothing.  Thus it is not a sectoral initiative but rather a horizontal one to assist regions with a high dependency on both the textiles and clothing industry by encouraging the adjustment of commercially viable businesses in all sectors of industrial activity.</P>
      <P>Qualifying member states have been invited to present operational programmes, within six months of the date of the publication of the initiative on 4 June 1992.  Work is already underway to meet their requirement.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the GATT talks have been deadlocked for some time.  Although agriculture has been highlighted as the main stumbling block there are also other areas where significant work is still to be done such as market access and services where very rigid positions have been adopted by the US and others.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless the major contracting parties including the EC and the US have continued to emphasise their commitment to the satisfactory completion of the Uruguay Round and to underline its importance to the future expansion of world trade.  The conclusions of the recent European Council reaffirmed the EC's commitment to a swift conclusion to the Uruguay Round and called on all partners to show flexibility.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware attempts made at the G7 Economic Summit, in the last couple of days, to achieve a breakthrough in negotiations have not succeeded.  However it is likely that discussions will continue in the matter.  In my view if progress is to be made the US must reciprocate the significant steps taken by the Community on Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the Round will be concluded satisfactorily but it is not possible to make any accurate prediction at this stage regarding the timing. Obviously the US Presidential election will have a major impact on the progress of the negotiations and on the ability of the US to come forward with an overall acceptable package in the near future.</P>
      <P>Ireland attaches great importance to a successful and balanced outcome to the negotiations and will continue within the Community to make every effort to see that such an outcome is achieved.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the current excise duty on motor vehicles is being replaced, with effect from 1 January 1993, by a Vehicle Registration Tax, which is to be administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Commissioners have decided that the new tax will be administered through a headquarters, with over 30 staff situated in Wexford, supported by about 100 staff operating out of a nationwide network of Revenue offices, including an office located in Monaghan town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the decentralisation programme, it is unfortunate that many areas, including Monaghan, have had to be disappointed to date in this programme. However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the selection of centres to benefit from the programme has <Col N="1173" /> been most difficult given the large number of locations that merit consideration. A further extension of the decentralisation programme is unlikely for the foreseeable future, at least pending completion and review of the present programme.</P>

      <P>I refer to the Deputy's previous parliamentary questions on the same topic which were answered on 6 November and 12 December, 1991 respectively.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in both previous replies, it is established practice that a Minister for Finance does not answer a parliamentary question about an indivdual's tax affairs, other than when the Deputy asking the question is acting on behalf of the taxpayer.

      <P>Details of the phasing arrangements in relation to the outstanding pay elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> are set out in the statement I made following a meeting with the public service unions on 17 January 1992.  Copies of tha statement have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The statement indicates, on page 4, that the Exchequer pay bill will, mainly as a result of the commitments undertaken therein, rise by some £350 million in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage, the two outstanding cost elements will be (i) the carryover cost (£70 million) in 1994, of removing the cash ceiling of £6.50 per week on the 1993 general round increase with effect from 1 December 1993 and, (ii) the cost (£115 million) of restoring the losses incurred by public servants in 1992 and 1993 due to the cash ceilings which applied to the <Col N="1175" /> general round increases up to 1 December in each of those years.</P>
    <P>The commitment in relation to (ii), is as set out in the second last paragraph of my statement of 17 January last, which states, inter alia:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In the context of the constraints mentioned above, the Government are prepared to have further discussions with Congress in 1993 and before the expiry of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> to agree a specific time-table for recoupment of the losses arising from the application of the ceilings of £5 and £6.50 per week at the earliest possible dates and, in any event not later than 1994, this timetable to reflect the situation then applying and the emerging budgetary position for 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The particulars requested in Question No. 91 are detailed in the following below.</P>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 92 I am informed by the Garda authorities that figures for recorded indictable crime in the Ronanstown area for 1991 and to-date in 1992 are not yet available.  The indications are that the level of crime increased last year.  However the Garda authorities inform me that a specific plan of action has been drawn up to deal with the crime problems experienced in the Ronanstown area.  This plan involves a very strong emphasis on community relations and crime prevention and includes measures such as the GRAFT project which was established last year and is one of a number of community-based projects in which the Gardaí cooperate with the Probation and Welfare Service and statutory and non-statutory agencies in helping young people to steer clear of crime.  In addition the Garda Schools Programme is in operation in all primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>As the following below shows the Garda strength in Ronanstown station has been increased by 10 since the beginning of this year.  This includes the appointment of an Inspector to the station.  There are now nine Community Gardaí operating in Ronanstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that their plan of action has been very effective and the preliminary and provisional <Col N="1182" /> indications for the first half of this year are that the level of crime in the area has decreased in comparison with the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the interdepartmental group on urban crime which was established last year with the purpose of providing a wider response to urban and juvenile crime than can be provided by the Garda Síochána on its own.  The group which comprises senior officials from the relevant Government Departments, agencies and the Garda Síochána is currently focussing on the needs of the Ronanstown area and its report, which is expected shortly, will include a reference to the Garda response to crime in the area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the legal reforms in my current programme are the Confiscation of Criminal Proceeds Bill which I hope to introduce in the next session, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which among other things will deal with the problems caused by gangs and the Juvenile Justice Bill which will replace the Children Act, 1908.  Work on the latter two Bills is at an advanced stage <Col N="1183" /> of preparation and they will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Other legislative proposals I have in the criminal law area are a Criminal Law Bill, an Extradition Bill, a Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, a Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill and a Criminal Procedure Bill.  Work on these Bills is proceeding and I hope to introduce the legislation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have also set up an Advisory Committee on Fraud to review the legal, technical and operational aspects of that type of crime and the Law Reform Commission report on Dishonesty is expected shortly.  I intend that any legislative changes found to be necessary in this area will be dealt with as a matter of priority and introduced with a minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>My Department in collaboration with the Health Promotion Unit in the Department of Health, have developed a package of resource materials on AIDS education to assist schools in their development of educational programmes in this area.  The resource materials package was developed and sent to the usual consultative bodies, Teacher Unions, Management Bodies, National Parents Council by the Department of Education, and to the health boards by the Department of Health for information and comment.</P>
      <P>The materials were piloted in 20 schools and, following modifications in the light of this process and comment received, the final version was printed and disseminated to all second-level schools at the end of September 1990. Copies were also sent to FÁS youth training schemes, teachers in the prison service, teachers' centres, various bodies and libraries including the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a series of one-day seminars on the use of the materials were organised, on a regional basis.  Over the course of the school years 1990-91 and 1991-92 a total of 27 seminars was organised and every school was offered an opportunity to send two teachers to a seminar.  Approximately 75-80 per cent took up this offer.  In general the response to both the seminars and the materials was highly positive.</P>

      <P>I have noted the Comhairle's comments on all of the areas specified by the Deputy.  The geographical distribution of consultant posts, the alleged over-production of medical graduates relative to this country's needs and the imbalance between the number of hospital training posts and consultant vacancies are all issues that will be examined in depth in the context of the tripartite study on medical manpower currently under way. This is a collaborative exercise involving my Department, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board and the Comhairle.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 134 temporary-locum consultant appointments, their regulation is a matter for Comhairle itself. With the exception of two or three specialties, the number and duration of such appointments is not unduly high.  I understand that Comhairle is now working closely with employing authorities to encourage permanent appointments as far as possible.  Comhairle will continue its policy of keeping temporary-locum appointments to the minimum essential for the maintenance of services.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the provision of primary care and management of persons with HIV requires a multifaceted approach involving primary care professionals particularly general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The National AIDS Strategy Committee, of which I am Chairman, has completed a report on the care and management of persons with HIV-AIDS. This report recognises that some general practitioners encounter difficulties in treating certain patients with HIV and recommended the establishment of community type clinics where general practitioners would provide services on a sessional basis.</P>
      <P>I have made funding specifically available to the Eastern Health Board to establish two satellite clinics in the Dublin area to implement this recommendation and thereby put in place an appropriate framework for the effective delivery of primary care services for drug abusers with HIV.  I expect these satellite clinics to be operational shortly.</P>
      <P>I have also funded a Primary Care Research and Development Project involving the Eastern Health Board and the Royal College of Surgeons which is providing on-going service assessment of HIV patients in the Dublin area to determine the strengths and problems associated with the provision of comprehensive primary care services.</P>
      <P>As far as capitation rates in the GMS are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that the Review of the General Medical Services scheme is in progress.  The review will address a wide range of issues of concern to participating general practitioners and to health service management.</P>

      <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the years 1988 and 1989 which was published recently outlined, among other things, the measures which in the inspector's opinion needed to be taken in those years to enhance patient care.  I am satisfied that the recommendations of the inspectorate have been acted upon by all health boards and that the rehabilitation and activation of patients in psychiatric hospitals has been given a greater priority.  Progress in this respect has been noted by the inspector in his reports for 1990 and 1991 which will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I launched a Green Paper on Mental Health on 3 June last.  The Green Paper includes a chapter on improving care in the existing psychiatric hospitals.  It draws attention to the vulnerability of long-stay patients in psychiatric hospitals and the need to maintain standards in the hospitals at the same time as services are moving to acute hospitals and the community.  For this reason the Government intend to retain the present role of the inspector in relation to the psychiatric hospitals.  The inspectorate will continue to provide an objective report on the standards of accommodation and care in psychiatric hospitals and a means whereby my Department and the public can be kept informed of the conditions in the hospitals and progress towards the rehabilitation of patients and their transfer to more appropriate services.</P>
      <P>Submissions on the proposals in the Green Paper have been invited from interested parties before 1 October next.</P>

      <P>In May 1991 the Board of Cheeverstown House and the Eastern Health Board agreed to the appointment of a third party to oversee the implementation of an agreement negotiated in October 1990.  This decision enabled the then Minister for Health to provide funding in June 1991 to open 20 additional residential places in Cheeverstown House.</P>
      <P>As the agreement of October 1990 provided that a chief executive officer be appointed before the places were opened, the clients to occupy these places were identified and placed in temporary accommodation in late 1991 in other mental handicap agencies in the Dublin area pending the opening of the places in Cheeverstown House.  A total of 37 clients benefited from this additional service provision.</P>
      <P>A chief executive officer of Cheeverstown House was appointed on 1 April 1992.  Following discussions between the Eastern Health Board and Cheeverstown House it was agreed that the 20 places would be opened on a phased basis between mid-July and late September 1992.  As some of the places will be used for respite care, the 37 clients will continue to benefit from the additional funding made available to Cheeverstown.</P>
      <P>The October 1990 agreement provides for further places to be opened in 1993 on condition that the implementation of the agreement will continue into 1993, overseen by the third party.</P>

      <P>The drugs refund scheme, which provides for a refund of any expenditure on prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of a specified amount over a prescribed period, was amended with effect from 1 August 1991.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that less than a month has passed since the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, or the Earth Summit as it became known.  The establishment of an important new body such as the Commission on Sustainable Development will require extensive consideration before its structure and functions are precisely defined.  It will be necessary to ensure that the Commission has sufficient resources for its task and that it does not overlap with other United Nations institutions, such as the Economic and Social Committee, which are also concerned with environment and development matters.  At the recent Lisbon European Council, the EC member states agreed to play a leading role in the establishment of the Commission at the forthcoming United Nations General Assembly.</P>

      <P>This person has been deemed ineligible for payment of grants under the 1991 suckler cow premium scheme because he made a false declaration on his application.  Two animals which were stated to have calved in June 1991 were found to be in-calf heifers at inspection on 1 October 1991.  I regret that I do not have discretion to change that decision in this case.</P>
      <P>He was paid the maximum allowed per forage acre under the beef cow scheme in the disadvantaged areas for 1991 and accordingly is not due any grants under the equines headage or sheep headage schemes.  Through an oversight he was paid £47.50 under the 1991 sheep headage scheme.  It is proposed to recover this overpayment from grants due to him in the future.  The 1992 ewe premium application has been cleared for payment and the first advance under that scheme will be paid shortly.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 167, 168 and 169 together.</P>
      <P>My Department's operations have recently been restructured on the basis of eight regions with centres at Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Dundalk, Sligo, Galway and Longford with the largest region, Dublin, being divided into three sub-regions.  The purpose of the restructuring is to bring improved and speedier services closer to my Department's clients, to put in place management structures with a strong local identity and to enhance control mechanisms with a view to eliminating abuses of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dominant criteria in determining <Col N="1216" /> the numbers of staff in each region are workloads, geographic factors and population considerations.  Each region is managed by a Regional Manager assisted by the Assistant Principals in that region under the general direction of my Department's Regional Director.  The regional management are responsible for the delivery of social welfare services in their regions, in particular the unemployment payment schemes, the processing of claims that require client interview, the operation of control procedures, the development of an information service and liaising with voluntary and community development groups.  To this end, and depending on the needs of the region, the Assistant Principals are engaged in a wide range of duties appropriate to their grade.</P>
    <P>The selection criteria for Assistant Principals in the regions is the same as that for the grade in all other areas of my Department, including suitability for the post, relevant experience and work performance. Regard must also be had to agreements with the staff side, Civil Service Commission interdepartmental competitions, transfer applications etc.  Apart from the Assistant Principals, each Regional Manager is assisted by a small number of more junior staff whose function is also to assist the Regional Manager in the effective administration of the region.  The numbers and grades of staff assigned for this purpose are detailed in the following table.  However, I would point out that the number engaged in such duties will vary from time to time as each regional manager has discretion to deploy the resources of the region to suit local requirements.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons living in the State who are 66 years of age or over and to certain incapacitated persons under that age.  The scheme also enables a spouse under age 66 to travel free when accompanying a free travel pass holder.  This is in recognition of the fact that married couples would be accustomed to travelling together.</P>
      <P>There is no provision enabling another member of the pass holder's family to travel free where the spouse is incapacitated or deceased.  To extend the scheme in that way would have significant financial and other implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of invalidity pension since 28 April 1988.  He was being paid at the rate of £93.60 per week comprising a personal rate of £56.40 and an adult dependant allowance of £37.20 up to 1 July 1992.  As the wife of the person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit in her own right at the full personal rate of £50.00 per week, no adult dependant allowance or invalidity pension is payable to her husband.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions under the Social Welfare Acts for payment of an adult dependant allowance with invalidity pension in respect of an adult dependant who is receiving a social welfare payment in his/her own right.  If, however, the means of the person concerned are insufficient to meet his needs, he may contact the community welfare officer at his local health board office regarding possible eligibility for payment under the Supplementary Welfare Act.</P>
      <P>The rate of payment to the couple concerned will be increased from 30 July 1992, from £106.40 to £111.70 per week.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which was agreed between the Government and representatives of employers and trade unions, contained a commitment to extend social insurance cover to part-time workers.  This was implemented in April 1991 by bringing part-time workers earning £25 or more into social insurance.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to exempt particular industries from the system as this would lead to loss of benefits for the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the new arrangements imposed additional costs on certain <Col N="1220" /> industries which employ a number of part-time workers.  I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the mushroom industry, and the particular problems of the industry have been addressed by officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>An information leaflet has been prepared, setting out the advantages of PRSI and also giving information on other benefits, so that workers would be aware of the extent to which they can work without affecting these benefits.  In addition, the Revenue Commissioners have issued a circular through the Irish Mushroom Growers Association setting out the arrangements which apply in order to ensure consistency in their application throughout the country.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to resolve any transitional problems arising in the implementation of the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the FÁS Enterprise Scheme.  The numbers participating in the scheme each year in the past five years were as follows: 1991, 1,592; 1990, 2,534; 1989, 2,523; 1988, 2,467; 1987, 4,539.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details are not available on the number of participants who have remained in business.  However, a study carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute in 1988 found that some 55 per cent of businesses set up <Col N="1221" /> under the enterprise scheme were still in business after two years.</P>
    <P>The scheme is not aimed at the long term unemployed.  It is designed specifically to encourage unemployed persons on the live register for at least 13 weeks and in receipt of unemployment compensation to set up their own enterprises. Expenditure on the scheme through the Department of Labour is offset by savings in expenditure through the Department of Social Welfare.  I have no plans to amend the elegibility conditions for the scheme.</P>
    <P>The 40 week enterprise payment is an income support measure which is part of a range of supports available through FÁS to unemployed persons wishing to set up their own businesses.  These supports include a ten week business appraisal training course prior to participation in the enterprise scheme during which participants are paid FÁS training allowances.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the area-based response to long term unemployment included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  The Taoiseach recently approved a package of measures aimed at eliminating the difficulties faced by persons who are long term unemployed when the possibility of taking up either paid employment and/or training and development schemes present themselves.  These measures which will operate solely in the 12 areas established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> strategy include allowing long term unemployed people interested in setting up their own businesses to be paid an allowance equivalent to their unemployment payments for 12 months.  They can then enter the enterprise scheme.</P>
    <P>The area-based strategy will be reviewed and may be extended nationwide.</P>

      <P>The Catering Joint Labour Committee established in 1977 does not cover catering workers in the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  Last year SIPTU applied to the Labour Court to extend the scope of the Catering JLC to include those areas. The court, having conducted an inquiry, decided to reject the application on the grounds that it considered that the extension of the Catering JLC and its associated Employment Regulation Order was not the appropriate mechanism to provide safeguards for catering workers in the two areas concerned.  I understand that the Catering JLC is at present examining the position in the light of the court's decision.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent Charter of Rights produced by the European Network of the Unemployed; his views on the objectives of the charter; if he intends to take any steps to further the objectives of the charter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question refers to the Charter of Rights of the Unemployed which was drafted by delegates from eight European countries at the annual conference of the European Network of the Unemployed in Spain in October 1990.</P>
      <P>The charter is a wide-ranging document comprising a series of demands relating to employment and the labour market generally which would have implications for different aspects of Government policy and programmes.</P>
      <P>Most of the labour market issues raised in the charter are already being addressed in the context of Government policy and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>Tackling unemployment remains a major priority of Government as the charter advocates.  In this respect the Government fully recognise the value of social consensus in achieving its aim of sustained economic and employment growth.</P>
      <P>I agree with the charter's call for the creation of real and socially useful employment: the only substantive answer to the problem of unemployment is the creation of authentic, viable, self-sustaining jobs.</P>
      <P>The successive national programmes agreed between all of the social partners have proved to be the major contributory factor to the economic recovery achieved over the last four years.  I am convinced that without these agreements this country could not have come through the global recession as well as it has compared with most of the major economies of the world.  Indeed, the Irish economy is better placed than most to capitalise on the anticipated upswing in world trade.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Hours of Work/Overtime</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As provided for in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> (PNR), 150,000 <Col N="1224" /> workers now benefit from reduced working hours.  A framework agreement on hours of work was concluded in 1989, providing for the implementation of a one hour per week reduction in working hours where the normal working week is at or above 40 hours.  The Department are aware of over 450 agreements which have put the framework into effect.</P>
    <P>While systematic overtime depresses job-opportunities, however, the question of negotiations about the trade-off between extra jobs and the ability of firms to respond to market changes is best handled through the local collective bargaining process.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part-time Employees/Short-term</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 employment protection and holiday and maternity benefits were extended to those working a minimum of 8 hours per week.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP) contains a commitment to review the legislation relating to holidays.</P>
    <P>The question of short term employment contracts is a matter for negotiation between the employer and the employee. Any undue Government interference in this process could severely restrict a firm's flexibility and could damage employment potential.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Minimum Wage</i>
    </P>
    <P>As there are many factors contributing to low pay, measures to tackle the problem must cover a wide range of areas such as education, training, social benefits, taxation and collective bargaining. The overall solution to the problem of low pay is to increase the range of job opportunities available.</P>
    <P>Joint Labour Committees (JLCs) provide a flexible and effective means of tackling the problem of low pay in particular sectors.  There are at present 15 JLCs in operation, representing approximately 68,000 workers.</P>
    <P>In addition, the pay increases negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery and Programme for Economic</i><Col N="1225" /><i>and Social Progress</i> have been deliberately structured in favour of the low-paid and provide for minimum flat-rate increases while the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the Employer-Labour Conference will consider all the issues affecting a statutory minimum wage, including the opeation of the JLC system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employee Participation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Arising from commitments contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery and Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> the FIE and ICTU have had discussions on how best to encourage and develop employee involvement.</P>
    <P>Arising from these discussions a joint-declaration, covering employee involvement in the private sector, was published in June 1991, with the aim of promoting employee involvement as a complementary activity to conventional industrial relations practices.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Protection of Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Protection of Employment Act, 1977 provides that an employer must notify workers' representatives of proposed redundancies and consult with them on their implementation.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Act is currently under review.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rights of Foreign Nationals</i>
    </P>
    <P>All EC nationals and non-EC nationals who are legally working here enjoy the same rights as Irish workers as provided for under protective legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Training</i>
    </P>
    <P>All of the mainline training/retraining courses provided by FÁS are designed to improve the skill levels of trainees.  The courses are updated regularly to take account, <i>inter alia</i>, of changing skill requirements.  They are geared towards various categories of persons, with priority being given to persons on the live register and early school leavers. Training is provided for women returning to work after a prolonged absence from the workforce.</P>
    <P>The aim is to have certification for <Col N="1226" /> all FÁS training courses.  Several courses receive joint certification through FÁS and City and Guilds of London.  Under this arrangement, there is a mutual system in operation.  Negotiations are in progress with a view to involving other bodies in the certification of courses on a similar basis.</P>
    <P>Unemployed persons are not obliged to participate in training.  However, they are encouraged to participate and persons with dependants are paid an additional allowance over and above the normal training allowances.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for training of employees rests with employers although the State encourages such training.  Close liaison is maintained between the State training agencies and the educational system.</P>
    <P>FÁS provides funding for the 13 ICTU centres for the unemployed, totalling about £150,000 per annum.  In addition, assistance is provided through its cooperative development programme and through social employment scheme projects.</P>
    <P>CERT, the Council for the Education, Recruitment and Training for the Hotel, Catering and Tourism Industry, is the coordinating and executive State-sponsored body responsible for the education, recruitment, training and placement of staff at all levels for the industry.  It provides training both for those seeking to enter the industry and for those already employed.  There is equality of access to CERT training for males and females.  Personal development is included in all CERT training courses.</P>
    <P>At Maastricht, eleven member states, including Ireland, signed an Agreement on Social Policy which sets out the procedure for implementing the 1989 Social Charter.</P>
    <P>Future developments in this field will be largely influenced by the provisions of the agreement.</P>

      <P>The FIE/ICTU Joint Declaration on Employee Involvement in the Private Sector which was drawn up under the Employer Labour Conference was launched by the Minister for Labour in June 1991.  At the launch the Minister stressed that the document should not be seen as an end but as the beginning of a process of exhorting and encouraging the development of employee involvement.</P>
      <P>I know that both FIE and ICTU are committed to the promotion of the content and spirit of the document and have impressed on all member companies and unions the importance of introducing employee involvement initiatives along the lines outlined in the document.  The IPC which was designated as the national participation agency has also been actively promoting the document and reports a very positive response.</P>
      <P>The Employer Labour Conference has been given the role of monitoring developments and I am confident that over time they will have very positive results to report.</P>
      <P>I and officials of my Department have regular contact and meetings with FIE and ICTU at which many issues are discussed including the question of employee involvement.  At two such meetings with ICTU so far this year employee involvement issues have been on the agenda for discussion.</P>
