      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 8 and 9; No. 9 shall be taken at 12.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that business shall be interrupted at 12 midnight.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings in Committee on No. 8 up to and including section 21, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with item No. 8 agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal that item No. 21 &mdash; that is Private Members' Business &mdash; be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 this evening satisfactory?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>About two weeks ago the Taoiseach indicated in the House in private meetings with the Opposition Leaders that he had made available to them the wording the Government had in mind for the amendment of the Maastricht Protocol.  It appears from a statement on the part of a Minister of State that in fact a number of alternative wordings at present are being canvassed around Europe by the Government and not just one wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, Sir. Does the Taoiseach propose to make available to Members of the House copies of the alternative wordings the Government have in mind so that people in the House can be consulted as well as those outside the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to reject the word &ldquo;hawking&rdquo;&mdash; a Fine Gael invention.  But, for the benefit of party Leaders, I said that when we had arrived at the stage at which it would be appropriate to update the party Leaders I would do so.  My office will be in touch with party Leaders today to let them know where we are at at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There appeared to be a general acceptance of the urgency to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgment in this House a fortnight <Col N="1491" /> ago.  Since the Taoiseach has said that there possibly would be some consultation with party Leaders today, I would appreciate it if he would inform this House what the Government are doing, and pursuing, in Europe.  There was a second aspect of this, that is in relation to legislation, as put forward by the Supreme Court in relation to our obligations in this matter.  May I inquire of the Taoiseach whether the Government have taken a decision and whether there will be legislation introduced in this House to regulate matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the House and in order to be helpful, I should say I make it quite clear two weeks ago that the Government were approaching this matter at two different levels.  One was to correct the position in relation to the freedom to travel on the part of citizens of EC member states; that was number one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Second, I said the Government were also considering whether legislation or a referendum, one or the other or both, was appropriate.  I said that was a separate matter that would be dealt with at length because it is a very complex one to which there is no simple or easy solution.  The Government are concerned to ensure that on this occasion we get the matter right, that we get the correct answer, if that is humanly possible <Col N="1492" /> to get, and we will not be bounced or rushed into any immediate choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>While realising that consultation is a new process for the Fianna Fáil Party, it is only right that we should advert to the fact that in this House yesterday specific questions were asked of the Taoiseach in relation to what was taking place in regard to the Maastricht Protocol when the Taoiseach refused to answer.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if it is his intention to give time in this House to enable us to discuss alternative wordings to the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty before other European Governments have a chance to discuss it in private?  In other words, will the Members of this House, elected to represent both the male and female citizens of this Republic, have an opportunity to discuss the revision of the Protocol before foreigners see it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that Opposition leaders are not being kept updated if they have to discover through the papers, by virtue of an interview with a Minister of State, that alternative wordings are being canvassed in Europe and only one such wording has been made available in any form to the Opposition leaders?  The Taoiseach should not give the impression that there is consultation in this matter when there is not consultation in this matter.  The Government are acting entirely on their own account in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to promised legislation, perhaps the Taoiseach would confirm to the House that it was indicated to his Government by the Attorney General that this issue cannot be adequately addressed in the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and that it requires a referendum.

      <P>I wish to seek some information from the Taoiseach in relation to the long promised Green Paper on Education.  Last year the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, informed us that a Green Paper was about to be published.  The former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, also informed us that it was about to be published. I now see that the Green Paper will be delayed for a number of months. Perhaps the Taoiseach can explain why the Green Paper will be delayed yet again.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I said that the Minister for Education was availing of the opportunity, as <Col N="1496" /> previous Ministers for Education did, to acquaint himself with the Green Paper and make changes to it.  At my request attention will be drawn in the Green Paper to the development of an enterprise culture in our society which will be started at school level.  When the Minister has completed his deliberations in this regard the Government will make a decision and the Green Paper will be published.  It will not be a matter of months before it is published.</P>

      <P>We had a long debate on this amendment and there is an agreement today to debate as many sections as possible.  I understood that the Minister was well disposed to the import of the amendment and I asked whether it would be possible on Report Stage for her to accept the phrase &ldquo;not exceeding £10 million or such greater sum commensurate with the full cost of returning the environment to its original state or reasonable equivalent&rdquo;.  If the Minister of State is well disposed to that we can achieve the twin objectives of the Opposition Deputies who tabled the amendment who are fearful that a fixed sum &mdash; even a sum of £10 million &mdash; will be insufficient to meet the requirements of a horrendous catastrophe such as the <i>Exxon Valdez</i>, and at the same time have a back-mark figure in the legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that formulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider this amendment for Report Stage? While the sum of £10 million mentioned in the section seems a lot of money, it is very easy to visualise environmental disasters which could cost a great deal more to put right.  For instance, in Alaska, an oil tanker went aground on the rocks and did hundreds of millions of pounds worth of environmental damage. It is not fanciful to think that that sort of situation might arise around our coast; indeed when I was Minister for Transport there were two major alerts on the same night, the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Capo Emma.</i> We were very lucky to get away with small environmental damage.  Luckily, there was no damage of a lasting nature and it did not cost a fortune to put right but it could have.  I also remember the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> disaster off the coast of Cornwall about 20 years ago which did an incredible amount of damage and cost <Col N="1501" /> much more than £10 million to put right. In that context, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment or to address it in somewhat altered wording on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were debating the Bill on the last ocasion I moved this amendment, I thought it was self-explanatory and I did not think there would be a long debate on it.  I gather from the Minister's attitude that she understood exactly its import and that we wanted to ensure that those responsible for massive pollution on the scale which would require to be met by costs greater than £10 million would be held accountable and charged and that no limit would be put on the figure.  Since then there have been oil spillages along the west coast from Mayo right down to Kerry and they can cause major disasters.  The Minister should favourably reconsider the suggestion of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 43 is being debated with this amendment and I should like to make a few points. The issue which the Fine Gael amendment is quite rightly addressing is the possibility that damage caused might exceed the sum of £10 million and that there should be provision in the Bill for the possibility of fines exceeding that amount, which is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment addresses a slightly different aspect of the problem, situations where, very probably, the amount of damage caused might well be considerably less than £10 million but, when the case is brought to court, where a judge might not impose the kind of fine commensurate with the damage caused. There are many examples, even where the Legislature indicates high maximum fines, of the Judiciary delivering inconsistent judgments.  Very often a judge, for whatever reason, does not imppose a fine commensurate with the damage caused.  My amendment seeks to put an obligation on the court to take account of the damage caused when imposing a fine.  We have laid down a maximum fine of £10 million, although the damage <Col N="1502" /> caused might be considerably less.  It might be in the order of £500,000, but the judge may decide to impose a fine of a couple of thousand pounds, completely out of proportion to the damage caused. In the Bill there is much reference to &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle but it should be stitched into the Bill that that principle is not just about laying down maximum fines it is also about placing an obligation on the courts to take account of the amount of damage caused when they are making their judgment and imposing the fine for the offence which has been committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we discussed this on the last occasion I have had the opportunity of discussing the matter with the Attorney General.  I said on the previous occasion that I was against removing the £10 million fine because it is important to give an indication to the courts in this legislation of the extent and kind of fine about which we are talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with some of the comments made by Deputies in relation to the reluctance to impose substantial fines on those convicted of offences in relation to environmental damage.  I hope that will change and that the courts will impose tough fines where persons are convicted of pollution offences.  I am very keen, in so far as I can, to give guidance and encouragement but, at the end of the day, it is purely a matter for the courts to consider all the evidence and weigh the facts before them.  I said the last day that I was very taken by the amendment in the name of Deputy Gilmore and certainly the substance of what the Deputy is trying to do appeals to me.  However, when I discussed it with the Attorney General he advised that because the amendment includes the words &ldquo;shall have regard to the cost of restoring damage&rdquo; if there was no damage to the environment but gross negligence on the part of a particular individual or company, the courts would be prevented from imposing a fine or certainly would <Col N="1503" /> be prevented from imposing a large fine and that the fine would have to be linked to the cost of restoring the damage.  What I want to do is to keep the monetary fine of £10 million as well as taking on board what the Deputies on all sides wish, that is, in addition to a fine that we would have regard to the cost of repairing the damage and restoring the environment, if that was considered desirable.  I will have further discussions with the parliamentary draftspersons on that matter before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Let me add, however, that the costs of mitigating or remedying the effects of emissions are covered in the Third Schedule which encompasses the Air Pollution Act and also by the Water Pollution Act, which is also covered by this Bill.  If an offence is committed under the Water Pollution or Air Pollution Acts, the court in addition to imposing a fine will be free to impose a sum of money commensurate with making good the damage &mdash; for example, setting aside a sum of money so that a river may be restocked.  I ask the Deputies to bear with me until Report Stage.  In addition to imposing a fine I will see if there is some other way we can indicate to the courts that the fine should reflect not only the negligence but the level of damage that has been done to the environment and the cost of repairing that damage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;prosecuted by the Agency,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the section stands at present it appears to us that the payment of fines to the agency is limited to offences processed by the agency.  We wish to delete the words &ldquo;prosecuted by the Agency&rdquo; so that no matter who institutes the prosecution the fines will go to the agency. This seems a reasonable point to put to the Minister and perhaps she will explain why the agency will only get the fines in the cases where they instituted the prosecution.</P>
      <P>We feel the agency should be the beneficiary of all the fines.  While I personally as a member of a local authority see some merit in the local authority getting the fines in cases brought under the Air and Water Pollution Acts, as there is a cost involved to the local authorities in carrying out their duties under the environmental legislation, it would be of benefit if all fines went to the agency and I ask the Minister to give us the benefit of her wisdom as to why this should not be the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The acceptance of this amendment would involve a total change <Col N="1505" /> in our legal system.  The fines on summary conviction will obviously go to the agency because they will be the prosecuting authority. If we were to accept the Deputy's amendment it would mean that in cases where the Minister, a local authority, a body responsible for Eco-labelling for example or for operating internationally modified organisms took the prosecution, the agency would benefit from the fine.  I think that would be unsatisfactory. The prosecutions will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions who will in the main bear the heavy cost of taking such a case.  Although the agency will give assistance in the case, the Director of Public Prosecutions will bear the heavy burden of taking the case through the court.  It is right and proper therefore, as happens in all other cases in the State under our present legal system, that fines so imposed go to the State.  It is then a matter for the State to decide how such fines may be allocated.</P>
      <P>I am not free to accept this amendment as it would involve a total change in our legal system.  It would mean that the agency would be the beneficiary of fines even when they did not actually prosecute or have any real function in relation to matters which would be the function of other bodies.  For that reason I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to my amendment, No. 48 which is being taken with Deputy Howlin's amendments.  The section provides for authorised persons of the agency to enter premises to examine documents, records, take samples and so on.  Two types of situation are presented here.  One is where an authorised person would enter a premises, for example, a factory or some kind of commercial premises where it would be necessary to carry out certain inspections. It is perfectly in order that the authorised person would be enabled to enter those premises on their own without notice to carry out whatever inspection would be necessary.  Situations might arise from time to time, as Deputy Kavanagh pointed out, where it might be necessary for the authorised person to be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  I do not think it should be necessary on all occasions for the authorised person to go to the trouble of getting a member of the Garda Síochána to accompany him or her into the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second situation &mdash; which my amendment is seeking to address &mdash; relates to subsection (2) which deals with entry into a private dwelling.  The Bill, as drafted, proposes that the authorised person can only enter a private dwelling if he has given 24 hours notice to the occupier of his intention to enter the dwelling.  That is perfectly reasonable as far as it goes.  One has to be cautious and sensitive when talking about persons acting on behalf of the State or State agencies entering private dwellings. Some precaution has to be taken as private dwellings might be used to conceal and avoid possible prosecution by unscrupulous people who, aware that the authorised person was about to make a swoop, transferred certain equipment or documents into their private dwelling, and, having got 24 hours notice of the <Col N="1508" /> authorised person's intention to visit, would have the opportunity of disposing or transferring them to somewhere else.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to provide an arrangement whereby the authorised person, if he believed something of that nature was taking place, would be able to go to the court, obtain a warrant to enter the premises and enter the premises in the company of a member of the Garda Síochána.  The Control of Dogs Bill, which is before the House, gives a dog warden authority, through the Garda Síochána, to obtain a warrant and, in the company of a member of the Garda Síochána, to enter a private dwelling.  I do not anticipate that that would arise too often.  Where there might be serious pollution and where the level of fines may be substantial one has to anticipate the extent to which unscrupulous people will go to avoid prosecution.  I see a possible loophole in this legislation if 24 hours notice has to be given before entering a private dwelling.  In normal circumstances that would be perfectly reasonable.  That loophole must be closed in cases where the private dwelling may be used to escape possible detection and prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <P>In general, I support amendments Nos. 46 and 47.  I am very supportive of amendment No. 48, in the name of Deputy Gilmore.  It is a very reasonable amendment.  It should be borne in mind that private dwellings are sometimes used illegally for business purposes where planning permission has not been granted.  In the normal course a person's private dwelling, which is used solely for that purpose and not for any business activity or to store documents of any kind, should be protected by legislation. However, Deputy Gilmore is trying to strike a reasonable balance between the obvious rights of the householder and the rights of the community who could be involved if there were some serious pollution problems.  It is an excellent amendment.  Deputy Kavanagh elaborated on amendments Nos. 49 and 50.  I do not fully understand their purpose so I <Col N="1509" /> cannot indicate whether I would support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accept amendment No. 47 in the name of Deputy Howlin.  It seeks to insert after &ldquo;persons&rdquo; the following, &ldquo;(including members of the Garda Síochána)&rdquo;. Although I believe members of the Garda Síochána were included it is no harm to specify it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore made a very good case for his amendment.  I would like, with his agreement, to give some further consideration to it before Report Stage. Obviously, authorised persons can enter premises other than private dwellings without giving notice.  That is desirable, otherwise it would be impossible for them to carry out their duties, to take samples, inspect records and so on.  If they had to give notice invariably all the evidence would be removed.  When authorised persons are visiting private dwellings I am anxious to ensure that they respect, on the one hand, the privacy of individuals and families and, on the other, that they have due regard for the need for the agency to have authorised persons go to private dwellings to assist in carrying out the work.  However, because the Deputy includes a warrant and asks that the authorised person be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána &mdash; that is a reasonable precaution &mdash; I would like to discuss the matter with the Attorney General.  I would not agree to deleting subsection (6) because there should be a power to give 24 hours notice of an intention to visit a private dwelling except in circumstances, as suggested by Deputy Gilmore, where the warrant is obtained and the person enters in the company of a member of the Garda Síochana for the purposes of carrying out an inspection, examining records and so on.  If one gave notice of intention to visit a dwelling and was refused entry we would need subsection (6) which allows one to obtain a warrant, following a refusal.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) states:</P>

    <P>Where an authorised person in the <Col N="1510" /> exercise of his powers under this section is prevented from entering any premises, the authorised person or the person by whom he was appointed may apply to the District Court for a warrant...</P>
    <P>This includes an authorised person who is refused permission to enter a premises or refused entry after 24 hours notice has been given to a private dwelling.  In the event of such a refusal the authorised person has the power to obtain a warrant to enter the premises.  Therefore, I would not be happy to delete subsection (6).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 46, in the name of Deputy Howlin, seeks to give authorised persons under this Bill, in certain situations prescribed by the Minister, certain powers for the purposes of other environmental legislation.  That is a far reaching power and it means for the purposes of implementing the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act and similar Acts, that an authorised person under this Bill will also be the authorised person under those Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment would be able to prescribe, in the case of any legislation &mdash; because almost everything affects the environment in some way &mdash; that these authorised persons would have the powers that other bodies already have.  Although there will be cases where it would be sensible for the authorised persons, for the purposes of this Bill, to act in certain situations for other bodies from time to time this would have to be specifically referred to and the powers of those bodies would have to be transferred to the agency for that purpose.  It could prove in time that to have a hard and fast rule in these matters is too black and white.</P>
    <P>I would like to have an opportunity before Report Stage to talk again to the Attorney General about this matter to see if we could facilitate authorised persons of this agency to act as authorised persons for the purposes of other legislation. I am thinking here of emergencies where it might be desirable, where agency staff are working in a particular area, for them to act on behalf of another <Col N="1511" /> body from time to time.  Subject to the agreement of the House, I will consider amendments No. 46 and 48 before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It seems, given the way the subsection has been drafted, that it will allow the authorised person to apply for a warrant but does not expressly authorise the court to grant the warrant.  Neither does it provide any criteria for the court to apply in deciding whether to grant the warrant.  It is important that there should be some mention of this in the subsection.  Neither does it outline what the consequences would be if a warrant is disobeyed. Would the Minister of State comment on those points?</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer but let me give an immediate response.  I think we would have to leave it up to the court to decide whether a warrant should be granted.  This subsection will apply if the authorised person is refused entry to a premises.  It will apply where a person is physically restrained from entering the premises in which case they should be <Col N="1512" /> perfectly entitled to go to the court to put their case.  I have no doubt that in virtually all circumstances the court would be willing to give the authorised person the warrant to enter a premises. It would then be a legal matter and I presume that they would be accompanied by members of the Garda Síochána, although not necessarily so, but they may have to be if they are physically restrained from entering the premises.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that I should set down the criteria that the court should take into account.  Obviously it will be put to the court that authorised officers, if they are to carry out their duties, will have to be allowed to enter a premises to take samples and carry out inspections.  If they are not in a position to do so they will not be in a position to carry out their duties under the Bill. Therefore, I have no doubt that the court will give them the necessary warrant if they find it impossible to carry out their duties otherwise.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong of us to tie the hands of the court and allow it grant a warrant in specific circumstances only, or to insist that the court grant the warrant.  At the end of the day the court will decide and obviously will have the power either to give or refuse the warrant.  It may refuse to grant a warrant if it feels it would be unreasonable to do so and that there are no good grounds for believing that a warrant is necessary.  I think that would be the exception and I cannot think of any circumstances where it would be possible for me, even if I was willing to do so, to limit the capacity of the court to decide on matters of this kind.  I am not aware that this happens in the case of other legislation and I think it is purely a matter for the court to decide whether to grant a warrant on the basis of the facts before it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> The reason this amendment has been tabled is that it appears subsections (7) and (8) are unnecessary.  Section 6 (1) empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purpose of giving full effect to this Bill.  That is one of the main reasons this subsection should be deleted.  It also seems that subsection (9) is meaningless.  What is the point in giving a certificate outlining the results of tests on a sample unless that certificate is going to be used in criminal proceedings, where environmental legislation has been breached? The subsection should state this. We think the subsection should be deleted for those reasons.</P>

      <P>As this is enabling legislation, the Minister is given various powers throughout the Bill, many of which will be implemented by way of regulations.  Although a specific power is given in the Bill it is repeated in many of the individual sections.  It is interesting that while Deputy Howlin wants to delete subsection (7) he leaves subsection (8) which also gives the Minister power to make regulations, if he so wishes.  In that subsection the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used as opposed to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It states that the Minister may make regulations to provide for the taking of samples and the carrying out of tests, examinations, analyses and so on.  If there is a necessity for regulations, it is desirable that the power to make regulations should exist in this subsection as it does in many other sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am quite concerned about this section and I would like to hear the Minister of State's <i>rationale</i> for including it.  As I read it, section 15 will put the agency above and beyond the law.  It states:</P>
      <P>No action or other proceedings shall lie or be maintainable against the Agency or any body referred to in section 44 or 45.</P>
      <P>&mdash;those sections refer to local authorities and various other public authorities who will carry out various functions on behalf of the agency&mdash;</P>
      <P>for the recovery of damages in respect of any injury to persons, damage to property or other loss alleged to have been caused or contributed to by a failure to perform or to comply with any of the functions conferred on the said Agency or body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words as I read the section, if the agency are negligent in carrying out their functions or cause damage to property or injury to people in the course of carrying out their functions they cannot be sued.  I find this to be an extraordinary section.  In other words, the citizens, the public, will have no recourse to the courts of the land against the agency in respect of any of the agency's actions or if they are negligent.  That seems to be an extraordinary provision.  I do not know of any <Col N="1515" /> other public authority that cannot be sued.  That is what is being proposed in this legislation.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation for it.  I indicated in the amendments tabled that I wish to oppose the section, because as it stands it is extraodinary to put into legislation a provision that the Environmental Protection Agency would be above the law, above the normal recourse that citizens have to the courts for actions concerning negligence, damage, or loss.</P>

      <P>Section 15 provides complete immunity for the agency in tort actions for the recovery of loss caused by failure to exercise functions under the Act.  It would not appear to prohibit a criminal prosecution of the agency or a judicial review of the agency's failure to act in a particular case, nor would it appear to prohibit tort actions where the agency performs a function negligently, causing loss.  The Minister referred to this in the Seanad debate.  The section also applies to any body referred to in sections 44 and 45.  This could refer to the Minister, a local authority or any other public authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of these bodies in the language here is a little bit coy.  If the Minister wishes to protect herself, she should name herself in the Bill in section 15.  This subsection should be deleted. Perhaps the Minister will be able to answer some of our concerns about this <Col N="1516" /> subsection and then we can consider how we will deal with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not give immunity against the negligent performance of functions, nor does it mean that the agency are above the law, as the Deputy suggested.  This section provides that the agency shall be immune from any legal proceedings for recovery of damages arising from a failure to perform their functions.  It does not give immunity against negligent performance or functions. A similar immunity is granted to any other body, such as a local authority or any other public authority, or the Minister when providing services under sections 43 and 44.  The range of functions under the Bill is so broad that if the immunity was not included it would leave the Agency or bodies acting on their behalf exposed to a succession of law suits which would be damaging, not only financially but which would also adversely affect the credibility and standing of the Agency and the other bodies involved.  Without this provision the Agency could easily become the fall guy if serious pollution occurred, given the doctrine of joint and several liability which applies in Irish law.  There is a similar provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  If, for example an officer of the Agency did not notice something on an inspection, it would not be fair that the Agency could be held liable if the inspector deemed that everything was in order and an accident occurred later.  If this power was not here, they would be open to a host of litigation. While it is open to anybody to sue the agency or the officers of the agency for negligence, it would be a matter of having to prove their case.  If we did not have this provision the job of the agency would be impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide number of functions in this Bill.  If the agency had not the resources to carry out some of the functions, should they be liable?  When the Agency start work they will have to decide on priorities and some matters may be left aside for some time.  Would it be appropriate to subject the agency to <Col N="1517" /> litigation for failure to carry out a function simply because they felt that it was in the interests of the environment to organise their affairs in a certain way? The Deputies are concerned that in carrying out their duties the agency will in some way be above the law because of this section.  That is not the intention or the effect of this section.  If the agency are negligent in the performance of their functions they can be sued.  It would be wrong if the agency could be sued for a simple mistake or for a failure to see something.  A similar provision exists in relation to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  I am not sure if it applies in relation to other legislation, but I will check up on it.  We had a good debate in relation to this matter in the Seanad.  On balance it is appropriate that officers working for a public authority should have this kind of protection. Otherwise it would be virtually impossible for them to carry out their duties under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a legal person but I do not readily see the distinction between being able to pursue an action against somebody for negligence as against an action for failure to carry out some function.  The example the Minister gave of an officer of the agency going out on inspection and failing to notice something could well be regarded as negligence in certain circumstances, whereas if the officer had not gone out at all to inspect something that might be regarded as a failure.  There is a very thin line here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the agency to work effectively. If we allow this section to remain in the Bill, whereby the agency, the directors and officers know that no matter how lax they are in carrying out their functions, no matter how lethargic they become, nobody has any recourse in law against them, it could result in an agency which is less than active and vigilant in doing their work.  Any action brought by any person has to be proved.  If one wants to take an action against the Environmental Protection Agency, or against a local authority to whom functions had been delegated, because of their failure <Col N="1518" /> to carry out inspections or other functions under the legislation, one must prove one's case.</P>
    <P>The Minister is suggesting that the agency would be inundated with actions being taken against them, exposing them to all kinds of costs; but anybody taking an action against the agency would have to prove his case and assess his chances of success before going into court.  There is the normal precaution.  Any of us in the course of our work can be subject to actions being taken against us.  A doctor in a hospital, a teacher in a school, an individual school and all kinds of bodies are open to actions being taken against them.  The people taking the actions must prove their case.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of negligence. I do not see how one can draw the fine distinction between negligence and failure under this section.  If the agency receive a report about a factory causing a great deal of pollution in a local area and the agency fail to inspect it or to deal with the matter, pleading that there are other priorities and that they do not have the officers available, does that mean that the person who suffers loss or damage due to the pollution cannot pursue the agency?  Let us say the agency were in place when the Merck, Sharp and Dohme case arose in which Mr. Hanrahan claimed he had suffered loss as a result of pollution.  If the person concerned had reported it to the agency and they had failed to do anything about it, would they have been immune from action?  This is a very dangerous provision from the point of view of the citizen who has a right to expect action and service from public bodies funded by our taxes.  Lawyers will have great fun trying to draw the distinction between failure and negligence in particular circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience as a Member of this House and as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I have been disturbed by the lack of accountability by public bodies.  Local authorities are being screwed to the wall by a litigation-conscious public, egged on by members of the legal profession who <Col N="1519" /> seem to be hell bent on getting people into court to contest even minor incidents. One must try to reach a balance.</P>
      <P>Having considered this matter, I have to agree with Deputy Gilmore that all public bodies must be accountable and that the public must be protected against negligence and carelessness.  Will the officers and staff of the agency be protected if the agency do not have the resources and technology to take up existing issues and those which may arise?  It will take two or three years for the agency to become fully operational. What will happen if in the meantime a serious incident occurs which the agency have not the necessary resources and manpower to deal with?</P>
      <P>I can see both sides of the argument, but the public have a right to be protected and to take any action they deem fit.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 52 is an attempt to remove the defects in this section.  Deputy Gilmore's proposal to oppose the section is probably the easiest way out.  The section is not well worded in that it gives immunity to the Minister in respect of the non-exercise of any of her functions under the Act.  Is that what the Minister intended?  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, I will have to press the matter to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the debate and I am inclined to come down on the side of the Minister in this instance.  Deputy Gilmore mentioned Merck, Sharp and Dohme and asked what the situation would have been if the agency had been in place when the case was taken against them by Mr. Hanrahan. The primary people liable are the companies operating these industrial plants which are causing pollution.  These are the people who should pay.  The courts have been used by Mr. Hanrahan and many other plaintiffs over the years taking cases on environmental grounds against polluting industries.  We must not lose sight of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I get very cynical when I read in the <Col N="1520" /> newspapers that a certain county council have been fined £5,000 for breaches of the Water Pollution Act.  Who is to pay that £5,000?  It will not be the officials of the local authority but rather the rate payers or taxpayers.  If, as Deputy Gilmore suggests, a complaint is made to the agency and they fail to respond, or else carry out their inspection in a cursory fashion without pursuing the complaint, the Minister and the director general should be accountable for any loss caused by pollution.  The Minister should remove the director general or resign. Alternatively the director general should remove or suspend a negligent employee. A multi-million pound action against the agency will merely take money from the pockets of the taxpayers.  It is the polluter we must attack, not the agency.  If the agency are at fault the Minister and the director general should accept responsibility. For those reasons I will not support these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing we should have learned during the past six or nine months it is the difficulty of getting Ministers or Taoisigh to resign on foot of non-performance or failure on the part of public bodies.  It is not the easiest thing to establish a sufficient degree of accountability between the public body and the political person responsible to cause a resignation.  Unfortunately we do not seem to have the kind of political culture that would allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I distinctly recall that in the Merck, Sharp and Dohme case questions were raised about the performance of the local authority concerned.  If the local authority had been more vigilant in the carrying out of their functions the case might never have ended up in the courts. There is a principle involved here, the principle of accountability.  There are a number of ways of making people accountable.  As Deputy Garland has indicated, there is the political way, and I am in favour of that; but there is also accountability through the courts.  I do not believe that anybody, including a public body, should be immune from <Col N="1521" /> court action, which is effectively what this section provides for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Deputy Gilmore has said about lawyers having a field day trying to distinguish between failure and negligence, which is not an easy thing to do.  In the example given by the Deputy of an incident of pollution being reported to the agency but the agency doing nothing about it, obviously that would be negligence.  Where negligence is established the Agency can be sued and successfully prosecuted. However, there is a difference between that case and, for example, the case of an officer of the agency going to a particular plant and failing to notice that something is wrong.  If pollution or a major accident is caused, with somebody being killed or injured, or if environmental damage is caused, it would not be appropriate to involve the agency in any action that might be taken.  If, for example, members of the public complain about an environmental incident, instead of seeking, as Deputy Garland suggested, to have the real polluter convicted, the Agency would become the fall guy because they would be acting on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be virtually impossible for the director general, directors and staff of the agency to carry out their duties if they were to be subjected to the kind of litigation that could follow if immunity was not provided for.  The problems referred to by the Deputy would at the end of the day have to be matters for the court.  Otherwise, a Government may decide not to fund the agency because they know that the agency have widespread powers and have to work all night if necessary in order to carry out their task.  If they do not do so they could be sued and successfully prosecuted.  If we do not provide for immunity it would be virtually impossible to get employees to work for the agency.  If the agency fail to carry out their function because they have not the resources to do so, it is only right that blame should rest on the Government rather than on the officers of the State agency.  Perhaps the agency may not be able to take proper samples <Col N="1522" /> because they have not the resources to buy certain equipment and as a result a pollution incident occurs.  In such a case the inspector may have carried out his duties in a proper way but because he did not have the wherewithal to do the job that was necessary he could be held liable.  That would be intolerable.</P>
    <P>On balance, it is right that such a provision be inserted in this Bill.  A similar provision is included in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and perhaps in other legislation.  Because of what is involved here it is right that the courts should decide whether there is negligence.  Where there is failure to carry out a function either due to lack of resources or because of the priorities of the agency, the agency would obviously have to be immune from legal action.</P>

    <P>This section was inserted as a Government amendment in the Seanad.  My amendment proposes to extend the provisions for civil liability to all forms of pollution as covered in legislation such as the Water Pollution Act and other legislation.

      <P>The point the Deputy wishes to cover is already covered in the Air Pollution Act and the Water Pollution Act.  The Deputy seeks to extend the provision to waste, but there is no waste Act at present.  The intention is that the kind of provision included here will be included in the proposed waste legislation and it would be more appropriate that we deal with the matter then.  Otherwise we would be discussing hypothetical legislation.  As the Deputy knows, the Third Schedule deals exclusively with air pollution and matters relating to the Air Pollution Act.  It is desirable that we do not include other matters under that Act unless we can specify precisely what they are, and since there is no waste Act we cannot do that.  However, I give the Deputy an assurance that in the proposed waste legislation we will make provisions of this kind.</P>

      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that this matter is more appropriate to waste legislation.  I know that legislation has been promised in this area, but many Bills promised in this House never materialise or materialise much later than promised.  For instance, for almost a year the Housing Bill has been promised to be circulated next week, this session or next session, but it still has not been introduced.  The latest promise is that it will be introduced this week and, even if that is done, it is certainly a long time after it was first promised.  Some time ago we were told that legislation to deal with the question of waste would be introduced in the first half of this year.  From recent discussions I learned that this legislation will not be introduced before the summer.  Can the Minister give an indication when the relevant Bill will be circulated and what is the target date for the enactment of that legislation?</P>

      <P>The amendment would have no practical effect until the waste legislation was in place, which is the reason I believe it is more appropriate to wait until the waste Bill is before the House.  That Bill will give powers of this kind to the agency.</P>

      <P>I am not sure what the Minister means when talking about the negligible impact the amendment would have.  Paragraph (3) of the Third Schedule provides civil remedies and civil liability for air pollution and other types of pollution.  The amendment seeks to extend those provisions to pollution caused by waste.  I do not understand why that measure would not do exactly what it is intended to do.  I accept that the Minister has made a promise to the House concerning the production of a waste Bill, and that is to be welcomed. In the absence of that legislation, however, we have to deal with the legislation that does exist.  Perhaps the Minister would give an assurance in terms of a time frame for the waste Bill.  In the absence of that, the Bill would be improved by including waste pollution in paragraph (3) of the Third Schedule, as suggested in the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I told Deputy Mitchell, the time schedule for the Bill is, hopefully, for publication by the summer.  The waste Bill is comprehensive and major legislation.  It is hoped discussion will take place in the autumn or as soon as the House has the opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should refresh Deputy Howlin's mind by reminding him that the Third Schedule is simply concerned with amending the Air Pollution Act.  That is the whole purpose <Col N="1525" /> of that schedule, which I brought to the House during the debate on the Bill in the Seanad.</P>

The amendment proposes to substitute the word &ldquo;Ecomhshaoil&rdquo; as the Irish name for the Environmental Protection Agency,.  &ldquo;Comhshaoil&rdquo; is the word we now use in the Irish language for environment.  That word could be construed to mean &ldquo;for life&rdquo; in relation to the environment and &ldquo;eco&rdquo; is the abbreviation used for the word &ldquo;ecology&rdquo;, so I propose that we invent a new Irish word &ldquo;Ecomhshaoil&rdquo; to describe the Environmental Protection Agency. An Ghníomhaireacht um Chaomhnú Comhshaoil, I hope the Minister agrees, is rather a tongue-twisting mouthful.</P>

I accept that the Irish language is rather complicated and perhaps in titles too many words are used but I am not at liberty to change the language in this regard.  Certainly, if, on establishment, the Environmental Protection Agency wish to use an abbreviated name in Irish, that would be acceptable to me.  For the purpose of the Bill, however, we have to use the literal translation of the name and therefore I am not able to accept what is not the literal translation of that name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on the section.  The Chair's statement requires some comment from the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 56 was tabled as a demonstration of my concern that the number of members of the agency, at a director general and four directors, seemed to be very low, particularly given the range of work in which the agency will be engaged when fully operational. My amendment seeks to increase the number of members of the agency.  I accept the ruling of the Chair that to increase the number of directors would involve a charge on the State and I understand the reason for ruling the amendment out of order.  Nevertheless, I would like the Minister to say whether or not she feels that the number of directors proposed for the agency is sufficient, given the range of work that the agency will have to do and given that the quorum <Col N="1528" /> will have to be two.  Given the possibility that there may be people on leave, who have retired, or whatever, in practical terms there could be fewer people than a director general and four other directors serving on the board which could result in delays and so on.  For example, a planning Bill is being brought before the House, purportedly, to address alleged delays on the part of An Bord Pleanála, delays, it was alleged, were caused in the first place by a shortage of staff in An Bord Pleanála.  That is now being dealt with in a completely different manner. I should like the Minister of State to comment on that.</P>
    <P>The Chair's comments in relation to the other amendment, that a provision that the agency be brought into being not later than three months after the passage of the Bill, would involve bringing forward the date on which the agency would come into being fills me with alarm.  At one stage we were told this agency would be established on a non-statutory basis, even before the legislation was enacted there being such urgency about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of there being a charge on the State, I would point out that as far back as 1990, £500,000 was provided in the Estimates &mdash; I forget what the figure has been in succeeding years. Money has been provided in the Estimates from the establishment of this agency.  We are now almost into the month of April and by the time the Bill goes through Report Stage, is returned to the Seanad and so on, it could be quite some time before it is enacted.  Add three months to that and we discover that, at the earliest, it could be the end of 1992, possibly into 1993, before the agency will be established.  I am alarmed that the Minister would even contemplate a period longer than three months after the enactment of this Bill before establishing the agency given that money has been provided in the Estimates for its establishment.</P>
    <P>While accepting the Chair's ruling I should like the Minister of State to comment.</P>

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling.  I accept that the number of directors proposed is very small.  In principle I am not in favour of very large boards. The point I wish to make is that under the provisions of this Bill all the directors appear &mdash; the Minister might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;to be executive directors; there are no non-executive directors. There are none from outside who would introduce a different perspective to the agency, a normal feature in business generally. Some people serving on the board as non-executive directors would come in from outside once a month or whenever, and would take a more detached view of the business and/or agency and its activities than the inbred view of those who serve on the board full-time.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider on Report Stage making some provision for additional non-executive directors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of trespassing on your good nature, Sir, I must say I too am surprised that amendments Nos. 55 and 56 were ruled out of order.  I might point out that a similar technical amendment to No. 55 was debated in the other House.  Notwithstanding that a general point should be made in relation to the principles involved.  We had a long <Col N="1530" /> debate on the timescale for the enactment of this Bill on having the agency up and running.  I do not intend to cover the same ground now, but it is incumbent on the Minister of State to give the House an indication that she wants to have the agency up and running within a clearly defined timescale.  While three months after the passing of the Bill would appear to be a very reasonable time for its establishment we have already had discussions in relation to preliminary work continuing. I am sure the Minister wants the agency up and running with the greatest possible speed but that should be made abundantly clear.</P>
      <P>In relation to the number of directors of the agency, perhaps it is difficult and/or dangerous to specify a number.  It might be better not to specify any number but to state such number as may be deemed appropriate by the director general.  That would allow a level of flexibility.</P>
      <P>The most important issue that arises under this section is the necessity for a clear statement by the Minister that she wants this agency up and running.  That is essential, if only for those people who worked so hard on the preparation of this Bill in recent years.  I might remind the House that I quoted from the programme of the Green Presidency, in the dim and distant past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I am amazed that these amendments have been ruled out of order.  I do not want to repeat what Deputies Gilmore and Howlin said about the urgency of having this agency established and operating.  It is amazing that these amendments can be deemed to involve a charge on the Exchequer.  I echo other Members' views that it is most important to have the agency established and operating as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That amendment No. 56 was ruled out of order is amazing because there is nothing in the Bill to indicate what will be the level of remuneration of each director.  For example, had it been stated in the Bill that each director shall be paid, say, £5,000 or £50,000 per annum I could understand that any increase in the <Col N="1531" /> number of directors would represent a charge on the Exchequer but there is no indication that this would involve any such increase.  For example, the Minister might well decide to have seven directors, pay them £200,000, which would be the same as would have been paid to, say, four directors.</P>
    <P>This ruling is being extended beyond what is reasonable.  We need to be very careful of the constant refrain in this House, the amendment is out of order in that it would involve a charge, or potential charge, on the Exchequer.  That is very dangerous.  We need to watch it very carefully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to table amendments on Report Stage on the commencement procedures we discussed. Therefore it follows, in relation to the appointment and establishment of the agency, that we would discuss this again on Report Stage.  I wish to make it clear that it is my intention to have this agency established this year.  On the assumption that this Bill is passed by this House by Easter, then returns to the Seanad for another short debate, it is the intention to begin recruitment immediately thereafter of the director general and other directors.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Jim Mitchell's comments, obviously I gave much consideration to the size of the board, composed of a director general and four other directors.  It was something on which I took much advice.  I should add that always it was the intention to have an executive board.  Given the functions this agency will have to perform I do not think it advisable to have non-executive directors serve on the board although I accept that in many State companies and bodies non-executive directors do outstanding work.  Generally the day to day running of those bodies is left to the chief executive and his or her staff &mdash; I do not know whether there is any woman chief executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, non-executive directors, on many occasions, take a mere passive interest in the activities of boards since <Col N="1532" /> they will have other full-time jobs, which is understandable.  That would not be desirable in the case of this agency which will not have representatives of particular interest group serving on the board. Rather the board will be composed of professional people with the necessary expertise to undertake a very complicated and specific task, particularly in relation to licensing.  In addition, the drawing up of codes and practices will require the director general, and other directors, to understand the very technical and professional advice given them by their staff.  Therefore, it is desirable to have a small board of directors of five members.  Obviously, they will be fulltime executive board members. Invariably they will be a management board.  In my experience, the smaller within reason a management board are, the better.  Larger boards tend to become unnecessarily bureaucratic and cumbersome and do not necessarily perform their role in a clearly focused way.  There may be too much divergence and difficulty if there are too many people on the board.  I believe we have picked the optimum number.  However, when one picks the figure five it can always be debated that the number should be four or six.  It was decided to have five members, four directors and one director general, as it was thought this was a good number.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell was concerned about the role of outside people.  I share his concern.  There is a role for an advisory body.  The purpose of having an advisory body is to ensure that advice will be available from representatives of environmental organisations and other professional groups who have an interest in environmental matters from either a non-governmental organisation point of view or a professional interest point of view.  They will be involved in the activities of the agency, give advice and direct the agency.  They will bring to the agency an outside view of how they should perform their function and what the relevant issues are.  They will also act as great educators and informers of what the agency are all about.  They will act as a <Col N="1533" /> link between the public generally and the full-time executive board and staff of the agency.  I believe we have picked the most desirable framework &mdash; an executive board and an outside advisory body.</P>
    <P>When they are fully operational the agency will have a fairly large staff of professional people working throughout the country.  While the staff will have the task of carrying out much of the day-to-day work of the agency, the board, based on the advice they receive, will have the duty of making the overall management decisions in relation to such issues as licence applications, how certain functions should be performed, advising Ministers, codes of practice, etc.  For example, An Bord Pleanála, who deal with approximately 3,000 applications a year, have six members on their board. When this agency are fully operational in terms of their licensing activities it is envisaged that they will licence approximately 1,000 activities.  They will also have to monitor the licences thereafter. In regard to their other activities, such as drawing up codes of practice etc., while obviously the board members will be involved in this work, much of the work of the agency will be done by the staff on the ground.  The Government are committed to ensuring that the agency have the necessary resources to enable them to do this work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked about resources for the agency.  This year's Estimates provided for a sum of £710,000 to enable the agency to start up.  Work is already under way in regard to some preliminary matters to ensure that the agency, on establishment, will be able to begin their work immediately and in particular ensure that regional laboratories have the proper facilities.  Work is already being carried out in respect of some matters.</P>
    <P>I believe we are correct in providing for a director general and four directors. I want to assure the House that the Bill will come into operation as quickly as possible.  Some amendments in this regard will be put down on Report Stage. Obviously, a person who is appointed to the board may have to give some notice <Col N="1534" /> to their current employer.  Normally a month's notice is required.  We have to take this into account in advertising and recruiting the director general and the four directors.  There are two separate procedures involved.  The director general will be recruited first and then the directors will be recruited.  The reason they are not being recruited together is to ensure that people who apply for both positions will not damage their chances of being recruited for the post of director general merely because they showed their willingness to be a director.  Therefore we separated the procedures.  While this means the time limit of three months may not be met, perhaps we can meet a time limit which is close to it.  On Report Stage we will be discussing appropriate commencement dates for the various Parts of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is simply to require an affirmative vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the appointment of the director general.  The appointment of the director general by the Government is not acceptable or democratic.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there would be a bias in favour of high profile individuals. If the Members of this House were to debate the appointment of someone who is unknown to them or someone with whom they had no contact, they may not be in a position to make the correct appointment.  Only a selection board with the assistance of a professional recruitment body would be in a position to assess qualifications, having met people on a number of occasions.  In addition to the qualifications, the interview process is also important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies would not be familiar with what went on at interviews or the track record of individuals who may be seeking appointment as director general or a director.  How could they be familiar with such issues?  Would they expect someone who seriously wants to be director general of this agency to go around lobbying politicans?  This would be highly undesirable. If this process were followed many people who would be interested in this position may not consider themselves suitable to be involved in a political process. This process would be distasteful to many people and they may not wish to engage in it.  We have seen some awful examples of the consequences of such a <Col N="1536" /> process in the United States.  It would be undesirable for the political process to be involved to that extent in the appointment and recruitment of professional fulltime people for the Civil Service, the semi-State sector, the agency and other State bodies of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably tell me that all they would need is a brief summary of a persons' qualifications and they could make a judgment on that basis.  It is often assumed for positions of this kind that the person you know best or the person with the highest profile is the best person for the job.  I have no doubt that some high profile individuals may be interested in these positions, but it does not necessarily follow that they will be the best people for the job.  Therefore it is inappropriate to drag into the public arena a debate on the particular merits or otherwise of persons to be appointed to these posts.  Obviously, such a procedure would lengthen the process for recruitment. For example if, as I envisage, the members are recruited during the summer, the appointments could not go ahead until the Dáil resumed after the summer recess.  This would lead to further delays.  I am not just giving this as an excuse; invariably, this is what would happen.</P>
    <P>My main objection to the amendment is that it would politicise the process and prejudice the agency's ability to stand as a credible independent body.  If two parties in the House found a particular appointment acceptable but other parties did not, this could totally politicise the individual.  For example, if the Government and one of the Opposition parties favoured Mr. X for appointment as director general but two other parties favoured Mr. Y, how could we expect Mr. X to function as a totally independent person, having been opposed by two parties and a number of individual Deputies? It is not appropriate, on balance, to go down that road and I regret, therefore, that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to facilitate the Chair and the rest of the Deputies who wish to contribute so I will not take up too much time.  We submitted an amendment which states that, (1) the minimum rate of benefit or assistance payable to an adult in respect of the periodic benefits or social assistance, specified in the Schedules, shall be not less than £66 per week; (2) the minimum rate <Col N="1539" /> payable in respect of each dependent child shall &mdash; (a) in the case of each dependent child under 15, be not less than 40 per cent of the adult rate, (b) in the case of each dependent child between 15 and 17, be not less than 55 per cent of the adult rate, and (c) in the case of each dependent child aged 18 or over, who is living at home and in full-time education or training, be not less than 70 per cent of the adult rate.</P>
      <P>A number of suggested amendments also deal with bringing forward the payment dates but they have been ruled out of order.  A classic example is that we tried to delete &ldquo;30th day of July&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;2nd of April&rdquo;, for obvious reasons, to bring forward the payment dates to what they were in the past.  I also attempted to have the miserable £5 basic social assistance payment increased to £10.  There is a common thread running through all these amendments because social welfare payments are far too low. Clearly, one requires a basic minimum income.  I was disturbed by the Minister's speech yesterday as he seemed to be throwing up his hands in dispair in saying how complex the social welfare code is. He seemed to panic, to some degree, in relation to unemployment and the demands on his Department because of the Government's failure to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to panic. He should slow down and look at the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and use it as the bible for moving forward in the social welfare area.  In one of the amendments ruled out of order there was a suggestion that a sum of £66 should be the basic minimum payment. This figure did not fall out of the sky but was derived from the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, who arrived at their figure after a great deal of consideration.  They issued the report in 1985, and if successive Governments had taken their recommendations on board a single person would now receive a minimum payment of £66 per week and a married couple would receive £109 per week, that is if the 1985 figures were <Col N="1540" /> adjusted to comparable figures today. Their figures represent the mid point minimum figures.  When one compares their recommendation with what a single person on unemploment benefit receives, a miserable £53, there is a substantial difference, because £13 is a substantial amount of money to an unemployed person.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined in his speech time and again that the Department were succeeding in bringing social welfare rates up to the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  This is not the case.  I am sure the Minister will have read the excellent submission from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors.  They supply the research to back up the commission's figures.  In fairness, I do not think it is too much to ask that a person trying to keep body and soul together in our society in 1992 should receive an income of £66 per week.  I am sure the Minister or his friends would not blink an eyelid when they would place a bet of £66 or £53 on a horse.  It is easy to place bets of this size when one has a substantial income, but we must recognise that thousands upon thousands live in dire poverty.  The very least the State owes them is a standard of living in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the minimum rates for each child dependent.  Yesterday it was pointed out that expenditure on children varies with the age of the child.  An infant does not make the same demands on the financial resources of a family as a teenager.  When young people reach the 17 and 18 age bracket they are extremely demanding because they need to be clothed and educated if they are still at school, which is a massive drain, and they need pocket money in order to socialise &mdash; indeed, their social activities can be extremely costly on parents. It appears logical to us that the rate should vary in line with the age of the child and that young adults should receive a percentage of the adult rate.</P>
    <P>We requested an increase from £5 to £10 in the minimum payment made to those eligible for social assistance.  The <Col N="1541" /> Commission on Social Welfare recommended in their report in 1985-86:</P>
    <P>In assessing means of single adults living at home, board and lodging should not be counted except for people under 25.</P>
    <P>Single people aged 18-25 should be assessed with board and lodging but they should all be entitled to at least £10 a week regardless of their parents income.</P>
    <P>Obviously, £10 would be substantially more in today's figures and I ask the Minister to take that on board.  Unfortunately, the amendment was ruled out of order because it incurs a cost on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I cannot let that pass without commenting. It is not as if Members pick figures out of the air, because we have done the background research and have suggested alternative ways of financing the increases.  A cursory glance at the Annual Report for 1990 of the Comptroller and Auditor General shows that we are living in a two tier society.  The Minister referred to self assessment for income tax, but the report states:</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of self assessment to income tax, 4,500 cases have been selected for detailed screening of which 1,923 had been or were in the process of being audited at 30 June 1991....</P>
    <P>Out of the 1,324 cases examined.</P>
    <P>The value of the present additional liability established was £11.6 million or an average of £11,143 per case.</P>
    <P>When one considers the paltry number of cases examined it gives a flavour of what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying, that there are still massive amounts of unpaid tax remaining to be collected from business companies and the self employed.  It is important that something be done about this.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, people in receipt of social welfare assistance are poor; and, were those on social insurance are not on the bottom rung, they are certainly not at the top rung.  It is important to draw <Col N="1542" /> attention to the fact that since the introduction of self assessment only 4,500 cases were selected for detailed screening and that approximately 1,900 had been or were in the process of being audited, yet the outcome is alarming.  The report states:</P>
    <P>The fact that 80 per cent of cases which have been finalised have resulted in or are likely to result in additional revenue being collected is a clear indication that devising and implementing a representative and focused programme of audits is critical to ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of the self assessment system.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners informed the Comptroller and Auditor General that their inspection-audit visits under all programmes &ldquo;impacted on 9 per cent of the taxpayer base in 1990.&rdquo;  The Comptroller and Auditor General states:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the fact that less than 1 per cent of cases have been subjected to a full self assessment audit to date must call into question the present capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to implement fully and promptly this review process which is crucial to creating confidence in the self assessment system.</P>
    <P>That puts my point in a nutshell; the Revenue Commissioners are either under financed, understaffed or are not getting the political direction they badly need to go after those who have the money and can pay but who are not making their fair contribution to society. In that report their is an equally astounding figure which puts into context our arguments and our reasonsing for increasing the rates in the Bill.  The amount due from employers under the PRSI scheme shows outstanding arrears at 31 May 1991 a massive £137 million. The report goes on to show that the estimate of the amount likely to be collected is a miserably £29 million, a substantial shortfall in what should have been taken in.</P>
    <P>I presume I am confined to speaking <Col N="1543" /> on those amendments in my name which were ruled out.  Having said those few words as an initial contribution I should like to read into the record a case in support of highlighting the dishonest delays in the implementation of payment dates.  One aspect of this Bill which has received little attention is that the dates for the implementation of the meagre increases being granted to those on social welfare have been pushed even further back.  Some of the increases will not be paid this year until 31 July, which is a full six months after they were announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the Government attitude to the collection of VAT increases which were imposed from 1 March.  There was a time when social welfare increases were paid in April; in 1982 they were delayed until the end of June and year by year they were pushed back a little further; in 1984 the increases were paid between 5 and 6 July; in 1987 between 15 and 24 July; in 1989 between 19 and 27 July; and this year some increases will not be paid until 31 July. Presumably, next year it will be announced in the budget statement the payments will be made in the month of August.  This is a despicable practice and I would ask the Minister to use his influence in the Department of Social Welfare to bring forward the payment date to April.  Those who are most in need of increases are having their income diminished each year because payments are pushed back further.  While the Minister prides himself on a 4 per cent across-the-board increase in payments, he fails to make the point that by July inflation will probably be 4 per cent, so that there will be no real increase but rather an increase just keeping pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>It is extremely dishonest and a mean political formula to exploit media attention for the Minister when the Budget Statement indicates that increases are due, whereas by the time they are inserted in the pension books of old age pensioners and children's allowance books inflation has already eaten into them because six months has gone by and the stated rate of increase is <Col N="1544" /> devalued in that period.  I would ask the Minister, instead of pushing forward the payment date to August of next year and to September in future years, that he revert back to April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I want to highlight more or less what has been said by Deputy Byrne and I do so with my tongue in my cheek because I have seen all Governments do it, so I am not singling out the Minister on this issue. However because all Governments have engaged in this practice does not mean it is correct.  I meet many elderly people who say they heard on budget night they would receive either a 4 per cent or 6 per cent increase and they realise they will not get it for another six months.  As all Governments in recent years have more or less extended the date of payment &mdash; prolonging the evil day, as they see it, for paying those increases &mdash; there should be a planned clawback on the dates of payment.  Can the Minister tell us what it would cost the Exchequer to pay the increases three months earlier?  I appreciate that payment cannot be made immediately but, perhaps, provision could be made over three or four years to have payment made earlier so that as soon as it is administratively possible after the budget, payment will be made. The tax on new cars was implemented much quicker than the payment of the social welfare increases.  We must compare like with like but I appreciate there are administrative difficulties in the Department and that payment could not be made the following morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost would be about £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a substantial figure.  The point I am making is that it is relevant to the recipient.  So far as they are concerned they are £30 million worse off under present circumstances.  If you take inflation at 3.6 or 3.7 per cent there is no doubt that by the time they receive those increases next July they will be no better off.  We are talking about what social welfare payments mean to recipients. One can juggle the figures around <Col N="1545" /> whatever way one wishes and probably many previous Ministers had to do it because of budget constraints, but there is no point in saying social welfare recipients are to be given a certain percentage increase.  Obviously, the Department of Social Welfare, the Government and previous governments, believed old age pensioners were entitled to receive a maximum rate of X pounds.  That decision is taken on the basis that the recipient will not receive that increase for four to six months.  A year ago I recall debating in this Chamber the child benefit scheme under which the increase was paid in October of that year.  There is an element of sleight of hand in the sense that the increase is announced but the benefits will not flow for some time.</P>
      <P>I want to put down the marker and ask that a policy be adopted that over the next two, three or four years the payment date will be brought forward so that we can genuinely say to people on budget night: &ldquo;yes, we meant what we said, we decided to give you an extra 4 or 5 per cent and that is what it will mean to you&rdquo;. In reality the 4 per cent or 6 per cent which has been announced in the budget will not amount to a 4 per cent or 6 per cent increase in the financial year because recipients received it for only six months of that year.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister knows better than I do that people ask how is it that Social Welfare recipients are about the only group who have to wait longer than anyone else for an increase. National wage increases are sometimes backdated; social welfare recipients always have to wait between four to six months.  While I appreciate that £30 million has to be found somewhere and would not for one moment suggest to the Minister that it would be possible to do this overnight, he should in the future, as a matter of Government policy, rather than extend the period recipients have to wait before they get what is rightfully theirs, bring the payment date much closer to budget day to ensure that it amounts to a real increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people have suggested to me that <Col N="1546" /> we would be far better off &mdash; this would be far more honest, although I am not saying that the Minister is operating differently from any other Minister &mdash; if we gave a 5 per cent increase instead of 6 per cent and paid it within two or three weeks.  I have no doubt that many recipients would much prefer this because they would know what they would be getting and that it would run parallel with the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to make &mdash; as I said, I do not wish to labour the point &mdash; is in relation to the minimum payments.  I remember that the Minister's predecessor indicated in the House on a number of occasions that it was his intention to move towards the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  While it is true to say that some progress has been made during the past few years in moving towards the rates proposed by the commission &mdash; it must be remembered that the rates were very low &mdash; we have a long way to go before we implement their complete findings.</P>
    <P>I will have much more to say about this later in the day when we come to deal with deserted wife's benefit.  However, I do not think it is fair to suggest that we are anywhere near what the commission suggested.  It appears that everyone accepts their findings and considers their report to be gospel in relation to social welfare.  If that is the case &mdash; and I have read the report on a number of occasions &mdash; it appears that there are many deficiencies along the line.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as my amendments have been ruled out of order I cannot move them, but I would like the Minister to indicate if he envisages any changes, however small, being made in the future in relation to the payment dates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments have also been ruled out of order.  I, too, sought to bring the payment dates nearer budget day.  Other Deputies have spoken eloquently and mentioned that the fact that the money is not payable immediately must be the source of great annoyance and distress for social welfare <Col N="1547" /> recipients.  Given the way they operate, the Government are very insensitive to the needs of these people and have shown a meanness of spirit which characterises their attitude in this area.  The poor are always picked on and this is yet another example.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not give the excuse, when he comes to reply, that it takes time to do these things, because it does not; the matter could be sorted out within a short space of time, given new technology in the computer and printing fields.  If we were to accept Deputy Connaughton's suggestion that we try to bring the payment date back by one month each year we would at least achieve something.  On the one hand, we make promises today but then do not fulfil them for six months.  I am aware of the budgetary constraints &mdash; budget deficits do not form part of Green Party policy &mdash; but I wonder if the Minister could make any move in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few general comments and repeat a number of suggestions that I have made in the past and which the Minister may not be aware of, although his predecessor would be.  I would then like to comment on the motion listed in my name which states that the section is being opposed.</P>
      <P>First, when the Department of Social Welfare give examples indicating what increases will mean they tend to select examples at the higher end of the scale. However, a substantial number of people receive increases of approximately only £2.70 per week.  I am referring here in particular to single people, who find themselves at the lower end of the scale, and widows, most of whom live in local authority housing and are paying either differential or fixed rent.  By a strange coincidence we never hear anything from the local authorities about increases in either differential or fixed rent until after the Social Welfare Bill has been disposed of.  Perhaps this is a coincidence, but it always seems to fall that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past four years the average increase in differential or fixed rent for <Col N="1548" /> single people who live alone has been £1.50.  Therefore, if we take the increase of £2.70, £1.50 goes immediately.  I am sure if the Minister checks with his colleague in the Department of the Environment he will find that he will be able to give him the average increases.  It would be far more honest to say that we are giving them an increase of £2.70 from the Department of Social Welfare but that the Department of the Environment will take £1.50 of this, so the net increase is £1.20.  Those of us who are members of local authorities will have to take the flak when they notify people during the next few weeks of the rent increases.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> for an increase of 4 per cent last year and 3 per cent this year.  This represents an increase of 7 per cent over two years.  However, these increases will mean far more to someone wiih average earnings of £250 per week rather than for someone on social welfare in receipt of £47 or £50 per week.  By giving increases of 4 per cent and 3 per cent it sounds as if social welfare recipients are getting the same increase as someone earning £250, £300 or £400 per week, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two suggestions. We consistently come across people who have been in receipt of disability benefit for between ten to 15 years.  Indeed, I met a woman last week who has been receiving this benefit for 21 years.  Surely, a person who has been in receipt of that benefit for that length of time should automatically be transferred to a pension payment because she is certainly not fit for work any more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>She is disabled now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking in particular about women who are being hassled, who feel frustrated and who are called in twice, three times or four times a year to undergo a medical examination.  A man with only one leg came into my office in Drogheda last week and he had been certified by a medical examiner as being fit for work.  The whole question of long term disability benefit should be looked <Col N="1549" /> at.  The bulk of long term disability benefit recipients are women and they should automatically go on to a pension.  They should have a book which they can bring down to the post office.  They should not have to watch for the postman every day and worry that they might not get their certificates if St. Patrick's Day falls in the middle of the week or if there is a bank holiday, or the postman is out sick.  One book for the year would do away with a lot of the administration involved and there could be a re-assessment of a person's condition once a year if necessary. There is movement in that direction and it would cut down the expensive administration in the Department and the delays experienced by people.</P>
      <P>The same system should apply for invalidity pension.  At the moment if a person wants to move from disability benefit onto invalidity pension he must first apply for the application form.  One cannot get an application form for invalidity pension without writing to the Department for the application form. The applicant must then wait one or two weeks for the form, complete it and send it back in and he may then be called for a medical examination although the person concerned may have been on disability benefit for anything from five to 15 years having survived perhaps ten medical officers.  If the Department do not know that a person is ill, having drawn disability benefit for ten years, I do not know when they will.  The largest waste of money occurs due to the messing about in the Department of Social Welfare. There is lack of proper co-ordination and efficient administration in the Department.  This is mickey-mouse stuff and we should not have to employ consultants to deal with it.  Half a dozen TDs will tell the Minister what needs to be done to save money in the Department. At the moment one section of the Department does not know what the other is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a complimentary note, the new arrangements for dealing with TD's inquiries is excellent.  This is evidenced in the Order Paper every day where we see that the level of parliamentary questions <Col N="1550" /> relating to social welfare has been greatly reduced.  If every Department was organised in that respect all parliamentary questions would be substantially reduced.  There was rationalisation there, because the media highlighted what questions put down by TDs to the Minister for Social Welfare were costing the taxpayer.  Social welfare inquiries are now dealt with speedily and efficiently.  I compliment the Department on that.</P>
    <P>A great amount of time and administration in the Department would be saved with a bank link system in the post office.  I raised this five years ago as Labour Party spokesperson for social welfare and I continued to raise it on a yearly basis.  I appeal to the Minister now to introduce a bank link system in the post offices to save old men and women having to queue outside post offices from 8.30 a.m. waiting for Securicor to arrive with the money.  A bank link system would substantially improve security in post offices and we would not need Army patrols to accompany the money.  The money would be in the bank link machine in the post office and people would be able to draw their money any time from 8 a.m. until 12 midnight without having to queue up for it.  I asked for that five years ago and was told that it was being investigated; then I was told a survey was being carried out and so on, but we still have not got the technology that the banks have had for the past ten years. That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the social welfare system in relation to increases should be on a planned basis.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was negotiated on that basis.  As part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> agreement it was agreed that the floor for social welfare recipients should have been at £60 in 1991, £65 in 1992 and £69 in 1993.  That was what was agreed in principle.  The Minister might say that it is all right to agree with the ICTU and with the employers organisations but that he has not got the money.  It is dishonest to agree these figures as part of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i><Col N="1551" /> and then for the Minister to say that although he agreed he has not got the money.  Workers should not be asked to vote on something they will not get and that is what is happening here.</P>
    <P>If the Government and the social partners enter into another agreement covering a period of three years, the social welfare recipients should be dealt with over a three year period as well.  My colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, made this point.  He is right.  The agreement should set out what people on social welfare will get.  Four per cent of £300 is one thing, but four per cent of £48 is quite another. The agreement should spell it out in financial terms.  We will be opposing the section.</P>

        <i>:</i> I am glad the Leas-Cheann Comhairle mentioned that, because I was beginning to wonder if we would ever get to the stage where we would deal with the amendments. We often go through Bills here carried away with loquaciousness in the early stages of the Bill and we tend to forget about the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept of this Bill.  I accept, as the Minister said, that this is a serious matter and that £30 million will be required.  I certainly support my colleague in suggesting that this could be brought in in stages.  I am sure that if the Minister had £30 million to bring this forward in one year there would be several ways of spending that money which might be of more benefit in the Minister's opinion, but I would certainly ask the Minister to consider bringing this in in stages, retrospective from July.  In fairness to social welfare recipients, they have to pay the extra VAT and rent, and if they are lucky enough to have an old &ldquo;banger&rdquo; on the road they will be paying the 20 per cent increase in the road tax in April.  They have all the extra costs.  A 4 per cent increase, with inflation running <Col N="1552" /> at 3.7 per cent, amounts to no increase in real terms.  They are on a loser.  I would ask the Minister to consider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and wish him well in his Department, to which he will probably bring a totally new approach.  We might have seen some changes in this Bill if he had been the author from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Our opposition to increases in social welfare payments requires an explanation. It is not possible to amend increases upwards and the only way to signify that the increases are inadequate is to oppose the section.  It appears that the Minister was staggered when he saw the total expenditure under this Bill, which amounts to £3.3 billion; but it works out at about £84 on average for each social welfare dependant.  Many families have to depend on that kind of sum to get them through every week.  The increases are certainly inadequate and the only way to express our disappointment at the level of increase is by opposing the section.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed last night to express disappointment and surprise that only 60 per cent of the amount provided for the family income supplement has been taken up.  It is difficult to understand why people do not look for the money when it is available and an exercise should be undertaken to discover the reason.  I do not know of anybody in my constituency who earns a low wage and yet would refuse money.  The purpose of the FIS is to make up for the inadequacy of payments made by employers to workers in cases where the payments do not reach the level of social welfare benefits. I thought the Minister was about to suggest last night bringing down the level of social welfare benefits to very low wage levels.  Perhaps the Minister will decide that a minimum wage is necessary which should not be allowed to fall below social welfare assistance levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments against the family income supplement was that it would be a hidden subsidy to employers. How do we deal with the fact that people in employment are not properly paid? <Col N="1553" /> Perhaps they have not the benefit of trade union membership or they belong to occupations which are not covered by the joint labour committees.  The Government decided to encourage them to stick at their jobs and to pay them a financial top-up in the form of the FIS.</P>
    <P>There are several possible reasons why people do not claim the supplement.  One may be that the joint income from employment plus the FIS might lead to an increase in the rent payable to a local authority for housing.  The income might also make the recipient ineligible for a medical card.  People have to balance these factors and there are good reasons why they may not be enthusiastic about this scheme.  It is designed to help the very worst off in society and they certainly need assistance.  The matter deserves the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in this difficult Department where great balancing tricks are required. People have very high hopes of the Minister because he has always been a very honest, open and courageous person as a backbencher.  The real test is how much of that honesty and courage can be brought where it really matters.  It is very difficult to run such a high-spending Department; but it is also an honour, a challenge and an opportunity.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that the Minister's first Social Welfare Bill has evoked an incredible response from women.  They are saying this is the most anti-woman Social Welfare Bill they have seen.  I regret I could not speak on Second Stage due to a family illness, but having listened to the contributions made by Deputies this seems to be the general perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the timing of the increases, I join with my colleagues who have stressed that there is here a classic illustration of the difference between people who are earning and those who are dependent on social welfare.  Those in employment will get increases at the beginning of April and will be paying higher car tax and other levies from that time.  Increases for people who are <Col N="1554" /> dependent on the State are pushed further ahead each year.  I grant that a certain time must be allowed to deal with administrative changes, but the payments should be brought forward in order to give people the feeling that they are part of what is happening here, not lepers to be kept at a distance.  For a person awaiting an increase of £4.50 a week, a delay of even three or four weeks can really matter.  I know the Minister wishes to help these vulnerable people.  Let us plan this year to bring forward the date of payment so that we will not have to make similar pleas every year.</P>

      <P>There was an estimated net outward migration of approximately 6,100 persons from County Mayo in the five-year period 1986 to 1991.  This figure <Col N="1557" /> is derived as a residual by subtracting the natural increase in the population of Mayo &mdash; that is the number of births less the number of deaths &mdash; from the change in population as measured by the 1986 and 1991 censuses of population.  It is not possible to disaggregate this figure by the year.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that the figure quoted represents the net effect of all movements into and out of Mayo, not only to or from abroad, but also to or from other parts of the State.  Therefore, it corresponds to the net of two gross flows &mdash; outward and inward.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to the last question, said that if these questions were phrased differently we would get different answers.  I am confused by the statistics produced by the Minister. Surely it is evident from the recent census that the population of County Mayo has declined radically to the extent that the county no longer warrants six Dáil Deputies.  Do these statistics not show a clear policy of disinvestment by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If he has difficulty with regard to the figure of 6,100 which I have mentioned, I would be delighted to tell <Col N="1558" /> him how that figure is derived.  The population in Mayo in 1986 was 115, 184 and in 1991 it was 110,696, a reduction in population of 4,488.  The number of births in the county during that period was 8,507 and the number of deaths was 6,881, the natural increase being 1,626. Therefore, net emigration was 6,114.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that the best statistics on emigration that his Department can come up with do not distinguish between emigration out of the State and migration to another part of the State?  In view of the importance of emigration, emigration policy and support for emigrant welfare, does the Minister of State not consider that there should be emigration statistics on a county basis?  Could the Minister of State inquire whether such information is available on a geographic basis in other European countries that have substantial outward migration?</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office does not compile information on income levels by county.  Any such data would involve a considerable degree of estimation and would require the redeployment of resources from existing priority tasks in the national accounts area.  These priorities are to improve the timeliness and quality of the accounts for the nation and to provide a more extensive range of national sectoral information than has hitherto been possible.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that information on relative county income would be particularly useful when deciding the allocation of funds as between one county and another &mdash; for example, within the Department of the Environment &mdash; to ensure <Col N="1561" /> that ongoing distribution is fair and that allocation is not simply made on a historic basis that has no regard to actual county income and ability to pay tax and generate it locally?  County statistics were available in the past, having been prepared by the ERSI, but were not kept up to date.  Would the Minister not agree, from the point of view of regional policy, that county income statistics should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that such statistics would be useful in the allocation of moneys and so on, but whether or not it would be an economic proposition to produce those figures on the basis suggested by the Deputy is another matter altogether.  It is true that those statistics were available from the Economic and Social Research Institute. However, the most recent statistics relate to 1969 and were published in a 1972 paper entitled <i>Further Data on County Income in the Sixties</i>, written by Miceál Ross.  The results of that study involved a considerable degree of estimation, principally because of the difficulties in measuring the extent of the transfer of incomes between counties.  The results have not kept up to date.  It is a matter of whether or not it would be proper to spend the required amount of money and time on such statistics when the Government are giving priority to the accounts of the nation.</P>

      <P>The forthcoming Housing Bill will include provisions to overcome legislative difficulties which have arisen in relation to common areas in flat <Col N="1563" /> complexes in which individual flats are to be sold.  Valid applications from tenants of flats under the terms of the 1988 and 1989 tenant purchase schemes will continue to hold good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge that the Bill will almost certainly address the problems of common areas within flat complexes, there are other issues that I should like to be certain will be addressed by the Bill.  For instance, does the Minister know of the difficulty relating to deceased tenants who applied to purchase in 1988, made up a will and left property to relatives who looked after them?  Will the Bill cover the position of those relatives?  Another problem relates to the payment of rent since 1988.  Will the Bill provide for rent paid since 1988 to be offset against the purchase price of property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenant succession rights, the position of local authorities and their long-established authority in dealing with those issues are not now in question and therefore there is no provision needed in the Housing Bill.  As to whether a local authority would be obliged to make expenditure for repair work that might be necessary in the context of a tenant purchase scheme, the Deputy would not dispute that the 1988 and 1989 schemes were regarded as extremely generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That was quite obvious from the manner in which the schemes were taken up and accepted all over the country.  I do not accept that it is necessary for the taxpayer to now undertake additional cost, as suggested by Deputy Mitchell, under a purchase scheme that allows for a 40 per cent discount on houses built after 1960 and a 50 per cent discount on houses built before then. That would be asking for over the odds. From our experience of the application of this scheme nationwide we have not <Col N="1564" /> encountered any real difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appeared to be answering a question I did not ask.  I did not ask about repairs. It is clear the Minister has come in briefed on certain questions, and is giving those replies rather than replying to the question I asked.  I repeat my question: will the Minister accept that people who paid rent over four years &mdash; due to a delay on the part of his Department, not theirs &mdash; should have that rent offset against the purchase price?  Had there been no delay on the part of his Department those people would be four years nearer completion of repayment of their mortgages. Will the Minister accept, in natural justice, that any rent paid on account of a delay on the part of his Department should be offset against the purchase price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry if I misunderstood the Deputy's question.  I thought it related more to how one could offset costs for repairs and so on.  To deal with the question Deputy Jim Mitchell has posed, I should say the tenant purchase scheme of 1988 was not notified by Dublin Corporation to their tenants in that year.  The then Minister for the Environment introduced a new scheme in April 1989.  It was not until November 1991 that Dublin Corporation returned to the Department of the Environment with any difficulties in regard to that scheme.  The difficulties brought to the attention of my Department will be dealt with in the context of the new housing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister please note the problem I have raised?  I know the Housing Bill is due to be circulated within the next few days and if that provision is not incorporated in it it would be my hope, on Committee Stage, to table amendments to eliminate this injustice against flat tenants as compared with house tenants.  Will the Minister say whether the provisions of that Bill will provide for the succession rights of <Col N="1565" /> people who might have succeeded to ownership of their flats had there been no delay on the part of his Department but who have been so deprived because of that delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, no basic problems have been brought to the attention of my Department in relation to that matter.  I might add that from my experience in that area any problems as far as tenants' succession rights are concerned should not present any great difficulty</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="1566" /> Nos. 5, 13, 117, 118, 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Up-to-date information on the number of houses without an indoor toilet or bathroom will not be available until the results of the 1991 Census of Population are compiled.  The 1980 and 1990 surveys of the housing stock, however, indicate that the proportion of the total stock without a fixed bath or shower has been reduced from 19.5 per cent in 1980 to 8 per cent in 1990 in the case of the country as a whole and from 24.6 per cent to 7 per cent in the case of the south-west region.  The proportion of the total housing stock lacking indoor toilet facilities has been reduced from 16.0 per cent to 6.4 per cent over the same period.</P>
      <P>On the basis of returns from local authorities, it is estimated that 5,700 rented local authority dwellings lacked bathroom facilities at 31 December 1990.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement, based on returns for the year ended 31 December 1990, setting out for each local authority the number of their rented houses which do not have bathrooms.  Complete returns of the position at 31 December 1991 have not yet been received in my Department.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the management, maintenance and improvement of their rented dwellings, including the provision of bathrooms. Following the announcement of a new sub-programme in <i>A Plan for Social Housing</i>, a special allocation of £2 million was made in 1991, and again this year, to supplement the authorities' own expenditure in tackling the backlog of work in the provision of bathrooms in rented local authority housing.  In addition, the refurbishment of pre-1940 dwellings under the remedial works scheme normally includes the provision of toilet and bathroom facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable progress in eliminating these deficiencies in the housing stock therefore has been achieved.  I expect this progress to continue, particularly having regard to the measures to which I have already referred and others, such as the increase in the local authority house <Col N="1567" /> improvement loan and income limits, announced in <i>A Plan for Social Housing.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is unacceptable, as we face into the 21st century, that any household or dwelling should be without a bathroom; that there are far too many, whether local authority or private dwellings, without a bathroom?  Will he agree also that, with the present rate of improvement to local authority houses, it will be 16 years before all dwellings have a bathroom?  In view of that will he inform the House whether he has any further proposals to ensure that at least the end of this century every house and dwelling will have a bathroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the ambition would be to clear that backlog of problems, to ensure, within the shortest possible time &mdash; having regard to available finances &mdash; every house or dwelling nationwide has such essential facilities. The Deputy will appreciate that the problem has been specially targeted for the first time here.  Last year £2 million <Col N="1570" /> was provided in a specially designed scheme for this purpose.  We must also bear in mind the increased ceiling of income limits, the house improvement loans, refurbishment schemes and the special voluntary housing programmes. Therefore, it will clearly be seen that the Government have taken a comprehensive, extremely dedicated approach to the resolution of this problem.  The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to make further inroads into the problems so that it can be eliminated within the shortest possible time.  I accept that it is, and always will be, unacceptable to every Member of this House that there should be any dwellings without the necessary essential sanitary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be rather taken aback that a newly-appointed Minister should show such complacency about such important, basic facilities as bathrooms and indoor toilets. Does he realise that at the present rate of progress in local authority housing it will take 16 years to have every local authority dwelling provided with a bathroom while little or no progress has been made in relation to private dwellings? May I issue the Minister an invitation, bearing in mind that millions of pounds have been spent on the refurbishment of his office block at the Custom House in the past couple of years?  Will he agree that, if the same amount of money was spent on the provision of bathrooms in dwellings in Dublin, there would be no backlog at present?  I invite the Minister to come with me within a half mile radius of his office to see dwellings without bathrooms or indoor toilets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has deliberately chosen to ignore the essential facts I have given, that over the past ten years substantial progress was made in the resolution of this problem.  I intend to make further inroads into it on the basis of the resources available to me. Indeed I would dearly wish not to have to find resources &mdash; as would have been the case with my predecessors in this Department &mdash; to meet an over-generous <Col N="1571" /> house improvement scheme provided by the Government of which the Deputy opposite was a member.  They gave grants to people who could well afford to provide these and other facilities.  I should like to have that money now available to me, which, I might add, totalled £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that, were the house improvement scheme introduced by our Government still in place, most dwellings now without bathrooms would have them?  Furthermore, will he agree that the house improvement scheme abolished by the Fianna Fáil Government five years ago was the cause of so many people living in dwellings without bathrooms or indoor toilets, essential basic facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an awful pity the Deputy would not examine in depth the effect of that scheme in terms of usage of resources.  It facilitates people who could well afford to provide those facilities and was at direct and immediate cost to the people the Deputy now pretends to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now agree that the house improvement scheme, which was introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, not alone helped to provide basic facilities such as bathrooms, indoor toilets and essential extentions but also gave extremely valuable employment?  It is little wonder that the level of unemployment increased after the abolition of these schemes.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of local authority houses in (a) Dublin city, (b) Dublin county and (c) the rest of the country, which have been sold to the tenants since the first tenant purchase scheme; and the total number of houses in each area which remain tenancy houses.</Quest>

      <P>Information about the number of houses purchased under all tenant purchase schemes is not readily available in the Department.  However, details of the number of dwellings sold annually by authorities during the period 1970-89 have been included in the Housing Statistics Bulletin for the final quarter of each year.  Some details for earlier years are given in the Department's annual reports for those years.</P>
      <P>In 1990, sales in the areas mentioned by the Deputy were 1,943,747 and 2,910, respectively.  At the end of 1990, dwellings in the ownership of the authorities in the areas involved totalled 34,775, 7,893 and 53,658, respectively.</P>

      <P>In view of the extremely high administration costs for tenancy dwellings and the very high maintenance costs, which have been the subject of exchanges in this House over the past number of months, may I ask the Minister if he has any plans to introduce a further tenant purchase scheme to facilitate the sale of more houses to tenants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can recall, the total amount provided by my Department for maintenance is approximately £65 million and the rental income is approximately £46 million.  There is no doubt that there is a substantial cost in that area.  I agree with the Deputy that one has to look seriously at this issue in the overall context.  One option is to contemplate a new house purchase scheme.  I am not ruling out this option but it is too early yet to make any decision about it.  In the context of his earlier questions the Deputy devoted much of his time to the need to clear up the position in regard to the previous scheme. There is still a great number of outstanding applicants to that scheme who <Col N="1573" /> have yet to be served.  Local authorities need to concentrate their available resources on solving these problems as well as getting involved in the mix of new arrangements proposed under the new housing programme.  Therefore, I do not propose to introduce a new scheme in the near future.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not take some special steps to clear the backlog from the 1988 scheme?  Most of the backlog is due to technical problems either in flats or houses.  A large number of people who were not in a position to purchase their houses or flats in 1988 because of unemployment, their economic circumstances or tenancy factors are now in a position to do so and would like to do so.  I ask the Minister to try to bring in a scheme later this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 21, 31, 44, 46, 57 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I regret that the major farming organisations were, inadvertently, not among those formally consulted by my Department in the preparation of the national report for UNCED.  Environmentally sound agricultural policies are, of course, essential for sustainable development, and this was reflected by the involvement of the Department of Agriculture and Food in an interdepartmental committee established to assist in compiling the report.</P>
      <P>I will be seeking to promote a wide representation from Irish representative bodies at the Global Forum for non-governmental organisations which will be held in parallel with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992.  I intend to contact the farming organisations, among others, for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that farmers are the occupiers of by far the largest part of the physical environment of our country at present and that any policy prepared in regard to the environment which did not involve discussions with farmers could not be argued to be truly comprehensive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, there is no excuse for failure to have consultations with the farming community.  I cannot really say what happened at the time.  As the House knows, we have much consultation with farming organisations on a variety of fronts.  In the context of the fish kills and agricultural pollution, it would seem logical to have such consultation. Even though there is a time constraint I <Col N="1576" /> am proposing to provide that facility so that I will have their views in time for UNCED.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if the Government intend to make available to farming organisations the submission which has been made to the Rio de Janeiro conference by the Government to enable them to make their contributions as up to date as possible?  Will the Minister also make that submission available to Members of the House so that they too can make their views known on the appropriateness of the Government's submission to this very important world conference on the environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very major conference and I would be very anxious, before we come to a final decision in relation to our plans for the conference, to afford this House the fullest opportunity to discuss every aspect of this matter.  I hope this will meet the Deputy's wishes in that regard.  It would be inconceivable to think that we would have a debate without discussing the final report at that time.  Since the report is not available to me I cannot say any more at this time.</P>
      <P>With regard to making available to one organisation parts of submissions which are at the early stages of consideration, I do not know how feasible that would be. In view of their exclusion up to now, I will be as facilitatory as possible to the farming organisations and, within the constraints on me, I intend to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has not responded properly to the question asked by Deputy Gilmore. A preliminary report must have been done by his Department because there have been at least four inter-Governmental meetings at various venues around the world in preparation for this; indeed the previous Government told us that we had been represented at those meetings.  Surely it is not beyond the power of the Minister's officials to have a preliminary report available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>On occasions Deputy Carey and I seem to have crossed swords in relation to these matters.  I did not say that information was not available.  I was asked whether I could make available certain reports to the farming organisations and I said I would go as far as was feasible.  We can decide in due course whether to make a preliminary report available, but my concern at the moment is to have the widest possible consultation in preparation for a final report which will be available in time for the Rio conference. The opportunity is there to consult a wide spectrum of opinion in regard to this matter.</P>

It is open to sanitary authorities to publish such data collected by them at any stage.</P>
      <P>The first national report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland for the year 1989 was published by the Environmental Research Unit in October 1991.  Now that the systems for collecting, reporting, compiling and analysing the data on which the report is based have been established, a shorter interval between monitoring and publication should be possible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The environment action programme sets out the Government's objectives for eliminating untreated sewage discharges to coastal and inland waters.  The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990, when enacted will empower the Minister for the Environment to prescribe standards for sewage discharges.  This will facilitate implementation of the EC Directive on Urban Water Waste Treatment.</P>
      <P>The provision of new and improved sewage management and disposal arrangements for major coastal towns, including Dublin, is a particular priority of the water and sanitary services programme. Dublin Corporation have appointed consultants to develop proposal for the provision of secondary, or if necessary higher, treatment at Ringsend and Howth.  The question of capital expenditure does not yet arise in relation to these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the question because I was concerned about the disposal and treatment of sewage in the greater Dublin area.  The raw sewage from over 50 per cent of the houses is disposed of directly into Dublin Bay off the nose of Howth.  I am aware that it is mandatory to introduce some of the EC Directives in this area before 1998. Because of the huge volume of untreated sewage being discharged into Dublin Bay, which of course has an effect on amenities in the area, would the Minister consider introducing interim measures to ensure that the sewage is treated by some means in 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals to upgrade and re-equip the screening facilities at Howth are under active consideration at present. I accept the point made by the Deputy that the discharge of raw sewage into the bay at the nose of Howth, into inland waterways or coastal water is not just objectionable but needs to be eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The environmental action programme will be carried out over the next ten years. It involves massive expenditure on secondary treatment plants.  Where more effective treatment plants are called for <Col N="1584" /> in our coastal areas, this work is being undertaken progressively.  I will examine the extent to which the screening process can be expedited and ultimately integrated into the scheme that the consultants are presently examining in the context of secondary and tertiary treatment plants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not well past the time that the Department took the initiative to make a major investment in the sewage outflow facilities into the sea and coastal waters?  We have to abide by EC Directives on this matter by 1997, but how can the local authorities deal with this matter if the Government do not take the initiative and provide the funds required to solve the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not only taken the initiative but we have asked the local authorities to submit a programme of works to eliminate pollution from our inland watercourses and from our major coastal areas. Implementating such a programme will cost £230 million over the course of ten years on inland waters and £400 million on our coastal waters.</P>
      <P>Recently I had the opportunity to open a plant in Dún Laoghaire.  We expended £13 million on the plant, but now we will be able to get the blue flag for the bay. It is our ambition that in the course of time we will provide the greatest possible resources.  We will also negotiate at EC level for moneys from the Structural and Cohesion Funds to enhance, improve and accelerate those programmes as much as we can.  The local authorities will have to be able to match these plans.  The Government have taken the initiative in this regard and the moneys expended in this area are much greater than anything that was ever considered in this country in the past.  The fact of the matter is that the problem has not been resolved and requires additional commitment and resources to solve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the local authorities be required to upgrade the long sea outfalls which were put in place?  Will <Col N="1585" /> money be made available to upgrade these outfalls, which predate the EC Directives?  Many of these outfalls were installed since the eighties but these directives were not applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility of each local authority for the schemes they put in place is a secondary matter in the context of overall responsibility when the system is not working properly.  As the Deputy will appreciate, some systems that were installed many years ago are still working effectively, but other systems which were installed quite recently are creating problems.  When the sewage treatment facilities are inadequate we have to face up to our overall responsibilities in both financial and technical terms and deal with the problem over a planned period, having regard to the resources available at home and from our EC partners.  In the final analysis we have an obligation to eliminate pollutants from our waters and we must do everything within the constraints to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many local authorities have been taken to court because they caused pollution? Has the Minister prepared a list of the main problems that need to be dealt with immediately and over the next five years?  Will the Minister take the initiative to establish a list of priorities and to set aside a sum of money to resolve the problem over the next five to ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly asks will I make a list, but what we are talking about is a thorough examination of the problem in all local authority areas and the setting up of a programme which will be developed in consultation with my Department, the local authorities and wider interests where that is necessary, so that we will have an operation programme to submit to the EC for additional resources to deal with these matters.  It would be incomprehensible that an operational programme would not set out priorities to be dealt with ahead of other problems which could be <Col N="1586" /> postponed for some time.  I do not envisage any difficulty in the consultative process and the preparation of an effective and ambitious plan in that regard.</P>

      <P>I indicated that over 50 per cent of sewage in the greater Dublin area is being disposed of untreated off the nose of Howth.  This is totally unaccetable.  I am aware that four engineers are working on it on behalf of Dublin Corporation and bringing back reports, but I would ask the Minister to indicate that funding will be available to address this unacceptable situation on the north side of the city compared with the south side where sewage is being treated, and that if the Department were to seek an interim measure to treat the sewage on the north side of the city the Minister would provide the funding to do so?</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the position of homeless persons has been significantly improved by a number of initiatives taken in recent years.  The more significant of these are as follows: wider powers conferred on local <Col N="1588" /> authorities by the Housing Act, 1988, to secure accommodation for homeless persons; assessments of housing needs undertaken by local authorities and which now specifically include homeless persons; more flexible financial arrangements have been introduced where voluntary bodies provide accommodation for homeless persons and there is increased Exchequer funding for this purpose; better liaison between housing authorities and voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless persons; improved arrangements to provide an emergency response service for homeless persons; new schemes of letting priorities adopted by housing authorities under the Housing Act, 1988, give greater prominence to homeless persons; and, finally, the level of capital assistance available to voluntary bodies providing accommodation for, <i>inter alia</i>, homeless persons has been increased substantially.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that we have a housing crisis and that the problem which appeared to be resolved in the mid-eighties has worsened?  Second will he not accept that local authorities need money more than power and that the number of houses which they can build now is minuscule in proportion to the number built in the past?  Finally, would the Minister not agree that unless action is taken now we will have more and more horror stories in our clinics of homeless people or people living in rat-infested, slumlike or overcrowded conditions?  Will the Minister accept there is a crisis and tell us what he will do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe should accept that in the Housing Act, 1988, for the first time statutory provision was made for dealing with this problem. Nobody is trying to deny there is a problem and that it will take a caring and wide range of proposals to deal with it.  For the first time also there has been a recoupment to the local authority.  Expenditure in this area has grown, and in the voluntary housing area up to 600 units will be provided this year for which a sum of <Col N="1589" /> £11 million is being provided.  That is an indication of a certain amount of progress being made.  That is not to say the problem is being resolved.  As long as there are homeless people a major concern of Government must be to dedicate resources to that area.  For the first time the legal framework has been put in place.  The resources committed to this area in terms of the mix of different solutions applied by the Government are more extensive than ever.  To the extent that I can find additional resources to deal with this matter over a period I will do my best to get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Minister has come some of the way in that he now admits there is a problem.  I suggest that in fact there is a crisis.  Can the Minister tell me the extent of that problem?  The Minister has differentiated between the number of people who are actually homeless and those who are living in totally unsuitable conditions.  Has he any idea of the extent of the problem under both headings so that we can then think about the resources that would have to be applied to resolve that problem.  Otherwise, I genuinely believe we will have major social unrest in this country apart altogether from having our fellow citizens living in conditions that are totally unacceptable?</P>

There are extraordinary differences in relation to the provision of these facilities, recoupment and the support available from the Department, from one part of the country to another.  I am extremely interested in having discussions with the voluntary agencies some of which have been immensely successful in dealing with this matter.  In other areas little or nothing is happening.  Everyone in this House who wants to get involved seems to have the notion that the Government have unlimited resources to resolve every problem raised, be it sanitary services or housing.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister got a warm welcome to the House and was congratulated on his promotion by many Deputies, including me.  However, I will be standing well back from the warm welcome this Bill seems to be getting from all sides of the House.  This is an outrageous Bill.  It is a direct attack on social insurance and the Minister should be ashamed to have moved so far from the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Labour Party colleague, Deputy Bell, congratulated the Minister on providing an excellent information service for TDs.  Deputy Bell said that because of the excellence of the service fewer parliamentary questions were being asked of the Minister because we are now able to have our queries adequately handled by the Department.  That is the sort of respect which should be afforded to a Member of Parliament.  Would the Minister not agree that that type of service should also be delivered to the general public who are inquiring about <Col N="1662" /> their benefits and entitlements?  It is due to the lack of facilities, unfortunately, that so many people find their way to TD's clinics.  The Members of Parliament should legislate and should not have to try to present themselves as people with a cure for all ills, at their clinics.</P>
    <P>While congratulating the Minister's staff on providing TDs with an excellent service I congratulate the NSSB for the excellence of their service to those of us who are prepared to pay for it.  If the Minister is genuine in wishing to let the public know about their entitlements the information which the NSSB provides to TDs for a fee of £300 a year should be made available from the Department to, for instance, party spokespersons on social welfare.  Without the filing system and constant updating of the system in the NSSB we would be lost.  The Minister has admitted that this is an extremely complex area and he has made it ten times more complex as a result of the introduction of more means testing in this Bill.  Politicians need the service provided by the NSSB to prepare a case to argue with the Minister and to accommodate constituents who wish to make inquiries. Would the Minister at least consider giving the service to party spokespersons as a service from the Department?</P>
    <P>Under section 3, I sought an increase in the minimum rate of benefit and assistance in line with the figures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  In support of my case I cited the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and figures produced from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which showed that there are millions of pounds outstanding in uncollected taxes which could be directed towards upgrading the minimum social welfare payments.  The Justice Commission of The Conference of Major Religious Superiors in &ldquo;A Question of Choices&rdquo; alleged that the Department are losing out badly at Cabinet level and that the reason the Minister does not come anywhere near the figures recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare is that the social welfare budget as a proportion of the overall <Col N="1663" /> budget has been declining.  Does the Minister accept that?  Expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of GDP has been declining and the Exchequer contribution as distinct from the social insurance contribution to social welfare has been declining.  Does the Minister not accept that it is a combination of all three things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The previous speaker referred to the National Social Services Board.  I heartily endorse what has been said in relation to the NSSB and the service they provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the complexity of the social welfare system.  The Department published an information booklet but it is comprehensive and bulky and it is not as easy to assimilate as the booklet produced by the NSSB.  A large number of voluntary groups also publish information booklets on a whole range <Col N="1664" /> of social welfare services.  The Minister should look favourably at funding local groups and the National Social Service Board for their work in providing information and booklets for the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>So that we can make progress.  I again appeal to Deputies to confine themselves on Committee Stage to what is in the section and not to ramble too far away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank speakers who have contributed.  The debate on section 3 has been more like a Second Stage debate in that it has ranged over everything from income tax to information services and dates of payment.</P>
      <P>Section 3 provides for the increases in the weekly rates of social insurance payments announced in the budget. Many speakers referred to the dates on which the increases will become payable. Increases have been paid from July for a number of years and speakers have been asking that we bring forward dates of payment.  Clearly there would be cost implications.  It would cost an extra £30 million if the increases were to be payable from 6 April.  I do not have the money to bring forward the payment dates.  July has been the date for some time and I see no reason to change it.  Last year people got increases in July and it is hardly reasonable that they should be given another increase after only nine months.</P>
      <P>Deputies also referred to the Commission on Social Welfare.  We have achieved the priority rates recommended by the commission in many areas.  The total annual cost of achieving the commission's rates of payments in 1992 terms would be £340 million.  The commission's report is excellent, but I have not the means to put another £340 million into the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other speakers referred to percentage increases.  Deputy Bell rightly said that 4 per cent of £50 is a small amount of money.  A friend of mine used to say that 60 per cent of nothing is still nothing. That is self-evident.  I recognise that people on basic unemployment assistance <Col N="1665" /> and unemployment benefit are not living in the lap of luxury.  Over the past couple of years we have at least reached the priority rates recommended by the commission in many respects.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the commission's recommendations in relation to the rates of payment present serious problems of resources which can only be resolved as the economy grows.  To reach the priority rates in 1992 would cost an additional £15 million in 1992 and £33.5 million in a full year over and above the existing 1992 budget allocation.</P>
    <P>The commission recognised these difficulties and identified priority increases as the first step in bringing the rates of payment to minimum acceptable levels. The Government have committed themselves under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&ldquo;to move by 1993 to the priority level of rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and thereafter, to increase social welfare rates further and progressively, in accordance with the commission's recommendations, as the resources of the economy grow&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended their rates in 1985 terms.  In 1985 terms the priority rates would have been £45; in 1992 terms that is the equivalent of £56.50.  In regard to social insurance, the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have already been achieved in the case of old age contributory pensions, retirement, invalidity and widow's contributory pension schemes, deserted wife's benefit, the maternity allowance scheme for women in employment and the occupational injuries benefits schemes.</P>
    <P>The disability benefit and unemployment benefit schemes are the only social insurance payments which are not yet at the commission's priority level.  Of approximately 397,000 persons in receipt of the various social insurance payments, over 266,000 &mdash; almost 67 per cent &mdash; are receiving payment at a higher level than the commission's priority rates.</P>
    <P>Regarding social assistance payments, of the total of approximately 777,000 social welfare recipients, over 587,000 &mdash;<Col N="1666" /> 75 per cent &mdash; are receiving payments at a higher level than the commission's priority rates.</P>
    <P>We have done what the commission asked us to do.  To bring up the rates in one year would have very serious cost implications for the Exchequer and they recommended as an interim step that we should achieve the priority rates.  In 1993 we will have achieved priority rates in all areas.  That will be welcomed by everybody. We have gone some of the way to meet the objectives set out in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for a general increase of 4 per cent in the personal, adult and child dependant rates, with a special increase of 6 per cent in short term payments, including disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  The personal rates of disability and unemployment benefits are being increased to a new weekly rate of £53. The adult and child dependant increases payable with these benefits are being increased by 4 per cent to £34.30 and £12.50 per week respectively.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of old age (contributory) and retirement pensions are being increased by £2.60 a week to £66.60.  The rates of widow's (contributory) pension and deserted wife's benefit are being increased by £2.30 a week to £60.50.  The rates of invalidity pension and of pensions and lump sum gratuities under the occupational injuries benefits schemes are also being increased.</P>
    <P>The new rates of social insurance payments are set out in Schedule A to the Bill.  These improvements in the rates of payment which are in excess of the rate of inflation represent an increase in real terms for social welfare recipients and clearly demonstrate the commitment contained in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&ldquo;to ensure that social welfare recipients are protected against inflation and their living standards are maintained and, where possible, improved&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These increases go a long way towards alleviating the hardship of people on minimum levels of social welfare.  The <Col N="1667" /> Government in successive budgets have matched and bettered the inflation rate in the social welfare increases.  I recognise that people on the basic levels are not in luxurious circumstances but we are doing the best we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to the family income supplement and the possibility of losing the medical card.  We have made a special arrangement with the Department of Health so that people in receipt of the family income supplement will not as a result lose their entitlement to a medical card.  This is clearly stated in a leaflet which explains the family income supplement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight overlap for a month or so until all this is accepted and passed.  At Eastern Health Board level I have some experience of this.  It takes a little time when rates are changed to get the message through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case the Department will issue a further diktat on the operation of the system.  Deputy Bell mentioned the bank-link method of payment at post offices.  We are in discussion with An Post and will be entering a new arrangement with them shortly to improve the current system.  As Deputies are aware, with the growth in technology and computerisation people will very <Col N="1668" /> shortly have the option of alternative payment methods, some of which have been introduced on a pilot basis.  I will bear in mind the points made by Deputy Bell.  We hope that, with the growth in computerisation and so on, improvements will be made in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I took note of all the points made but many of them apply to other sections of the Bill and we will deal with them when we come to those sections.  Deputies referred to a wide range of areas covering all sections of the Bill but I will deal only with section 3 now.  Otherwise we would make no progress on Committee Stage.  I want to co-operate with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  If he had been in the House this morning he would not have allowed such a wide-ranging debate and Deputies would not have been allowed to wander over the broad spectrum of welfare taxation and so on.  Now that he is ensconced again in the Chair I will bow to his superior knowledge of the rules of the House.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is in many respects similar to section 3 so I shall just remark on one or two of the comments made by the Minister in his final contribution on section 3.</P>
      <P>I am a little concerned about the Minister's explanations for payments being made in July every year.  I certainly shall not waste the time of the House on this issue because I have to accept that the decision has been made this year and there is no more to be said about it, but I am slightly bemused at the position, which is very similar to that of a company selling the same product in a different wrapping.  The Government announced on budget day that there is to be a 6 per cent or a 4 per cent increase but that it will not be made until July of that year.  In keeping with the spirit of the Commission on Social Welfare, I should have thought that the Government would try to give real increases to those who need them most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, I should have thought <Col N="1671" /> that what we should be endeavouring to do is get those dates back, even over a five-year period, so that that could be taken into account, if necessary, in the actual percentage increase itself.  That would mean that at least the elderly, those who are ill, invalided or whatever, would know that the actual increase meant what it said.  I know the Minister has made the case that he has not got the £30 million to enable him to do so; I know that only too well.  It is true to say that the hallmark of a Christian society, in good or bad times, is that they do the best they can to look after their underprivileged. I am somewhat worried that the Minister appears to be saying there is nothing he can do about it, or perhaps there is nothing he wants to do about it, that that is the system and that is the way it will remain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Connaughton examines the logic of what he is saying he will find it will not withstand chronological examination.  I appreciate that he is not making the point in a party political or contentious manner.  What he and the other Members appear to be saying about these dates is that, when the Government of the day announce those increases at budget time, the fact that they are not implemented for some considerable time later creates an anomaly whereas I contend none is created. However, an anomaly would arise if we were to say we would not pay such increases until, say, next September, whereas, as of now they are paid in each July; that would be unfair.  Governments are forced at budget time, usually in January, to say what will be their expenditure on social welfare.  I accept that for any party in power introducing their budget there is, if you like, a political negative in people or recipients contending that they will not receive such increases until July.  But if such increases are paid in July, or on a given date every year, there is no disadvantage for anybody. Members are really asking me to grant social welfare beneficiaries a retrospective payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> Many Members particularly Deputy Bell, will have been involved in trade union negotiations over the years with regard to rates of pay and so on, agreement being reached on the payment of, say 2 per cent or 8 per cent from a certain date.  So long as those dates comply with what happened in preceding years I do not perceive any disadvantage.  Nonetheless, I realise there are political negatives for the Government caused by the delay in payment from the budgetary announcement of such social welfare increases.  But if recipients are paid those increases in July every year then there is no disadvantage.  If people follow the logic of what I am saying they will find they can agree with me.  I have heard this argument advanced before and never went along with it whether in Opposition or in Government.  If there is a consistant date annually for the payment of such increases there is no disadvantage for anybody, whereas there would be if any Minister for Finance or Social Welfare were to say, &ldquo;in 1992 I will not grant these increases until September or October&rdquo;.  I contend that the arguments advanced do not withstand rational examination.  That is my belief anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat the same arguments.  We will be opposing this section on the same grounds as I advanced earlier.  The Minister is wrong to say no problem arises if these social welfare increases are paid consistently annually in the same month.  This is not being done.  As I pointed out, the rot seemed to set in around 1982 when the payment of such increases was delayed until the end of June, whereas prior to 1982 they were effected in the month of April.  The logic of the slippage of successive Governments &mdash; those increases now being effected in July whereas they had been paid in April, May or June &mdash; is that they will meet themselves at the other end.  Whereas those increases are announced annually at budget time, usually January or February, their payment is delayed for six months.  If that slippage continues they will be overlapping into <Col N="1673" /> the succeeding year's budget which would be totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>One may take the Minister's point that he does not have the £30 million to date those increases back to April, but rather than put their payment in abeyance until, say, August next year or September the year after, it has to be said that the Minister faces a crisis in that payments cannot be paid so much later than their announcement in the budget.  It is clearly dishonest on the part of the Government to do so since they encounter no problem whatsoever striking and introducing PAYE rates, collectable as and from March.  Since the money is collected in March there appears to me to be no reason the Government cannot effect social welfare increases in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on section 3, if circumstances obtained in which it was negotiated with the trade union congress &mdash; in accordance with <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress 1</i> or <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress 2</i>&mdash; that the phases of social welfare increases would comply with the phased salary increases to workers generally then a date would be fixed by negotiation each year which would be a more acceptable manner of dealing with the matter.  Certainly I will be suggesting that strongly to the trade union movement in discussions on any new agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What concerns me most are the provisions of section 4 (2) (b) dealing with unemployment assistance.  I do not know whether we will be given an opportunity to deal with this on other sections or whether we will reach them.  The biggest bone of contention <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare nationwide at present is the non-payment of unemployment assistance to young people who are being penalised if they live with their families.  They are being forced to leave home and live elsewhere in order to qualify at all.  We are here talking about a payment date of 29 July but for very many young people there will be no payment date at all.  In the case of a father working in a local authority bringing home, say, £130 per week, if his son of 20 is living in the <Col N="1674" /> home he will receive no unemployment assistance at all.  He must seek accommodation in a flat when not alone is he then paid the benefit in full but the relevant community welfare officer must pay him £35 towards his rent.  It is not logical.  It is a crazy system.  In addition, any such young person must wait eight weeks to be assessed only to be informed he will not get benefit anyway.  On that basis alone the provisions of that subsection warrant close scrutiny.  I am sure the Minister is aware that that is a nationwide problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record again that because Governments have got into the habit of paying social welfare increases on a given date in July then within the overall context it basically means that social welfare recipients are now £30 million worse off than they might have been otherwise.  I am not making a political point.  We did the very same.  It is almost parallel with the arrangement in respect of a person and his family in receipt of unemployment assistance.  It is not good enough that parents with four children must live on £136 unemployment assistance.  In a society like ours that is grossly inadequate.  I know we could engage in a full scale discussion on how that figure is struck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the provisions of this section are concerned, the fact that payment was effected on a given date over a certain number of years does not mean it is correct to continue that practice if we believe that social welfare recipients are not receiving sufficient money.  If we as a society genuinely believe that the unemployed and poor are not being treated as well as they should be then this Bill represents the vehicle by which we could grant them extra benefit.  That is the point I am making.  If the Minister is still in office this time next year I have no doubt that there will be only a small change, for reasons I understand only too well.  The Government should make it a priority to bring forward those dates as quickly as possible.  It may not be possible to do this for two or three years but I should like <Col N="1675" /> to think that the Minister and Government of the day will make this a priority.</P>
    <P>It would be wonderful if we had a fairy godmother who could provide jobs for 50,000 people so that our economy could tick over better.  The current procedures were built into the system because it was perceived that finance was not available. One could talk about this issue all day but I believe we have debated it adequately at this stage.  It would be very easy to turn the argument around and say that several people will manage to bend the system. I will not mention any names but we have had plenty of examples of this over the past 12 months.  It appears that the old, the sick and the poor have to wait at the end of the line for everything.  They seem to be the only groups in our society who have to wait for up to six months before they can receive the benefits which are given to them.  That is the point I am making.  I hope the Government will have the political will to rectify this anomaly as resources permit.  An extra £30 million would make a huge difference to those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton is asking me to give a once-off payment backdated from July to April.  This would become the operative date in future.  I accept that people can feel hard done by when the changes announced in the budget do not apply until July.  If the fairy godmother to whom Deputy Connaughton referred gave me £30 million it would be possible to backdate the payment to the start of April.  The cost in future years would be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is that there is no disadvantage to people when they get the increase on the same day every year. As I said, people get confused when the increases announced in the budget do not apply until July.  If I had an extra £30 million I would gladly give this once-off payment.  However, I do not have that money.  As long as the dates stay the same every year people will not be hard done by.  Governments who are short of money naturally extend the dates until later in the year in the hope that they will save <Col N="1676" /> money.  I accept that this can give rise to hardship.  However, this is not being proposed in this Bill &mdash; the dates will be more or less the same as they were last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell referred to the question of assessment, particularly as it affects young people.  I know that this causes some problems.  The purpose of this assessment system is to ensure equity between people living at home and those who are not.  The abolition of this assessment system would cost the State approximately £25 million.  I do not have those resources either.  As resources become available, my Department will look at the position of people over 25 who are assessed with benefit and privilege.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has said is correct &mdash; there are certain anomalies in the system.  Young people who leave home are paid a supplementary welfare allowance by the health boards, which is a charge on the Department of Social Welfare.  This is also a problem. The abolition of this system of assessment would cost the State approximately £25 million, and I cannot do it.</P>
      <P>Section 4 provides for increases in the weekly rates of social welfare assistance payments announced in the budget.  In view of the fact that we discussed the social insurance provisions under section 3, I do not intend to go into this in detail. If Deputies want to raise any specific questions about the section I will be glad to answer them.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 19 not moved.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little bit of good news to announce.  Subsection (1) provides for the payment of an additional weekly allowance to invalidity pension recipients aged 80 years or over.  This extension of the over-80 allowance to these invalidity pensioners brings the invalidity pension into line with other social welfare payments.  Subsection (2) provides that the allowance will be payable at the existing rate with effect from 9 April 1992.</P>
      <P>Subsections (1) and (4) together with Schedule A provide for an increase in the allowance to £4.40 per week with effect from July 1992. This is in line with the general social welfare increases provided for in section 3.  This provision removes an anomaly whereby invalidity pensioners aged 80 years or over were not getting the same amount of money as old age pensioners.  There will be a very small cost to the State in removing this anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We obviously welcome this and I am glad that it will take effect from 9 April 1992, because this is what we were arguing about on section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister bear in mind the two points I raised, perhaps under the wrong section, that is the question of application forms for invalidity pensions, because a great many older people who would be eligible for invalidity pension would not understand how to apply for invalidity pension.  Naturally a very small number of people over 80 would be entitled to <Col N="1680" /> invalidity pensions.  Could the Minister tell us the number of people who will benefit.</P>

      <P>I welcome this change and I am glad to see the elimination of the anomaly, which affected a very small number of people.  I must confess that I thought amendment No. 19 would be more relevant to section 4, and although the Chair has ruled it out of order, I am not complaining because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer.  However, I wanted to put down a marker because here was no other place I could do so on the Bill.  As I said yesterday, this is the first time ever that no increase has been provided in the child benefit scheme and I wanted to ensure that the Dáil would note this.  I would like to see mothers getting the same percentage increase through the child benefit scheme as applies to other schemes.  The Minister is probably aware that this is one of my hobby horses.  Indeed it is not today or yesterday I started to speak on this subject.  I genuinely believe that the best way to channel financial help to families is to the mother via the child benefit scheme.  The NESC report and the report of the Commission on Social Welfare back up my assertion.  I cannot understand why child benefit was not increased in line with other social welfare benefits. The mothers are very angry about this &mdash; there is no danger that they will take to the streets because as a category they do not do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, but I know they are terribly angry.  They have good reason to be angry.  Child benefit is the only income mothers get in their own name from the State.  For all the work <Col N="1681" /> they do in the home that is the least they can expect.  We are not talking about a great deal of money as it is less than £4 per child per week.  On any scale of priority one would have imagined that the Minister would try to ensure that money was channelled into the heart of the home.  Many mothers have to make tremendous efforts to keep the family together.  Mothers know that on the first Tuesday of every month, year in year out, they can collect their child benefit payment and it is amazing what they can do with the family budget.  I want to protest in the loudest manner at the failure to increase child benefit.  It was a rebuff to every mother in the country that no increase was given on this occasion. It is not enough to say that on other occasions no increase was paid, and I genuinely believe this is the first of the bad mistakes in this Bill.  However, we have limited resources and we will have to accept reality.  There is just so much that the Minister can dispense, and that is one of the reasons that my party abstained from voting.  So far as the increases are concerned we would have preferred if they were higher, but the Minister does not have a golden goose.  I am glad to avail of the opportunity today to put on the record of the House that a fundamental mistake has been made in that the child benefit allowance was not increased even to the minimum rate of 4 per cent which would have sent a signal to every mother in the country that we acknowledge the work she does in the home.  That goes without saying.  The signal that went out as result of this Bill, in which there was no mention of the child benefit scheme, is one which does not reflect well on the Government.</P>

      <P>I support the very eloquent case made by Deputy Connaughton in this matter.  The history of this payment goes back a long way.  I was one of those people who in the early seventies realised when the children's allowance was first introduced that it was paid to the father.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is new a little insight will not go astray.  Initially the childrens' allowance, as it was called, was paid by the State to the father.  He had a legal right to it.  Many men kept the childrens' allowance book in their pocket and cashed it on the first Tuesday of the month and may or may not have given the money to the women or may have given them something extra in their housekeeping money.  When the womens' campaign started in the seventies this became a focal point for agitation by many mothers and I am happy to say a Fianna Fáil Government changed that rule and gave it to the woman.  In effect that was the first and, I think, it is still the only social welfare payment the woman receives in her own right.  We know the childrens' allowance is for the children, but the woman has the right to keep the book and to go and collect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No public funds are better spent than the childrens' allowance.  The money is kept in preparation for Holy Communion, Confirmation and is put away to pay for extra educational classes.  It is the least wasted money of all the money allocated in the budget.  I regret this Bill is silent on increased payments.  I appreciate that if the Minister had said we will give a percentage increase he could expect criticism and people would say it was not enough.  It is bad form and it is totally inexcusable that they were forgotten. The Minister will not be forgiven and I am sure his constituents have been in contact with him; certainly they have been in contact with me and many of my colleagues to see whether anything can be done.  Why can the Social Welfare Bill and the budget not recognise the <Col N="1683" /> importance of this benefit.  I am aware of the thinking in the Department of Social Welfare, at the Cabinet table and in the Department of Finance because I have been through it all.  The thinking is why should money be given to people for children whose surnames are Smurfit or Dunne&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael proposal for <Col N="1684" /> a 95p increase in child benefit for the first three children, which works out at approximately £137, is certainly not very demanding.  They are not seeking a tremendous amount of money, even if the Minister could find the means to pay it, but the principle is very important. Child benefit has not been increased and it has not even attained the 4 per cent increase.  That may be incorrect.</P>

      <P>I sum up by saying I hope the Minister is aware that 40 per cent of Ireland's children live in households below the minimum income level identified by the Commission on Social Welfare and that large numbers experience serious deprivation.  Much research has been carried out to identify children most at risk in our society.  They should be targeted and it is remiss of the Minister not to have allowed any financial increase in child benefit.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I have to claim a plenary indulgence for a few minutes on the basis that we were talking about the child allowance.  I think the Minister is carried away with religious fervour; he is paying too much attention to the gospel, to the birds in the air and the trees and the lilies in the field and how they look after themselves.  Unfortunately, children have to be fed.  We proved earlier that the 4 per cent increase which social welfare recipients received really was not an increase when one took into account the extra taxes and the rate of inflation.  We now have a situation where nothing is given, which means that even though the children will be a year older they are supposed to live on less. <Col N="1685" /> The mothers of Ireland depend on this income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it is in order to deal with the deviations as well.  I presume everybody is accepting the provision in section 5 with regard to invalidity pensions.  I dealt with the points regarding child benefit in my closing address on Second Stage last night.  I do not necessarily disagree with much of the thinking concerning child benefit put forward by Deputies.  There is hardly a better way of directing the resources of the State at those most in need &mdash; those living in poverty and the poor.  Before she entered this House Deputy Fennell played more than a small part in getting that provision changed on the grounds that child benefit should be paid to the woman.  I have learned a little about politics during the years &mdash; I have made many mistakes also &mdash; and I am aware that all women, be they at the top end of the social scale and living in expensive houses or at the lower end, regard child benefit as their payment.  Like Deputy Fennell, I have often said that there is an anomaly in the system in that people with very large incomes are receiving child benefit just like the person at the lower end of the scale living in Clonmel or Newbridge. I realise however that even those people regard child benefit as their payment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make this an excuse but, as I said last night, having regard to budgetary restraints, hard decisions had to be made in the budget and it did not prove possible to increase the allowance this year.  Indeed on the last occasion on which my predecessor in this Department increased child benefit he was run over in the House and had to take some abuse. If I was to grant a 4 per cent increase this would mean that child benefit would be increased by about 95p each month and people would say that this works out at 3p per day.  Therefore one cannot win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke about this matter last night, when Deputy Fennell was present, I indicated what my thinking is in this <Col N="1686" /> regard.  I accept that this is a very effective way of targeting resources at a particular area and that they are used to maximum effect.  The one thing we can be sure of is that in poor households the woman will spend child benefit on the basic necessities of life.  I gave an indication last night of what I may do in this regard if I am still in this position next year.  However, there may be a down side also.</P>
    <P>I accept many of the economic arguments in regard to child benefit to which Deputy Fennell and I, when an ordinary Deputy, have referred.  If it was thought that women would not receive this payment, the Government would find themselves in serious political trouble. Regardless of what my thinking may be in future years the House can rest assured that the woman will still receive child benefit.  However, other ways might be found of targeting or redirecting resources.  The point has been made that we should be able to target more effectively most of the moneys we pay out.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, child benefit was not increased in the budget. However, for those in receipt of unemployment assistance and benefit etc. the child dependant allowance was increased.  As I mentioned last night, there are anomalies in the system in relation to disincentives to work.  If we looked on this matter differently and stopped scoring political points &mdash; I should say that this debate has been constructive both last night and today &mdash; we might be able to make progress.  Child benefit will cost £217 million this year at the rate set in 1991.  Perhaps we could target these resources a little bit better. If I am still in this hot seat next year, I will consider what can be done in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before subsection (2), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister shall arrange, in association with the Revenue Commissioners, for the issue of an information notice in relation to the family income supplement scheme and which shall be enclosed with each P60 form issued by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House but I would like to comment on a few important matters in relation to the family income supplement and to ask the Minister a number of questions.  I should say that I have advocated the concept of family income supplement from the very first day it was introduced for a specific purpose.  It is my understanding that only 7,000 people are in receipt of this supplement. I do not have the exact figure, but I think it is around 7,000.</P>
      <P>Apart from carer's allowance, this scheme has attracted more publicity than any other scheme that I know of.  I recall that this time last year a publicity campaign was undertaken to ensure workers were aware of their entitlements as there was a belief that many people were not aware of the family income supplement or, if they were, they felt for whatever reason that they were better off without it.</P>
      <P>We need to look at this scheme.  Since I entered this House ten or 11 years ago we have all been trying to eliminate poverty traps.  If one wants to speak for an hour to an hour and a half in the House there is no better topic that one could pick.  There are reams of newsprint dealing with it.  Indeed, I have in my possession a number of studies which clearly show that there are poverty traps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, it will finally dawn on a person in a low paid <Col N="1688" /> job when they arrive home on a Friday evening, having worked a long, hard week, that one of their neighbours is in receipt of more money on the dole.  One can put whatever veneer they like on it, but that is what it amounts to.  In relation to the work ethos and dedication to duty, the problems start from there.</P>
    <P>I fully accept, for historical reasons that I will not go into now, that many people are in receipt of social welfare in the area that I come from; but, as I said earlier, I genuinely believe that families in receipt of social welfare and nothing else are not having a good time.  It appears that the job that people on low incomes have is not regarded as being important; it is considered to be a dead end job.  In addition it is felt that they are being manipulated.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Major Religious Superiors and others make the point, in relation to the concept of work, that there is work available but not enough money to pay for it.  I always thought that the family income supplement was designed to supplement a person's income, where a job required to be done but the employer was not able for a variety of reasons to pay a living wage and because it is desirable to keep people in employment. However, something has gone terribly wrong with the system.  I would like to know why.  All but some 5 or 10 per cent of the population know about their entitlements, so I do not believe that the reason the family income supplement is not taken up is because people do not know about it.  However, I agree with the Minister doing anything he can to make the scheme more public.  I have an amendment which suggests that when the P60s are sent out every year there should be a note on them from the Revenue Commissioners to tell workers about the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>However, the question is more fundamental. The family income supplement together with the income from the low paid job must be less than the social welfare rate.  People on the dole have the rent allowance, the medical card and other things.  It has often been said that people earning perhaps £160 or £170 <Col N="1689" /> per week in a reasonably good job and who might have to drive from Ballinasloe to Galway, for instance, to get work, would be better off on the dole.  I am not sure if that is so but it is the perception. What are the Minister's thoughts on this? Obviously, this hits at the centre of much of our unemployment problems.  We should disregard a person's gross earnings for the previous year and take only net earnings into account and we might find out why more people are not availing of the family income supplement.  It should be highlighted then.</P>
    <P>For a few years, I believe people genuinely did not know about the family income supplement because of the complexities involved and that all we needed was a huge publicity campaign to get over the problem.  Enough campaigning has been done, but the message is not getting across.  If we are to eliminate the poverty trap created in this area, now is the time to use our imagination.  I am sure there are thousands of answers to this problem in the Department of Labour and in the Department of Social Welfare.  A reliance on publicity only will not sell the family income supplement.  The changes proposed here will make people a little better off but not as well off as indicated in the examples which the Minister has given.  We have an ideal opoprtunity to try something different.  Most people genuinely want to work.  It is worth a lot to the country to encourage the work ethic and to keep men and women working.</P>
    <P>In the past three or four years it is being said more frequently that it would pay people better to stay at home than to work.  It would be out of order for me to go into the area of taxation, but it is one area that could be worked on as a way of maintaining jobs.  When replying will the Minister give some indication as to why the family income supplement scheme has failed?  Perhaps the Minister will take the line that it has been a success. If it is, and it only affects 7,000 people or even 19,000 people, it is not having the effect we thought it would have, over five years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this scheme could <Col N="1690" /> be policed, but it is important to extend the family income supplement to other people, for instance, the self-employed and small farmers.  The reason initially &mdash; it was not to apply to those groups was because there was no clear method of calculation of their income but we got over that with the introduction of the PRSI system in 1988.  We know that many small farmers do not have a taxable income, but provided small farmers and self-employed people have a Revenue Certificate of their income, there should be no trouble in bringing them into the family income supplement scheme.  It is very important to have a system to keep small business people and small farmers and their families on the land.  The jobs they are doing are important for the health of the national economy.  There is a whole range of thoughts on the family income supplement.  I wonder if the Department or anyone else have made an indepth study of the family income supplement.  We must question whether we should continue the scheme if it is not producing the sort of results that were envisaged at the beginning.  I will not speak about the increases because unless and until the net pay rather than the gross pay is taken into account we will not know whether the scheme is as successful as it might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>We always welcome any increase in these schemes.  Many of the points made by Deputy Connaughton are correct.  It is my experience that people are afraid to apply for benefit under this scheme but I do not know why.  While I agree with the main thrust of the amendment, the matter could be dealt with in another way, by circulating a notice with the PAYE certificate rather than the P60. More and more employers are not giving their employees a P60, certainly not on 5 April.  They might give them in July, August or September.  In consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social Welfare could arrange that the document be circulated with the PAYE certificate.  This would cover a large number of workers, particularly <Col N="1691" /> industrial workers and those in service industries.</P>
      <P>A second point is that it would be a further check against the non-payment or return of PRSI and PAYE payments by employers.  One employer in my constituency owes £400,000 in PAYE and PRSI.  I will not name the company because they are not here to defend themselves.  It is public knowledge that a substantial number, if not all, of the people working for that company would qualify for the FIS.  How can the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners allow a company to run into the red to that extent while at the same time the Department of Social Welfare are subsidising workers because of the low wages paid by the employer?  We do not want to create another monster.</P>
      <P>This scheme will have to be monitored carefully by the Department.  It must not become a vehicle to subsidise bad employers.  It must be monitored in such a way that employers will not be able to issue P60s or P45s showing the same level of earnings year after year, while at the same time the Department are subsiding those earnings through the FIS.  If, for example, the average level of earnings for a worker in a particular company is £150, it is reasonable to expect that worker to receive an increase of 4 per cent under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> If the figure of £150 remains constant for five years, it simply means that the Department are subsidising the employer and paying the national increase on that level of earnings.  That monster is likely to emerge.  As competition for employment rises, bad employers will seek to exploit workers.  Deputy Connaughton should keep that point in mind.  It is the reason people believe they would be better off on the dole.  If they had to travel from Galway to Ballinasloe and bear the expense of maintaining and taxing a car, naturally they would be better off on the dole than in receipt of very low wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the main thrust of what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  It is a good idea but I suggest that the information <Col N="1692" /> document about the FIS should be sent with the PAYE certificate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank Deputy Bell for his intervention. We will be satisfied if the Minister undertakes to notify people through the taxation system.  Notices sent out from the Department of Social Welfare are displayed in employment exchanges but the FIS is of no benefit to somebody who is unemployed.  The scheme is designed to assist those who are in employment but receiving very low wages.  We will be happy to accept a form of notification which is directed at people in employment.</P>
      <P>We tabled an amendment, which was ruled out of order, dealing with net income.  People paying into pension schemes may gain a long term benefit.  If a person has a gross income of £180 and a net income of £150, it does not make any sense to disqualify him from benefit of some kind on the basis of the gross income.  It is unfair that people who are paying tax to keep the State going are penalised because the money they pay in tax is considered to be part of their income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the relevant points have been made.  Statistics show that the take-up rate under this scheme is extremely low.  Last year only 6,569 families benefited, at a cost of £9 million.  At least that money is going into the right hands.  One must question this low take-up rate.  To be eligible for the FIS people must work a minimum of 20 hours per week.  That figure can be made up by combining the hours worked by a spouse. A minimum supplement of £5 is payable. Of the 6,569 people who take up the family income supplement could the Minister give a breakdown of the number who receive the full supplement and the number who receive the minimum supplement of £5?  Perhaps tomorrow the Minister would give a breakdown of how the £9 million is spent.</P>

      <P>I would question the effectiveness of the scheme as it has been <Col N="1693" /> implemented over a period.  In Cork city, despite publicity about the scheme, many people see it as having little substance. When people applied for the family income supplement they found that because of notional earnings they did not qualify.  I listened very carefully to Deputy Connaughton, who made the point that one of the most important units in society is the family unit.  The State should do everything possible to ensure that the family unit has the support and encouragement to overcome the problems being experienced at present, especially the unemployment problem. People are caught in poverty traps and many of those who are anxious to work realise that it is not worth their while. I accept what Deputy Bell said in that exploitation is rife.  Considering that 90 or 100 people apply for a £40 a week job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am doing.  I am talking about the adequacy of the scheme in relation to its rates.  The family unit is under pressure at present and the so-called improvements which have been announced are insufficient to deal with the challenges facing the family.  Instead of bringing about these superficial changes in the scheme I would ask the Minister to ensure that the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour work together to bring about real support for the family unit.  The Minister has announced improvements in the rate of family income supplement while at the same time other Government Departments are eroding the viability of the family.  An example is the abolition of the Teamwork schemes in Cork city.  In recent days family support projects have been axed by the Department of Labour while on the other hand the Department of Social Welfare are announcing increases to supposedly support the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of organisations dealing with the marginalised have been abolished. I would ask the Minister to do more than just come into the House and give a sop to the family unit.  A co-ordinated approach should be taken by the relevant Departments in dealing with family support.  As I have said, a whole range of voluntary groups, family support groups and groups dealing with young unemployed people have been axed, with the loss of 200 jobs.  How many families will be affected as a result and what comfort will the increases announced in this Bill be to these families?  I would ask that a more co-ordinated approach be taken to this matter.  This Minister has imagination and has knowledge of the realities of life.  I would ask him to apply himself to resolving some of the basic problems not just by offering people a specific amount of money per week or per month but by working in a co-ordinated way <Col N="1695" /> with State agencies and other Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening when the Minister was concluding Second Stage he mentioned that one of his aims in his new job is to come to grips with the carer's allowance.  I suggest that the family income supplement should also be seriously considered.  It is a crying shame that while £14 million or £15 million per annum is allocated for this scheme there is never a full take-up of the scheme. As the Deputy Byrne has said, only £9 million of the total amount is taken up. There are many families with only one breadwinner and these families have to stretch the income to make ends meet. Yet many of them do not apply for the family income supplement.  I accept that the problem is not one of advertising or promotion.  I give full credit to the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, for whom I had very high regard as Minister for Social Welfare, who made great efforts to advertise the family income supplement scheme and to ensure that people are aware of it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the scheme is too complex.  At one stage I published a newsletter on benefits such as this for an area where I knew there was need for it.  When I sat down and tried to figure out the scheme I realised it was very complex.  Perhaps the scheme should be revised to allocate the money in a different way.  We all accept the principle of this scheme and we certainly cannot presume from the lack of take-up that there are not people who are lowly or inadequately paid.  I think every public representative will agree that there are difficulties with this scheme and that it needs in-depth examination. Perhaps some research should be carried out as to why there is not a better take-up of the scheme or how the people concerned feel about it.</P>

A husband and wife with two children on unemployment benefit would receive £112.30.  The maximum rate to which they are entitled, including family income supplement, is £175.  Therefore, there is a big difference between the amount paid on unemployment benefit and the amount people are entitled to, taking into account family income supplement.  In fact, after close examination of the figures, one would have to say that the incentive between being unemployed and what could be received from the family income supplement is considerable and should be attractive.</P>
      <P>This morning I asked the Minister why the scheme was not working, and that is really what is being asked now.  I do not consider that it is the actual rates of family income supplement suggested here that would be the attraction.  For example, I do not think that any man with a wife and two children and earning £160 a week would suddenly give up work if he had the choice and draw the unemployment benefit.  On the other hand, why would the same man not want to draw the family income supplement?  That is the dilemma.  What is suggested in the amendment, with the change suggested by my colleague, Deputy Michael Bell, would be a great improvement and would make the scheme much more attractive. There is a need for explanation and there is also a need to make family income supplement simpler to apply for and collect. Nevertheless, with the financial pressure on people today, it is my belief that if there is money to be gained by applying for family income supplement more people will collect it.  As I have said already, a possible reason for the lack of success to date is that every increase one receives &mdash; whether through social welfare benefit or other means &mdash; first has a bite taken out of it by the local authorities and then has another bite taken out by the tax man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned before that the medical <Col N="1697" /> card scheme could be in jeopardy.  The Minister disagreed with my comments and advised the House that he had distributed leaflets telling people that if they were in receipt of family income supplement they were automatically entitled to a medical card.  That is not the case. When I spoke this morning I meant that reasons such as increases in rent and small benefits such as those relating to income tax and medical cards make it less attractive for people to give up social welfare assistance in one form to gain the benefits of another form.  I checked the position and I can tell the Minister that a person can claim for family income supplement and retain their medical card but someone in receipt of family income supplement who wants a medical card will be told they are substantially in excess of the limit of eligibility for a medical card.  For the Eastern Health Board area the limit of eligibility for a medical card for a husband, wife and one child is £125.50.  The same family in receipt of family income supplement would get £155 a week, which does exceed the eligibility unit for a medical card.  That is one factor contributing to the lack of success of the family income supplement scheme. I hope that changes will be made and that health boards will be told that from now on a family in receipt of family income supplement is automatically entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to the debate on the family income supplement scheme.  Based on my own experience as a TD in Wexford, I have to agree with the point raised by Deputy Kavanagh about medical cards.  At the moment all health boards take into consideration the amount received by a family under the family income supplement scheme when deciding whether or not someone is entitled to a medical card, and that is one of the most significant factors inhibiting the success of the family income supplement scheme.  I have here a form giving the rates of family income supplement.  I am not sure whether the form is up to date, but the rates given are not accurate and they are <Col N="1698" /> extremely complicated.  The form says: &ldquo;at £112 if you have one child you are entitled to the family income supplement scheme&rdquo;.  What is that entitlement?  The entitlement amounts to a benefit of about £7 or £8 per week.  I have just seen a person on £120 a week gross who has three children and who under last year's scheme was entitled to about £23.  The family income supplement scheme is of very little benefit to that person when one considers that he will automatically lose his medical card.  If he had to attend a doctor he would be faced with a bill for £10 to start with and then another bill for £10 when he went down to the chemist. That is the way people look on the scheme and that is why it has not been very successful.  If the scheme were properly operated it could be very beneficial. Many low-paid workers would be able to stay in work if in receipt of a reasonable sum in family income supplement.</P>
      <P>Another question to be asked is how much money can be received each week. Family income supplement is usually 60 per cent of the difference between the weekly family income and the income limit for the family's size.  That system is very complicated and is difficult to explain.  I ask the Minister to take up this issue with the senior officials of his Department and to try to make the system a little simpler.  When taking into account the circumstances of low-paid workers, the 60 per cent level adds up to a very small sum.  That is the reason that the scheme costs the State only £9 million. People say to themselves and to their employers that it is not worth their while to bother with the scheme.</P>
      <P>I lend my voice to the comments made by our party spokesman, Deputy Paul Connaughton, and those made by other speakers in the debate that the family income supplement scheme is very useful.  It was introduced, after much pressure, by the Fine Gael Coalition Government from 1982 to 1986.  If the scheme is to be effective, it has to change.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Deputy Byrne, I have to point out to the House, while not wanting to erode whatever fading embers of popularity the Chair might have, that we are discussing an amendment moved by Deputy Paul Connaughton that would exhort the Minister, in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, to make information about the scheme available with each P60 form.  We are not discussing the merits of the scheme.  A second amendment is being discussed in concert with that amendment, which again requires that the Minister, from whatever resources he has, makes information available.  They are the two amendments before the House.  The section is not before the House.  Deputies cannot jump from speaking to the amendments to speak to the section and then go back to the amendments.  We should first discuss the two amendments and then, having dealt with the amendments, we can proceed to discuss the section.  The debate is extraordinarily disorganised and Deputies will not get the best out of the discussion on the amendments before us. I appeal to Deputies, in making contributions, to address themselves to what is formally before the House, two amendments which refer to the advertising of the virtues of the scheme.  In respect of the second amendment, there could also be discussion on the need for information to explain why people did not qualify. That is what should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and that is precisely the matter I intend to address.  I intend to support both amendments.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is very important that he provide information to applicants for and recipients of social welfare benefits.  Those people should receive information on the full range of benefits to which they are entitled. Unsuccessful applicants should be informed of the reasons for refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often a wide range of people, from the elderly to the young, approach public representatives in this regard and ask: can you tell me what I am entitled <Col N="1700" /> to?  It is not so easy to answer because one must engage in considerable investigation. But when an applicant has been unsuccessful it would seem only logical that the full range of benefits to which that person might otherwise have been entitled be listed for their information.</P>
    <P>I have taken a quick look at the report of the Commission on Social Welfare. Perhaps the Minister would inform us whether at any stage he considered implementing their recommendation concerning the family income supplement. While they recognise that the family income supplement is targeted at low paid workers and were concerned at its low take-up, they went on to argue that if its conditions were modified and the rates of payment increased this might lead to a greater take-up.  They contend that could be achieved by using net rather than gross wages for determining eligibility or increasing the ceiling.  Has the Minister considered that suggestion &mdash; using the net as against the gross figure &mdash; because very often there is a substantial difference between that deemed to be net and the actual gross earnings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the amendments.  When we deal with section 6 I will reply to the various interesting points many Members have made in relation to the family income supplement.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 21, I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners do issue an information leaflet with certificates of tax-free allowances and so on showing the income limits for eligibility for family income supplement in respect of various family sizes and so on and advising potential claimants to contact the Department of Social Welfare. That is the document the Revenue Commissioners have been sending out for the past couple of years; certainly it is also being issued this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the reason Deputy Connaughton tabled these amendments was to highlight the range of benefits appertaining to the family income supplement. Another reason may have been to allow a discussion on the overall question of <Col N="1701" /> the family income supplement.  But legislation would not be needed to give effect to the provisions of amendment No. 21 or amendment No. 26.  Therefore, I would have to oppose them since they are not really proper to a Social Welfare Bill. The provision of the type of information service sought could be done in co-operation with other Departments, by way of regulation or good administration. Indeed I might add that the Department have provided quite a good information service in recent years.  Nonetheless, I take the point that people may be confused about some benefits.  Here the regionalisation of Department of Social Welfare offices nationwide, the so-called one-stop-shops, should facilitate people in gaining easier access to the whole range of benefits and not merely those provided by the Department of Social Welfare.  For example, FÁS schemes are becoming nearly as plentiful as Department of Social Welfare schemes, almost warranting another information service.</P>
    <P>I will be opposing these two amendments. I shall speak generally about the family income supplement when we come to deal with the section proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot disagree with what the Minister has said in regard to the amendments except to say that I am not at all sure we could not discuss formally in this Chamber the desirability of providing the type of information I contend is needed by social welfare recipients and to which they are entitled. I will give the Minister two or three examples of what I have in mind.  There have been major changes effected in the Department over the past couple of years.  Some of the Minister's officials present with him today will remember the famous change in criteria for eligibility for small farmer's dole.  On that famous occasion, in 1984 or 1985, the position was more like a civil war than anything else; but farmers were entitled to know exactly on what basis they were assessed.  In fact that information is now issued to them by the Department &mdash; in other words, their assessment on their entire income and expenditure.  They are <Col N="1702" /> entitled to that information from the Minister's Department and they receive it.</P>
      <P>I question why all other recipients do not receive the same information.  For example, why would old age pensioners not be entitled to the same information? There is a huge difference between writing to inform an applicant that they have been unsuccessful in their application because they may have exceeded the guidelines, or whatever may be the terminology used, and the alternative proposed in my amendment, which is that they be informed exactly why they were turned down.  I consider that it makes a great deal of sense.  Like other Members, I see many people each weekend at my clinic when the frequent story is: I have been refused my pension but I do not know why.  Such applicants are informed by the Minister's Department that they have exceeded the guidelines.  I want to know what were the guidelines and why they exceeded them.</P>
      <P>Lest this occasion pass without my referring to it, I should say that generally the Department of Social Welfare provide a good service.  As a TD I have to say I get a good service.  I may not always get the answers I seek, but that is another story altogether.  There are greater problems than that along the line, but I am afraid the Leas Cheann-Comhairle would not allow me stray into that area.</P>
      <P>Then there is the reverse side of the coin.  I should have thought that clear guidelines would be issued to applicants when they submit their applications.  By that I mean that it should be clearly spelled out what are the guidelines applicants must adhere to or comply with on application. That is not quite the case now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to make the point that they have an opportunity to appeal.  Of course, they have the right to appeal; that is only correct. In this technological age there should be no problem whatsoever in setting up a computer programme &mdash; this proposal would relate more particularly to unsuccessful applicants &mdash; to ensure that, accompanying the departmental letter informing an applicant that they have <Col N="1703" /> been unsuccessful, they should be given the specific reasons their application was turned down.  As far as I am aware, most officials in the Department of Social Welfare agree with this proposal.  I do not know whether it amounts to an administrative problem for the Department. Certainly the precedent has been well and truly forged over the years, having been highlighted in the mid-eighties. Indeed I was somewhat taken aback to hear the Minister say he will be opposing these amendments.  I thought he might have advanced some administrative reasons for not accepting them.  If it has to be done by way of ministerial regulation, I say to the Minister do so.  I do not care whether it is done as a result of this or any other amendment so long as applicants unsuccessful in their quest for social welfare benefits know the specific reasons their applications have been turned down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to amendment No. 26, which involves two issues in that one half of the amendment relates to the provision of information to claimants generally.  The information service of the Department of Social Welfare is the focal point from which all these services are operated. Over the past few years, Deputies will have noted the presence of this information service at major public events such as the Spring Show.  The Aertel service on television also gives information to social welfare recipients.  We have made considerable progress in this area. I should like to avail of this opportunity to thank the people in that section of the Department of Social Welfare for their valuable work.  These are the people with whom ordinary recipients get in touch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton's amendment proposes that the detailed reasons for the refusal of a claim should be given to an unsuccessful applicant.  I agree that this is what should be done.  Over the past few years and, in particular, over the past few months, deciding officers have started to give claimants their reasons for refusing a claim.  It is intended that the <Col N="1704" /> Department of Social Welfare should, if at all possible, give their reasons for refusing claims.  I do not know what the views of previous Ministers for Social Welfare were on this issue but I imagine they were similar to mine.</P>
    <P>We live in a society in which people want to be given an explanation why certain things are done.  We have made great play of the fact that this is an open and transparent Government.  If this is the case, surely people should be told by a major State institution such as the Department of Social Welfare why their claims are being refused.  We are working towards this end.</P>
    <P>In certain parts of the country deciding officers are already telling people why they are being refused unemployment assistance.  While this will create further administrative burdens there is nothing to stop us from doing this.  In view of the limited resources available to the Department it is not possible to tie up too many staff in this area.  Nevertheless, this principle has been established.  I am not a lawyer but I am sure that if a case went to court the court would find that people would have to be told why their claim was being refused.</P>
    <P>Deciding officers are required to advise claimants why their claims are refused. As I said, my Department are making some progress in this area.  Consideration is being given to the appointment of a chief deciding officer with responsibility for reviewing standards and methods, including the type of notifications issued to claimants and dealing with other practical problems affecting the speedy processing of claims.  Our main objective is to try to reduce the incidence of appeals and ensure greater transparency in the system.  This would get over the problems about which the Deputy is rightly concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not opposed to the principle of the Deputy's amendments but it would not be appropriate to include either of them in the Social Welfare Bill.  The Bill is complicated enough from a technical point of view without including a provision which would make it more technical. This is the only reason I am <Col N="1705" /> opposed to the Deputy's amendment.  As I said, I support the principle of the amendment and we are making some progress along this road.  We live in a society where people want to know why certain things are done.  I do not think it would be appropriate to include such an amendment in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with what the Minister has said.  I thought that the provision of information in regard to the entire range of social welfare benefits would be of the utmost importance.  I do not understand why a provision which would require deciding officers to give the precise reasons for refusing a claim cannot be part and parcel of social welfare legislation.  Unfortunately, I will have to put my amendment to a vote.</P>

      <P>I believe the problem could be resolved very simply.  This is the time of year when PAYE certificates are issued but I know of three people who, this week, received PAYE certificates but did not receive the information in question.  Obviously the Revenue Commissioners have not got around to circulating the information with all the certificates.  These certificates can be taken as application forms for a PAYE exemption limit but they cannot be taken as application forms for family income supplement.  It would appear though, that the second part of the certificate is an application form for a family income supplement but it does not say so.  An application form for a family income supplement could be attached to the PAYE certificate thereby resolving the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Department of Labour and not the Department of Social Welfare should be responsible for the family income supplement scheme.  Family income supplement is of benefit to employers as opposed to recipients.  The great problem in relation to the family income supplement is that it has encouraged low wages in certain areas which are not covered by trade union negotiations, the <Col N="1707" /><i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the joint labour committees which deal with the clothing trade, the agricultural sector and the restaurant and hotel trade in which very low wages are paid.  We could all give examples of other areas where wages are very depressed because people do not have the benefits of the trade union movement to press their case for better conditions and rates of pay.</P>
      <P>Money paid under this heading should attract Social Fund money because I do not see any difference between the FÁS schemes and the Department of Labour schemes.  Perhaps the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, could exploit the Social Fund to include this scheme.  It would mean that FÁS offices would be used to administer the scheme and people could also go there to find out their entitlements. Perhaps there would be greater pressure, if money was coming from the Social Fund, to see that this scheme would be a far greater success.</P>

      <P>I totally support the comments of Deputy Kavanagh.  I may be repeating myself but the Department of Labour and the Department of Social Welfare must synchronise their attitude towards the family, parents and young people.  This week the Minister announced improvements in the family income supplement and, at the same time, the other arm of the Government who are supposed to support the family &mdash; the Department of Labour &mdash; axed essential Teamwork schemes which are a lifeline for voluntary groups working with the unemployed, single parents and young people.  When we have finished debating the Bill this evening the Minister for Social Welfare should meet the Minister for Labour to extend a lifeline to the many voluntary groups dealing with the marginalised in society; they deal with these people in family support centres throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is no point in giving a family a small increase and then cutting the lifeline to the other members <Col N="1708" /> of the family, including young people, who are in danger of becoming marginalised. They are already demoralised and the Minister must not marginalise them.</P>

      <P>When amendments Nos. 21 and 26 were being debated Deputies ranged over section 6 so I will take this opportunity to reply to the points raised by them.  However, before I reply to those points I should like to reply to a question raised by Deputy Kavanagh. He asked whether people in receipt of family income supplement would lose their medical cards.  Last year, we agreed with the Department of Health that it would not be so, the payment of family income supplement will not affect entitlement to a medical card.  The Department of Social Welfare issued a document in this regard and there was agreement between them and the Department of Health.  However &mdash; only cartain types of civil servants could think like this &mdash; if you have a medical card and are also in receipt of family income supplement you will not lose the medical card but if you apply for a medical card and you are in receipt of family income supplement you will not get it.  Such convoluted thinking is hard to understand but I will certainly take this matter up with the Department of Health because it is mindboggling to put such an interpretation on it.  Maybe I have a very small mind but it is certainly beyond my understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

      <P>My Department entered into negotiations with the Department of Health some time ago in regard to this matter and that is why we were allowed to refer to this in the explanatory note about the family income supplement.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, my officials will take it up with the Department of Health to see if it can be changed because it is ridiculous at present.  Section 6 provides that the weekly income limits below which families can qualify for family income suplements will be increased by £15 per week for families with up to five children and the limits for families of more than five children will be increased by £18 per week.  Many interesting points were raised about the family income supplement and it was asked why the uptake was not higher.  Various studies have been done in this regard.  Deputies also referred to the poverty trap, to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>The ERSI conducted research into the level of non-take-up of benefits, not just family income supplement.  In the report entitled &ldquo;Poverty, Income and Social Welfare in Ireland&rdquo;, it is estimated that 3.1 per cent of people on social welfare appear to be entitled to some form of payment which they do not claim.  The payments they were investigating included unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and the family income supplement.  However, I was advised to treat the report with caution because some of the people which the survey identified as eligible for payments may not in fact be eligible because of different approaches to assessing means.</P>
      <P>A private consultant also did a report on the uptake of the family income supplement and he said that a maximum of 20,000 families would be eligible.  Allowing for take-up rates experienced internationally in relation to this kind of scheme, the consultant estimated that the maximum achievable number of clients was unlikely to be more than 12,000 families. As Deputies pointed out, 6,568 families benefited from the scheme in 1990 and we estimate that 7,200 families will benefit this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme is now uncomplicated, in spite of the best efforts of officialdom.  It <Col N="1710" /> is now so simple that even I can understand it.  It is composed of 60 per cent of the difference between wages and the income threshold.  There were many complications in the scheme over the years but I have a list of all the changes made since July 1985 which, as I said, simplified it.  It is also calculated on gross wages, I will refer to that later.  We would like the uptake to be higher, we are not even at the level to which the independent consultant referred.  Nobody seems to know why this is, because it is a particularly good scheme.</P>
    <P>In winding up Second Stage last night, I said that the family income supplement was an example of various things wrong with the arms of State and the way they contradict one another.  We must have a scheme which will bring people on low wages up to an acceptable level.  In the industries Deputy Bell dealt with in his former role that indeed may have been the case.  In changing the thresholds we have to guard against ending up with a scenario which would not be in line with the principle behind our thinking.</P>
    <P>We have made a great many improvements over the years.  A great many anomalies in the system have been removed and we have simplified the system.  It is getting easier to understand the system.  I do not know why the take-up level for the family income supplement is so low.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Kavanagh's query on the medical card, I said I would take up the matter with the Department of Health later.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the poverty trap and the disincentives to work, which is a topic close to my heart.  Deputy Allen pointed out that one arm of the State is working against the other.  What has struck me since I became Minister for Social Welfare is the myriad levels of meanstesting for State support &mdash; social welfare, health, education and local authority. The same people have to deal with a variety of different agencies.  It is quite possible that one arm of the State does not know what another Government Department are doing.  We will have to get a grip on the State support system <Col N="1711" /> because I can see it going totally out of control.</P>
    <P>A possible solution is the unique identification of the RSI number, and we are making progress on this in the Department.  Surely it must be possible to input a person's RSI number and find out what State support the person is receiving, to find out that X has been unemployed for the past five years, that he was sick for part of that period and that he undertook a FÁS course.  At present you would need a lorry to collect the files on one person.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  I hope to have this implemented as soon as possible in the Department.  At present we have responsibility for the RSI number, but it could become one of the important tools in ensuring that State agencies co-operate with each other.  It would eliminate the anomalies in the system at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of points in the course of the debate on the family income supplement.  One may have varying views on whether people are abusing the system.  Deputy Connaughton said that a great many people say &ldquo;It is not worth my while going to work.  I would be better off on social welfare&rdquo;.  We have to accept that a great many people say this, but generally they still keep on working.  However, since I came to the Department I have found people who are on the margins, who may be able to get a job and go back to work, even part-time employment, but who are afraid that they will lose the medical card, that perhaps their differential rent would be increased and that they would lose a great <Col N="1712" /> many other benefits as well.  Therefore they are not inclined to go back into the system.  If we are to tackle the employment problem we will have to take a radical new initiative on subsidiary benefits. This is a matter that will have to be considered by the Government and not just by the Minister for Social Welfare.  I hope that we would come up with some ideas at Cabinet because these traps and anomalies make people afraid to jump out of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton asked how much it would cost to extend family income supplement to the self-employed and to the farmers.  We have estimated that it would cost in the region of £10 million to extend the scheme to the farmers and our guesstimate is that it would cost £25 million to extend it to the other self-employed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Equal Status Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the five minutes at my disposal I would like to mention a couple of points which are at the centre of the Labour Party's thinking in proposing this legislation.  The first point that I want to make is that it needs to be put on the record that the equality which exists in the country was won by the women's movement, by those who spoke on their behalf and by those who assisted their cause.  Little, perhaps nothing, was conceded without a struggle.  It is important that women recognise in today's conditions that very often the equality they enjoy was hard won after a struggle by those who have gone before them.</P>
      <P>I recall in the seventies an atmosphere in which people like myself spoke in favour of equality issues. However, many people did not feel free to join in because they felt that to manage within a male role model was the best that could be achieved at that time.  There was an encompassing atmosphere of patriarchy. We should be very clear then that patriarchal society is a myth which is both crippling and demeaning and damages people of both sexes.  If there have been achievements since the first equality legislation of the seventies they may lie in the manner in which women have been able to undo some of the inequalities directed at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly there has been insufficient reflection on the price which has been paid by males in particular as a consequence of patriarchal society.  The intention of this Bill is to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origins, <Col N="1716" /> including membership of the travelling community, but it goes beyond gender discrimination and discrimination in the workplace.  This is correct because while I spoke about patriarchy a few moments ago it is important to realise that at the core of this legislation is a perception that people have rights and that those rights are rooted in a fundamental humaness of the person.  Therefore, we have to extend our opposition to discrimination across all the categories mentioned.</P>
    <P>The second object of the Bill stretches it beyond the workplace because it is not only in the economics sphere that discrimination takes place.  It extends into the areas of recreation, services, entertainment, accommodation and transport.  In a way it is a great limitation to think that just because we have eliminated discrimination in the workplace that somehow or other we have reached the end of our agenda in relation to equality. It is a moral question.  At the end of the day, as one looks at the other person, their social status, living accommodation, colour, gender and, correctly, sexual orientation should not be used as the basis for a perceived difference to exclude them.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between discrimination and exclusion which offends against rights and diversity which is natural. There is no assumption on the part of the Labour Party of sameness and similarity; what there is is a recognition that it is important that differences should be recognised as being just that and not used as the basis for discrimination in relation to the three categories specified &mdash; direct, indirect or victimisation.</P>
    <P>In education, for example, so many teachers are female; yet they are not allowed to be promoted to the higher ranks.  The same applies in the public service but, more importantly, there is a communicative order in relation to school text books, television, advertising and so forth.  We need legislation like this to take a leap forward of a moral kind so that we recognise the fundamental rights that people have to be free of discrimination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> Let me conclude by disposing of three arguments in a few sentences.  In saying that we should wait for the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women we are addressing only part of the proposed legislation as it speaks of discrimination beyond that matter.  Furthermore, we are only asking the House to support the Bill on Second Stage. Second, some other speaker mentioned that perhaps legislation is not necessary but moral suasion is not enough when it comes to the issue of rights; we need legislative affirmation.  Third, the headline for those entering the next century as citizens is that they should not carry with them the psychic damage that we have done to ourselves by being free to discriminate.  Therefore, I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Right's, I have mixed feelings as I stand to speak on the Bill.  Having said that, the Labour Party deserve credit for raising this issue once again; it is an issue which has crawled along at a snail's pace throughout the European Community during the past 20 years.  I am afraid, however, that I cannot support the Bill for the following reasons.</P>
      <P>At a time when the need to create sustainable employment is at the very top of our list of priorities it is important that we do everything in our power to encourage employers to take on as many people as possible.  At this time we should not tolerate blatant discrimination or exploitation of workers or potential workers on the grounds of sex or for any other reasons listed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is encountered all over the world, not just in Ireland.  Like many other evils in our society, I doubt if it can ever be eradicated simply by enacting legislation.  We are often criticised for the number of laws which we cannot enforce. As far as equal status is concerned, this Bill with all its good intentions is not the answer.  A Bill like this, which seeks to cover too wide an area and which <Col N="1718" /> attempts to do too much, could have the exact opposite effect to what is intended by threatening the effective operation of longstanding procedures already in place.  The Bill overemphasises the assumption that it is possible to effectively eliminate discrimination by introducing a wide range of regulations and by creating a system of constant monitoring which would discourage many a fair-minded businessman from employing anyone.  The Minister in his speech referred to this Bill as being cumbersome, bureaucratic, unimplementable and unnecessary, I entirely agree with those sentiments.  I would go further than that.  I would call this Bill a paradise for lawyers and a hell for women.</P>
    <P>Discrimination takes many forms but the most widespread has been the manner in which women have been treated in the workforce from the time when men in many parts of the world regarded women as being inferior to men intellectually, whose sole role as regards work was confined to the rearing of children and caring for husbands and a variety of menial tasks usually in the domestic area.  It is hard to believe that it is only a short time ago since the suffragettes won for women the basic right to vote.  We all want equal status for women but we have not yet decided what equal is.  What can be defined as equal work?  The work being done by women is generally undervalued.  We must describe what is actually equal.  Is the work done in the textile industry not of equal value to work being done in the mines?  What would we do without the textile industry? The Labour Party with this Bill have preempted the EC who are attempting to define equal tasks and a memorandum on that is to be published in September. We should await that memorandum.</P>
    <P>Progress has been slow in many areas of life, but in many areas it has been significant.  In this country the greatest single forward leap in the cause of women came from the Fianna Fáil Government in the early sixties with the radical reform of education.  In the intervening years many thousands of women have joined <Col N="1719" /> their male counterparts in virtually every branch of third level education.  Not enough have joined them, but from a situation where girls at secondary school had been traditionally confined to a narrow range of options, which included domestic economy, nursing and teaching, and were not regarded as having the skills necessary to study such subjects as honours maths or science, they are now competing and frequently outperforming the boys at every level.  This has continued at third level and women are graduating at the top of their classes in virtually every field.  The areas in which women are competing include the previously male dominated professions of veterinary medicine and engineering.  At the very least there is now equal opportunity of access at these levels of education. Whether or not employers treat graduates equally is another question and it would often depend on the personal prejudices of personnel managers, who may or may not regard women as having a risk factor in potential performance, purely because of their sex.</P>
    <P>Women have proved that from an intellectual point of view they can match anything a man can offer.  In the workplace they can match men in virtually every area except perhaps in the jobs where more physical strength is required. It is disappointing therefore that in such areas as financial services the management structures are still dominated by men, so much so that it is usually an item of news when a woman is promoted to a senior position.  Even then we hear the unworthy male comment that she must be a tough lady, the implication being that she must be endowed with male characteristics.  This is a type of discrimination which stems from a very human problem.  It does not arise necessarily from an anti-woman attitude but from a genuine feeling that in particular cases, especially where men have exclusively held a post in the past, women are simply not properly endowed by nature with the skills required.</P>
    <P>Even though a particular job is offered to a male candidate with equivalent <Col N="1720" /> qualifications, the unsuccessful female may quite justifiably feel that she has been discriminated against simply because of her sex.  This may well be true but how can it be proved, no matter what legislation is in place?  It is a slow process but gradually this kind of bias is disappearing and we must continue to educate employers on the futility of adopting these ridiculous attitudes.  Women are now distinguishing themselves in every profession.  I do not think one would feel any less safe in an Aer Lingus plane nowadays because the pilot happened to be a woman.</P>
    <P>Being a member of the Committee on Women's Rights, I am well aware of the developments which have taken place in recent years and especially from the publication of the report by the Commission on the Status of Women in 1972.  Since that time several pieces of legislation have been enacted.  These include the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Pensions Act, 1990, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  All of these in one way or another were designed to ensure fair play and to deal with various forms of discrimination.  The former Minister for Labour, Deputy Bertie Ahern, further demonstrated his commitment in this area with his discussion document in 1987, from which several items have been lifted and included in the present Bill introduced by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that, in the light of experience, shortcomings have been demonstrated, notably in the 1974 and 1977 Acts &mdash; good as the intention of these two Bills were at the time, I felt that they led to further discrimination, particularly in the sphere of segregation.  The Minister proposes to come back to this House at a later date with a comprehensive Bill which will bring all these things up to date in a way in which the public at large can clearly understand.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Higgins said, the final draft of the Bill will await the <Col N="1721" /> report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which is expected in the near future, and will await the publication of the EC memorandum on the definition of equal work.  The interim report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women has already played a significant part in Government thinking in drawing up the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The setting up of this commission in 1990 was a significant development.  They were given a wide-ranging mandate to make recommendations to the Government on the means by which women would be able to participate on equal terms and conditions in the economic, social, political and cultural life or our society.  Their terms of reference included the review of the implications of the recommendations of the report of the First Commission in 1972.  Also included are recommendations on specific measures which can be taken to ensure that their objectives are achieved.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to equal status not only in the sphere of sex.  Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan referred to the exploitation of workers who are desperate for a job at any price.  I agree that this is also a form of discrimination which is mainly directed at young single people emerging from the educational system onto the labour market with a wide range of skills.  These are our brightest and best young people, the ones who in recent years left the country in despair when they realised that their talents were being grossly undervalued by unscrupulous employers.  I have nothing but contempt for the employer who uses high unemployment as a means of making huge profits at the expense of their workers.  If a worker in those circumstances dares to assert his rights he is usually told that if he does not like it there are plenty of people waiting for the job.  The person is not dismissed but is goaded into resigning. Consequently he does not qualify for social welfare and the employer cannot be charged with unfair dismissal.  I wish this House could deal with the situation where starvation wages and poor conditions are the norm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> The other matter that I will mention finally is the discrimination against disabled people in the matter of access to buildings and appropriate facilities to enable them to use the services provided in the building, be it a bank, building society, hotel or whatever.  It is true that the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, brought in building regulations which are due to come into force in June of this year.  These regulations deal comprehensively with the matters to which I have referred. However, they only deal with new buildings. Meanwhile we are left with many buildings which leave a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>Recently a reporter in my home town accompanied two disabled people in wheelchairs on a tour of public buildings. The results in some cases were appalling and the worst offenders were some of the main banks where the person in the wheelchair could not reach the cash-dispensing machines, could not get access to the building and, if he was carried in, could not even reach a counter where he could transact his business in private. Surely it should be possible for such wealthy institutions to adapt their buildings immediately without having to be forced by law.</P>
    <P>On two occasions I have had the privilege of being invited to European councils for women and I have found them most enlightening.  At the first meeting there were 211 in attendance and there were four men.  At the most recent meeting which was attended by 112 people there were five men.  Most of those attending were parliamentarians from member states of the EC, not members of ordinary women's organisations.  Women should encourage more men to take part in these enlightening meetings.  Women tend to talk to each other instead of enlightening more men.  There are men who are quite willing to listen and quite prepared to help.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister's plans to deal comprehensively with the problems of discrimination will bear fruit.  I urge the House to reject this Bill for the reasons I have given.  It would be a paradise for lawyers and a hell for women <Col N="1723" /> on account of its complexities.  I am sure that the Minister will take account of some useful ideas in the Bill when bringing forward his own legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Wallace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the issues addressed by this Bill are fundamental in terms of asserting the basic values under which we operate as a society.  Frederick Douglas once said that &ldquo;All anybody has a right to expect, ask, give or receive in this world, is fair play&rdquo;.  We must all accept that we live in a far from perfect world, one in which fair and equal opportunity is not offered to all and it is only right that we should concern ourselves with this issue.  I believe that arbitrary discrimination, under any guise, must be firmly established in the laws and institutions of the State as being simply unacceptable, and I further believe that it falls on us as legislators to make sure that we do all we can to eliminate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very much in favour of equality at all levels and therefore I support the underlying thrust of the Bill, which I have considered in great detail.  However, it is lacking in some practical respects.  It attempts to undertake too much in one measure and thereby deals superficially with complex areas.  This is a concern for those of us who want to see appropriate legislation implemented.  The Bill's isolation from any proposal for a comprehensive scheme of official action means that, were it to become law, it would inevitably fail to have any real effect.  The importance of attitudinal change must be emphasised, and often we depend on legislation to produce such change.  Legislation must have a real effect when implemented.  The commitment by the Government to consolidate and amend existing employment <Col N="1724" /> law will deal with areas where immediate action is desirable.</P>
    <P>My main concern relates to the timing of the Bill.  This year is particularly important for women because the Commission on the Status of Women are due to produce their report in July.  We have waited 20 years for this report and this second commission have put considerable work into it.  It is important to consider the recommendations they will make and then to proceed with legislation. The terms of reference call on the commission to set out the administrative and legislative means by which women will be able to participate on equal terms in economic, social, political and cultural life.  I have no doubt that the commission will produce a comprehensive blueprint for official action over the next 20 years. We have a commitment from the Government in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that they will use the Commission's report as the basis for introducing necessary legislation.  It is of great relevance that the commission's recommendations will be taken on board and included in legislation.  In addition, employers and trade unions have accepted their role in terms of developing positive action programmes.  This comprehensive, consensual approach is the best means of achieving equality for women in the practical sense.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to make unlawful various kinds of discrimination on nine stated grounds.  These grounds are: sex, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, age, handicap, religion, race or membership of the travelling community. Of these, the first three, sex, marital status or parental status can be generally referred to as relating to the concerns of women.  The remaining areas are definitely important areas which merit the consideration of the Oireachtas.  However, I believe that they are dealt with only superficially in this Bill.  I do not believe that a &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; measure can realistically hope to achieve more than giving us a false sense of achievement.  These separate areas merit separate and detailed consideration in order that we can consider fully the specific <Col N="1725" /> problems encountered by each group and legislate accordingly.  I should like to see specific legislation relating to equality in line with the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.</P>
    <P>Legislation such as this will have little or no real effect if it is introduced in isolation from a comprehensive scheme of official action.  I would draw a comparison with the position in relation to the handicapped.  We are anxious to eliminate discrimination in this area.  Before giving a commitment to the handicapped that they will have full, fair and equal access to employment services and to the range of activities that the able bodied take for granted we must first recognise that considerable financial and administrative resources are required.  It must be recognised that before we can oblige someone to comply with an objective they must first have the opportunity and the ability to do so.  Therefore, we must do more than simply bring in legislation.</P>
    <P>The need for comprehensive official action to enable people to comply with an objective has a general application to the Bill in terms of what is deemed, usefully and quite correctly, as &ldquo;indirect discrimination&rdquo;.  In the Bill indirect discrimination has been enumerated in two principal ways.  I have absolutely no difficulty with the first of these which relates to instances where an employer imposes a requirement which is not properly an essential requirement in relation to a job. However, I believe that a problem arises with the second area concerning requirements in respect of which the proportion of a specific group eligible to apply for a job is substantially higher.</P>
    <P>Women, in particular, face exclusion from certain professions on the basis of unequal availability of training.  I believe that this is more the problem of Government than it is the problem of individual employers.  If it is ensured that employers are not able to introduce unnecessary and discriminatory requirements for employment, it must then fall to us to make sure that all groups are given a fair and equal opportunity to fulfil reasonable prerequisites for employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> I would like to refer specifically to the positive action programme operated by FÁS in the past three years.  In this case the agency showed that, in the area of employment discrimination against women, concerted action can have a definite effect.  All of us are aware that as a result of that positive action programme women now account for 40 per cent of FÁS trainees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to apprentices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many problems in this area, one of which relates to apprentices.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights have expressed concern about this matter.  It is important for us to recognise the areas where positive action has proved successful.  A programme was set up by FÁS and the Employment Equality Agency to encourage women to enter the electronics industry at levels other than operatives, and there has been some success in that area also.  It is important that women have an opportunity of access to such an area which has great potential for employment in future.  That programme was very helpful in encouraging women to enter that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, the IDA have operated a Women in Business scheme which sought to actively encourage women to start businesses.  While drawing attention to the positive aspects of this scheme I would not like people to think that everything is marvellous, because that is not the case.  We recognise the positive aspects of work carried out by FAS and the IDA, but we are simply giving examples to show that positive action can be successful in encouraging women to participate in the workplace and in training. The Women in Business scheme operated by the IDA led to an increase in the proportion of start-up grants given to women from only 3 per cent in 1985 to 20 per cent in 1989.  Even though grants were allocated by the IDA to people to set up their own businesses it was established that only 3 per cent of the grant aid was given to women applicants. <Col N="1727" /> Such schemes are needed to help those who are discriminated against before we can fulfil any promise of equality for the groups addressed in the Bill.  I would like to see a broadening of the remit of the Employment Equality Agency.  As we all know, the agency deal only in the area of equality in the workplace.  I am concerned that their remit be broadened to cover other areas of equality.</P>
    <P>There are specific shortcomings in current equality law which have been exposed and which require immediate attention.  I would like to welcome the commitment of the Minister for Labour, given to the House a fortnight ago, to bring forward as soon as possible amendments to the 1974 and 1977 Acts in fulfilment of promises in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> In addition, his promise to consolidate current equality law is very much welcomed. These positive aspects must be acknowledged. I believe that the more accessible and understandable the law is, the better is the chance of the law being effective.</P>
    <P>Overall, I believe that this Bill raises some very important and serious issues. However, I believe that it is inherently flawed in the way it seeks to deal with these issues.  It is a measure which attempts to deal with so much that it inevitably ends up dealing with nothing in detail.  In addition, its balance is wrong in that it establishes objectives without supplying the means by which underlying inequality can be dealt with.  That is the area about which I am most concerned. It is an unfortunate reality that there is all too often a gap between rhetoric and concrete action in bringing about equality.</P>
    <P>A point was raised earlier by Deputy McDaid &mdash; it is one about which we should be concerned &mdash; that it is important that men attend conferences and meetings relating to women.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights found that much progress can be made in this area.  All women should be aware that there is no point in groups of women meeting and being concerned about inequality if there are no men in <Col N="1728" /> attendance.  I was disappointed to hear that at one women's conference which was held only five men were present. Hopefully that position will improve.  The Joint Committee on Women's Rights have always been conscious of the involvement of male and female members of the committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Men are in the majority in every parliament in the world but what have they done with regard to women's rights?  They do no even attend women's meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Barnes.  Considering that there is such a large proportion of men representing the people it is important that more men are involved in the whole area of women's rights and equality.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I look forward to the report of the Commission on the Status of Women and the fulfilment of the Government's promise to introduce suitable legislation and programmes arising from the recommendations of the report.  While I cannot support the passage of this Bill for the reasons I have outlined, I have no doubt that it is a useful base for more comprehensive legislation in the future.  I look forward to the introduction of this legislation as soon as the report of the commission is published.</P>

      <P>The speakers who contributed from the Government side of the House certainly came across as genuine crusaders of equality.  Yet they will vote tonight against this Bill.  If visitors to this House listening to those contributions came back at 8.30 p.m. for the vote and saw those same people voting against the Bill they would wonder whether the Labour Party had made radical changes to the Bill in the intervening hour.  The Government speakers support the philosophy and the general thrust of the Bill; they support equality but they will vote against the Bill.  The same was the case when Deputy Gay Mitchell from our party proposed a Bill to introduce the Eight Amendment to the <Col N="1729" /> Constitution.  That Bill was voted down, despite the fact that during the debate on it Members made statements of genuine and absolute support for equality.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome and support the Bill and I congratulate the Labour Party for introducing it.  As far as the women of Ireland are concerned, such legislation is long overdue.  It is appropriate, it is necessary and it is important that we here in Ireland have clear, unequivocal and unambiguous legislation underpinning the fact that women are indeed equal to men and must be so deemed under the laws of the State.</P>
      <P>For much too long women have laboured and, sadly, they continue to labour under an abundance of discriminatory attitudes, practices and even laws.  It has taken the tenacity, the valour and the obstinate determination of many women, such as my colleague here beside me, Deputy Barnes, throughout the years to reverse the blatant discrimination against women in our laws.</P>
      <P>Ireland's joining the EC gave a tremendous boost to the pursuit of equality for women.  Fortunately, the women's movement seized the opportunity presented by EC membership to push Ireland into the 20th century in relation to women's rights.  Under the watchful eye of the European Court, Irish Governments have been embarrassed and coerced into putting women on a par with men before the law.  We now urgently need to move forward, to put Ireland into the 21st century and to take the all-important step of publicly demonstrating through legislation that we as a nation unreservedly acknowledge the inherent right to equality in economic, political and social spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution, together with legislation enacted by this House, is the basis for all laws in this country.  However, viewed from a women's point of view, the Constitution is an unbalanced document. Unfortunately, whenever women do get a mention they are, by and large, relegated exclusively to the domestic sphere.  For women, no other role is readily seen.  Is it not an ironic twist that remedies for some of the injustices <Col N="1730" /> against women have been arrived at by recourse to the Constitution?  As matters stand, though, recognition of the equality of women can be won or lost by the attitude of the courts to the Constitution. Indeed, we experienced that recently. Because of that, we need legislation that clearly defines equality and is enacted to guarantee equal rights to both sexes under the law.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the Government's recital of all that they are supposed to have done to improve the lot of women, as Minister Kitt tried to demonstrate in the House last week.  It is hardly a matter of self-congratulation that the Government have set about righting injustices against half the population. The fact that we still need the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights serves to show that women do not yet fully enjoy equality in all spheres. The very existence of that committee and the lack of an Oireachtas joint committee on men's rights speaks volumes about the position of women in Irish society in 1992.</P>
    <P>One has only to take a glance around this House or the Seanad or to consider the composition of the Cabinet to see the tremendous imbalance in numbers.  One has to ask why there are so few women in either House.  The fact that there are only 13 women in the Dáil out of a total of 166 Deputies, only six women Senators out of a total of 60 and only one woman Cabinet Minister out of 15 is stark evidence that all is not well for women today.</P>
    <P>The Bill is needed urgently and it is about time that the Government came clean on the issue.  The Government must be prepared to declare their support for legislation for equality, equality that they support verbally.  When speaking on the Bill last week, the Minister of State reminded us of his contribution to Deputy Mitchell's Private Members' Bill on the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. In fact, at the time he stated, &ldquo;Let us collectively take the best proposals from the many positive issues which have been referred to during this debate&rdquo;.  I remind the Minister of State <Col N="1731" /> that to date his Government have ignored every proposal raised during that debate. They have ignored every issue, ignored every point argued and since that debate nothing has changed for women.  Unfortunately, the Government voted down Deputy Mitchell's Bill, as they will do with this Bill this evening.  Once again, all of the concern expressed in the House in the past two weeks will be left to gather dust on the Library shelves.  I believe that the Government will never respond unless pushed to do so by European legislation or embarrassed into doing it.  It is indeed sad that no initiative has ever been shown in this regard and no ambition or aspiration to improve equality has ever been demonstrated.</P>
    <P>Minister Kitt also said that he now had the honour of representing the concerns and the interests of Irish women.  I wish the Minister well in that regard. However, I believe that this Bill presents him with an opportunity to show courage and to prove his eagerness to promote equality by supporting this legislation tonight.  It is not good enough to just subscribe to the Bill's philosophy &mdash; that will not bring about any change for all those suffering under inequality today. In all the fields &mdash; social, economic and domestic &mdash; action is the way forward; legislation such as the Bill before the House tonight is the way forward.</P>
    <P>The Government are opposing the Bill because it is &ldquo;too broad&rdquo;.  They opposed the Bill introduced by Deputy Mitchell because it was &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;.  The truth is that Bills introduced by Opposition parties must be opposed by the Government, irrespective of their merits.</P>
    <P>Minister of State Kitt quoted the carer's allowance as an example of the Government's commitment to equality. He could not have chosen a worse example.  The carer's allowance is nothing short of a disgrace in its strict eligibility rules.  Fewer than one-third of all applicants for the carer's allowance are successful.  Women continue to be the carers in our society, providing support and providing 24-hour care for those who cannot look after themselves.  Their contribution <Col N="1732" /> is as yet not appreciated fully and is taken for granted.  When the carer's allowance was introduced by the Government it was advertised with so much hype and pomp that it unfairly raised the expectations of many people, people who were suddenly sent crashing back to reality when the small print was enlarged.  If the contribution of women as the carers in our society is to be recognised and acknowledged then realistic income guidelines must be introduced. Until that is done, the majority of our carers will continue to be unpaid workers in society.</P>
    <P>Discrimination in recreational areas has been highlighted by many Deputies speaking in this debate.  Discrimination such as we have witnessed in Irish golf clubs is completely and absolutely unacceptable. While the contribution of women to those associations &mdash; whether it be through fund-raising, providing meals or providing tea &mdash; was very welcome, when the issue of full membership rights for women was raised the basic lack of commitment to equality was demonstrated. I congratulate Deputy Barnes and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights for highlighting that discrimination and for ensuring that associations that supported such basic inequality got no State recognition. Unfortunately, it was shown that equality come only with the threat that money would not be provided.  It is sad that even in 1992 equality was embarrassed and coerced out of those associations and that nothing was done until the associations could not get grants or support from the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins spoke about the inequality of women in our schools.  I completely support his comments.  I taught in a school that had 40 staff members.  There were eight positions of authority in that school; a principal, a vice-principal and six grade A positions. Of the 40 staff, 26 were women yet not one woman held a position of responsibility. Yet when several of those teachers took up careers outside of teaching they gained tremendous promotion.  That is a sad feature of our present education <Col N="1733" /> system and is a bad example to our students.  We may as well admit that it must have an effect on young girls' ambitions when they see the very female teachers who educate them not deemed worthy of promotion.  I have seen very little improvement in that area.  Indeed the position in that school remains the same today.  It is no use merely talking about equality; it is about time serious steps were taken.  Rather than the Government congratulating themselves on minor advancements it is about time they devoted more of their energies to making more progress in areas in which such blatant inequality obtains.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid wondered how one would define equality.  I say to him: experience inequality and one will really know what it is all about.  Women who work today, receiving only 60 or 68 per cent of the hourly rate of their male counterparts, will readily define that as inequality.  Once one experiences it one will have no difficulty understanding what is inequality.  I warn the Government that the women of Ireland are watching and waiting.  They demand, as do we in Fine Gael, that the laws of this State recognise unequivocally full equality for women thereby removing all doubt, all ambiguity, and move forward towards equality.  I contend a step forward in that direction would be acceptance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for many in our society equality remains merely an aspiration. There has been some progress made in regard to reform in employment equality, violence towards women and to some extent in the area of family law; but much remains to be done.  This Bill constitutes a response to that need.  I welcome the fact that its objectives aim at creating a climate of understanding and mutual respect in which everybody will be recognised as having equal dignity and rights.</P>
    <P>It must be quite clear in our laws and Constitution that women and men have equal rights politically, socially and economically. We should aim at a society in which it would be totally unremarkable to find that half of the posts in any occupation would be filled by men and the <Col N="1734" /> other half by women.  We should also aim to create a society in which every member, without any discrimination on the grounds of sex, creed or any other difference, would feel that he or she had an equal chance to make his or her choice to follow the direction they might wish to take unaffected by any outside values that might be brought to bear.  Unfortunately, that is not the position at present.  Women are still trapped.  They are denied the same rights to develop their contribution to their families and society as their male counterparts, who take such rights for granted.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution in the very manner in which it refers to women actually traps them, creating circumstances in which inescapably they are discriminated against, not alone in law but in more comprehensively by the attitudes hidden behind our laws, by the very way our society functions.  Governments should lead.  We cannot expect attitudes to change unless society is steered toward change, encouraged to change, by the Government.  Sadly, it takes a long time to change ingrained attitudes or prejudices, but unless we make a start they will never change.  The way to do so is to introduce legislation.  I believe attitudes will never change if this House refuses to take the step we ask this evening, to encourage and to lead the public into changing their attitudes.</P>
    <P>If the Government refuse, as they say, to support this Bill they will be most unwise and backward-looking.  It is of the utmost necessity that we build a structure of equality within which we can achieve equal status and opportunity for all our people.  The attitude of Members who state in the House that they support and believe in equality and would like to see it obtain but who will walk through the lobbies this evening to vote against the Bill is, I believe, an absolute and total contradiction of their expressed views.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an <Col N="1735" /> opportunity to contribute to this debate. Indeed I welcome all of the contributions made to the debate.  Having listened to many, I have to admit that there appears to be a basic element of agreement on the necessity for this debate and the attributes of the Bill.  As Deputy Therese Ahearn has just said, it would be very difficult for people to understand how Fianna Fáil backbenchers could praise this Bill &mdash; and to judge by their contributions 95 per cent accept the aspirations of this Bill and praise its aims &mdash; but when the test comes at 8.30 p.m. that they should toe the line and do as instructed by the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>The decision of the Government to refuse this Bill a Second Reading is regrettable.  I am quite happy to accept that there is room for improvement in this Bill, but that is the nature of legislation.  I should like to feel that whenever any Government Minister introduces legislation in this House he does so on the basis that the function of the House is to improve on it.  After all, what would be the purpose of debate in this House if Members' views &mdash; each one of whom benefits from their individual experiences, knowledge and expertise &mdash; were not taken into account?  Basically it would be a total charade if the Minister of the day was not prepared to listen and to seek co-operation in improving legislation introduced in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of this Bill, which took place over a number of months, involved widespread consultation with many interest groups, with many sectors of our society interested in the widespread inequality that obtains in our society.  Through consultation advice, information and direction from the many groups who have been involved in equality cases over the years, we sought to eradicate such inequality as it obtains right across our society.  When we went out from Leinster House to meet the many groups involved, ranging from the Employment Equality Agency to others, in preparation of legislation in fighting individual cases, in endeavouring to eliminate discrimination where it obtained, <Col N="1736" /> we found there was no shortage of examples of discrimination in our society. Regrettably, it is occasionally difficult for people to see the wood from the trees; people are not aware of the blatant discrimination that obtains because they take so many things for granted.  It is only when one begins to look and to examine in detail &mdash; and the opportunities for examination were many &mdash; one discovers circumstances in which such discrimination exists.  In many circumstances people are totally oblivious of the discrimination obtaining in our society.  It involves a whole process of endeavouring to change attitudes, endeavouring to bring about an awareness in our society leading to the elimination of the discrimination that obtains.</P>
    <P>I have to say that the attitude of the Government is difficult to understand. I do not exaggerate when I say I am astonished at their attitude.  Only a matter of weeks ago the Taoiseach came before the House and the people declaring that this would be a new style of Government, an open style of Government, that there would be no secrets, no hidden agenda.  I should have thought this type of Bill was one that they would have been prepared to take on board, that they would at least give it a Second Reading and put it before a committee of this House.  In the case of the Judicial Separation Bill, the Government themselves were slow to bring a Bill before the House.  It was originally introduced by Deputy Shatter of Fine Gael, and the process of Special Committee of this House a much improved Bill was eventually passed.</P>
    <P>The Government have offered no concrete excuse for rejecting this Bill.  Some nit-picking took place in regard to the impracticality of certain provisions but no concrete reasons were offered by the Government during the course of this debate as to why this Bill should be rejected.  I do not accept, as has been alleged by Government Ministers, that acceptance of this Bill would in some way damage the integrity of existing legislation. I find that proposition extremely difficult to understand, and I do not <Col N="1737" /> accept it.  The Labour Party have tremendous difficulty in accepting such a proposition.  I say to the Government that that is a very lame excuse for not accepting this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Government believe they have strong grounds for rejecting the Bill then the legal advice available to them should be put before this House.  The legal advice setting out the reasons they should reject the Bill which I presume they sought from the Attorney General's office, should be made available to the Members of this House.  I strongly believe that this legislation was carefully drafted.  It pulls together existing legislation in the area of inequality.  The Labour Party set out to update that legislation.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice will be aware that most of our legislation in the equality area dates back to the seventies. If nothing else, this legislation should be updated and revised.  In this respect, the Government would have been doing a good day's work if they had been prepared to take the Bill on board, put it to a committee of this House and bring it back before this House for further improvement.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have a difficulty &mdash; this has been highlighted in recent Supreme Court decisions &mdash; with the apparent inability or unwillingness of this House to accept certain pieces of legislation. The recent Supreme Court judgment and, in particular, the remarks made by Mr. Justice McCarthy, should be taken very seriously by all Deputies who have a responsibility not just to the immediacy of their constituency work but also to legislation and ensuring that it is updated and improved as often as possible.</P>
    <P>We have been fortunate in terms of our Constitution and its validity.  Our Constitution has stood the test of time but times takes its toll on all legal documentation. Our Constitution which was acceptable to a reasonably small proportion of the population in 1937 obviously needs to be updated to meet the exigencies of the nineties.  A major review of our Constitution by a committee <Col N="1738" /> of this House in the sixties made very clear recommendations.  Unfortunately, we have not acted on these.  It is a shame on parties on all sides of this House that they did not avail of the opportunity to implement these recommendations. The very clear directions, message and signal given by Mr. Justice McCarthy in his recent Supreme Court decision indicate the need for us to operate in a new atmosphere.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious from the way legislation has been processed in this House that sadly we have tended to wait for directions from Europe.  It is incumbent on all political parties and the Independents to change the style of this House.  Rather than wait to be driven by Europe we should take the responsibility ourselves.  We should undertake to rectify the obvious and glaring omissions in the area of legislation rather than wait for Europe to give us a direction.  Headlines such as those in our newspaper today about the Irish morality plays which are being acted out before the European Courts do no good for any of us, do no justice to this country and do nothing for the people we represent.</P>
    <P>Much work has been done in the area of equality but unfortunately commission reports have not been acted upon.  The Second Commission on the Status of Women will bring more urgent matters before this House.  I would like to think that this House will take on their responsibility in regard to these matters. I certainly felt, as I said in the House in response to the initial statements by the Taoiseach when he took office, that this House would adopt a new perspective in regard to important issues and that we would be more open with one another when dealing with difficult issues.  Given the Taoiseach's reaction in recent days I have to admit that I am beginning to wonder whether the aspirations he expounded both inside and outside this House in the early days after his succession to the leadership of Fianna Fáil will be followed through.  The Taoiseach had a golden opportunity of showing that his new style of Government had substance by instructing his Minister for <Col N="1739" /> Labour to come before the House and say that the Government were prepared to take on board the aims and aspirations of the Equal Status Bill presented by the Labour Party.  It is regrettable that he has not availed of that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Despite the reluctance of the Government to co-operate with us during the course of the debate I have to admit it is my strong conviction that it will not be long before a similar Bill is brought before the House either by the Government or an Opposition party and we will be discussing these issues again.  We cannot continue to sweep these issues under the carpet.  I do not believe people outside this House will accept this from us.  This House will have to undertake a programme of reform in these areas.</P>
    <P>This legislation sets out wider areas of discrimination than any legislation previously brought before the House.  It sets out to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin, including membership of the travelling community.  It is only right that these provisions should be very wide.  It is extremely important to ensure that this Bill is totally inclusive and that there are no exclusions.  The second object of the Bill is to make discrimination unlawful not only in the workplace but also in education, in the provision of goods, facilities and services, including recreational, banking and other financial services, entertainment, accommodation, transport and the services of any trade or profession and in the disposal or management of premises.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party set out very deliberately to ensure that this Bill would be extremely wide.  Given that the Bill covers such a wide area of Irish life, it is incomprehensible to think that the Government were not able to come into the House and say there were parts of the Bill they could accept and on which they were prepared to work so that they could be improved.  As I said at the outset, many people listening to the debate may wonder where the examples <Col N="1740" /> of discrimination to which I have referred exist.  These are well documented and recorded.  Sadly, we have been very slow to address these issues.  That is the main purpose of the Bill.  There is a responsibility on all Deputies to address these matters urgently.</P>
    <P>We also define three types of discrimination &mdash; direct, indirect and victimisation. Obviously quite a lot of this is self-explanatory, but we set out to ensure that no area of Irish life, ranging from entertainment to sex, handicap, race and colour, was excluded.  With the help of the legal advisers available to the Labour Party this is one of the most comprehensive Bills to be introduced in this House.  If we had set out to introduce the Bill on a rushed basis or without due consideration, I could understand that the legal advisers to the Government, the Attorney General and others, might have difficulty in relation to the acceptability of the Bill at this time.  However, that is not the case.  The Bill has been in course of preparation for a long time, a process of preparation which involved widespread negotiation and consultation.  We set out to reflect the views of many people working in areas where discrimination manifests itself, and I would say that many Members of this House have perhaps never come into contact with those areas.  I strongly recommend to the Members of the House &mdash; and to Cabinet Ministers &mdash; that if they travelled around the city they would see where discrimination exists, including lack of access to legal facilities.  They would see people who have extreme difficulty in coping with day-to-day situations because of the widespread discrimination in society.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have an obligation to remedy these situations.  We have responsibility in this regard and we also have the opportunity &mdash; it is before the House at present &mdash; to remedy the situation.  Unfortunately, the attitude of the Government is, perhaps, consistent with the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to these issues, as they are having difficulty in dealing with very basic issues before this House.  As we discovered <Col N="1741" /> on the Order of Business this morning, there are many areas where the Government are afraid or unprepared to bring legislation before this House. Despite a speech made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, at the Ard-Fhéis early last year which seemed to herald a new era and in which he promised all sorts of new, reforming legislation, sadly and regrettably not one shred of that legislation has been brought before this House.  I could never be accused of being a great admirer of the former Taoiseach &mdash; I was perhaps one of his strongest critics &mdash; but in that speech he gave indications that he was prepared to take on some of the very serious issues facing us.  We were promised a simple measure to update our family planning legislation.  We are still being promised it, but I doubt, from what we heard on the Order of Business today, that we will see it within the lifetime of this Government.  I find that very difficult to understand or to take.  I have very serious worries about the Government's ability to deal with the very serious issues consequent on the recent Supreme Court decision which are facing the Government, and the Government have no choice but to deal with them.  However, unless and until the Government introduce simple legislation to update our family planning legislation, I question the bona fides of the Taoiseach or indeed of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>In updating this legislation and before introducing the Bill in the House we consulted people on a widespread basis. Indeed, many of the provisions in the Bill are a response to suggestions made by the Employment Equality Agency and many other interested groups which have been well documented and recorded down through the years.  The net effect of the work we have done, in the eyes of any legal commentator, will greatly strengthen the legislative code as it exists at present in relation to discrimination.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and accepted by most contributors to the debate, that this Bill aims to go a great deal further than any previous legislation on discrimination.  It has, to my knowledge, been welcomed <Col N="1742" /> by every organisation representing women in the State and by the great majority of the organisations representing disadvantaged minorities.  I do not recall hearing any serious objections from any group representing people outside this House.  If adopted I am convinced that the Bill will place Ireland at the forefront of European member states in terms of our attitude to discrimination and inequality.  Unfortunately, as things exist, we are very far from that position. I will give one instance by way of clarification. Ireland is still today unable to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination.  We signed that convention nearly 25 years ago, but sadly we cannot ratify it until we adopt legislation to enable individuals or groups in Ireland to claim legal protection against discrimination. That is one obvious example of the ground we must make up in this whole area.  Until we are in a position to ratify conventions like that, Ireland will not be able to say that it has a society free from discrimination or intolerance. Even after we take the necessary legislative steps to put ourselves in that position, we will still have an awful lot of work to do.</P>
    <P>For as long as Ireland remains a country where the average woman at work earns two-thirds of the pay of the average man, for as long as Ireland remains a country where women have little or no hope of rising to the top in business or the public service, for as long as Ireland remains an economy which has a heavy dependence on its ability to exploit low paid and part-time women workers &mdash; for as long as these conditions exist we cannot afford to lightly turn our back on legislation like the Equal Status Bill.</P>
    <P>I repeat my assertion that this is a fundamentally important Bill where women are concerned.  But it is not just confined to women, neither is it confined to the workplace.  This Bill would have fundamental effects on our attitudes to a wide range of people across the whole spectrum of Irish life.  It would force us to confront attitudes that have been hidden for too long.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> To illustrate what I mean, I want to refer to just two situations.  I want to do so by quoting to this House extracts from a pamphlet published within the last week by the Attic Press.  The title of this pamphlet is <i>Repulsing Racism &mdash; Reflections on Racism and the Irish</i> and it was written by a woman born in India who has chosen to spend her adult life in Ireland and to raise her family here.  In that pamphlet she writes passionately about her own experience, in the following way:</P>
    <P>Skin colour and sexism have been paramount in the evolving of my blueprint. My inner self has been defined and constantly re-defined by me and for me, in relation to the &ldquo;superior white other&rdquo;.  Being perceived as inferior has left me with an abiding sense of inadequacy and guilt which is only slowly decreasing.  I have often been subjected to a type of inverted racism which disregards the cultures which have formed me.  Because I am middle class, do not speak English with a broken accent and do not wear any particular national costume, I am often regarded as &ldquo;not really Indian&rdquo;, &ldquo;not Irish&rdquo;, a &ldquo;West Brit&rdquo;, &ldquo;not coloured, because you're like us&rdquo;.  What is perceived as an identifying feature about me is used, consciously or unconsciously, to discriminate by either inclusion or exclusion.  There is an assumption among many Irish people that those whose skin colour is different &ldquo;aspire&rdquo; to adopt a &ldquo;superior, less primitive&rdquo; culture.</P>
    <P>Against that background, Gretchen Fitzgerald has examined in detail the experience of discrimination under a number of headings.  I want to refer to just two.</P>
    <P>There are 21,000 travellers in Ireland who have a distinct identity, culture and lifestyle.  Their lifestyle, particularly its nomadic quality, is the most controversial and the one that we are least inclined to accept.  Most objective observers would recognise that the prejudice and discrimination against travellers is similar to that practised by <Col N="1744" /> white people against black people.  Just because travellers are the same colour as we are, does not protect them against racist thinking and behaviour, which is based on the ethnic and cultural differences between travellers and those of us who are settled.</P>
    <P>Gretchen Fitzgerald poses the question: &ldquo;How many of us personally know, socialise with, or can count a traveller among our friends?&rdquo; It is a disturbing question, and I suspect not too many of us can honestly say that we are entirely free of the prejudice against travellers which permeates a great deal of official policy. For as long as the statistics continue to show a high infant mortality rate, short life expectancy, frequent hospitalisation, high unemployment and widespread illiteracy among travellers, we will not be able to say that we have ended that period of prejudice in our history.</P>
    <P>The point is well made in the pamphlet that women travellers bear a double burden of oppression.  They are discriminated against by men who hold the balance of power in the travelling community, and the discrimination which settled women experience in relation to education, employment and work is felt even more acutely by traveller women. Their domestic situation, of course, is frequently compounded by the quality of their accommodation and by lack of access to water, sanitation and other facilities which even the most disadvantaged settled people take for granted.</P>
    <P>The other area of discrimination that I want to refer to before concluding is the whole area of aliens, immigrants and refugees.  The status, rights and obligations of aliens in this country are all determined by legislation.  Under our existing legislation, aliens and immigrants into Ireland effectively have no rights.  The legislation is administered by and large by the aliens section of the Department of Justice, who have very wide discretion to enforce restrictions on the entry, landing, freedom of movement, explusion and deportation of aliens in the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> The point has been made to me on several occasions by aliens that in Ireland they feel often as if they were in South Africa and subject to the pass laws of the Apartheid regime.  Aliens &mdash; and, it has to be said, especially aliens with a different skin colour &mdash; can tell countless stories of harassment directed at them by the Irish State.  That harassment can often be worse than the kind of victimisation that can be suffered at the hands of some landlords and other private providers of services.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a country where none of the international agreements concerning refugees has been given effect in our laws.  All applications for refugee status and political asylum are determined by the Department of Justice.  But no information is available as to what criteria the Department apply to applications for refugee status and political asylum. There are no clear, public and enforceable procedures in relation to refugees and the refugee or asylum seeker has no protection under Irish law.  As the Minister of State at the Department of Justice is in the House perhaps he could take it on himself to look at this area and then come back with some recommendations as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The issues of travellers and aliens are just two issues which highlight the need for us to address the question of discrimination in a fundamental and soul-searching way.  We cannot do it by legislation alone.  The Churches, the media, the education system &mdash; all have their role to play in changing attitudes and in encouraging and fostering a climate in Ireland where respect for human dignity is paramount.</P>
    <P>If we cannot face up to the need to legislate to address our own shortcomings then we have failed the first test.  That is why I conclude the debate tonight with a sense of regret because when the Government had to face their first test they sadly failed.  I am not sure how the Taoiseach and his Cabinet Ministers will respond to the many issues dealt with in the Bill which are constantly arising and will continue to be raised again both inside and outside this House by the many interest <Col N="1746" /> groups working in the area of inequality and discrimination.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, and it is worth repeating, this is basically the first test the Government have had to face.  The Government will be confronted with another in relation to other issues consequent on the recent Supreme Court decision.  That seems to have frozen the Government into some form of inactivity and a degree of silence which does nothing to strengthen democracy in this country and does nothing to strengthen the working of this House.  Amid the fanfare of the Taoiseach's taking up office we were promised openess and honesty and that all the issues confronting Irish society would be faced up to.  The issues have been set out clearly and directly, after a great deal of consultation and consideration in this Bill.  These issues will confront the Government on a day-to-day basis.</P>
    <P>We have not heard from Fianna Fáil's colleagues in Government on this issue. As they like to take the role of riding shotgun on the Government in order to keep them on the straight and narrow, as they claim to do on occasion, this was a golden opportunity for them to set out their views on these issues.  Is it because these issues do not have economic urgency which the Progressive Democrats claim as their area, that they have no contribution to make on these very serious issues?</P>
    <P>To deal with these issues requires courage and, on occasion, they may lead to political unpopularity but that is not an excuse for Members not to face up to them.  These issues cannot constantly be swept under the carpet by Government. As I said at the outset, discrimination and abuse of privilege exists right across Irish society and I urge the members of Cabinet and Members of the House to go out and see for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us to legislate for these situations.  It is not satisfactory merely to have a debate.  It would have been far more satisfactory if the Government had taken a positive role, accepted the suggestions made and allowed further <Col N="1747" /> discussion and consultation by way of a committee of this House.  If the Minister of State takes his task seriously, because he is responsible for law reform, he will come back to the House within a short period of time with a Bill on similar lines.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was dealing with the points raised by the Deputies opposite in relation to the family income supplement. I think I had more or less dealt with most of them apart from those raised by Deputies Bell and Kavanagh, who suggested <Col N="1751" /> that this scheme should be administered by the Department of Labour.  I will consider this suggestion.  Even though I have not given the matter any thought, I will not simply hold onto a scheme just because it is administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>Last night I outlined my views on the carer's allowance, and think I will follow this principle in respect of that allowance. I can consider this suggestion as there is a connection with the Department of Labour.  The scheme is administered by the Department of Social Welfare to raise the incomes of those who are working to a certain level.  Therefore it is not a social welfare scheme and I will have the matter considered.  I do not know whether my colleague in the Department of Labour would want to administer this scheme, but this is a suggestion that we can consider. Even though I have not considered it, good ideas present me with few problems and I am always willing to consider them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had taken on board any of the recommendations made by the Commission on Social Welfare in their report, but he did not reply.  As only a small number of people were taking up the family income supplement they suggested that the net income of applicants should be taken into account rather than their gross income.  I also asked him for some statistics, which I subsequently found.  These are disturbing and provide an extra dimension to the picture.  They point to a low uptake in 1990, when only 6,569 people availed of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Minister would be happy to hand this scheme over to the Department of Labour, and he has mentioned that he would be happy to get rid of the carer's allowance to the Department of Health, I do not know whether I could support a proposal that this sum of £9 million, which is made <Col N="1752" /> available to needy families, be transferred. Despite the fact that there has been a low uptake, those of us on this side of the House, should be happy that at least £9 million is being made available to these families.</P>
    <P>However the statistics which provide a breakdown of the figure of 6,569 recipients are disturbing.  One might presume that they were all getting substantial payments but instead, it is disturbing to see that the weekly rates for some of the families can range from £1 to £10 and that of the 6,000 recipients almost 1,000 fall into that category.  The second lowest payment band between £11 and £20 has the highest uptake at 1,700.  At the top end of the scale there are very small numbers involved.  There are only 210 families in receipt of the maximum payment.</P>
    <P>We all have our reservations about this scheme.  We feel that more families who are entitled to it are not getting it because they are not aware of it or because we have not convinced them to apply for it. Bad as the scheme is, the Minister should try to improve it for existing recipients and for those who should apply for it. Rather than wish this on to some other Government Department we should improve the scheme.  We should not talk about abolishing the carer's allowance or passing it to some other Department either.  The Minister should not suggest that this is not a very good scheme and that he really only wants good schemes in operation.  I would remind the Minister that £9 million at least filters its way through the system to deserving families. The carer's alllowance is a foundation stone for the future.  It is not something that should be transferred from one Department to the other because the Minister might get too much flak because of the nature of its application.  I hope the Minister shares my concern that so many people only benefit from £1 to £10 and that the take-up is so small.  It will only be improved if the Minister improves the terms of the scheme, possibly along the lines suggested by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of transferring the FIS scheme to the Department of Labour did not come from the Minister but from my colleague, and I support it.  We suggested that it might be more appropriate for the scheme to be transferred to the Department of Labour, not because we want to eliminate the underspending of £9 million but rather because we want to supplement that sum with support finance from the European Social Fund.  Another reason why the scheme should be transferred is because the bulk of the work in relation to lower paid workers is carried out through the agencies of the Labour Court, the joint industrial councils, the joint labour committees, the hotel and catering organisations and through the farm workers JIC.  Rather than trying to save £9 million, we hope to get additional moneys through the European Social Fund to assist the lower paid by doing this, not to be a prop to employers or a subsidy for bad employers who pay low wages.  We want to assist those who for one reason or another earn low pay.  The Minister will obviously have to consult with the Department and he might decide that this is not a good idea, but we look forward to hearing from him on it.  We make our suggestion for positive reasons only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because £9 million is being paid out from the Department of Social Welfare that I am considering transferring the scheme to the Department of Labour.  I am not trying to save money.  If £9 million is being provided in the Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare it will also be provided in the Estimate for the Department of Labour.  I was just taking up the point made by Deputy Kavanagh, which was supported by Deputy Bell, that the FIS might be more appropriate to the Department of Labour.  I have not given it a lot of thought, but I am prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disingenuous for Deputy Byrne to suggest that I thought the FIS and the carer's allowance were not good schemes.  I am for those schemes in principle <Col N="1754" /> and I want the carer's allowance to become a proper carer's allowance.  An appropriate carer's allowance could save the State a vast amount of money.  During the break at 7 p.m.  I provided Deputy Byrne with this document and told him on which page he would get the figures. In future, if the Deputy goes on like this, I will not be as helpful.  I will have to be careful about that.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Deputy made a point about tax and whether the family income supplement should be assessed on net pay.  That is being considered in the Department.  The consultant to whom I referred earlier who did a report for the Department on the take-up of the FIS suggested that up to 12,000 recipients could take up the scheme.  The consultant concluded that there was a possibility of proceeding along the lines of using the net income but on balance he thought it was better to stick with gross income.  If we transferred from gross pay to net pay some people might lose out.  However, the suggestion is being considered.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is a good scheme.  The report of the Commission on Social Welfare concluded that in the long term, as resources permit, family income supplement should be discontinued and that children's allowance payments and realistic marginal tax rates for low paid employees should be the instruments of incentives policy; but in the short term they were forced to conclude that the family income supplement should be retained and modified, as its abolition or abatement would reduce the incomes of low income families.  Since that report was compiled we have simplified the scheme.</P>
    <P>I will just give the figures with regard to the take-up of the family income supplement. The take-up in 1991 was 7,200 families. The uptake of this scheme was quite small at the start.  The scheme was introduced in September 1984 and the take-up was 1,424 families.  This grew in 1985 to 4,664 and now the figure is 7,200.  In 1988, for some reason that is not obvious to anybody, the figure was down on 1987.  We wonder why there has <Col N="1755" /> not been a greater take-up of the scheme. Since I became Minister I saw various newspaper articles saying that people are not taking up the scheme and various groups have concluded that not everyone who is entitled to it has taken it up.  The Department have advertised it and made it well known.  We have done all we can. There are families who should be taking advantage of the scheme but are not doing so.  About £9 million was spent last year and we expect the figure this year will be roughly the same.  We are still well short of the 12,000 families who could be taking up the scheme.  We have advertised it and made it well known, yet people have not taken advantage of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment in this regard but it was disallowed, for reasons which I fully understand. I did not expect to get an answer to all of the questions I posed earlier. The issue is as difficult and involved as when we started.  Publicity about the scheme may have reached saturation point but I welcome Deputy Bell's suggestion regarding the posting of leaflets.</P>
      <P>A married man with two children, earning £175, could claim the FIS, yet another family where there is no unemployment would be entitled to only £112. It is difficult to understand why there is such a huge margin.  For many years I was of the opinion that the FIS could be the vehicle by which thousands of people would go back to lower paid work.  I do not want it to be a crutch for employers. The longer this debate continues the more I am convinced that the FIS will never achieve what I had envisaged.  The most we can expect is the inclusion of a further 4,000 or 5,000 families in the scheme.  Even 10,000 or 12,000 would have little impact on the 280,000 who are out of work.  I am not certain but the transfer of this scheme to the Department of Labour would improve the position but it should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested earlier that eligibility for the FIS should be based on net income rather than gross income.  The Minister <Col N="1756" /> replied that there would be winners and losers in that system.  I do not believe there would be too many losers.  A spouse earning a gross income of £175 might have to pay the usual costs such as mortgage interest and travelling expenses, as well as a certain amount of income tax. If income tax of, say, £25 or £30 were to be disregarded in the application for this FIS, it would make it far more attractive for that man to continue in employment. We are losing jobs all over the country. Some jobs have simply become too costly for the employer.  Would it not make sense to increase the FIS by about £25? Families at a certain level may qualify for a supplement of £5 but that does not serve any purpose.</P>
    <P>Department officials have suggested that if small farmers were allowed into the scheme it would cost a total of £10 million.  It must be remembered that 6,500 or 7,000 are already in the scheme at a cost of £9 million.  There are about 13,000 farmers in receipt of farmer's dole, at a cost of about £36 million.  I find it difficult to understand how so many small farmers would qualify, given that they are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The Minister knows that a great number of people with small and medium sized farms who are not entitled to unemployment assistance are on the poverty line.  How can the Department calculate that it would cost an extra £10 million?  All the farming organisations have been clamouring for this for some time.  It would seem to be an answer to a particular problem.  Those people are <i>in situ</i> and have a so-called job.  They are, of course, under-employed and if this trend continues they will not be living in the same place in three or four years' time.</P>
    <P>The social implications might impel the Minister and his officials to consider this question.  His predecessor floated the idea last year of making £1 million available for distribution to small farmers at a certain level and it was announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget. That money was never paid out because a scheme could not be devised for disbursing <Col N="1757" /> it.  A modified version of the FIS might be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>A constituent of mine who telephoned me this evening went to great trouble to become self-employed as a precision engineer and put his redundancy money into this project.  He found himself in a valley period and applied for unemployment assistance but was told he had the capacity to borrow his way out of a bad patch.  He was actually up to his ears in debt.  If he could establish his entitlement to unemployment assistance he would be eligible for the enterprise scheme.  One is dependent on the other. Many people would agree that the family income supplement would be very useful for the self-employed.  I was very surprised to overhear the officials tell the Minister that it would cost £25 million to fund the scheme for the entire self-employed sector, and I admit that we do not have that money.  However, a variation of the scheme could be considered. I would like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>

      <P>Since we spoke about this matter earlier I contacted two people in my constituency who qualify but did not apply for the family income supplement. One family is entitled to about £25 per week while the other is entitled to the minimum supplement.  When I asked these people why they did not apply for the family income supplement they said they believed they were not entitled to it because it is social welfare.  People associate the FIS scheme with unemployment benefit and believe that to qualify they must be on the dole.  I told these people that while the scheme is administered by the Department of Social Welfare it is a supplement to a person's income.  People generally believe that the supplement is social welfare and that if they are employed they are, not entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS offices are located in virtually every urban area in the country, which is where the vast majority of people entitled to the family income supplement live. These offices operate near all the main industrial areas throughout the State, although there are not as many in rural <Col N="1758" /> areas as in urban areas.  FÁS deal with the registration of apprenticeships and operate schemes designed to get people back to work.  If the Minister transferred responsibility for the FIS scheme to FÁS people's attitudes would change.  Therefore, I strongly recommended that he consider that suggestion.</P>

      <P>There should be greater co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare as regards the FIS scheme.  There has been a great deal of talk about the whole question of tax and social welfare.  The classic example has been given by Deputy Connaughton of people paying tax to the Revenue Commissioners while the Department of Social Welfare pay them back money by way of the family income supplement scheme.  Single people earning £3,700 or more and couples earning £7,000 or more are taxed at present.  It is a waste of money to collect taxes from people on the one hand while paying the same people money by way of the family income supplement on the other.  I have advocated for a number of years that single people earning £5,000 or less and couples earning £10,000 or less should not be taxed. We should concentrate on taxing the higher levels of income at a greater rate. At present the reverse is happening; we are reducing the higher levels of tax. People earning £150,000 a year save about £16,000 in tax as a result of a reduction in the higher rate of tax.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that it would be acceptable to transfer responsibility for the FIS to the Department of Labour.  I believe the Department of Social Welfare are a much more caring Department and know more about poverty than do the Department of Labour.  There is a great case to be made, however, for the transfer of the carer's allowance to the Department of Health.  In those circumstances the Department of Health would realise the great value of allocating more money to carers, thereby saving enormous sums of money in hospital and nursing home charges.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> At this stage of the night I think we may be hallucinating, and I too am affected.  We are talking about transferring responsibility for schemes but it is the schemes that matter.  I do not care whether the Department of Foreign Affairs operate the carer's allowance from the embassy in Athens as long as they improve on it, or whether the Department of the Marine operate the family income supplement from a boat at Inishvickillane as long as the scheme is improved.  I do not know why Deputy Byrne is concerned about this matter.  I have a suspicion that he has a burning ambition to be Minister for Social Welfare in the future and he wants all this money under his control.</P>
      <P>Amazement was expressed at the fact that 1,000 people will gain only from £1 to £6 on the family income supplement. I think that is marvellous.  I was shocked to learn that one of my constituents was entitled to £40 family income supplement. Therefore, he was working for slave labour.  I was glad he was able to avail of the £40 extra.  Unfortunately, having worked for so little for many years he lost his job about a month later.</P>
      <P>I will hallucinate again and agree completely with all members of The Workers' Party that the idea of paying income tax on the one hand and getting money back under the family income supplement scheme on the other, is crazy.  As long as the schemes work that is all that matters. The more people who avail of even small amounts of money under the family income supplement the more we will be convinced that people are not working for slave labour.  Therefore, the fewer people who are entitled to £40 or £45 in family income supplement the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with Deputy Connaughton's point.  One of my predecessors in this Department considered the possibility of extending the FIS scheme to farmers.  It has been calculated that a total of 9,000 farmers would avail of the FIS scheme at a full year cost of £9 million &mdash; I incorrectly gave the figure of £10 million earlier.  If the scheme was extended to the whole <Col N="1760" /> self-employed sector the cost would be £25 million.  That proposal was considered but it was not taken on board. The Departments of Social Welfare and Agriculture and Food were anxious to extend the scheme to small holders but that did not prove possible because of the extra cost involved.  However, I will consider that matter again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell referred to the family income supplement.  He gave possibly the best answer to the question as to why there has not been a greater uptake of this scheme.  It is probably because people assume that it is social welfare and that in order to avail of it they must be unemployed. That is probably a factor why a certain percentage of people have not taken up the scheme, but I do not know how to overcome that problem.  I do not know whether Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla was in the House when I spoke about the carer's allowance last night, but I spoke in exactly the same terms and for the same reasons as he spoke tonight.</P>
      <P>Those on the Opposition benches have come up with an idea in relation to the Department of Labour.  I am considering both sides of the argument.  I recognise the Deputies' concerns that the Department of Social Welfare could be more caring than another Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what has been said about tax.  There are so many circular transfers of funds that this system is mindboggling. We have tax, social welfare assistance, FÁS and the Department of Labour.  I spent a few hours one day talking about such matters with officials at departmental level.  The same money is going around different agencies.  We tax people and then we give it back to them.  It is illogical that we tax people and then assist them with family income supplement.  The answer could be to provide higher tax exemption limits.  The fact that I am now in Cabinet has not changed my views in relation to tax rates.  I went on public record some time ago with those views, but in deference to my Cabinet colleagues of another party I shall keep my mouth shut in that regard and confine myself to social welfare <Col N="1761" /> issues.  I am not saying that I necessarily disagree with the Deputy in that regard, but I am not the Minister for Finance and other people have other views on that matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Browne also talked about these schemes.  The person to whom he referred, who earned up to £40, seems to be in an extraordinarily low paid job.  As I have said, we have to guard against the scheme being open for exploitation by employers.  There is a danger that employers could exploit people in very low paid jobs and the Department of Social Welfare would be required to top up their earnings.  A balance has to be struck in relation to limits and so on, otherwise the scheme would be completely exploited, particularly in certain industries.  That is something I spoke about earlier today.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a brief point in relation to the Minister's final comment.  I hope that the Minister corrects me if I am wrong, but I understood him to say that if the scheme were extended to the self-employed and farmers a cost of about £25 million would be incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Much is heard about slave labour and people being paid paltry wages.  However, to me this issue demonstrates what happens when people try to do something for themselves.  If the scheme as it stands at the moment costs the State £9 million and would cost another £16 million if it were extended to the self-employed, there must be an awful lot of people in this country working for themselves who earn much less than those earning wages.  That point should be taken on board; it is part and parcel of the problem of people being unwilling to make the effort to start up <Col N="1762" /> in business for themselves.  In this country the system is geared towards those who work for someone else, and the figures prove me to be correct in that.  The Minister is now saying that it would cost £16 million extra to extend the scheme to the self-employed, which implies that there are many people out there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who are self-employed and earn less than those who are employed by others and in receipt of family income supplement.  That is what is wrong with the whole structure of our country.  There is no incentive whatsoever for people to try to start up their own business.  Those who are young and have no assets and go to the banks cannot get the money required.  For those who do start up their business and make a very small income in the early days it is much easier to go back on the dole &mdash; there is no scheme such as family income supplement to support them.  Everything is geared towards those who are employed.</P>
      <P>Ireland has nearly 300,000 unemployed. The only way that the unemployed problem will be eased to any significant extent is to get people to do things for themselves.  The Minister knows as well as I do that there are thousands of people who are willing to do things for themselves, but unfortunately they are outside the system and they are not being encouraged into the system. Those people move into the area of the black economy with the result that their businesses never grow properly or expand because they fear that the authorities will find out about them.  They are forced to keep their enterprises small, to put the money in their pockets and to say nothing to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our nation is losing glorious opportunities because of the way we think when it comes to benefits.  If there are nearly double the number working for themselves who earn less than those who are employed and are eligible for FIS, then we should seriously consider the benefits <Col N="1763" /> to the Exchequer and the economy in extending the scheme to the self-employed. The £25 million paid out to get the self-employed into the system would bring back twice as much in the long term through various taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Barrett, rather than myself, made the case for the self-employed.  If it had been me, Deputy Eric Byrne might be encouraged to think that I was standing up for my former profession.  Deputy Barrett has made some very good points. However, I have to say that for the very near future I cannot visualise approval being given to bring another £25 million into the FIS scheme under the present circumstances and I should not like to give the impression that that is likely. The Deputy's comments in relation to the economy and employment have been self-evident to me for a long time.  If the unemployment problem is ever solved it will be solved by those in business taking the responsibility to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier today Deputy Byrne talked about tax evasion, tax avoidance and the collection of large sums of money. However, the reality for most self-employed is that they scrape together a living by working harder and longer hours than most of those in any other form of employment.  Most of the self-employed <Col N="1764" /> do not make great fortunes; they are not in the category which earns £40,000 or £50,000 a year and they do not have offshore companies.  Politicians sometimes give the impression that all self-employed are involved in tax evasion and other kinds of abuses.  That is not correct, but I am afraid that the public perception is otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would like to be able to extend the scheme.  Before I gave the figures, however, I said that someone had to pick up the tab.  I am glad that Deputy Barrett made the point that many self-employed people are worse off than those who are employed and in receipt of FIS.  The Deputy's comments emphasise the fact that many of the self-employed are in much more difficult circumstances and have more headaches than those in paid employment.  I do not honestly foresee that in the next few years it will be possible to extend the FIS scheme to the entire self-employed sector.  As I promised Deputy Connaughton, I shall again examine the issue of extending the scheme to farmers.  However, in principle, if the scheme were extended to farmers then it should be extended to include all self-employed.  The costs are such that I would be wrong to give the impression that that will happen.  I do not visualise the Government being flush with money in the next few years.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 23 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 8, before subsection (2), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided elsewhere, the provisions of the Principal Act shall not be so construed or applied so as to exclude from entitlement to dental benefits under that Act persons whose income is equal to, or exceeds, the earnings ceiling for pay-related insurance contributions and who would otherwise qualify for such benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with one of the most serious provisions in the Bill. It is proposed that persons who earn over <Col N="1767" /> £25,000 should be debarred from receiving dental and optical treatment.  I consider this to be a very serious trend.  Irish people believe that the PRSI system is what it is supposed to be, that is, a social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government are basically proposing that people earning over £25,000 who contribute to this scheme in a mandatory way &mdash; they have no other option; it is the law of our land &mdash; will get no benefit.  Anomalies seen to be arising in the system by the day.  I am sure the Minister is aware of these.  A number of people have contacted me about this issue and I am sure they represent only a quarter of the number who are contacting the Department.  These people are annoyed for two reasons.  It has been brought to my attention that if both spouses in a marriage are working and each is earning £24,000 both of them will be entitled to receive dental benefit under this Bill.  However, if only one spouse is working and he or she is earning £25,001 they will not be entitled to any dental treatment.  This is a huge anomaly.</P>
    <P>Even more serious is the attack being made on the PRSI system.  It is strange that the Minister's proposals seem to put a squeeze at both ends &mdash; on dental benefits at the top end and on people who are made redundant at the lower end whereby they will lose nine weeks' unemployment benefit.  This is a very serious proposal.  The Minister could have argued in isolation that people who earn over £25,000 a year can well afford to look after their teeth.  However, the problem is that this is just the thin end of the wedge.  A few evening ago I visted a factory where, apart from the manager, none of the workers earns anything like £25,000.  These workers wonder what guarantee they will have that they will be able to benefit from the scheme when the need arises.  If that factory closed in the morning and the workers who were made redundant were refused nine weeks' unemployment benefit they would be extremely angry and hurt, as I would be if I was in the same position.  Basically <Col N="1768" /> what we are seeing is an attack on our social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the other problems associated with this scheme in my Second Stage speech yesterday.  I understand that the Dental Association will ballot their members in a fortnight's time and it is significant that we are debating the omission of people earning over £25,000 from that scheme.  It has been suggested to me that the deal being done obviously suits the Minister because he wants to save money.  It is hard to blame a Minister for wanting to do that but it should be done in an evenhanded way.  It also appears that the people earning over £25,000 will be expected to pay for their own dental care.  I am sure everybody knows that the VHI do not cover that sort of dental care.</P>
    <P>This scheme means that there will be a tax on people earning over £25,000 because they thought when they started paying it &mdash; it is my understanding that in 1979 when the scheme was introduced this was one of the pillars on which the scheme was built &mdash; that it would be there as insurance for the rainy day.  Certain specified benefits were outlined which all PRSI contributors would get.  However, in this Bill at both ends of the scale PRSI does not mean what people thought it meant.</P>
    <P>There will be a credibility gap in so far as contributors to the PRSI fund are concerned.  The Pensions Board will issue a report shortly and many workers are beginning to feel extraordinarily jittery in relation to PRSI contributions and what they will mean in future.  It has come to my notice that all the weekly contributions taken from thousands of people are going directly to pay people retiring this very day.  Indeed, much more money is involved because of funding from the Exchequer.  The number of people who will be at work in the years to come will certainly not increase much and, because of the age structure in our society, in 20 years' time many workers will be at retiring age &mdash; all the sociologists and economists are agreed in that regard &mdash; which means that the workforce, the generators of wealth, those <Col N="1769" /> who will be paying PRSI for the next 20 years, might have to carry a far greater burden than they do at present because the economists say that we will be very lucky if we increase our workforce dramatically.  After the year 2010, because of our decreasing birthrate, there will be a huge reduction of people coming to the workforce.  That means we will have many more elderly people to look after.  Are we now seeing a new trend in this Bill?  The signs are ominous. It is very hard on people who genuinely believed &mdash; and who were entitled to do so because it was the law &mdash; that if they worked and paid PRSI contributions they were entitled to benefits at certain times. I would compare it to driving my car into a tree &mdash; I sincerely hope it never happens &mdash; but because I paid insurance on the car I expect to have it repaired.  However, if it turned out that the law had suddenly been changed and I was told I was not covered obviously I would have to cry foul.</P>
    <P>This matter is far more serious than the Minister seems to realise.  I heard him speak on the radio recently defending his policies.  My party and I will be strongly opposing this on a number of grounds. People earning under £25,000 will be nervous tonight because they will believe at the next budget the sum could be reduced to £20,000 or £15,000; that is the great problem in relation to this.  The Minister should change his mind in regard to this entitlement.  I will have more to say about it when we consider the aspect of redundancy later on, but there is a link between the two; it is an erosion of the benefits which people expect from their PRSI contributions.  Many people will say that those earning £25,000 should be able to do many things.  That would be all right if they had been told that was the case some years ago.  A deal was made <i>vis-à-vis</i> the contributions made and people expect to get something in return.</P>
    <P>Earlier I outlined the anomalous situation regarding both spouses earning £24,000.  There will have to be a grouping of family income or something like that; I am not sure how it can be handled but something will have to be done.  When <Col N="1770" /> the Pensions Board report is issued I hope it will clarify the situation.  Unless people have a pension which was paid by their firm they may not be entitled to a contributory retirement pension, we do not know.  The Minister should be aware that people are anxious in that regard. There are many other aspects of the scheme about which we will talk in the next half hour, because this is a very important part of the Bill and we want further clarification from the Minister.</P>

In practice I do not think it matters a tupenny damn what level is brought in for optical or dental treatment because the reality is that people earning less than £10,000 have to pay for their dental service at the moment.  Having taught in primary schools for many years, I know that many of the children assessed as needing dental care at that stage have now reached 15 or 16 years of age and are still on a waiting list.  Dental treatment has been non-existent.  The principle is what counts in this situation.  I agree with Deputy Connaughton that the sum of £25,000 has been established, but at any stage it can be reduced to £20,000 or less.  If somebody joins a scheme it cannot be changed half way through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example the Deputy gave is quite relevant.  If you have paid your insurance and are then involved in a car crash, your cover cannot be changed.  However, the insurance companies can offer a newcomer anything; for example, they could offer people insurance to drive their car around the bedroom and confine it to that if they so wish.  However, once you have established insurance, it has to be continued.  The principle of changing your entitlement under PRSI is raised here but I doubt that it would stand up to constitutional challenge if we interfered with the standard.  I will not repeat what has been said but I think the idea of limiting benefit to those with an income of less than £25,000 should be scrapped. <Col N="1771" /> While we are on the topic of PRSI payments perhaps I could refer fleetingly to something that I am not supposed to raise, but I will run through it.</P>

People who have paid PRSI contributions for ten years are entitled to a contributory pension but under the 1988 Act, people who have made PRSI contributions for seven years are not entitled to anything.  We discussed this question at great length last year.  I think the pension scheme should be extended to this group or else they should receive a pension on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  The Minister should consider this point.  I am sorry that I had to rush.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy bear with me and the Minister may answer me if he wishes?  The point I want to make is that I would like to see people on much lower incomes getting dental benefit.  I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that the problems in this area will be solved quickly and that people who have to postpone dental treatment because they cannot afford it, would be able to avail of such treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that PRSI should be levied on all income, no matter what you earn.  I <Col N="1772" /> would like to see everybody being eligible for benefit.  I believe there should not be any class distinction and that health and dental treatment should be available for all on the same basis.  However, if someone wishes to avail of private treatment, it is a choice if he wishes to pay for it. They should pay for public health no matter what their income is and if they wish to avail of it then well and good.  I believe the same level of health and dental treatment should be available to all and people on low incomes should not have to wait for treatment.</P>
    <P>We will be opposing the amendment because we believe that health and dental treatment should be provided for all people on the same basis.  We would like to see this as Government policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I agree with the case my colleagues have made on this extraordinary decision that the Minister has made in relation to the Bill.  I can only say that he allowed somebody to get his grubby hands on something that is very important. This concession to allow the spouse at home to benefit from their partner's PRSI contributions was hard won.  The need to extend to spouses the rights to benefits which the income earner enjoys was very hard won.  We were campaigning for a long time for this and I believe that in 1987, or some time around then, this benefit was extended to spouses.  I am aware, as other Members said, that the scheme is not working and that only a fraction of dentists have participated in it.  I know that the optical scheme is working.  The dentists have not agreed to operate the scheme and that is a poor reflection on the dental profession.  I do not know what conditions they are looking for before they agree to participate in the scheme and give the non-earning spouse, who is at home rearing the children and possibly looking after a relative, these basic benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know an attempt has been made to get at other Ministers but they have resisted touching this benefit.  I am aware that a deal has been done with the dental profession and I wonder if those whose <Col N="1773" /> income is £25,000 and more have been ransomed in the interest of making the deal.  I know the Minister said on radio that we were referring to only 18,000 cases but let me ask the Minister does he know what he is talking about?  Where there is one income of £25,000 coming into the household, the mortgage and income tax have to be paid and one is left with a very modest income to divide between the wife and children.</P>
    <P>When we discussed family income supplements it was pointed out that social welfare payments bear a relationship to the number of children in the family but in the case of the simple income, it does not matter how many children there are in the family.  Whoever negotiated with the dental profession see people with an income of £25,000 to be in the goldmine category.  In many instances these families are very hard put to cope and pay their bills.  The effect of this measure is that families will be cut off from benefit and the woman, particularly in her child bearing years, will not spend money on her teeth and we will have gummy women all over the country.  Women will give priority to their children's needs.  I ask the Minister to look at this measure again. Perhaps the Minister would consider allowing benefits to enable either the husband or wife, to avail of them.</P>
    <P>In most case you will find where this scheme is effective that the woman has more dental work done than her husband. By virtue of their maternal role they need more dental care.  I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at this matter and see whether he can come back with something that is not so stark.  When this group are being deprived of these benefits will they pay the same contribution or will it be reduced?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that issue.  Why should they pay the full benefit after the Minister makes the regulations if they are not receiving anything in return?  That could be seen to be a serious contravention of rights.  As other speakers said, I think it is a very dangerous precedent. We believe we have insurance based benefits and rights and suddenly they begin to disappear.  I view this very <Col N="1774" /> seriously.  The criticism that has been made about this measure is correct and justified and it was either ill-thought out or else the Minister was caught napping as he was new in the Department.</P>

      <P>I have not had an opportunity to welcome the Minister into his office until now.  I hope this boyish good humour and <i>joie de vivre</i> continues in this Department.  I hope by the end of this evening we may have blunted it a little when we highlight for him some of the pups he has been sold in this Bill.  The principle of what he is doing here is an attack on the whole concept of husbandry and thrift and people providing for the rainy day.  In one fell swoop the Minister has done away with the whole principle of insurance.  If I buy my house insurance I know there is always a minor clause which states that you must cover yourself for the first £30.  I would be very cross if when I make a claim to my insurance company they said: &ldquo;Your salary is a bit high and we have decided, because you are a bit better off, to include a clause stating that you must cover the first £5,000 of the claim&rdquo;.  Essentially, the Minister has attached the whole principle of social insurance.</P>
      <P>I should like to highlight some of the problems I see in it.  I believe it is an extremely blunt instrument.  The Minister has said that the cut off point for eligibility for free dental services is £25,000.  He has made no provision for the size of the family or for the outlay of expenses where two or three children may be attending third level college or some other college.  Because their income is too high they are not receiving any State grants and their actual disposable income of £25,000, on a single income, for the family may be much less than for somebody on a salary as low as £13,000 or £14,000.  Because they are earning £25,000 they are considered to be in the high tax bracket and they are paying for everything such as education etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that somebody who has managed to reach a salary of £26,000 is exactly the kind of person who, perhaps, in the past 20 years has cost the <Col N="1775" /> State very little in claims for optical and dental benefit.  This is a very mean provision &mdash; where after paying stamps for 20 years &mdash; and perhaps never having a claim &mdash; they cannot obtain dental and optical benefit.  I have got to the age now where I am told I am supposed to have my eyes tested regularly.  So far I do not need glasses, but I am told that from the age of 40 onwards a few of one's bits and pieces begin to deteriorate, particularly your eyes.</P>

      <P>Yes, your eyesight and your hearing is extremely good.  When people get to the stage of their life when they will be able to benefit from the husbandry of paying their PRSI the Minister comes in with his big axe.  I do not think the Minister has done this out of any malicious feeling.  This is one of the kind of pet projects that some of the social welfare officials have had up their sleeve waiting for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been a Minister but I understand that very often when Ministers come into office pet projects are put on their desk and they are sold the particular concept.  I would ask the Minister to look again at this provision. As other speakers have said, there could be an attack on the whole concept. If in unison with what is being done now the Minister were to say that from now PRSI would not be obligatory, that it could be voluntary and that at a certain <Col N="1776" /> stage people could opt out of PRSI and pay their own insurance policy to cover optical, dental and other benefits as they get older, there might be some argument to be made.  Instead the Minister is telling people to continue paying PRSI when they are on £12,000 per year but when they reach a certain stage all the benefits disappear.</P>
      <P>What would be the position of a person earning £26,000 or £27,000 who decides to take early retirement, thus freeing up a job for somebody younger in the system? They will have lost the benefit of their optical and dental benefit and the right to be in that scheme.  Can they revert back to being eligible?  If they retire they will no longer have paid contributions; they will be caught in the net where they will not have sufficient paid contributions in a certain contribution year to become eligible for such benefits.  They could be in their mid-fifties, of dental or optical benefit until they become eligible for an old age pension.  Has the Minister looked at the anomaly which might be created if he persists in this foolhardy approach?</P>
      <P>The Minister is sufficiently tuned into what we are saying here to recognise that if he goes along with the idea he could be the Minister who goes down in history as having collected all the PRSI contributions and happily spent them on all sorts of things in his Department other than the reasons for which they were collected, which was to cover people in the rainy day when they need dental and optical benefit.  I agree with my colleagues, particularly Deputy Fennell, that this is a bitter pill for spouses to accept when it appeared they might receive some benefit after 20 years of managing the home.  The Minister, who is such a feminist and is so willing to see women take their place in society, turns around and deprives them of dental and optical benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for being man enough to admit that it was not his officials &mdash; who have been attacked &mdash; who were responsible for this provision.  When Deputy Fennell was on her feet and attacked the Minister's officials he was man enough to tell the House that they did not sell him a pig in a poke.  This is his policy and he is man enough to stand over it.  Having cleared that point I do not consider him to be a feminist if he consciously sets about doing this.  In fact, it constitutes an absolute vicious attack on women in this country, albeit women who might have a spouse earning £25,000.  That is not the key point.  The Minister was saying he would like to make a name for himself in the Department and he outlined, both yesterday and today, some areas he had in mind.  I suggested that unless he withdraws his proposals in this section he will go down in history &mdash; just as the Fine Gael Leader, Deputy John Bruton, went down in history for taxing children's shoes &mdash; as the man who set about dismantling the social insurance system.</P>
      <P>There is one bible we can look to in determining what policies and plans we should follow in pursuing equality in society and that is the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  That report contains the only guidelines that are available to any group, including the Government, who claim that they are attempting to follow the commission's recommendations.  Indeed, everyone uses it as a manual for developments in social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission suggest that there should be a differential of 10 per cent between the amount received in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  They also recommend, at page 277 of the report, on the grounds of redistribution, that the PRSI rate be extended to all employees' income without a ceiling.  They further state that at present the imposition of a ceiling adds an element of regressivity in the insurance contribution across a wide range of gross incomes.  They call for the removal of the ceiling and outline in great detail the reasons for removing it.  They suggest <Col N="1778" /> that by removing the ceiling we could increase treatment benefits and the benefits payable under all other schemes covered in that document.</P>
    <P>The Minister is undermining the concept of pay-related social insurance, and let me remind him that last night I stated he was introducing means testing into the system.  We have already spoken about just how loathsome means testing is and how it is hated by those caught on the border line.  The Minister is bringing degrading and unfair means testing to the social insurance scheme and putting it on a par with means testing in the case of unemployment assistance and many other services such as medical cards, for example.  This is being done for the very first time and there is no place for it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has read the recent publication entitled <i>Selectivity Issues in Irish Social Services</i> by Dr. Carney which was reviewed in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently under the heading &ldquo;Means Testing Stuck in a Bureaucratic Quagmire.&rdquo;  The article points out that there are 50 such means testing schemes in operation across a wide range of areas: community welfare officers implement certain social welfare schemes; school principals administer education grants; and the Judiciary other schemes.  I am very angry and I hope the Minister will take on board the points that I have already made.  He should remove the ceiling of £25,000 and allow all those who pay their contributions to avail of dental and optical benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed that the ceiling should be raised by £1,000 for all categories, the self-employed, employees and employers.  Normally, we would support such a move but because he has proposed that pay-related social insurance benefits should be means tested he is forcing us to vote against this proposal and the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The workforce and employers are now being asked to accept that the ceiling should be raised by £1,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is my firm belief that the Minister is going to weaken the PRSI system and that there will be a backlash from those who will be forced to pay. Who, for example, will want to pay PRSI at the rate of 5.5 per cent out of a total contribution of 7.5 per cent?  Why would anyone want to pay money if they are going to receive no benefits?  I can see the day when more and more people will question the reason they should make a contribution, and more than ever before they will consider PRSI, as it is already regarded by some, as a tax.  If the Minister raises the ceiling by £1,000 and deprives a certain sector of benefits people will have to deduce that it amounts to a second layer of taxation, and that was not the intention.</P>

      <P>As I do not want to delay the House I will not dwell on what has already been covered so eloquently by <Col N="1780" /> other speakers in relation to the proposal that pay-related social insurance benefits should be means tested even though people have no choice.  This is a major constitutional issue.  The Minister may not be aware that the principle that spouses of PRSI contributors should receive benefits was hard won.  As I know many of the Minister's officials &mdash; I always refer to them and compliment them for helping Ministers in introducing legislation in recent years to reform the system &mdash; they are aware of the arguments to be made in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>First, under the law and the Constitution, there is no guarantee that a proportion of a husband's income will be given to his wife and children.  The only way in which this can be done is for the spouse, under the inadequate free legal aid system, to wrest maintenance in overcrowded courtrooms.  As we are all aware, regardless of what a husband's income may be, his wife is not guaranteed a proportion of that income.  She has to rely on his good will and generosity. There are women in families on high and middle incomes living in poverty in this city, women who outwardly seem to have an affluent lifestyle but the reality is that the fridge is locked, the coal and fuel is rationed and both they and their children do not have enough to buy basic commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had two or three surveys over the years which showed that married women's teeth and eysight are neglected more than those of any other category in our society.  A woman, unless she is in a high earning capacity, does not choose to pay for expensive optical and dental treatment for herself because, especially where there are children, there is always something that claims the money first. Women, being the sacrificing, generous people that they are, always leave themselves last.  We do not need surveys and research to know that.  Society does not credit or acknowledge financially the caring work of women in the home.  We have a miserly carer's allowance which is means tested.  I agree with Deputy Byrne on the obscenity of some of the means <Col N="1781" /> testing we have here.  The means tested carer's allowance totally denies the intrinsic value of the work being done. That is the greatest obscenity of all.  It does not take into account the nurturing, round-the-clock caring and responsibility that goes with those jobs.</P>
    <P>This leads to the devaluation of work outside the home that continues to be done by women, work called &ldquo;women's work&rdquo;.  We have turned decent work values on their heads.  By denying free access to optical and dental treatment for married women who are not earning in their own right, means that we are turning the clock back pre-1972.  Deputy Byrne referred to one report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I would refer the House to the first report of the Commission on the Status of Women, published in 1972.  We have lobbied with regard to the recommendations in it since.  It concluded that one of the most important supports and services which should be given to women in the home who are without earning capacity, was dental and optical treatment, even if it was only to be extended to the spouses of contributing husbands.  The Minister has turned the clock back pre-1972.  I cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>The women's right committees, at European Parliament level and at national parliament level, are lobbying strongly for women's rights.  We hope to meet the Minister soon to make the point that women should be credited in their own right for the work they do in the home.  Until that is recognised positively, this proposition is removing one of the few supports and acknowledgements they have.  When the Minister reconsiders this he cannot possibly allow it to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly defended his officials.  Every Minister must do that, particularly when there are five of them around him.  The Minister cannot take the credit for this himself because his predecessor, who was only a short period in office, Deputy Daly, announced the introduction of means testing for PRSI and he announced that <Col N="1782" /> optical and dental benefit would not be allowed for those earning over £25,000. He also announced the means testing of the deserted wife's benefit.  This was on the table before this Minister came into office.  It is hard to know whether this idea was Deputy Daly's or his predecessor's or the officials' idea, but I agree with everything that has been said about this. The Minister, before he was appointed was known as a caring, liberal person whose views we would all agree with. However, he has introduced the most hard-nosed Social Welfare Bill ever put before this House.  The Minister is turning everything upside down.</P>
      <P>Like another speaker, I wonder is the means testing for PRSI constitutional. Under the PRSI scheme people pay for benefits.  All entitlements under it are now at risk.  Unemployment benefit after redundancy is at risk in this Bill for nine weeks.  Sickness benefit for those on unemployment assistance is at risk as well.  Sickness benefit will be means tested and free dental and optical benefits, things which were paid for over the years, are to be lost.  Under the VHI system one pays for benefits.  One may have to increase payments but one knows what benefits one will get.  One can also get annual reports from the VHI.  I wonder if there is any PRSI scheme at all.  Do the Minister and the Government regard PRSI contributions as just another tax?  Does it all go into the Exchequer to be paid out later?  Is there a pay-related social insurance scheme?  Is the Minister saying that more is going out than is coming in?  Has the Minister had an actuarial assessment done and reported?  Are there annual reports?  Can the Minister tell us how much he is taking in each year and how much he is paying out each year? One can get that information from the VHI or from any other insurance scheme. I have never seen such a report and I doubt if there is such a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If means testing is introduced it will be a disaster.  As in every case of means testing, the PAYE worker will come off worst.  When one is paid a wage or a salary it cannot be concealed.  Before a person gets his wages the deductions are <Col N="1783" /> made.  There is no hiding it.  It is more difficult to discover the earnings of professionals and self-employed people and to discover at what precise stage they reach £25,000, or whatever figure is put on it.  Means testing will hit the PAYE person straight away.  The Minister has not assessed the enormity of what he is doing.  I agree with this amendment but this system if means testing goes right through this Bill.  Once it starts there is no end to it.  Next year and in the year after, it will be easier to adjust the ceilings and to make other cut-off points for a whole series of things in the PRSI scheme.  This will destroy the PRSI system.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister said that one of his aims would be to try to ensure that the system caters for everybody who needs it, that it will actively encourage enterprise and will enable people to improve their situation. The PRSI system gave people a certain independence, a feeling that they were paying their insurance and getting their entitlements.  Now that is all gone.  In the current climate jobs are not for life any more.  People are paying PRSI and they will have something in the kitty if they lose their job.  Now they are not covered for these benefits.  There will be very strong reaction against paying PRSI as a result of this Bill.  People will want to pay into their own insurance schemes for dental and optical benefits.  The whole system will break down.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider.  How much does he propose to save by this measure?  Let him give us some figures to show why it must be done.  What is the purpose?  Is it to save money or to provide a better system?  The Minister has not shown that this system will work better than the other system or that people will be better off and improve themselves. Their situation will be much worse.</P>

      <P>It might be appropriate for me to say that it would be unfortunate and undesirable if in this friendly atmosphere we were to establish a precedent whereby we would differentiate <Col N="1784" /> between any Minister and his officials.  Reference has been made to it in a friendly fashion.  Traditionally we do not say anything either complimentary or derogatory about officials who are in attendance or who are absent.  If the Minister wears the palm he also carries the can.  That is the way it should be.</P>

We must direct our firepower at the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Minister is taking a retrograde step in this matter.  We have been told that 18,000 people will be affected because they earn more than £25,000.  A single earner in a family with an income of £25,000 may have to bear heavy expenses after the deduction of income tax.  These might include mortgage repayments, VHI contributions and life assurance premiums, on which tax relief is to be abolished.  Children going to university may have to be supported and an income of £25,000 may be rather small in these circumstances.  As salaries increase, so do standards of living.  The only perk enjoyed by many people as a result of PRSI contributions is optical and dental benefit.  People on reasonable salaries make a generous contribution to the social insurance fund and we should not lose their confidence.  We should acknowledge their contribution, but unfortunately the Minister is doing the opposite by introducing a cut-off point at £25,000.  There is also the fear that it will be reduced in future years to £23,000 or £22,000.</P>

      <P>I referred last night to automatic entitlement and the whole question of the social insurance fund.  The <Col N="1785" /> proposal in the Bill is reasonable.  It was announced by my predecessor last December but it is a decision I am prepared to stand over.  The announcement was made in the context of the Estimates for 1992 and if I wanted to change it I could.  I do not.</P>
      <P>There is no section in the Bill dealing with treatment benefits, although Deputy Connaughton has mentioned them in the amendments.  Existing regulations will be sufficient to deal with any changes.</P>

      <P>All politicians want to have it both ways.  The extension of the scheme to dependent spouses of qualified insured persons was hard won.  Deputies who have spoken fought to achieve this. When the extension was established in theory, the scheme could not operate because most dentists refused to co-operate. An extra 300,000 people were theoretically covered for dental benefit, bringing the total eligible number to 1.3 million.  It was a wonderful idea and a hard won battle, but the rules were changed by the dentists.</P>
      <P>Much work was done before I came to the Department to resolve the dispute with the dentists.  I had three choices.  I could have scrapped the scheme of treatment benefits in its entirety and let people with medical cards rely on the GMS.  That was one option which would have saved money for the State.  I could have let the scheme trundle on in its unsatisfactory way.  A pyrrhic victory had been won in that the dentists would not operate the scheme.  The third choice was to attempt to sort out the problem with the Dental Association.  That is what I have decided to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the social insurance fund is not self-financing.  In reply to Deputy Tomás McGiolla, the accounts of the social insurance fund are published and are available in the Government Publications office.  The appropriation accounts that are laid before the Dáil affect the social insurance fund.  This year the State will pay about <Col N="1786" /> £143 million into the social insurance fund.  Therefore, the fund is not self-financing. There are restrictions in many areas of social insurance.  In some areas there is automatic entitlement but in those cases people have to build up a level of contributions.  That system has always operated.  Some people pay high rates of PRSI but get nothing from it while others pay less and get a lot from it.  Therefore, there is a redistribution element in regard to pay related social insurance, as is self-evident from the figures. A later section of the Bill deals with increasing PRSI but there is a ceiling on this insurance.  Deputy Byrne pointed out that the party of which he was formerly a member have been in favour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is logic to the argument that there should be no ceiling in that whatever income one earns one would pay pay-related social insurance at a corresponding rate.  However, if that system applied I would not be able to defend the introduction of an income limit in relation to treatment benefits. Whatever about Deputies in the middle of the Floor, the Deputies over there would be the first to say that we would be introducing an extra tax, thus taking more money out of people's pockets.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I have explained the background to this measure.  The Government should get some credit for resolving the long running dental dispute. I was very impressed with what Deputy Monica Barnes had to say.  I know that she is deeply concerned about these matters, but she is raising them with the wrong person.  I know of married couples on incomes well in excess of £25,000 where the husband locks the phone before he goes out in the morning.  There are many such cases, and I am not referring to people in the more affluent parts of Dublin or Kildare.  I spoke earlier today about child benefit and so on. There are avenues open to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Government to deal with these matters.  Is it not the Government's place to interfere in relationships, be they between husbands and wives or whoever.  However, I agree with what Deputy Barnes has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton and Deputy Browne, who put down this amendment, referred to the dependency ratio.  As I said last night, if money was plentiful I certainly would not be making restictions in this or any other area.  However, money is not plentiful.  If we were to introduce dependency ratios, as suggested by Deputy Connaughton and others, it would result in greater State expenditure and consequently there would be a greater burden on the taxpayers. Social Welfare expenditure is estimated at over £3.36 billion for 1992 and therefore corrective action must be taken.  I will deal later with people earning £24,000 as referred to by Deputy Connaughton. Deputy Liam Kavanagh referred to treatment claims.  The Department estimate that roughtly 4 per cent of the 450,000 treatment claims &mdash; 18,000 claims &mdash; would be affected if we change the system.  At present I am anxious to bring into the system wives whose husbands earn £10,000 but who receive no dental benefit because dentists will not operate the scheme.  As a result of the dispute, which went on for a long <Col N="1788" /> time, many people are not getting dental benefit.  We brought into the system dependent spouses of insured workers but because of the dispute the system never came into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne referred to a scheme for children.  The scheme to which he referred is a Department of Health scheme.  I have nothing to do with that and I have no great desire to be Minister for Health.  However, I am aware of the growing problems in the Eastern Health Board area with regard to that scheme and I hope my colleague will do something about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell put forward a great case which I answered in referring to social insurance generally.  She and other Deputies believe that we are introducing a dangerous precedent in the social insurance system.  As I said last night, and I will spell it out again tonight, we have to consider these matters in the context of overall State expenditure. There will have to be some rationale in the system; otherwise, expenditure will keep rising.  It is only fair to point out to Deputies now that in next year's budget there may be proposals with which they will not be pleased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>Deputy Nora Owen, in a flowery and entertaining speech, said that this would be a bitter pill to swallow. She said very nice things about my boyish good humour.  I think I have aged a lot since I came to this Department.  At least I feel a lot older.  I do not know whether the strains would be the same, but I do not feel much different about it.  What I am about to say might be a bitter pill to swallow: if I do not make savings in areas in which I think people can afford to carry the cost then it is possible that in ten years it could be that we will not have the money to pay old age pensions.  If the costs relating to unemployment and everything else keep on increasing then Deputy Byrne will be right, it is quite possible that in ten years there will not be the money needed to pay those who really need assistance, the elderly. Anyone with a social conscience would realise that it is better to restrict the entitlements of a small number of people at the upper levels.  In that regard I am not saying that those who earn £25,000 and pay taxes are very well off.  However, they are a damned sight better off than a man earning £8,000 who lives in Daragh Park, Newbridge, County Kildare, and whose wife does not go to a dentist operating within the scheme, and they are better off than those living in Clondalkin or Ballyfermot.  Some restrictions must be made, and this provision is more than reasonable.</P>

      <P>I have already dealt with the queries raised by Deputy Mac Giolla about the annual accounts. The Government are adopting a reasonable approach.  Although I cannot anticipate what the Dental Association will do in the next few weeks, I hope a decision will be made very shortly.  I understand that association members will be balloted in the very near future.  It is to be hoped that the dental dispute will soon be at an end and that dentists throughout the country will be operating the scheme. A small percentage of dentists will be <Col N="1790" /> affected by the measure I am introducing. At the moment the majority of people cannot get dental treatment because very few dentists are operating the scheme. The measure proposed is reasonable and fair and I am prepared to stand by it.</P>

      <P>I said that I would come back to a point made by Deputy Connaughton and I have not done so. Deputy Connaughton raised the position of a two-income family in which both spouses earned £24,000.  Regulations are being drafted in the hope that the dentists' dispute will soon come to an end and they will take account of some anomalies in that regard.  At the same time, and as Deputy Barnes will be aware, the position is complex.  I could give the House many examples of difficulties.  If a wife earned £28,000 and her husband earned £24,000, the gross income of that couple would be £52,000, and the wife in her own right would have entitlements. Deputy Barnes, others and the present distinguished Uachtarán na hÉireann fought long and hard in the courts of Ireland and in the courts of Europe for equal treatment.  I recognise the anomalies that Deputies are referring to and we have discussed such anomalies in the Department in the past week, but we must also guard against unfair advantage. I am sure that Deputy Barnes would be one of the first to say that women who earn £28,000 in their own right do not need too much assistance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Owen spoke about redundancy. In the regulations to be prescribed by the Government in the very near future we will try to take account of the issues to which the Deputy referred. Much consideration has been given to <Col N="1791" /> this because the matter is quite complicated. On the one hand, we have to ensure that women get equal treatment and, on the other hand, we have to have equity in the system.  As Deputy Connaughton pointed out, there has to be a balance to provide both for single-income families with an income of about £27,000 and two-income families with a combined income of £48,000 or more.  We shall try to frame the regulations in a way that will clear the anomalies in the system.  The Government have recognised the difficulties, which is why the drafting of the regulations is proving somewhat difficult.</P>

      <P>The total cost of the treatment benefit provision this year will be of the order of £14 million.  May I point out that there will be considerable additional costs to the Exchequer in years to come if the dental dispute is resolved because there will be a greater take-up of these schemes.  Therefore, there will be considerable additional costs to the State in 1993, for example, if the dental dispute is resolved because all of the people who theoretically have been within the system but who have been unable to find any dentist to treat them will, if treated henceforth, will incur considerable additional cost.  That was part of the thinking in having an income limit at this stage or having some restriction on it.  There will be considerable cost implications in 1993 <i>et sequiter</i> on account of resolving the dispute.</P>

If the dispute with the dentists ends in the near future, as I announced at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis, the hope would be that the scheme would be up and running from July next.  That is the tentative provision, <Col N="1795" /> that it would come into operation and be applicable for the half year only.  The Department had to estimate the number of additional people who would be eligible under this scheme.  We are not too sure what will be the saving as a result of this decision because we do not know the actual additional numbers who will be eligible under the provisions of the scheme.  Theoretically there were 300,000 extra persons, but we do not know how many of them will take up the provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer this debate continues the more I am convinced that there is an altogether hidden agenda behind the reason for this proposal. It is my firm belief that it is undermining the PRSI system.  I predict that next year, the following year and the one thereafter will bring a gradual lowering of the ceiling and erosion of benefits for PRSI contributors.  I have no doubt that what the workforce in that factory in Galway said to me the other evening is true: that they can foresee the time when they will lose substantial benefits.  I could understand if the Minister could tell me he expected to save £X million but he does not know how much he will save. This means that the Minister and the Department are buying a pig in a poke because they do not know how many people will enter the system.  Therefore, they could not have based their assessment on that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also noted the Ministerial regulation proposal.  I should have thought the Department would have their minds made up once the Bill had been introduced here and would tell Members exactly what they proposed doing.  I contend the ministerial regulation proposal is passing the ball across very quickly.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot tell us openly in the House exactly what he intends doing because we will not have a chance of discussing this again. Irrespective of what we do this evening &mdash; and I will be putting this to a vote in a few minutes' time &mdash; from the Minister's point of view it would appear that that is <Col N="1796" /> all anybody can do about it.  However, that is not good business.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was satisfied that no more than 18,000 persons would be eligible.  Yet in the same breath he told me he expects a great deal more people to avail of the provisions of the scheme because the dentists will be operating it this year.  Therefore, by definition there will be considerably more than 18,000 people dissatisfied; in fact, I have no doubt whatever that there may be twice that number.  I want to put on the record that what the Minister is doing is an absolute reversal, an about-turn, on the whole question of eligibility and benefits people believed they had under the PRSI system.  I believe it involves a breach of contract with people who entered the scheme in good faith, that is, between the Minister's Department and contributors. I predict it will be seen for what it is, that there will be nobody in this State paying PRSI contributions who will not have the jitters this evening because they will know their turn will come.  I predict that that will be the Minister's experience in coming weeks nationwide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to seek clarification for one of the 18,000 people who contacted me.  Let us examine the position at present.  The person in question has an income of £25,000 annually and has been receiving dental and optical benefit for himself; luckily he has found a dentist who will treat his spouse in addition to her receiving optical benefit. After the introduction of the regulations will that man be paying the same percentage of his salary in PRSI contributions? This is an unprecedented proposal.  That person has asked me to ascertain exactly what will happen.  Will the Minister say whether he will be paying exactly the same amount, or does the Minister propose to reduce the contributions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fennell is trying to get me to say that I am going to reduce PRSI.  I am not, and she knows very well that I do not propose doing so.  That would be a total reversal.  I am <Col N="1797" /> introducing this particular restriction for the reasons I have outlined, reasons which are reasonable and fair.  I contend it is better to have greater numbers of people eligible under the system &mdash; that is dependent spouses &mdash; receiving these benefits than having them all theoretically insured.  I hope this dispute will be resolved in the very near future with the proposal advanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wants to know how we arrived at that figure.  I remember that in previous years there were 450,000 claims.  It is estimated that 3 or 4 per cent of that number will be affected.  This is how the figure of 18,000 has been arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put the points made by the Deputies into context.  The cost of treatment under the scheme is between £50 <Col N="1798" /> and £60, and we are asking people with incomes of over £25,000 to pay £50 or £60 for their treatment.  I think these figures speak for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a point.  The Minister has said three or four times that it is better for people on lower incomes to be able to benefit from the system brought in a few years ago.  I should like to remind the Minister that great savings have been made by his Department because the system has not worked very well.  The Minister referred to the amount he will have to spend to get the system up and running but, of course, the State has saved a considerable amount of money under the system brought in a few years ago.  I hope those savings have been stored in the Department and will be spent on this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has repeatedly said that it is better to bring more people into the scheme and that by setting the ceiling he will be able to get the system up and running.  The only logical connection between what the Minister is saying and what he proposes to do is that somebody somewhere must have said to the Minister, &ldquo;we will operate the system and bring those people into benefit if you do certain things&rdquo;.  Otherwise there is no logic to what the Minister is doing.  He has not yet drawn the connection between setting the ceiling and bringing people on lower incomes into the system.  If the connection is not the dentists, what is it? I have not yet found the connection.</P>

      <P>If in years to come the scheme is extended to include the dependent spouses of qualified insured people for whom the Deputies on the opposite side of the House have fought a great battle, the battle will be won but no one will gain.  I think I know what Deputy Owen was getting at.  I recognise <Col N="1799" /> the anomalies in the scheme to which Deputy Connaughton and others have referred.  Three hundred thousand extra people have been brought into the scheme since 1987.  I have decided to set a limit because I anticipate some considerable funding costs arising from 1993 onwards.  I do not expect 300,000 people to suddenly visit their dentists when this dispute is over.  That is not going to happen but if dentists operate the scheme considerable numbers of people will avail themselves of it in years to come.  To use football jargon, which Deputy Reynolds will understand, I am getting the retaliation in first.  I have to set some limit because I anticipate funding costs arising in years to come.  I am setting a reasonable income limit in this respect.  That is the rationale behind the thinking here.</P>

The Minister says he wants to bring more people into the scheme.  Leaving the dentists and the Dental Association aside, the hidden agenda is that the Minister wants to make savings.  He cannot give us any figures on the savings.  However, there will be major savings in a few years time when the Minister moves the ceiling down to £20,000.</P>

However, I cannot reiterate often enough &mdash; the Minister agreed with me on this point &mdash; that some women married to men who earn £60,000-£100,000 do not have one penny of their own and they do not enjoy the goodwill or generosity of their husbands to be able to go to dentists.  I do not want people to have it both ways; I am in favour of fairness.  If the Minister brings in this provision which will work against women in the home, then a legal provision will have to be introduced which will guarantee women a portion of the incomes of their husbands so that women could choose how to spent the money which would then be legally hers.  This is the position in other countries.  The Minister should remember that many women have no financial independence, regardless of their husband's income.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is late, but having waited nine years for this opportunity tonight, I will leave a little bit over for the morning when Deputy Byrne and I will take over. I will now tell Members a little about the history of the PRSI system.  I was elected to this House in November 1982 as a rookie backbencher.  I was full of ideas about social welfare having been involved at senior level in the trade union movement at Congress and I was also general secretary of my own union.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows &mdash; he was formerly a member of the national executive that pioneered the PRSI system in this country, we fought for a system similar to that which operated in Great Britain at that time.  It was the policy of Congress and the trade union movement to put pressure on Government to introduce the PRSI system.  PRSI did not come from Government but was introduced as a result of pressure from the entire trade union movement, of which I was proud to be a part.  When I took my seat on 25 November of that year, the Government had prepared the Social Welfare Bill, 1981.  Very reluctantly I found that I could not vote for that Bill and the reason that I could not vote for it is emerging in this House tonight.  I will explain the reason in greater detail tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>The PRSI system had been introduced and workers who unfortunately lost their jobs and were on unemployment or disability benefit received a payment of 30 per cent of their wages.  That Bill, which proposed to reduce the level of PRSI from 30 to 20 per cent, was handed from one Minister to another, as is happening on this occasion &mdash; it is history repeating itself.  I do not even have to look at the record of that time but I spelled out the consequences.  I warned Members on every side of the House, but they did not understand the PRSI system and they still do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PRSI systems means you get what <Col N="1806" /> you pay for.  We did not vote simply for that reason because there should not be any floor or any ceiling.  That is the concept of the PRSI system as introduced in Great Britain and adopted here.  We are not constructing houses, we are talking about the income of working class people who pay for the system.  Therefore, you should pay on what you earn and you should be paid accordingly when you are unemployed.  Because the system was messed up in 1981 we are now faced with confusion.  I have been listening to the debate and I do not think anybody in the House understands what PRSI is about. They are talking about putting ceilings here and there.  You can argue until the cows come home.  Unless you have a system where every worker, irrespective of the level of his earnings, pays a certain percentage which is matched by the employer, so that when workers are unemployed or sick they are paid in accordance with the level of contribution they make, the system does not exist. That is the reason it is going down the sink.  I have waited for nine years to tell the House that.  I am tired now, it is late at night, but I will be in better form in the morning to explain the detail of it.</P>
    <P>The situation is simply this.  If you continue to raise and lower ceilings you will simply destroy the system.  As I said in my opening remarks two days ago, it would be better to scrap the PRSI system altogether, increase the level of contribution rate and increase the benefit and have one straight payment of social welfare for people who are unemployed. The problem is that the administration of the system is expensive and workers and employers alike are confused.  Money is being taken out of industry and out of labour intensive industries that cannot afford to pay.  Companies are going down the sink every day and we find they are £250,000 in the red in PRSI and tax.  In one company in my own constituency a sum of £400,000 was not paid.  When companies go into liquidation the largest portion of outstanding moneys is always PAYE and PRSI.  If you go to the trouble of examining that you will see that millions of pounds are not going into the system.</P>
    <P>I worked a three day week.  I do not <Col N="1807" /> have any professional qualifications.  I am not an architect, a solicitor or a farmer. I depend on what I earn here.  The Ceann Comhairle knows because he worked in the same industry as I did.  At one stage I was his union official so we can talk in the same language.  The situation was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have waited a long time to say what I have to say tonight.  I am speaking to the section.  I am not speaking to the amendment.  I was given to understand I could do that because I could not say all I want to say in relation to the amendment in the name of Fine Gael.  I have to say it on the section.  Please try to bear with me.  I do not often offend the Chair and I will not do so tonight either.</P>
      <P>Labour Party policy is clear on this matter.  We think a worker should pay on his total earnings, whether he is a solicitor, a carpenter, a plumber, a factory work or a lorry driver; but when he is sick and out of work he should be paid accordingly.  That is the principle of the PRSI system.  That is the principle we should start looking at.  If we got back to that principle workers and employers alike would be far better off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We used to go to the labour exchange in the local community, whether in Dundalk or Drogheda, and sign on every day. At the end of the year you got a card and bought a stamp which was put on the card and presented to the employer.  The worker could go into the wages office, take out his card and see how many stamps were on it.  The employer had to go to the post office, buy the stamps, lick the stamps and put them on the card.  The workers and the shop steward could walk into the office an say &ldquo;Listen, manager, I want my card.  How many stamps are on it?&rdquo; He could walk down to the labour exchange, hand it in and he would know his money was paid.  We then introduced this high falutin' technology which was going to solve all our problems, but it has messed up the whole system completely. Nobody knows now until the examiner <Col N="1808" /> goes into the company or until the company goes into liquidation whether the money has been paid.  A worker on the factory floor has no way, good, bad or indifferent, of knowing whether any money is paid in.  That is the situation and the mess that has been created by this high falutin' system.  When the system was kept simple workers knew where they stood.  If anybody went to the labour exchange with unpaid stamps it was their own fault or that of the shop steward or the local branch committee operating on behalf of the union.  That is what we got away from and that is where we made the mistake.</P>
    <P>The more computerisation we have in the Department the more racketeers will be going around in industry and the more money that will be lost to the system.  I was pleased when the Minister announced yesterday that he hoped to get a central system where one could see the record of each worker.  Under the old system of cards one could see whether the money was paid in or not.  I and most Deputies on all sides of this House spend a great deal of time checking with the records section of the Department of Social Welfare to see how many stamps were paid for last year and the year before.  One person who understands the system is Deputy Barnes.  If we were to do as suggested by some people, Mná na hÉireann would not be covered for insurance because the men would not pay; instead they would spend the money on drink, cigarettes or gambling.  Women are not covered as equal partners in the social welfare system; they are called dependent spouses and are paid a reduced amount of money.  Deputy Monica Barnes was perfectly correct when she made that point.  She has my full and absolute support.  She understands what would happen in the social welfare system if we introduced the minefield suggested by one Deputy.  I know it was not done with any ill intent but if we were to adopt that approach we would destroy the social welfare system for the women of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should get down to talking about the social welfare system in the morning. I have a few suggestions to make and a few facts and figures to present.  I will <Col N="1809" /> present them in the morning after I and everybody else have had a few hours sleep and have the patience to listen to me.  The social welfare PRSI system was destroyed in 1981 by the then Government who introduced that Bill.  I have been trying for nine years &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle is well aware of this as I have raised it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and elsewhere &mdash; to pay into the PRSI system but the Minister's Department will not allow me.  Before I became a Dáil Deputy I paid stamps for 30 years, all of which are gone down the sink.  If I was unemployed in the morning I could not even draw unemployment assistance because I would have £130 of a pension, which would be the maximum, and on a means test basis I would not qualify for unemployment assistance even though I have worked for 30 years in industry and represented workers all over the country.  After nine solid years and four Governments I still cannot pay into the system.  Everybody should be in the PRSI system and should pay in full. Then the Minister would have the money to compensate and pay the lower income groups who need to be supported and so get the lower income families off the ground.  He can only do that if everybody pays their fair share in equal amounts based on the total level of their earnings. I will explain in the morning how that should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming into the House to respond.  I should say at the outset that I do not hold the Minister responsible for the great lapse that I have identified.  I do not know the reason for this but it has not been given the attention needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 247 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, states that &ldquo;the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall, in respect of each year, make to the Minister a report upon every mental institution...and the care <Col N="1810" /> of patients therein, and shall include in such report a general account relating to such year of the administration of the law relating to mental institutions and the care, welfare and treatment of persons of unsound mind&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When I went to the Oireachtas Library, which is a reference point when one wants to find out what is happening in relation to the care of patients in mental hospitals, to look for the reports I was surprised to learn that the last report published was for the years 1977-79 and was published in 1982.  I asked where the other reports were, having regard to the fact that there has been a number of developments since 1979.</P>
    <P>For instance, although the Health (Mental Services) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 1981 it has not been brought into force.  I would like to know what the Minister and the Department are going to do about this.  In 1984 the Department of Health produced the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i> Can the Minister tell us if any of its recommendations have been implemented? There has also been a change from institutional to hostel based care while those found criminally insane are sent to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  In recent years a number of people have been forcibly detained in mental hospitals against their will, which is the source of major concern.  The most recent case was highlighted in the newspapers last Saturday.</P>
    <P>All these matters should be reported on because we have an obligation to patients in mental hospitals, who have no voice and few rights.  Indeed, many of them have been abandoned during the years by their own relations and no one knows what has happened to them or where they are.  I should say that the inspector of mental hospitals is not functioning properly.  After their release, those who had been detained sought in vain to obtain details from the inspector on the reasons they were detained. Indeed many of them did not even receive a reply.  I am dealing here with a number of people and they feel very frustrated.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I give the Minister <Col N="1811" /> the opportunity to explain what he is going to do about this matter.  I ask him to make reports available for each of the years in respect of which we do not have reports in this important area so that we can see for ourselves what the conditions are in mental hospitals at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell) John F. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fennell for highlighting this issue.  I would like to clarify at the outset that the last report on mental hospitals prepared by the inspector of mental hospitals and laid before each House of the Oireachtas was an amalgamated report in respect of the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the statutory obligation placed upon the inspector of mental hospitals under section 247 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to make an annual report to me on each psychiatric hospital and in the case of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, under section 248 of the Act, and for each report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a copy furnished to the President of the High Court.  The Deputy will, however, be aware that following the presentation of the 1977 to 1979 reports the Department of Health concentrated resources on the preparation and drafting of fresh legislation intended to repeal all existing legislation in regard to the treatment of mental illness and to replace it with provisions which would have full regard to modern developments in the care of the mentally ill.  This work culminated in the enactment of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, which included provision for the registration and, more importantly, the supervision of the operation of centres for the care of the mentally ill.</P>
      <P>The Act provided for the replacement of the inspectorate of mental hospitals with a provision for the inspection of psychiatric centres and homes by officers of the Minister for Health.  The Act also repealed the Minister for Health's obligation under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, to lay the inspection reports before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enactment of the Health (Mental Services) Act, 1981, was intended to provide <Col N="1812" /> the necessary legal framework to assist the future development of psychiatric services as envisaged by the study group appointed by the Minister for Health in October 1981 to examine the future development of psychiatric services. The growing uncertainties over the operation of this Act following its enactment, and in particular the implications for the repeal of sections 247 and 248 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and the Minister for Health's obligation to the Houses of the Oireachtas, coincided with the Department of Health providing a dominant and leading role in the study group which published the report <i>Planning for the Future</i> published in 1984.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the concentration of effort by my Department in assisting local health authorities in implementing the recommendations of the report <i>Planning for the Future,</i> particularly the fundamental shift from institutional to community based care for the mentally ill, I am acutely conscious of the time lapse since inspection reports on psychiatric hospitals have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I can assure the Deputy that an amalgamation of reports for the years 1988 and 1989 is at an advanced stage of preparation and will be presented to the House shortly.  The report for 1990 is currently being compiled and will be completed in due course.  I will see to it that the report for 1991 is made available within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the current inspector of mental hospitals, who took up duty in late 1987, and his assistant inspector prepare detailed reports on their inspections of psychiatric facilities.  Public psychiatric hospitals are inspected every year and private psychiatric hospitals once every six months. These detailed reports are sent to the chief executive officer of the responsible health board in respect of public psychiatric hospitals and to the person in charge of each private facility.  In each case the chief executive officer or person in charge is asked to respond to the comments made on the hospital and the inspector's recommendations for improvements. These reports have been a major catalyst in improving standards of care in our <Col N="1813" /> psychiatric hospitals.  As the inspector's annual reports will show when published, there have been major advances in the quality of life for patients in psychiatric hospitals in recent years.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently preparing a discussion document on mental health which will outline the progress which has been made in the psychiatric service in recent years, identify service priorities of the future and suggest a new legal framework for the psychiatric services. The role of the inspectorate of psychiatric service will be an issue raised in the disucssion document for discussion with interestd parties.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Department, I would like to apologise to Deputy Fennell for the non-appearance of these reports.  I will get what information I can as quickly as possible and make it available to Deputy Fennell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  We all accept the necessity for providing athletic and sporting facilities throughout the country. The development undertaken by An Ríocht Sports Club in Castleisland is taking place in a county with a rich tradition in track and field athletics.  Indeed the county has produced a number of international athletes.  The project requires substantial investment from the Government. Until this project was undertaken, the facilities available in County Kerry for track and field sports were totally inadequate.  Notwithstanding the inadequacy that persisted, Kerry has produced international and national champions and also Olympic contestants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Castleisland is a town which will benefit enormously from this development. The town does not have any major public park and this project would serve as a public park and area for relaxation.  The town has six schools and there are 11 schools in the catchment area catering for a large young population with huge potential.  This is a very ambitious project. The costings, which I am sure the Minister has in his Department, amount <Col N="1814" /> to £620,000 for a four phase development.</P>
    <P>This project is worth supporting.  It offers enormous potential for the development of athletics and field and track sports in this country.  The project will need substantial investment from Government agencies.  I am glad of the opportunity to bring that to the attention of the Minister involved.  I would invite the Minister to take the opportunity on his next visit to the county to look at the facilities which are being developed.  This is a huge undertaking for what is a very successful athletics club, which has made its mark on Irish and international athletics. The project needs support.  The people of Castleisland and of County Kerry are giving it great support, but the scale of the undertaking means that they will require substantial public investment. I would urge the Minister to give tonight a commitment to that public investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must make it clear at the very start that all the money provided under the amenities-recreational facilities grants scheme in 1991 was fully allocated. In effect, the 1991 scheme is finished and it only now remains for the grants that were allocated to be paid, according as the work is done and proper claims are submitted.  The full list of the projects to which grants were allocated is in the Oireachtas Library.  There is no provision in my Department's Vote for new grant allocation in 1992.</P>
      <P>The local authorities recommended over 3,600 applications, worth nearly £282 million, to my Department for funding under the 1991 scheme.  The total amount sought in grants was £121 million. There was just £4 million to give out and this was allocated to 982 of the recommended projects.  It was inevitable that there would be many disappointed applicants and that many of those who were successful in obtaining grants would be disappointed at the amount they received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application from the Riocht Athletic Club for a grant of £10,000 for the completion of a running track was recommended by Kerry County Council to my <Col N="1815" /> Department for grant purposes under the 1991 scheme.  In the event the project was allocated a grant of £4,000.  A claim for payment of the grant in full was submitted by Kerry County Council to my Department on 20 February 1992 and the grant was paid on 4 March.  In those circumstances I hope the Deputy will accept that there was no undue delay by my Department in dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>As I often visit Kerry, I will be glad to avail of the invitation from Deputy Spring, to see the facilities.  Unfortunately, in the context of the 1992 allocation, it might not have the result which the Deputy seeks.  These projects being undertaken by volunteers in terms of community services are ones that deserve maximum consideration, but in the context of this year's Estimates I understand that considerable resources from the lottery were dedicated to mental handicap.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the delay in the provision of an extension of Causeway Comprehensive School, County Kerry, resulting in students being forced to take classes in substandard accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  The board of management of Causeway Comprehensive School and Kerry vocational education committee have been compaigning for the past 12 years for the provision of phase two of their school.  Phase one was completed in 1980.  Throughout the years there have been many meetings, letters, departmental visits and deputations regarding the proposed extension.  The Department finally committed themselves to providing a smaller extension of 830 square metres in the mid eighties. The Department of Education in a letter dated 25 May 1990 said that they were prepared to facilitate the rapid development of the project to the stage where tenders could be invited.  At a meeting on 28 May 1990, Kerry vocational education <Col N="1816" /> committee accepted the Department's schedule and since December 1991 completed planning permissions have been with the Department.</P>
      <P>All associated with the project were bitterly disappointed when the list of projects authorised by the outgoing Minister for start-up in 1992 were announced.  To all concerned the Department's formal commitment to the early provision of phase two is now as valueless as previous commitments.</P>
      <P>At the moment classes take place at four different locations &mdash; in the new school, in the old school, in prefabs on the site of the old school and in an old hall in the village.  Six hundred and twenty pupils attend the school although there is only sufficient accommodation for 500.  In the 1970s a committee and board of management agreed to accept the use of the old building only in the context of additional facilities to be provided on the new site which would allow for the lowest possible level of student movement over the exposed 400 metre connecting path and across the hazardous main road from Causeway to Bally-heigue. The movement of students from the old school to the new school results in major inconvenience, especially in bad weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Causeway Comprehensive School is of major importance to the area.  The school represents the amalgamation of three post primary schools and it has become the major focus for communtiy organisations. The school has co-operated with the local community to provide a fully developed games pitch and handball facilities together with changing room and shower facilities.  The facilities are owned by the vocational education committee and shared with the community. The school has also developed a folk museum with special emphasis on agriculture and machinery.  This school has a major role to play in serving as a focus for a scattered rural community.  Its development is very much in line with the EC policy expressed in the document <i>The Future of Rural Society.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present Causeway school is losing many of its potential enrolments because of the failure of the Department to provide <Col N="1817" /> adequate accommodation.  Present accommodation is grossly inadequate. The library continually occupied by two classes.  There is not any sports hall or covered recreation area for the students. Constant wettings and chillings are experienced as children move across the open hillside between the buildings in bad weather.  The delay in providing phase 2 of the school has served to weaken the school's ability to broaden its programmes and enhance its attraction to students who are now being canvassed by other post-primary schools.  The spread of the school is causing problems with timetabling.  Timetabling necessitates the movement of 240 students at various times over a distance of 450 metres.  This results in loss of tuition time. The timetable must cope with movements of students, limited accommodation and restrictions on specialised rooms.  This causes the students to suffer seriously on educational grounds.  This unsatisfactory position has been recognised by the Department officials.</P>
    <P>It is extremely regrettable and most frustrating that because of lack of action by the Department the development of this school is being held back and its growth stunted.  The school is not reaching its full potential and is prevented from providing a better education service for the pupils of the area.</P>
    <P>The teachers, parents and pupils of Causeway Comprehensive School are becoming increasingly frustrated and impatient at the lack of progress and obvious lack of commitment to this project. It is past time for the Minister to act to ensure the proper development of this school.  I look forward to the Minister's confirmation that phase 2 of the school will be allowed to go to tender immediately so that work can commence in 1992.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it will enable me to inform the House of the up-to-date position with regard to this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot comment in any substantial way on what was promised in 1984, although I understand that various changes in the plans for the school and changing <Col N="1818" /> financial circumstances were involved.  My main concern at this stage, which I am sure is shared by the Deputy, is to progress the project from this point on as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>It may be of some assistance if I briefly provide some details of the project in planning for Causeway and outline the recent developments to illustrate that there has been no unreasonable delay in recent times in the planning of the accommodation.</P>
    <P>The project at Causeway involves the provision by County Kerry vocational education committee of over 800 square metres of additional accommodation at the school, at a projected cost of over £400,000.  This accommodation consists of three general classrooms and specialist classrooms for science, mechanical drawing, two woodwork rooms, a metalwork room, as well as ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The planning of this accommodation involves a set of detailed architectural stages being prepared by the design team, which are then carefully examined in the Department to ensure that the accommodation is as planned for, that the required standards are met and that cost control measures to ensure value for money for the State are implemented.</P>
    <P>The latest stage of planning, the combined detailed design bill of quantities submission was requested by the Department on 1 November 1991 and received from the vocational education committee in January 1992.  Since then the submission has been carefully examined by the Department's technical staff and in a letter of 25 February 1992 the County Kerry vocational education committee were asked to arrange for some amendments to the submission.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee responded to the Department's letter on 6 March 1992, but indicated that some additional material would be forwarded shortly.  This material is still awaited in my Department.</P>
    <P>I have illustrated that there has been no recent unnecessary delay in the planning of this project.</P>
    <P>The next stage of the project, should the requested amendments prove satisfactory, will be the invitation to tender. <Col N="1819" /> I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made, within the resources available, to include this project among those for which tenders may be sought in 1992.</P>
    <P>A request has been made to me by Deputy McEllistrim to meet a deputation from the school as soon as possible.  I have agreed and I hope the meeting will take place within the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter.  I also thank the Minister for coming into the House at this hour.  Out of a total national roads allocation of almost £200 million announced last week by the Minister, less than £7 million is being allocated to County Donegal, one of the largest and most rural of our counties.  When one considers that Cork is to get in excess of £35 million, Kildare almost £36 million and Louth, our smallest county, £15.5 million, one realises the complete inadequacy of the allocation of £7 million to Donegal.</P>
      <P>Donegal is dependent on its road network to a greater extent than almost any other county.  We have not one yard of railway, we have no major air terminals except Carrickfin and we have no developed seaports except the fishing port of Killybegs.  A properly developed network of roads is crucial to the industrial development and economic wellbeing of our county.</P>
      <P>Vast areas of north and west Donegal are without primary routes which are so vitally important in the development and maintenance of industrial employment. During the past month in one part of the Donegal Gaeltacht over 120 workers have been made redundant in industries that are developing and expanding in other parts of the country along the eastern seaboard where the major road allocations recently announced are concentrated. This is a most serious development and if the trend continues we could have an industrial wasteland, not only in Donegal but throughout the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal is a huge county stretching from Bundoran to Malin Head and from <Col N="1820" /> Arranmore and Tory Islands to Castlefin and Killygordon.  It has excellent industrial and tourism potential.  Its main handicap and disadvantage is inadequate access.  An allocation of £7 million per annum will not solve our problem.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister to increase our share of the national roads allocation to match our size and difficulties so that our county, which is unique in its location and situation, can reach its full economic potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall allocation for national roads in 1992 amounts to £188.18 million, an all-time record provision for these roads.  This total figure comprises £131.65 million for major improvements on the primary routes and £21.03 million for other improvements on these routes.  The sum of £12.9 million will be spent on improvements to national secondary route and grants totalling £20.9 million are being provided for maintenance works on national roads. The balance of £1.9 million will be spent on technical assistance measures.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the 1992 grant of £2.186 million for national roads which was allocated to Donegal County Council represents a fair share of the available funds, having regard to priorities throughout the entire network of national roads.  This total includes £1.134 million for maintenance works and over £1 million for improvement works at a variety of locations.</P>
      <P>As regards non-national roads, Deputy McGinley will be well aware that primary responsibility for funding works on these roads rests with the local authority concerned. Traditionally work on these roads was financed from local resources, with only very limited state road grant assistance.  However, because of concern about the deterioration in parts of the network of county roads, in particular, the Government have provided significantly enhanced levels of road grants in the years since 1987 to supplement local authority expenditure on them.  This year has been no different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Donegal grant allocation of £4.669 million for non-national roads is a 4 per cent increase on last year's allocation of £4.496 million, exclusive of flood damage <Col N="1821" /> grants.  This compares with a total of only £2.127 million paid to Donegal County Council under equivalent headings in 1986.  Here again, I am satisfied that due recognition has been given to the road needs in County Donegal in the allocation of these grants.</P>
    <P>Before a decision was taken in relation to these allocations, I had representations from the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and from Deputies Coughlan and McDaid and I tried to take account of the strong representations made.  It is grossly unfair in the context of these allocations to spell out allocations to individual counties as if to indicate some preference.  Expenditure on the roads in Kildare, for instance, is quite important along the routes to airports and sea ports.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley will understand that on the national road network our priorities relate to through traffic.  Considering that we are an exporting economy, a major consideration is to get our products out.  The whole country would benefit from an improvement in the national network and the removal of bottlenecks. With the resources available to me I intend to continue to improve the national road network and to meet all the obligations in County Donegal as well as in all other counties.  In five years we have doubled the resources available for road development in County Donegal.</P>

      <P>The level of effluent emptying into the River Lee in Tralee from domestic and industrial sources is equivalent to that flowing from a town with a population of 45,000 people.  The raw sewage enters the river in a totally untreated state.  The stench of river where the sewerage main empties into the River Lee and Tralee Bay must be the most polluted in Ireland.  At one stage the River Lee was recognised as a prime fishing river, but that has not been the case for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tralee bay is not considered to be seriously polluted.  However, the condition of the north side of the bay at Spa-Fenit is giving rise to concern, especially because of the threat to the oyster beds. As a result of the EC ENVIROG programme there will be an increasing <Col N="1822" /> emphasis on improved water quality along our coastline.  The likelihood is that the level of pollution in Tralee Bay may soon be above that laid down in EC water quality regulations.  Tralee Urban Council have acquired a ten acre site for a treatment plant and are waiting for permission from the Department to draw up contract documents and bills of quantity so that the project can go to tender.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has been considering the findings of an environmental impact study with respect to this project.  I would urge him to complete his deliberations on that study as soon as possible so that the contract documents can be prepared and tenders invited.  This project, when completed, will be a major boost to the development of the Leane Valley and will add further to the various developments that have taken place in Tralee town in recent times.</P>

      <P>The provision of a modern sewage treatment plant for Tralee town has been identified as a priority proposal under the water and sanitary services programme. This major sewerage scheme would provide a level of treatment consistent with the objectives of the Government's Environment Action Programme and of the EC Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment.  The existing sewerage system for the town is unsatisfactory in that untreated effluent is discharged into the river.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of Tralee town as a major population and tourist centre, it is desirable that a suitable system for treating effluent should be put in place, subject of course to the proposal meeting with the requirements of environmental impact assessments.  Tralee Urban District Council have carried out the necessary environmental impact study for the treatment plant and this has been submitted to my Department for assessment. The assessment is being urgently carried out, taking account of the views received on the EIS and I hope to be in a position to give a decision on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

Knowing his commitment to the health services I am sure the Minister will take on board the points I make and will make every effort to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I have in front of me what I can only describe as a file of frustration.  Much effort has been made to resolve the problem of a constituent of mine who has been waiting for three years for an appointment at the Meath Hospital. Despite my efforts and the best efforts of this person's GP and the consultant urologist in Cork Regional Hospital there has been no success to date.  This is causing extreme distress to my constituent.  I can furnish to the Department details from the Meath Hospital and from the consultant urologist concerned, with regard to this person.  I earnestly request the Minister to intervene in this case and to expedite an appointment for this unfortunate public patient.  I hesitate to suggest that if this individual was a private patient he would have been treated long before now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is absolutely correct in that it is totally unacceptable that anyone should have to wait so long for treatment. The urologist or kidney surgeon in Dublin put this person on the list as an inpatient when he was sent to the hospital for an out-patient evaluation, and that caused confusion in the hospital.  Second, the person need not have been sent to Dublin because adequate treatment facilities are available in Cork Regional Hospital.  However, it is very annoying that this person has been on the waiting list for three years, especially in view of the fact that a number of representations have been made on his behalf.  I will speak to the consultant surgeon concerned to make sure that this patient is treated.  If this is not an urgent case the person should not have been put on the list.  Some system must be devised whereby a review committee should decide the order in which patients should be treated.  When a patient is put on a waiting list he becomes anxious and as <Col N="1824" /> time goes by the anxiety grows.  In this case the patient must have suffered intolerable anxiety.  I promise the Deputy that I will consult with the urologist in question and ensure that the patient is treated.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter of grave importance to my constituency.  I wish the new Minister for Health every success and congratulate him on his long overdue elevation to the Cabinet.  St. John's Hospital in Sligo is an excellent institution which provides loving care for the elderly in a way unsurpassed in any other similar hospital in the country.  This is the result of extraordinary dedication by nursing and non-nursing staff alike, but are the North Western Health Board, asking too much from these people.</P>
      <P>The nurses at this hospital have voted and mandated the Irish Nursing Organisation to take industrial action on 15 April because of inadequate nursing staff levels.  Obviously there is something seriously wrong when nurses, with their history of care and dedication and considering their organisation's history of never taking industrial action, have balloted for industrial action.  There is a dispute as to whether or not there has been an increase in the number of nursing staff in St. John's in recent times.  The chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board says there has been an increase while the nurses say there has been no increase.  However, the nurses are certain that the nursing staff is simply not adequate to maintain a proper standard of care.  For instance &mdash; I understand that this matter is not in dispute &mdash; there is only one nurse to 50 patients in four of the units from 6 p.m. until 9 a.m. the following morning, a 15 hour period, and the position is even worse in another unit. The nurses say that there should be a minimum of two nurses working together in these units at these times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nurses have explained that the present patients are much more dependent than previously because of a change in admission policy.  They say they are working under great stress and strain and that the inadequate staffing is now a crisis.  Quite obviously there is a major problem here <Col N="1825" /> which basically derives from inadequate Government funding and health cutbacks. By common consent the North-Western Health Board have been the most efficient board in the country in regard to administration.  Now is the time for the Department of Health and the Minister to acknowledge the good work done by funding the extra nursing staff so badly needed at St. John's Geriatric Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Under the personnel policy that applies in the health services it is a matter for the North-Western Health Board to determine the appropriate staffing levels in each of their institutions and other services, within their approved employment ceiling and financial allocation. Discussions between the Irish Nursing Organisation and the North-Western Health Board are ongoing with a view to reaching a satisfactory resolution to the staffing levels at St. John's.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between the North-Western Health Board and the INO on the introduction of the 39 hour week at this hospital were prolonged and failed to reach agreement.  The matter was then referred to an adjudication committee. At the final hearing before the committee the health board put forward revised rosters and improved nursing cover as a solution to the implementation of the 39 hour week.  The adjudication committee, having heard arguments from both sides, eventually issued their recommendation. The committee recommended that the INO accept the proposals made by the board.</P>
      <P>In further discussions between the board and the INO, the INO sought &ldquo;a full root and branch examination of the present staffing levels in St. John's&rdquo;.  In the course of those discussions, the INO also sought the creation of 22 additional nursing posts.  the cost of meeting that demand is estimated at approximately £400,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the discussions are ongoing and because there is a very good chance that agreement will be reached, I am not prepared to comment further.  I hope that good counsel will prevail and that industrial <Col N="1826" /> action, which would be very regrettable, will not be taken.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cork Hospital Incinerator.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early hours of this morning I am forced to raise the question of the incinerator at the Cork Regional Hospital.  The incinerator is antiquated, inefficient and overloaded.  It deals with all kinds of chemical wastes, ranging from everyday domestic waste to clinical hospital waste, such as disposable syringes, petri dishes and saline bags.</P>
      <P>Because the incinerator is antiquated there is no facility by which the emission gases can be analysed and monitored.  It is ironic that an incinerator in a health institution should be such a health hazard to those in the surrounding area.  As I have said, no analysis is being carried out on the emission gases, but I would safely say that coming out of that chimney stack must be dioxins, hydrochloric gas and other undesirable emissions.  The incinerator is a health hazard in a residential area and, as well as affecting the residential areas of Bishopstown the emission gases are being swept over the city of Cork by the south-west prevailing winds.</P>
      <P>Tonight I should like the Minister to say whether he is prepared to allow an allocation to the Southern Health Board so that the board may instal a more modern incinerator in the grounds of the regional hospital or whether the matter will be delat with in a broader sense in that the Minister might consider the setting up of a national incinerator for the burning of all clinical waste in this country, rather than having a large number of hospital incinerators dotted throughout the country.  The issue is linked to the question of our national waste management policy or, rather, our lack of such a policy.  I ask the Minister to indicate tonight what steps he proposes to take; does he propose to make the allocation asked for by the health board or does he intend to deal with the issue in the broader sense of a national incinerator for all hospital and clinical waste in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to respond to the issue raised by Deputy Allen in <Col N="1827" /> relation to the incinerator at Cork Regional Hospital.  I am aware that criticism have been made from time to time in relation to the inadequacy of many of the hospital incinerators currently in use and I accept that many of these criticisms are justified.  The fact is that most of our hospital incinerators are not geared to the level of performance required to meet today's rigorous standards on a continuous basis.  These standards are becoming more demanding year by year in response to society's increasing concern for the environment.</P>
      <P>Because of the inability of many of our individual hospital incinerators to meet the required standard, my Department consider that the most cost-effective and environmentally acceptable solution to the problem appears to be the provision of large centralised incinerators to cater for more than one hospital.  Accordingly, a proposal to establish a central incinerator at St. James's Hospital in Dublin to cater for the clinical waste from all Dublin hospitals is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the operation of the incinerator at Cork Regional Hospital.  The position is that the optimum method and location of clinical waste disposal facilities <Col N="1828" /> in the remainder of the country, outside the Eastern Health Board area, are currently being examined by officials of my Department and the relevant health boards, taking into account the experience being gained in relation to the proposed central incinerator for the Dublin hospitals and information on other technologies, which is currently being assessed. I assure the Deputy that the needs of the Cork area will be fully taken into consideration in this examination and that the question of providing capital funding to implement the best policy option for ameliorating the situation at Cork Regional Hospital will then be considered.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Allen for raising this important question and I am pleased to confirm that every effort is being made by my Department to implement as quickly as possible a hospital waste disposal policy that will overcome the difficulties associated with the current incineration arrangements at Cork Regional Hospital and will also comply fully with the demanding requirements of modern environmental standards.  I shall keep the Deputy informed.</P>

These include the elimination of levies and statutory demands, the writing-off of local loans funds debt repayments, and the introduction of direct rate payments by the ESB to local authorities.  The effect of these and other adjustments must be taken into accout before any valid comparison can be made between current rate support grant allocations and those of previous years.</P>

      <P>A statement of Government policy on toll based private investment was set out in Annex 8 of the road development plan, 1989 to 1993 (PI. 6482).  Apart from the provision in Part V of the Roads Bill, 1991, which proposes to assign tolling powers in relation to national roads to the National Roads Authority, there has been no fundamental change in that policy.  Pending completion by the Oireacthas of its consideration of that Bill, specific tolling arrangements for any road would be a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant road authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 122, 143, 145 and 148 together. I share fully the concern at the recent scientific findings on the ozone layer.  It is well known that damage to the ozone layer is caused by emissions of chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and other similar chlorine-containing substances which have a long residence time in the atmosphere; the recent findings are also linked to the presence of volcanic ash in the stratosphere as a result of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines last year.</P>
      <P>The EC has responded quickly to the situation.  The Environment Council which I attended on 23 March adopted a position in favour of the elimination of the production and consumption of CFCs and related substances by end 1995 and a reduction of 85 per cent in most cases by end 1993.  The Community will press for the adoption of these measures at the review of the Montreal Protocol to the Ozone Convention which is to be concluded in Copenhagen next November.</P>
      <P>EC Regulation 594/91 already provides a Community regime for the control and elimination &mdash; generally by 1997, of CFCs and related substances.  The stricter position to which the Community is now committed will require the adoption of a new regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has consistently adopted an <Col N="1603" /> advanced position on measures to protect the ozone layer: the Irish Presidency of the EC worked for the adoption of the London Amendment of the Montreal Protocol which strengthened and extended the phase-out requirements for CFCs and related substances; Ireland was among the first EC member states to ratify the London Amendment in December 1991; Ireland is contributing to the multilateral fund established under the amended Montreal Protocol to help developing countries comply with controls on ozone-depleting substances; grants have been made to local authorities to promote the recovery of CFCs from old domestic fridges and freezers; and my Department has consulted with the Irish industries concerned about voluntary reductions in the use of CFCs &mdash; in advance of the legal requirements &mdash; and the response has been generally positive.</P>

      <P>Policy on waste seeks to ensue that all wastes, including municipal waste, are managed on an environmentally sound basis.  This is achieved through a range of regulations under which local authorities are responsible for the planning, organisations and supervision of the wastes which arise in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated on a number of occasions, a comprehensive Bill on waste is being prepared in my Department at present.  Landfill is the prevalent disposal method for municipal waste in this country and my Department has issued <Col N="1608" /> detailed guidelines to local authorities on the management and operation of landfill sites.  New controls on landfill which are being developed at European Community level are likely to include more stringent controls on landfill practice; national policy will be developed in line with such requirements.</P>

      <P>My Department has, for some time, operated on the basis that as much information as possible in regard to activities and decisions, and the reason for them, should be made freely available subject to normal requirements in relation to notice and confidentiality.  The establishment in 1990 of ENFO &mdash; the environmental information service &mdash; is a notable illustration of this.  I should also draw attention to the Department's various publications on policy matters and works programmes, the regular statistical bulletins and other reports wich are published, the variety of other material made available by the Department's press and information service, and the extent to which officers of the Department participate in conferences, seminars etc. on matters related to its functions.</P>

The projects will be financed, in full, in the first instance, from specific road grant allocations by my Department and the European Regional Development Fund recoupment will, therefore, be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In September 1991, my Department requested local authorities in the six Border counties to nominate appropriate road projects for the Interreg Programme. A total of 125 projects, with a combined cost of £19.602 million, were nominated.</P>
    <P>Details of the projects selected for implementation in 1992 and the grant allocation for each project were notified to the local authorities on 18 March last. The following are the allocations for the six Border counties:</P>

      <P>Statutory drinking water standards have been prescribed under the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, which specify maximum admissible concentration values for a total of 53 parameters. Extensive monitoring is carried out by local authorities to comply with these regulations, and results generally demonstrate the good quality of Irish drinking water supplies.  The first annual report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, which was published last year, confirms this position but also defines the dimensions of the problems which still exist; these relate mainly to exceedance of the standards for aluminium and coliforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to deal with these problems are, in accordance with the Environment Action Programme, a priority in the programme of capital works for water supply.  Over £65 million was spent for this purpose in 1990 and 1991.  Local authorities are also reviewing all aspects of the management and operation of <Col N="1615" /> water supplies.  The indications are that, in many cases, better treatment works practice and more active supervision can bring the drinking water quality into conformity with the regulations.</P>

I do not propose to request local authorities generally to carry out a specific audit of the vacant dwellings in their areas, but there is no reason why any authority which considers it appropriate to do so should not adopt this course.</P>

      <P>Factors which directly influence the number of persons per room include average family size, stage in the family cycle and average number of rooms per house.  While the 1981 Census of Population indicated that Donegal was highest in the indicators referred to in the question, Offaly was second highest with <Col N="1617" /> regard to average persons per room but not so in regard to households with more than two persons per room.  Neither county had the highest level in either indicator in 1971 or 1966.  The results of the 1991 Census of Population will show a marked reduction in the extent of overcrowding in all areas.</P>

These allocations will ensure that steady progress <Col N="1618" /> will be maintained in the development of the service despite the difficult economic circumstances.

      <P>Following the adoption by the Government in 1984, of a common framework for co-ordinated response to major emergencies, major emergency plans have been drawn up by the main emergency services, the Garda, the health boards and the local authorities. The relevant local authorities have all prepared appropriate emergency plans which set out, <i>inter alia</i>, the functions of the different agencies involved and the other arrangements necessary to ensure a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach by the emergency services, including the local authorities, at major emergencies.  The contents of the plans are generic in character and are therefore capable of being applied to all types of emergencies.  Local authorities are required to keep their emergency plans up to date and to review them annually in consultation with the other emergency agencies.  In June 1989 my Department issued detailed advice to local authorities in regard to the holding of exercises to test their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While local authorities are not required to submit to my Department information on the operation, testing or updating of their plans, I am aware that the local authorities referred to update their plans regularly and have periodically tested them.  I understand that plans were put into operation by Limerick <Col N="1628" /> County Council in 1987, Mayo County Council in 1989 and Kerry County Council in 1990.</P>

      <P>Member states of the European Community are currently examining a proposed directive requiring that unfair terms are not used in contracts concluded with consumers.  If the proposal as currently formulated is adopted, member states will be obliged to ensure that a competent authority controls contract terms.  The proposal however is still at a relatively preliminary stage of consideration.</P>

      <P>Duties and obligations arising under the legislation are ultimately a matter for the courts.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for supervising the operation of the legislation and has powers relating to the terms on which goods or services are supplied.</P>

      <P>There is no generally accepted definition of what could constitute an investment company.  In its broadest interpretation it may include banks, building societies and a wide variety of institutions which provide financial services.  Only some of these are subject to regulation.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years one bank has failed, Merchant Banking Limited in 1982, with liabilities of about £4.5 million of which about £1.3 million related to depositors.</P>
      <P>Information relating to building societies, prior to 1989 when the Central Bank assumed responsibility for these societies, is not readily available to me. However, I understand that one building society, the Irish Savings Building Society, was wound up by the High Court in 1984.  A further building society, the Dublin Model Building Society, ceased trading that year also.</P>
      <P>Out of a total of approximately 200 IFSC companies approved to date I have been notified that one company, which could be described as an investment company, may have ceased to trade.  Until the position is clarified it would be inappropriate for me to name the company involved.  The circumstances were such that the question of losses did not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas of financial activity for which there is no comprehensive statutory provision for regulation include the Stock Exchange and investment intermediaries. <Col N="1632" /> I have no day-to-day responsibility for the Stock Exchange under existing legislation but I understand that two firms of stock brokers failed during the last ten years.  Only one of these firms left liabilities, which amounted to £684,119.  Compensation is being paid in accordance with the provision of the Stock Exchange compensation arrangements. There has also been a reduction in the number of stockbrokers over the past ten years due to mergers.</P>
    <P>Investment intermediaries are not at present subject to regulation and I do not have the information sought by the Deputy in relation to these firms.  I am keenly aware of the need for extending regulations in the financial services sector and I am at present actively considering measures for the regulation of investment intermediaries and I have announced impending legislation for the regulation of the Stock Exchange.</P>

Because I have extensive commitments relating to other Department work, I would be in a position to meet only a very limited number of these in any given week.

      <P>The position is that persons with conditions such as asthma who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable to meet their medical expenses without undue hardship may be granted a medical card which will entitle them to the supply of all drugs and medicines and general practitioner services free of charge.</P>
      <P>In the case where a particular child or member of a family is incurring heavy expenditure due to their asthma condition, the chief executive officer may grant a medical card to cover that child or individual rather than issuing a card to cover the whole family.</P>
      <P>Any other person with an ongoing medical condition, such as asthma, which imposes a requirement for continuous medication can benefit under the terms of the drug cost subsidisation scheme. This scheme limits the actual expenditure of authorised beneficiaries on prescribed medicines to £32 per month.  This scheme is being availed of by many asthmatics and the take up in the scheme emphasises the benefits of the scheme for asthmatics in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drug refund scheme ensures that persons with irregular expenditure on drugs and medicines are refunded the <Col N="1638" /> balance of their expenditure, in excess of £90 per quarter, on prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>

      <P>During the past year the eight health boards have been co-operating in a more structured way as part of A Value For Money initiative encouraged by my Department.  A VFM Steering Group representative of all health boards was established by the chief executive officers and is chaired by the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>A key element of the work of this committee is to provide a mechanism and structure by which health boards can maximise their collective purchasing power in respect of various goods and services.  My Department is also actively involved in encouraging co-operation among various agencies in the purchase of equipment.</P>
      <P>With regard to the purchasing of drugs, I am currently awaiting the report from the inter-departmental group on drug costs appointed by the Government last year.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group are: &ldquo;to examine the various factors which influence the cost of prescribed medicines to the Exchequer and to make recommendations to the Minister for Health on strategies to be pursued to contain/reduce drug costs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I expect this group to make recommendations as to the most effective purchasing of drugs by health boards and other agencies in the context of the current FICI agreement and for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that progress has been made on co-operation between the <Col N="1639" /> health boards in relation to purchasing, there is still considerable scope for further development and wider application of the initiatives which have taken place. This will remain an area of particular concern to my Department in the promotion of better value for money.</P>

This represents an increase of 24 or 14.5 per cent over the past three years, an increase which reflects my Department's commitment to the development of community services.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that some 225 (wholetime equivalent) personnel at 31 December 1990 were employed in a range of grades under the general heading teacher/instructor/therapist.  It should be noted that in many instances these grades perform a broadly similar service to that provided by occupational therapists.</P>
    <P>Details of occupational therapists employed nationally at 31 December 1990 together with the ratio per 1,000 of population are outlined in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991, is concerned essentially with the appeals stage of the planning process, and I have no proposals to amend the Bill in the manner suggested.  However, my Department issued a circular to planning authorities last January asking them, <i>inter alia,</i> to make it their objective to decide planning applications within the statutory two month period and only in exceptional circumstances to seek further information from the applicant.  Where further information is necessary, planning authorities were asked to seek it as soon <Col N="1650" /> as possible after receipt of the application and to decide the application, as far as possible, within one month of receipt of the information.  I will be monitoring the response to the January circular and will, if necessary, consider further measures to speed up the processing of applications at local level.</P>

      <P>While the principle of a public right of way in both Ireland and England derives from the same common law foundation, the practical application of that basic principle has evolved in very different ways over the centuries and not just since independence.  The result of this is that Irish law essentially recognises one concept of a public right of way, that is a right of the public to pass and re-pass whether over a public road or any other public right of way.  In England, apart from highways (public roads), there are a number of categories of public rights of way (pathways, bridleways, byways), each distinguished from the other.  The result is that while there is an extensive network of non-road public rights of way throughout England, in Ireland by contrast the length of the public road network per head of population is over four times that of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In this country, any citizen at present can take an action in the courts to stop or prevent interference with a public right of way.  The law in this regard will be considerably strengthened on the enactment of the Roads Bill, 1991, which is currently before the House.  This will make it an offence to obstruct, impede or otherwise interfere with a public right of way, subject to a maximum fine of up to £1,000 and/or six months imprisonment. I plan to table an amendment to the Bill to make it a duty of local authorities to assert the right of the public to use public rights of way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was refused a retirement pension in July 1990 as his yearly average of 17 contributions from 1955 to 1990 was too low to satisfy the minimum contribution conditions of the scheme.  His low average is attributable to the fact that there is no record of contributions on his behalf for the year 1957 and from 1959 to 1975.</P>
      <P>Following extensive investigations by my Department in June 1991 and again in February 1992, it was determined that the person concerned was not in insurable employment during those years.  Under current legislation, he has insufficient contributions over his working life to qualify for either a retirement or old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned might be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension.  An application form for this pension was sent to him in November 1991.  If he wishes, he should complete and return this application to my Department. His entitlement will be examined then and he will be notified of the outcome as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance <Col N="1659" /> claim of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from 11 December 1991 on the grounds that the applicant failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>He appealed against this decision and following further inquiries by a social welfare officer his case has now been referred to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The matter has been considered by an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of the appeal.

      <Quest>if, in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Wexford he will outline the reason arrears of orphan's allowance less the payments already included in the claimant's unemployment assistance cannot be paid immediately, in view of the fact that his Department's computer records already include the relevant information on payments made; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a delay of several weeks in paying these arrears will cause hardship to the family in question; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance of £79 per week.  This includes a personal rate of £55 and £24 dependent child allowance in respect of her youngest brother and sister.</P>
      <P>In early February 1992, she applied for an orphan's non-contributory pension. Following investigation by a social welfare officer it was decided on 4 March 1992 that the person concerned was entitled to an orphan's non-contributory pension of £62.40 per week with effect from 20 December 1991 &mdash; the Friday following the death of her father.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A payable order book for £62.40 per week payable from 27 March 1992 issued to her local post office on 10 March 1992 <Col N="1660" /> for collection.  Arrears of pension, less the dependent child allowance paid with her unemployment assistance since December 1991, amount to £537.60.  A payable order for this amount will issue to the person concerned within ten days.</P>
    <P>My Department made every effort to ensure that there was no undue delay in processing and awarding this pension application and in arranging for arrears of pension to be issued to her as soon as possible.  Developments in the Department's computerisation of its countrywide local office network this year will greatly assist the flow of information between various administrative areas. This will also help reduce any delays in calculating arrears in cases such as this.</P>
