      <P>It is proposed to take No. 14.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that:</P>
      <P>(1)  the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 14 shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today and the Minister for Finance shall be called on not later than 4.15 p.m. to conclude the debate; (2) the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m.; (3) the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 15 which shall be taken tomorrow, shall be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m., if not previously concluded and the Minister for State at the Department of Justice shall be called on not later than 12.15 p.m. to reply to the debate and (4) any divisions demanded tomorrow shall be postponed until 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 May 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to protest very strongly at the guillotining of the Second Stage debate of the Finance Bill.  There are only about four hours left to debate the Bill and there will be very little opportunity for me to speak.  I was not allowed to speak on the budget either due to insufficient time being made available. One of the Opposition spokespersons spoke for an hour and a half yesterday, which is much too long.</P>

      <P>I would like to repeat my request to the Taoiseach to allow time today for statements in the light of the comments made yesterday by the Attorney General and of the apparent conflicting advice he has given at different times to the Government, according to Government statements.  Such statements would provide an opportunity for the Taoiseach to clarify the precise position <Col N="2127" /> in relation to the Attorney General and for the House to comment thereon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, it is normal to publish an Explanatory Memorandum. Perhaps the Taoiseach could give some clarification as to why in this Bill the wording is quite different from that used in the Single European Act and at the time we joined the EC, particularly as the Bill refers to bodies competent under the Treaties.  Will the Taoiseach clarify whether we are talking about new bodies other than the institutions of the Community?  For example, are we referring particularly to the European Central Bank or the Western European Union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic background in which the Minister for Finance has introduced this budget leaves nobody in any doubt about the difficult financial situation facing the country in the next few years.  The Minister for Finance has indicated clearly the necessity to introduce a second Finance Bill during 1992 and this clearly indicates that a huge retrenchment in public spending, a reduction in public services or increased taxation will be required in the latter half of 1992 and in 1993-94.  This is further compounded by the fact that the Minister for Finance has postponed various commitments under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> until after the next general election when the next Government will have the opportunity to resolve the financial difficulties the Minister has delicately postponed.  We might get a false sense of security about the healthy state of our finances if we do not acknowledge there are serious issues facing the country in 1993 and 1994.  We need to take steps to bring the economy into a healthier state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest afflictions facing the country is the level of unemployment. Various speakers have referred to the massaging of figures and the understatement of the level of unemployment <Col N="2132" /> that will emerge following the enactment of the Finance Bill, 1992.  It is undoubtedly true, and it is acknowledged by the Ministers that 300,000 people will be unemployed by the end of this year.  This is a huge drain on our national resources, and on the Department of Social Welfare in particular, but no radical initiatives are being taken by the Government to bring more people into mainstream economic activity or to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister stated this was a pro employment budget. Nothing could be further from the truth. How can the Minister declare the budget and this Finance Bill are pro employment when the evidence before us runs counter to that statement?  The new Cabinet's first major announcement on creating employment was made by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, when he proposed taking the initiative by setting up FÁS offices in Europe and exporting 10,000 of our people, thus taking them off the live register.  In my opinion, this is a damning indictment of the Minister's lack of imagination and radical proposals to deal with this major national crisis.  If that is the best he has to offer, I feel very let down.  The unemployed should not expect to hear any more on those lines from the Minister but should expect to take more radical measures in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report was a very important development in industrial policy.  It pointed to very important decisions that have to be taken to give better value for money and greater scope to create a more pro-active employment policy.  The Culliton report proposals are radical.  I am disappointed that the task force appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not been seen to be radical in coming to early conclusion about the implementation of aspects of that report.</P>
    <P>Various proposals put forward in this budget are anti-employment rather than pro-employment.  The Minister for Finance has tinkered around with the tax bands in order to make it more palatable for people to get up in the morning and go to work.  So long as the PRSI rates <Col N="2133" /> remain at their present levels there will be no extra incentive in this Finance Bill to employers to employ more people rather than more capital.  A radical shift is needed in the grant aid given through our industrial policy and through various tax changes made from one budget to the next to ensure more labour is employed rather than more capital.</P>
    <P>The cliche that small is beautiful has often been related to industrial policy. Unfortunately, the level of economic activity in generating small indigenous industry, particularly during the last year or two, is practically nil.  I am disappointed there has been no recognition in the Finance Bill that the greatest contribution that can be made to job creation is through the many aspects of our indigenous industry, through small industrial and manufacturing projects that have the wherewithal and the expertise at local level to generate employment. No concern is being expressed at present by people living in cosy cocoons in Kildare Street or in any Government Department that there is a crisis beyond the Pale in the living standards and the employment opportunities of people in rural areas.  In fact, the decimation of towns and villages by large tracts of unemployment has not conjured up anything but glib statements by Government Ministers about how terrible it is and about the need to create the proper climate but no Government intervention is being employed to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill has copperfastened an anti-consumer aspect to this budget. Car tax was increased by 25 per cent. Alternative proposals are being put forward by the Minister for Finance for vintners' licences.  I am sure a civil servant had for a long time dreamed about getting a Minister for Finance to implement that regime and found a very innocent Minister in Deputy Ahern.  I am delighted he has had a change of heart, I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy O'Dea, who, I am sure, played a very important part along with the other Deputies in his <Col N="2134" /> party and Opposition Deputies in bringing pressure to bear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>And Deputy Leyden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably Deputy Leyden has some concern for publicans in rural areas.  The Minister was seeking to put rural publicans out of business by that ill-considered proposal put forward in his budget speech.  The fact that he had to do a swift U-turn on that valuation proposal in respect of licensed vintners is a clear indication of how badly thought-out that proposal was and of the Minister's innocence in accepting it in the first place. Had that proposal gone ahead there is no doubt that there would be an increase of 20p on the pint and 10p on the glass of spirits to assist publicans to pay the increased charge for the renewal of licences.  I look forward on Committee Stage to hearing the Minister outline the detailed proposals concerning the implementation of the levy on turnover in respect of the renewal of vintners' licences.  I will also be anxious to hear whether food and admission to various musical events which may be held on licensed premises will be taken as turnover or what exemptions will be granted in respect of the definition of turnover.</P>
      <P>There is an anti-consumer measure in the budget in respect of increasing the VAT rate from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent.  That will affect those who are most vulnerable in our community who have to spend a considerable amount of money on essential items, such as clothing.  It will have a major impact on the clothing and textile industry which is going through a difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure announced by the Minister during the course of his budget speech is the abolition of life assurance relief for policy holders.  Indeed, a Minister has attempted to reduce many reliefs over the past number of budgets and his predecessor did likewise, particularly in relation to mortgage relief.  Any holder of an endowment mortgage policy over the past number of years will have found a serious erosion of the various reliefs to which they were entitled when they first <Col N="2135" /> took out the policy.  I contend that the endownment mortgage market will slow up considerably as a result of the continuous erosion of the various reliefs that have been allowed to mortgage holders over the last number of years and which are no longer available.  The savings opportunities given to consumers generally will be considerably reduced as a result of the reduction in tax reliefs and the elimination of the life assurance relief that will be put forward as part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The announcement, by the Minister for Finance, during the course of his budget speech, that he will change the regime for writing off start-up expenses for life assurance companies in this country will add a further anti-consumer measure to the Finance Bill.  The only one from whom a life assurance company can recoup the costs incurred in establishing in this country and taking out a policy is from the policyholder.  If the writing off of expenses which have been allowed over a considerable period for life assurance companies are restricted to a seven-year period, it will be exceedingly difficult for the various life assurance companies to give an attractive return on the savings that would normally accrue from a policy.  It may be the Minister's intention to get the additional finance from the life assurance company but it will be passed on to the consumer in the form of lower growth rates and lower returns on maturity of the policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement that he was introducing a pro-employment budget, while at the same time eliminating one of the most fundamental and radical initiatives taken for a long time in relation to employment policy, namely, allowing tax relief for share options through manufacturing companies, is another example of how naive he is.  Share options have become the norm in this country since 1986 and many public and private companies have taken the opportunity to give additional incentives to employees to take a stake in the company and assist, in a more beneficial way to themselves as well as the owners of the company, the <Col N="2136" /> long term wellbeing of that company. The idea of having a stake in the profits of the company and in the development of the company was very worth while.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance has considerably reduced the level of opportunity people will have of getting additional income and an incentive to build up a company in the private or public sector.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also that the Minister did not refer to the lack of consumer protection for people who invest money in the life insurance business and Government gilts.  There are plenty of examples of consumers investing considerable amounts of money through intermediaries without any consumer protection if that money is invested in the wrong place or not invested at all.  There is an urgent need for protection for consumers who have given their money to an intermediary to invest on their behalf and who fails to do so.  A bonding system is necessary to ensure that that investment is returned to the consumer if the intermediary defaults.  There is no control at all over transaction costs relating to financial products and financial institutions generally.  The Minister should do something about that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister also attacked the very essence of rural life in seeking to impose extra taxation on the co-operative movement. This is a retrograde step that will have serious implications for employment in the co-operative movement.  The reasons given by the Minister for the withdrawal of the tax exemptions on co-operatives is that there has been a radical transformation of the co-operatives, and the distinction between the co-operatives and other commercial entities has disappeared. The Minister alleged that there was unfair competition if co-operatives were treated differently in terms of their tax and that he wanted to broaden the tax base generally.  The Minister's argument is flawed.  Co-operatives, including those which have developed their financial structures, provide the same core services for their members as they provided in 1978 when the exemption <Col N="2137" /> was restored by Government, and trade with their members in the same way as they did at that time.  There has been a huge growth in the size of the co-operative business in this country and it is not out of line with what is happening in other sectors of the economy.  There is different legislation governing co-operatives and the private sector business throughout the entire European Community. What we are seeking to do in this Finance Bill is to put Irish co-operatives at a disadvantage compared with their European partners, particularly when we face severe competition post 1992 on the completion of the Internal Market.  There could not be a worse time for any Minister for Finance, particularly an Irish one, to put the food industry and the co-operative structures of this country at a serious disadvantage.  The emphasis in co-operatives on providing service to members has always been to improve the living standards of the people who are forming the co-operatives and also to provide much needed employment in areas that find it very difficult to get any employment.  One of the largest co-operatives in my own area, Avonmore Foods plc, has made a tremendous contribution to the employment opportunities of our young people in Kilkenny and the surrounding counties.  That co-operative has made a major contribution in recent times in coming to the rescue of the meat business, particularly in the west.  I know my colleague, Deputy Leyden, would acknowledge that were it not for the intervention of the co-operative structure into the meat processing business we would have great difficulty in getting any player who would be sound and reasonable, who would provide much needed employment and would last the pace in this very competitive meat business.  We should acknowledge that were it not for the funds that were made available in 1991 through rights issues and financial incentives given by co-operatives to shareholders to invest money with them we would not have the wherewithal now to take over another aspect of the agricultural business through the co-operative structure and ensure that we not only <Col N="2138" /> have competition in the meat business but the potential for lasting employment in that important sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that co-operatives do not currently have exemption from taxation on all their activities.  Some of the activities of co-opeatives, particularly in the hardware business, are subject to normal taxation levels and corporation tax.  It is only some aspects of the co-opeative taxation structure that are being changed in this Finance Bill. There are substantial indirect benefits from a thriving co-operative in any rural area.  There is not only employment but, downstream, suppliers to co-operatives benefit considerably from the activities of a successful co-operative.  Through employment in co-operatives at the moment they are paying about £50 million in PAYE contributions to the Exchequer.  If the Minister proceeds with the tax structure he is proposing in this Finance Bill he is running the considerable risk of reducing employment in the co-operatives.  He is taking £1.5 million from Avonmore Foods plc in extra taxation which they could use to make further investments, to make further acquisitions and create more employment opportunities for the people of the area where they set up.</P>
    <P>The consequences of abolishing the tax exemption are that it will weaken the financial position of many co-operatives to the extent that many of the service co-operatives will collapse; it will ignore the role that many co-operatives have played in providing a public service, for example, animal breeding and farm relief co-operatives; it disregards the positive role that has been played and will be played by co-operatives in future rural development through the Leader programme and there has been no account taken of the major role of co-operatives in job creation where there are no economic alternatives to co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the Minister making that mistake and I appeal to him to reverse that decision if he is serious about creating job oppotunities in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>One of the other aspects of agricultural <Col N="2139" /> activity at a time when Mr. Ray MacSharry, the Commissioner for Agriculture seems intent on bullying all the member states and the Council of Agriculture Ministers into accepting reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy along the lines he proposes, is that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, would seem intent on accepting tacitly that Mr. MacSharry wants to put the commercial farmer here out of business.  There are those who say that the agricultural community are an untapped source of taxation, but I can assure the Minister that if these proposals are implemented by the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Ray MacSharry, there will be a marked reduction in the contributions made both directly and indirectly by the agricultural community for services in 1992-93 and onwards.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that there are delays in making payments under the various European schemes, including the special beef premium and headage payments. Even though this money is lodged with the Department of Agriculture and Food in December of each year, because of the morass of bureaucracy farmers do not receive their entitlements until the end of April, five months later.  This is obscene.  I ask the Minister to take the initiative and discuss the issue with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to ensure that the system, the merry-go-round under which cheques are issued under various schemes to the farming community from offices at Castlebar, Cavan, Dublin as well as local departmental offices is rationalised immediately and that the task force which he has established will report as soon as possible. He should also give local management discretion to make payments to the farming population without having to go through bureaucratic channels around the country.  This merry-go-round of bureaucracy must stop as an enormous amount of resources are wasted during this procedure.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not announce he was going to improve the inheritance tax regime for the agricultural community in the Finance <Col N="2140" /> Bill.  While I understand fully that a concession has been made in relation to the transfer of land for agricultural purposes, nevertheless there should be no tax impediments in transferring land in an agricultural country to ensure that land is handed over to young farmers at the earliest possible opportunity; but that is not the case at present.  In relation to the punitive inheritance tax regime, which is enshrined in this Bill also, the dead will pay less tax than the living.  This is not in keeping with the objective of generating economic wealth and encouraging the rural population to be more active and, in turn, generating more employment.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to make a few general comments.  Economically, 1991 is a year this country would like to forget.  The scandals within the public sector have been the subject of investigation and have consumed much time and money through various inquiries under the auspices of the courts and this House.  Resources have been wasted in seeking the truth in the beef tribunal, the Greencore inquiry, the Telecom inquiry and indeed other scandals which perhaps are too numerous to mention at this stage.  Perhaps we should not go into too much detail as the general public are fed up with the activity which has taken place within the public sector and business in general during the past seven or eight months.  Therefore it might prove to be counterproductive to add further to it. The public are cynical about the activities of politicians and it is distasteful that they appear to have been too close to the business activities which have taken place during the past seven or eight months. Nevertheless, it is important that we seek the truth in all these matters and do not waste resources in the foreseeable future in inquiring into those distasteful activities.</P>
    <P>The image of the Government and of business and political circles has been damaged considerably by these scandals with the result that our capacity to attract investment from the United States and other continental destinations has been reduced.  It will take take some time to <Col N="2141" /> get back to sound investment policies which will not be tarnished by the image of scandals which have made us the laughing stock of the world in relation to the way we handled our business during the past few months.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the reason the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice could not agree on the cost of the Government inquiry before it commenced. It is obscene that they are paying out £1,750 each day, which will have to be met by the taxpayer, to auditors, solicitors and barristers to carry out work on behalf of the State.  I hope this lesson will not be lost on the Government in relation to any future inquiries, which I hope will be few and far between.</P>
    <P>It has also been alleged on many occasions since 8 March 1992 that the Minister for Industry and Commerce interfered with the work of the inspectors involved in the Greencore inquiry in particular.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is anti-employment and anti-consumer and postpones a number of financial measures which should be implemented.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on presenting his first Finance Bill following the introduction of his first budget last January.  It is a very comprehensive document which brings before the House some very imaginative proposals in relation to the management of our finances.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate in Government &mdash; particularly in Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; in having had such good Ministers for Finance over the last number of years. They include the former Ministers, Deputy Albert Reynolds and Commissioner MacSharry.  Deputy Bertie Ahern is following a fine tradition.</P>
      <P>Section 24 refers to the restrictions of capital allowances on holiday cottages. The Minister should allow any project which had been commenced before 24 April to qualify as commitments have been entered into by bona fide investors. That would be of benefit in relation to job retention and creation.  A straightforward amendment to that section would be of great benefit and I hope the Minister will accede to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2143" /> Arising from discussions with the Minister on behalf of the licensed vintners, I am very pleased that he has amended the proposals in the budget.  Discussions took place at meetings of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and elsewhere and the Minister decided not to implement the multiplier in regard to valuation.  Deputy Hogan said that this constituted a U-turn but that is not so because when a budget is published and debated it is an opportunity for Deputies to assess and evaluate the proposals and to bring forward logical alternatives for the Minister to consider, it is parlimentary democracy.  The same applies to amendments which will arise as a result of the publication of the Finance Bill.  My experience in Government was that when the Opposition advanced good proposals I, as far as possible, accepted them if they were logical and well worked out.  It is certainly not a U-turn by a Minister to consider well worked out, alternative proposals.  It gives Deputies in Opposition a say and involvement in the passage of Bills through this House. When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition the same applied.  I compliment the Minister in that regard because the initial proposals for the multiplier of £7 in relation to the poor law valuation would have been a major imposition and an inequitable system as far as publicans are concerned. There are approximately 10,000 licence holders in the country, the majority of which are outside the greater Dublin area; 4 per cent of the licences are in Dublin with roughly 40 per cent of the population and 96 per cent of the licences are outside Dublin catering for about 60 per cent of the population. There are three public houses in Fuerty, where I live, serving a population of about 450 people.  It is obvious that there is no quick buck to be made as far as that is concerned.  Many premises have carried out improvements and have been revalued.  The Minister should examine valuation of property because rates are becoming a major burden in rural areas. There is no limit on the overall rateable valuation imposed by local authorities in addition to water and service charges.  It <Col N="2144" /> is becoming extremely difficult to run a small business in rural areas.  The Minister has been given clear examples of the kind of turnover in small businesses and public houses in rural areas, indeed 75 per cent of the licensees will pay in the region of £200 for the renewal of their licences.  The sliding scale is very attractive in that it allows for increased turnover in the city of Dublin and elsewhere and for a small return in rural areas.</P>
    <P>As a result of the evaluation being carried out, the Minister should consider reducing it in some cases because large increases have made life very difficult in rural areas in relation to development. Rural Ireland is under major threat at present.  The proposals by An Post some time ago in relation to the reduction in the number of sub post offices has met with rightful opposition in rural areas. The Minister has at her disposal the report of the National Economic and Social Council on the viability plans of An Post.  That document should be published as soon as possible to allow for a further debate in relation to the future of rural post offices.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I would fight for the retention of the majority of rural post offices, which are a vital cog in rural areas.  Particularly in the post-Maastricht era, when Ireland will be the peripheral part of Europe, it is important to retain services in the rural parts of this country.  It is my argument that the services of the local sub-post office are a vital part of a rural community. I would also say that there has been natural wastage in the provision of post office services because in many cases people are not prepared to run post offices for the small amount of funds provided by An Post for a particular area.</P>
    <P>On the basis of economic development and in relation to the Finance Bill, I urge that the present dispute affecting postal, services be brought to a speedy conclusion. I appeal to all parties in the dispute to come together and commence negotiations aimed at ending the dispute. The taking on of additional employees <Col N="2145" /> seems to me to be worth while, particularly when one considers the institutionalised £21 million spent in overtime payments each year here in the city of Dublin.  Such huge expenditure is completely unacceptable.  For much too long anarchy has reigned at Sheriff Street.  It is my belief that the management of An Post had to bring that position to an end, but negotiations could have been carried out in a more satisfactory way that has been the case to date.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when the Minister examines the position at An Post she should consider the management of that organisation. I for one am not too enamoured of certain transactions that An Post have carried out in the development of properties in Dublin and in the sale of properties that An Post did not even own.  In that regard An Post will face major claims, which will be fought through the courts, probably successfully.  Such problems bring to my attention the lack of managerial skills and the ability of people at the very top of An Post.  The Minister now has an opportunity to examine the management of An Post, and if heads are to roll then they should roll now.  I appeal to all parties in the dispute to come together as quickly as possible because the availability of modern technology such as facsimile machines and the efficiency of the courier services will result in the overall turnover and the use of An Post being seriously reduced if the strike continues.  I stress that the dispute must be settled as quickly as possible. There is a general lack of confidence in the ability of An Post to provide satisfactory service and a protracted strike will result in companies using the facilities of private courier services and modern telecommunications systems for the transmission of information and correspondence. The dispute should now be reassessed in a cool and calm manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have been successful in the privatisation of Irish Life and the Irish Sugar Company. However, I advise caution in future privatisation proposals for Telecom Éireann.  Telecom Éireann are a very successful public company that provide <Col N="2146" /> excellent service and employment.  The initial advantages of privatisation are evident in the amount of capital that would be realised to the Exchequer to assist in the paying off of our national debt. However, the regular returns from Telecom Éireann should be taken into account.  As the organisation make profits of about £50 million per annum, it is my contention that they are in a position to pay dividends to the State to pay off the original investment of £1 billion required in 1974 when Telecom Éireann and An Post were formed as State companies. The employees of Telecom are gravely concerned and the Government should very shortly come to a decision on their plans for the company.  At this stage I am not over-impressed by proposals for further privatisation of Telecom Éireann. It is my argument that the company have great potential for paying regular dividends to the State.  State companies have the objective of providing a service to the customer and they are also pro-employment, whereas private companies are pro-profit and are not particularly pro-employment.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in rural areas do not have the advantage of cheaper telephone costs enjoyed by businesses in the greater Dublin area.  There should again be a review of charges for inland telephone calls.  Higher telephone accounts are certainly one disadvantage in establishing a company in a rural area compared to establishing a company here on the eastern seaboard.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider proposals for continuing the decentralisation policy initiated by Fianna Fáil and continued by the previous Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government.  Decentralisation has proved an economically beneficial measure throughout the country.  It has provided major benefits in the west of Ireland in towns such as Ballina, Castlebar, Galway, Sligo and Athlone. Improvements will also flow to Longford following the success of the previous Minister, the present Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in his attempts to take decentralisation to that town.  I appeal to the Minister to look favourably upon a <Col N="2147" /> proposal that I have made for some time now that the decentralisation policy be extended to Roscommon county.  The town of Roscommon would be a natural location for application of the decentralisation programme as it is able to provide the necessary facilities and sites.  The Patents Office is certainly ready for setting up as a semi-State company and I earmark that organisation as a possibility for decentralisation.  With modern technology, there is no reason that a company such as the Patents Office should be located in Dublin or its surrounding area. I recommend that the Minister consider the location of the new Patents Office in Roscommon, a proposal that would bring more than 150 jobs to an area badly in need of development.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister and the Government to consider decentralisation throughout the regions, and particularly in the west of Ireland, to towns such as Ballaghaderreen, Boyle, Castlerea, Tuam, Ballinasloe and Carrick-on-Shannon. A decentralisation programme would be of major benefit to the west of Ireland and would recognise the concerns being expressed throughout the region. In that regard I think of the appeal made by the bishops, who have brought together a group to discuss the problems faced by that region.  It would certainly be welcome in the context of the disadvantages that will be suffered by the area post-Maastricht and in the single European market, when we will be the most disadvantaged area in the whole of Europe in relation to the location of mobile industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA are making great efforts to bring employment to our region but those efforts have not been too successful to date.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government should consider the provision of additional incentives coming from the EC for the relocation of industry to rural Ireland and specifically in the west.  If cohesion means anything, a special case should be made for additional support from funds that will be forthcoming when the Maastricht Treaty is endorsed, for both Irish and <Col N="2148" /> international companies to relocate in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The FEOGA grants have been a tremendous support in the location of industry in rural Ireland.  Industries like the Key Pack project in Athleague, the Polar West Ltd. project in Boyle, Hannons Poultry exports and Avonmore Irish Country Meats in Rooskey have all been supported by FEOGA.  This aid is a major incentive.  Industrialists have told me that they would not have established companies in counties west of the Shannon but for the FEOGA assistance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by Avonmore plc to buy the UMP plants in Ballaghaderreen, Ballyhaunis Sligo and Camolin.  This step has allayed the deep concerns of the employees in those plants.  To allow for the speedy reopening of the plants in Ballaghaderreen and Ballyhaunis, I appeal to the receiver, Mr. John Donnelly, to discharge all the accounts, particularly the accounts entered into in good faith by Mr. Des Guilfoyle, the Examiner under legislation brought before this House on foot of the Companies Act, 1990.  This Bill, which was put through this House by the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and myself as Minister of State, is good legislation. The examples highlighted in relation to the issue of cheques by the examiner in the UMP case which were not honoured by the banks has undermined the legislation. The Act is generally worth while and this is the first example of it not working in accordance with the intention of the Oireachtas.  This was one of the most important Bills produced for some years with regard to jobs retention and jobs rescue and I was glad to be associated with it.  Defects which show up will have to be amended by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This is relevant to the Finance Bill because all funding comes through the Department of Finance. The support from the Department of Industry and Commerce to industry comes through the Department of Finance. <Col N="2149" /> My comments also have a bearing on taxation policy.  The support we received in the Oireachtas for that Bill was encouraging and any defects will have to be rectified.  I appeal to the receiver to discharge all the accounts of the suppliers, hauliers and small creditors to allow Avonmore re-open the plants as quickly as possible so as to re-employ the workers and ensure that the plants will be up and running for the lamb season.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1991 the value of our exports was in the region of £15 billion while our imports were valued between £12 billion and £13 billion.  This gives us a trading surplus of £2 billion.  That is a credit to the Government and to the Departments concerned.  We face further challenges in relation to the open market of 1993.  Then our doors will be open to intense competition from European companies.</P>
      <P>About £1 billion of our imports could be substituted here if we had the will to concentrate on an intense &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  I urge people when purchasing to consider buying quality Irish products which are available at competitive prices. Import substitution could bring about an increase in jobs and about 50,000 extra jobs could be created as a result of an intensive &ldquo;buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  The quality Irish committee who issue certificates are doing their utmost to bring this to public attention.  I appeal to everybody to purchase Irish products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the proposal by Dr. Tony Ryan at the IMI Conference for an air bridge to a European airport, possibly Luxembourg.  The Ministers concerned, in consultation with An Bord Tráchtála, should examine his proposal.  As Ireland is on the periphery of Europe it is vital that we get our products to the centre of that major new market.  Dr. Ryan's proposals are worthy of consideration. Airports like Knock and Shannon could be geared to export some of our products. An air bridge would be expensive and it would have to be subsidised for a period but we should consider using the Cohesion Fund which will become available under the Maastricht Treaty to implement that proposal.  The best way <Col N="2150" /> to get our products to the centre of the market is by direct air transport services. Only about 4 per cent of our products are exported by air because of the cost of air transport.  Dr. Ryan's proposal should be costed and we should use the airports in the west as a hub for implementing it.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is imaginative and contains many good proposals.  In relation to the development of Europe we must be seen to bring the benefits of European union to the most peripheral regions of Ireland.  We face major challenges including how to deal with the many people who are unemployed.  We need to invest more in the development of tourism.  As a result of the Maastricht Treaty we will be able to get additional assistance from the EC to promote tourism, agri-tourism and so on.  It will be to our advantage to ensure that we are part and parcel of the greater European union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the budget, and the Finance Bill which implements its provisions, is to manage finances and decide how to raise finance for the coming year.  The budget can also be a method to motivate the nation to create employment.  Certainly a magnifying glass has been used in the budget and Finance Bill to raise finance.  They kill any initiative for job creation.  This is the most negative Finance Bill I have seen come into the House.  Deputy Leyden described the Bill as imaginative, but he did not indicate where.  I do not see anything imaginative in it.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years the Progressive Democrats element of the Government have treated us to speeches about the great reform of our taxation scheme.  I cannot see any reform taking place in our taxation system.  We are merely tinkering around with a system that is not serving us well, taking a penny off here and putting a penny on there, but not reforming it.  Reform means root and branch change in the system.  Unfortunately, this Bill will not bring about those changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had enough doses of medicine from the Government, particularly from the Progressive Democrats, about taxation <Col N="2151" /> reform, the great things they are going to do and how they are going to reduce the tax rates to 45 per cent and 27 per cent.  These figures are up in the air &mdash; there is no substance in them.  The structure of our taxation system is driving young professional people out of the country.  An American consultant who was involved in the Culliton report said that if one wanted to devise a system which would drive young achievers out of the country one could not devise a better one than our taxation system.  I do not think any of us would disagree with him.  I am talking mainly about young single people who are paying high rates of tax.  The Minister will introduce another budget towards the end of the year in which he will probably seek to tax fringe benefits such as car parking spaces, cloakroom facilities, etc.  We need to be more dynamic.  It is clear that the Minister did not have any hand, act or part to play in drafting this Bill.  This is a Civil Service Bill; it is not a political Bill with the political imagination this country needs.</P>
    <P>Reference is continually being made to the need to create employment.  When the Minister for Finance was Minister for Labour he constantly spoke about the importance of profit-sharing schemes: he was the guru who encouraged such schemes.  It is only correct that employees should have a share in their companies as it brings them together, motivates them and makes them that bit more loyal to their companies than if they thought they were just numbers on a page. However, in his first budget the Minister proposed to wipe out the profit-sharing arrangements, about which he had preached for years.  Did the Minister propose this himself?  This is why I question the part the Minister played in drafting this Bill.  I do not think this was the Minister's idea.  Once he spotted the change and after he had been assailed by all and sundry about it he decided not to abolish the scheme but rather to reduce the amount from £5,000 to £2,000.  This is most unsatisfactory.  If the Minister decided to make this change on his own, obviously he was talking off the top of <Col N="2152" /> his head when he was Minister for Labour and did not really believe what he said about the importance of profit-sharing. Was everything he said when he was Minister for Labour about the importance of profit-sharing merely bland talk? We are not going to create the kind of climate we need to generate jobs if this type of nitpicking continues.</P>
    <P>Up to now people who made a profit of, say, £14,000 from their investments in manufacturing industry knew they would not be taxed on half of it.  As we all know investment in manufacturing is very risky.  If there is a risk element people should get some reward.  I do not know why this concession which gave people an incentive to invest in manufacturing industry is being done away with.  A person who made a profit of £14,000 knew he would have £7,000 in his back pocket which would not be taxed.  That was a good idea.  Under a new arrangement which will be introduced towards the end of the year a husband and wife who make a profit of up to £100,000 will only pay 10 per cent tax.  This means no employment will be generated.  If they make a profit of £10,000 which they reinvest they will only have to pay £1,000 in tax but if they do not reinvest it they will pay 48p in the pound.  This is not the way to encourage enterprise.  It seems we are only paying lip service to the 300,000 people who are unemployed.  We have set up a talking shop in this House, a committee.  If we have a problem which we cannot solve and which is creating hassle we put it into a committee where we hope it will be resolved.  I see some sense in a jobs forum but I do not see any sense in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the business expansion scheme which no doubt was abused to some extent.  Nevertheless it was fairly successful. If it was open to abuse it should have been possible in the Finance Bill to eliminate the avenues which allowed for such abuse.  So far as I am aware this scheme will be done away with next year.  In future there will be little or no incentive to create jobs. Unemployment is the great scourge in <Col N="2153" /> this country.  Our economy is in a fairly good position, we have a reasonably low rate of inflation and a reasonable level of growth.  We should be doing everything within our power to ensure that we create the climate necessary to encourage employers to take on people, something which so far as I can see they are slow to do.  When an employer takes on someone he has to pay a payroll tax in addition to PRSI, etc.  A man employing say, 100 people may be making reasonably small profits but, because he is employing people, he has a large payroll tax.  There may be another fellow located in the Financial Services Centre, operating from a couple of rooms there, with three or four people, reaping large profits but because of the type of business in which he is engaged, his payroll tax will be minimal; he will be paying 10 per cent tax only on his business.  I should like to see the general payroll taxes spread uniformly across the overall business taxation code rather than an employer incurring a cost for employing somebody.  I do not know how that can be achieved but I do not think it is beyond the bounds of possibility. If that could be done the burden of taxation would be shared more equally and would be divorced from employment, in other words, impose a minimal tax on employment, whereas at present we tax employment to the maximum. There is no doubt but that this acts as a disincentive because, whenever one talks to employers, they all have the same story &mdash; they are slow to employ people because of the inherent cost and the volume of paperwork involved.  If we are serious about resolving the unemployment crisis, we must examine the overall payroll taxation system ascertaining whether we can devise a better one, thereby allowing employers to take on people whenever they wish.</P>
    <P>While talking about unemployment, disincentives to employers and so on, it is only right that I should refer to our legislation relating to employment generally. It is now practically impossible to dismiss an employee.  Indeed, whenever one threatens to dismiss an employee they can publicise the fact in the media <Col N="2154" /> and they can create havoc.  I am not advocating a hire and fire attitude &mdash; we have progressed from that point &mdash; but if people are not pulling their weight within their overall employment regime, then they must be let go.  Business people tell me they have employees they cannot dismiss. They know they are creating havoc, that they are not pulling their weight and that they take matters to the brink, knowing exactly how far they can go without being dismissed.  That is another disincentive to employing people.  This leads to employers preferring to purchase another machine, engage in additional overtime or whatever in order to overcome that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in this Bill which will create a sense of motivation or imagination that would lead to greater, more stable employment overall.  The proposal to move away from allowing people tax breaks, that is, those who invest in manufacturing industry, to allowing very generous tax breaks to people who have money, is not a good idea.  It must be remembered that our banking institutions today are most reluctant to loan money to small businesses; they do not want to know such people; they are afraid of them.  I contend that the greatest potential for employment in any country is to be found in its small businesses.  I know the odd company will expand and develop into a much larger business, but it is through helping the small industry or business we can create employment.  I do not foresee that the provisions in this Bill will help in that respect in any way.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposed introducing a new system of reaping money from licensed vintners based on their rateable valuations.  Apparently now he proposes to impose some type of levy on their turnover.  This begs the question: is this a new form of taxation?  It appears the Minister has singled out publicans because they pay a licence, but it should be remembered that the purpose of granting a licence was to streamline the trade overall.  I contend the Minister is initiating a new form of taxation on publicans' turnover.  I assume that all businesses pay tax on their turnover and <Col N="2155" /> are taxed on their profits; henceforth publicans will have to make additional payments which will be passed on to their customers &mdash; the publicans will not pay it themselves &mdash; by way of additional charges on the ordinary customer.  If this proposal is a success &mdash; and I hope it will not be since it constitutes another form of taxation &mdash; it begs the question whether the Minister will move on to, say, a draper's shop.  Will he then decide that we could get a good few pounds out of them?  Will he decide to impose a levy on the turnover of, say, the greengrocer, the supermarket or whoever?  Will it stop there?  He may think that is a great idea and impose another tax on the retail trade.  I do not like this proposal.</P>
    <P>In reforming the overall taxation system, one must ensure that people pay tax on their profits &mdash; which is what they should be taxed on &mdash; on a once-off basis rather than being taxed on their profit and then ascertaining whether there are other ways in which additional revenue can be squeezed from them under the guise of charging more for their licences. Blantly it is an additional tax.  I consider it wrong and it will open the door to yet more taxation.</P>
    <P>We must also remember that the inflation rate is most important to our economy and must be firmly nailed down at all times.  However, I must admit it has been kept well in check; I am not disputing that.  Nonetheless, I could advance a number of reasons that is so. However, this latest additional taxation will constitute an additional charge on services which will lead ultimately to an increased cost of living, in turn leading to an increased rate of inflation.  We are well aware of its consequences because, once it begins to rise, it is very difficult to restrain.  Therefore we should be doing everything in our power to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to genuinely examine some reasonable reform of taxation. I know it is not easy but we must ensure that we do not drive our achievers abroad because, ultimately, it is they who will render this country great, and this <Col N="2156" /> country can be great.  It has enormous potential if only we could move away from the begging bowl mentality.  Over the forthcoming six weeks or so when there will be much talk about the Maastricht Treaty, I hope we will not hear predictions that we may lose, say £6 billion if we do not comply.  If that is the only reason we are a member of the EC &mdash; that we might get £6 billion here or £2 billion there &mdash; better we never joined.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous opportunities in Europe for this country, a very affluent market of 400 million people we can cultivate and develop, which is the way we shall resolve our unemployment problem but not by moving around contending we are one of the poorer countries of Europe.  I very much resent that attitude because we are not a poor country.  In many ways we are a wealthy country, perhaps not in a financial sense, but we have tremendous wealth in other forms and we should exploit it rather than going around Europe with a begging bowl, cap in hand &mdash; like a dependent nation.  In so doing we are merely creating within our country a further dependency attitude.</P>
    <P>Whenever a businessman or industry decides to expand here they almost always ask themselves what will I get if I do this?  Is there a grant for it?  Will I receive anything from Brussels?  This overall dependency mentality is wrong. Having said that, I should make it clear I am all for assistance, for having funds allocated where they are needed to develop our infrastructure, and so on, in a really competitive manner.  We have reaped a great deal of funds from Brussels but are we any more competitive or better, have we spent those funds in the correct manner, or have we engaged in activities that will improve our competitiveness, our attitude or entrepreneurial spirit <i>vis-à-vis</i> development?</P>
    <P>These are questions we must ask ourselves. I am not sure that it could be fairly said that we have rendered our stewardship well as regards the money we have received.  Assuming that we receive £6 billion &mdash; that figure has not yet been agreed &mdash; it will not be adequate to meet our requirements.  However, that <Col N="2157" /> is not what we should be thinking about. We should be thinking about the advantages, encouraging industries to go into Europe and helping them with their marketing. That is how we will create the employment that is required.  The fact that there are roughly 300,000 people on the unemployment register is a sad indictment on us all.  There are more people on the live register than there are in manufacturing industry.  That frightening fact is referred to in the Culliton report.</P>
    <P>I said I would not delay the House because I know that a number of speakers wish to contribute.  This Finance Bill is a disappointment in many ways.  It is an anti-business, anti-job Finance Bill.  It is a mean, petty Finance Bill in which the Government are trying to squeeze all they can from people, whether in terms of shares in a company, investment in manufacturing or other areas.  Let us consign that sort of thinking to the waste paper basket and become a nation with a vision and imagination.  Let us come up with ideas to make this country a very competitive one and to put us in the position whereby we do not care whether people come here to invest because our own people can do the job just as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome the Bill. I take issue with Deputy O'Brien's rather derogatory remarks on the Bill.  That type of opposition for opposition's sake is something which the public and the electorate are tired of.  This is perhaps the largest body of legislation to come before the House for many years, and that is a tribute to the Minister.  It is a reforming Bill which takes cognisance of changes that are about to take place in Europe and which will have a direct impact on the management of our public finances and on our budgetary strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech detailed the changes to the taxation system in particular and outlined his strategy on unemployment. This Finance Bill continues the correct financial and fiscal strategy which has been the hallmark of all Governments since 1987.  It is fair to say that the economic and financial strategy <Col N="2158" /> from 1987 to 1992 has been the best of the last 20 or 25 years, and that can be easily lost sight of.  Opposition speakers should acknowledge that we have restored control to our public finances. We have significantly reduced taxation rates and we have reduced foreign borrowing as a percentage of GNP.  This was not done easily, it was done with some pain, but it was very necessary.  It is very important that when we talk critically of unemployment we remember that the overall financial framework is a solid and an improving one.  That results from wise policies pursued by Governments since 1987 and it should be put on the record because people are allowed forget it too easily.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the still excessive burden which our national debt imposes on our finances.  Almost one-quarter of total tax revenue is spent on servicing our national debt.  That is an incredible figure which has obvious implications for spending and for expansionary Government policy, which some people have been calling for.  It imposes very real limits on what Government can do in terms of reflating the economy, in terms of public expenditure, expenditure on health, social welfare and education. Almost one-tenth of GNP, or one-quarter of total tax revenue, must be allocated annually to meet debt servicing costs alone.  That is a very sobering reality which we should not lose sight of and which should be borne in mind when commenting on this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the Minister's speech that he is committed to maintaining financial and economic discipline. If we show any slippage or give any indication that we are going back to our wayward ways, the unemployment position and the economy in general would be the poorer.  The Minister has given a very clear commitment to follow through on the budgetary discipline and to attain the targets he set in the areas of borrowing, public expenditure and taxation, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>On unemployment, the Minister in his speech outlined four basic areas in which the Government are moving to combat <Col N="2159" /> the unemployment problem.  The first is by simplifying the taxation system and reducing taxation rates.  Most bodies who have carried out surveys and analyses on our economic performance have drawn attention to the taxation system as an inhibiting factor and a major disincentive to the creation of employment.  The OECD, the National Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Taxation and the Culliton report have made similar points and recommendations regarding our taxation system.  The Minister has followed through on a number of those and in this Bill has gone further than in most Finance Bills in recent years in endeavouring to implement certain proposals put forward by the Commission on Taxation and by other bodies. Hopefully, by streamling the taxation system and reducing tax rates we will give greater incentive to the private sector thereby creating more employment.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister referred to the new employment subsidy scheme and in-company training.  That is a very significant scheme and one that should be expanded.  It highlights the necessity for the Government to push harder at EC level for greater funding for direct employment and training initiatives.  We should be putting the whole question of employment and training firmly on the EC agenda and we should focus very strongly on that area post-Maastricht. This is a very welcome start, with total European funding covering the employment subsidy scheme and training. However, we should look for even more money in the years to come, and that is not the begging bowl mentality.  Unlike our European partners we have structural problems of ten to 20 years duration in relation to unemployment.  These problems relate to our population structure and our demographic situation.  We have the fastest growing labour force in Europe with thousands of young people coming onto the labour market year after year.  That is a fact of which we must take cognisance.  There is a case to be made to Europe that this is a problem which we will face for the next 20 to 25 years, <Col N="2160" /> a problem that will require interim measures by Government and that under normal economic and fiscal policy we will not be able to seriously reduce the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>We need special initiatives like the employer subsidy scheme but we require funding from Europe for them.  The Government should put employment and training on the top of the agenda.  Given the financial constraints under which we have to operate we should examine whether the moneys being spent on social welfare, on labour and training and on education are being used most effectively, whether we are getting value for money or whether the moneys might be used better if they were directed to employment creation.</P>
    <P>During discussion of the Social Welfare Bill, we were told that £3.3 billion is being spend on social welfare alone this year.  We will also be spending considerable amounts of money on employment and training and on education.  It is necessary to carry out a critical examination of expenditure with a view to redirecting moneys to employment creation and training.  For example, I do not think that a young person who leaves school at either 15 or 18 years of age should immediately go on the dole.  This is a bad start for any young person and it should be avoided.  There is an onus on the State to provide the young person with further training in order that the dole queue and the negative impact this has on personal self development is not inevitable.  We should try to steer young people towards vocational courses.  We should ensure that like other industrial countries no young person leaves the educational system without some skills that are useful in the labour market.</P>
    <P>We have a chronic shortage of employment. A very considerable number of our young people leave school far too early &mdash; perhaps at 15 or 16 years of age and without any skills whatsoever.  It is extremely difficult for those people to ever gain access to the labour market. They may pick up temporary work here and there but as a result of increased technology and the reduction in manual <Col N="2161" /> employment right across the board they will find it almost impossible to get sustainable employment.  There is a great need for targeted training programmes for the early school leavers who find it most difficult to gain access to the labour market.  We should direct both European and national funding to this group.</P>
    <P>Another group are those who have worked in traditional industry or areas of work for 20 to 25 years and now find at the age of 45 or 50 they have been made redundant.  We need training programmes so that these people are helped to adapt to further employment.  The reality is that in the next ten to 20 years people will not be in the same job for life.  People will have to be open to the possibility of change and may have to change the nature of their job in a ten year span.  This is why retraining is very important.  I want the Government to examine carefully the redundancy packages and rationalisation programmes that many semi-State bodies and local authorities set in place.  I question the wisdom of their actions.  This course of action is taken in the name of rationalising the State body and making savings but I am not sure if it achieves their objectives. The net result however is that more people are put on the dole and this costs the State considerable sums of money.</P>
    <P>The staff in Telecom Éireann, An Post and indeed in local authorities throughout the country were offered redundancy packages which were very expensive. Thousands of workers took redundancy and are now on the dole.  The State has had to make significant redundancy payments and will continue to pay superannuation and pensions to those former employees.  The net saving to the State is minimal.  Let me illustrate: I am a member of Cork Corporation and I know that that body laid off 500 staff since 1987.  Yet, if it was indexed linked, we are spending the same amount of money now as we were in 1987.  With 500 fewer employees, obviously there is an impact on the capacity to provide services.  The corporation still pay superannuation and pensions to those who took redundancy as well as the substantial redundancy payments <Col N="2162" /> which they received.  I question the wisdom of offering redundancy.  We would have been far better off if the 500 people were retained within the local authority.</P>
    <P>The question boils down to what type of society we want.  We should ask whether we want more people in employment or more people without jobs?  If employment is the cornerstone of our philosophy we should be examining critically the rationalisation programmes that companies undertake and asking if there are alternative ways of effecting savings and redeploying those who are surplus to requirements in a given area.  We should look at the problem in a different way. The frame of mind in many organisations is how people ought to be shed but a fundamental change in that thinking is needed because I do not think it has been particularly effective.  We can all talk about success stories but if they mean that we put 3,000 or 4,000 people on the dole we have to question how we measure success.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some interesting comments in his speech on taxation.  It must be acknowledged that in the past five years we have made the most significant and progressive reductions in taxation levels of the past 20 years.  In 1987 the then Fianna Fáil Government initiated the process which has been carried on by the present Government.  Prior to that we had a great deal of talk, many promises but very little action.  At present the lower rate of income tax is 27 per cent and the higher rate is 48 per cent. Both figures represent significant reductions in the marginal rates of tax.</P>
    <P>Some reliefs have been abolished causing considerable sectoral opposition right across the board.  In many ways this brought the taxation debate into focus. Many people who called for reductions in taxation never looked at the other side of the coin &mdash; the abolition of reliefs and shelters.  Various groups lobbied the Minister and Members of the Oireachtas to effect changes in the measures announced in the budget.  The Minister made a fair point when he said taxation reform is not just a universal lowering of <Col N="2163" /> taxes, that it involves pain for certain sectors by way of the removal of reliefs.  I believe, however, that we should proceed cautiously with the removal of certain reliefs and I am particularly anxious that mortgage interest and the VHI premium reliefs would be retained and not tinkered with in future Finance Bills.  These reliefs and others are justified because of their social dimension.  We must not forget that we can boast of having the highest rate of home ownership in the world.  Mortgage interest relief has a bearing on that in that it acts as an incentive in assisting people to purchase their own homes.  This reflects well on the State and on successive Governments.  The level of home ownership is a socially progressive achievement.</P>
    <P>This year we got a taste of the way various sections of the economy respond to erosion of reliefs.  I am not saying they were wrong as people are entitled to make their case.  However we need to have a more honest and up-front debate by the various sectors in society and the social partners who, on a global level argue for tax reform, but when it actually affects a specific sector mobilise behind the sector in opposing the reforms.</P>
    <P>In that context I welcome the measures contained in the Finance Bill which deal with profit sharing.  Deputy O'Brien was rather critical of the Minister in that regard as he has modified his original budget position on profit sharing and has reduced the limit from £5,000 to £2,000. In reducing the annual value per employee of profit sharing schemes from £5,000 to £2,000 rather than eliminating the relief entirely the Minister has responded well to the arguments put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers and the Confederation of Irish Industry.  I welcome the modification. There is still merit in the profit sharing schemes, they improve employment motivation and industrial relations within a given company and it is a concept that should not be eliminated.  A considerable number of employees in my constituency share that view also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> In regard to company cars, the Minister responded fairly reasonably to the case put forward by company sales representatives on the question of benefit in kind.  The fundamental point which sales representatives made to me, which I accept and support, is that the company car for all sales representatives is the tool of the trade &mdash; in other words, it is the <i>modus operandi</i> of their work and should not be taxed.  The Minister has moved significantly to meet the request put to him by sales representatives and they are reasonably satisfied with the response in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The third area which received considerable attention was liquor licences and the renewal of publican licences.  The Minister has responded reasonably to that lobby group.  He did so in a way which maintained the overall framework of the budget and its objectives, but basically he devised an alternative scheme. The licence charge will obviously apply to the bar turnover.  It will be set at £200 where the turnover is less than £150,000, a sliding scale of increased charges will apply subject to a maximum of £3,000 for any premises that has turnover of £1 million.  The Minister estimates that over three quarters of all publicans will have a turnover of less than £150,000.  That is a reasonable response to a very reasonable case put forward by the vintners and publicans. It is wrong to relate it to rateable valuation because that would act as a disincentive to publicans to improve their premises in future years.  People would be slow to improve their premises &mdash; improvements which have been demanded by the tourist industry for some time &mdash; if they realised they were increasing their own tax liability by doing so.  We have all witnessed significant improvements to public houses throughout the country which benefit the tourist industry and create employment in the construction industry.  Anything that would act as a disincentive should be discouraged.  That is one reason the rateable valuation was not the best means of doing things.  Certainly, the whole question of the multiplier left an open door for future Ministers in so far as they could <Col N="2165" /> increase the multiplier from year to year. The present system, as announced in the Finance Bill, relating it to turnover is a reasonable one and will not adversely affect the objectives of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that urban designated areas have not taken off as quickly as they should have.  In the city of Cork some significant areas were designated two years ago and so far we have witnessed very little growth.  In one area the difficulty is that the State controls a number of the buildings, a former Garda station and a former school.  There have been genuine difficulties involving title and so on in putting the buildings on sale to any prospective developers who may wish to develop the sites.  I would urge the Minister to continue to monitor and review the deadlines under the designated areas scheme with a view to extending them further where there is a genuine reason for development not taking place and a strong potential for such development.  Development should not be prevented because of a deadline at the end of 1994 and the Minister should be flexible in that regard.  The designated areas scheme works tremendously well, particularly in the South Parish area of Cork city.  There has been a dramatic improvement in urban renewal in the streetscapes, in business, housing and so on, all of which is directly attributable to the implementation of the designated areas scheme.  Cork Corporation deserve to be complimented in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the jobs committee. Deputy O'Brien was over critical of the jobs committee.  After all, it was Fine Gael who called for the jobs forum.  They should participate actively on the employment committee and try to add some of the imagination and vision which Deputy O'Brien talked about to the deliberations of that committee.  I thank the Chair for facilitating me.  I congratulate the Minister in putting such substantive legislation before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be mercifully brief because my colleague, Deputy Quinn, the Labour Party spokesman on Finance dealt with this Bill at <Col N="2166" /> some length earlier in the week.  I do not intend to range far and wide over the Bill.  I just want to express a view on a few areas about which I feel strongly. Obviously, our party will be opposing this Bill because we had looked forward to a Finance Bill which would have a major impact in attacking the great problem that besets this country, namely, unemployment and an escalating figure of 300,000.  This is something which shocks all of us.  Various initiatives are being suggested and are being considered, but surely the Finance Bill could have been used as a means of making work more attractive.  Because of the tax and PAYE levels people have to consider whether their household budget would be improved by employment.  They must consider whether they can afford to come off dole and travel to a job or move the family to a different area where opportunities may arise.  When we see the PAYE figures, which have increased over the previous years we must accept that the concessions given in the budget under PAYE do not offer the incentive to workers who pay high rates of tax.  Every year the figure goes up.  Small increases are given but every Government know there is a buoyancy in that and they can look forward to between 25p and 45p of every pound given coming back into the taxation pool.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to dwell long on this issue because my colleague has dealt very well with it.  However, I want to give two examples which are close to my heart. Because of the postal strike, one of the little jobs we had to do is to take cheques that are issued here to our secretaries.  I asked my secretary for permission to open her envelope and look at what tax she is paying.  Out of her gross pay of £269.55 a week there are deductions of £80.55 and the biggest deduction is £65 tax leaving her with under £190.  I know she has a mortgage, she tries to run a car and she has all the other usual expenses. That somebody in a fairly low paid job has to pay such an amount in tax shows there is something wrong with the taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other example I would like to give <Col N="2167" /> is our pay in this House.  Some of the public think we do not pay tax at all, that we are very well paid, get subsidised food, travel expenses, etc.  However, we pay heavily in taxation.  Out of a gross pay of £2,429.59 a month my total deductions are £935.  It is right that the public should know that public representatives are not getting away with something.  We have no advantage under the PAYE system. We have allowances for office expenses and various outgoings.  When one sees what a relatively well paid person pays in taxation &mdash; in my case it is £650 per month &mdash; one realises that the tax burden on the employed is very severe.</P>
    <P>This budget failed to appreciate the value of the PAYE payers to the community and to give them as good a break as possible; it sees them as the main prop in gathering money to carry out the various services the Government must provide under the Estimates for the various Departments.  The levels of tax are crippling PAYE payers.  There is a great disincentive for employers to create jobs and there is a disincentive to the unemployed to consider becoming employed and coming off the dole.  Most people are on the unemployment register because there is no work for them.  However, the level of take home pay compared with the amount of tax paid in even the most lowly paid jobs is a great disincentive for people to go into employment.  Ministers for Finance have a duty to examine this to see if it is the main reason for the increase in the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>The other areas I want to deal with are pub and hotel licences.  I had the honour to be the Minister for Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry for a short period in 1986. I know what efforts organisations like Bord Fáilte and Ministers for Tourism are making, and with some success, to expand our tourism industry at a time when this country is becoming far more attractive than some of the traditional Mediterranean resorts that held sway during the seventies and eighties.  We have the potential to expand this industry, our second largest, but this Bill seems to attack the producers.  On 29 January <Col N="2168" /> the Minister for Finance proposed that for public house licences the charge would be based on the rateable valuation of the premises.  He said that the operation of the rating system had been improved in recent years and reflected turnover, thus providing a fair means of differentiating between pubs.  He said that although the same general approach could be validly applied to liquor licences for hotels, he proposed, in designing the system, to take into account the fact that the valuation of such premises was based on much broader considerations than bar turnover alone.</P>
    <P>There has been a howl of protest from the licensed trade and from hoteliers since then and certain modifications have been made.  To say that the application of the rating system is fair is to forget what happened in the farming area when the farmers of Wexford took the licensing system to court and got it overthrown. The rating system is grossly unfair as a basis for reflecting the valuation and wealth creating potential of one premises as against another.  It was a major fault to consider that as a fair basis for the application of licence fees on premises. The valuation of public houses and licensed premises anywhere is an area that requires root and branch change.  It should be considered by the Minister and the Valuation Office with a view to introducing a fair system of rating.  Rates have been removed from domestic dwellings and local authorities now depend to a very large extent on the income from commercial premises.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, depending on their make-up and complexion, in examining the question of service charges and commercial rates at their estimates meetings to pay for services, which have been reduced since 1987, have leaned unfairly on commercial and industrial users.  The Minister for Finance is now proposing to introduce a rating system to penalise them further.  This reflects the disincentive effect this Bill will have in relation to the creation of employment. Indeed, it will place commercial premises with marginal profit levels in jeopardy.  I hope therefore that this proposal that <Col N="2169" /> licences be based on the rateable valuation or turnover will be rejected by the House as it appears to be a cute little way, on the part of the Minister for Finance, of raising additional taxation.</P>
    <P>I have never known the size of an operation to be reflected in the licence charge. When we take all licences into account I do not think turnover was ever considered. Indeed, the only area where the licence charge varies is the area of motor taxation if one wishes to use a larger or more powerful car.  It is worth recalling that in 1977, in an effort to win an election, the then Fianna Fáil Government decided that there would be only one licence for all vehicles.</P>
    <P>If one goes to buy a dog licence one does not say that it is for a bull mastiff or a pekinese as it is the one licence.  The purpose of the licence should be to ensure that statistics are available on the number of premises or dogs as the case may be. I would have thought that the taxation system would garner tax from any viable business for the Exchequer without the need to see if a business is doing well or to determine its turnover.  It should also ensure that tax is paid on behalf of employees.  I think therefore that the Minister has been badly advised.  As he did not increase the licence fee from £100 to £200, ignoring the question of turnover, the workload of the Department will be increased in checking out licenced premises, which run into thousands, to see if they are being honest and straight in making their returns on their turnover and are paying the correct charge.  At the end of the day it might be useful to carry out a cost benefit analysis to discover the increase in revenue under this section.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in relation to tourism that the basic producers of the product are being attacked despite the fact that we depend on them to provide a good welcome and proper facilities for tourists and to encourage them to return.  Therefore this legislation has been badly thought out.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in particular about the way in which this new charge will affect hotels.  Indeed, one of the major hotel groups has written to me about the <Col N="2170" /> effect it will have on its business.  I can show the Minister this letter, if he would like to see it, but I imagine he has a similar letter on his desk.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>In the case of my company, I am already paying three hotel rates amounting to £250,000.  We are now faced with this new additional charge from the Government of approximately £13,000 per annum.  Briefly, my objections are based on the fact that the proposal represents a new tax on hotels, a dramatic increase in an operating cost which will adversely affect our competitiveness in the international marketplace.  The comparable fees in Northern Ireland and the UK are £75 and £12.50 respectively.</P>
    <P>The country with the biggest tourism industry in the world is Britain, in terms of its size and population, and they can accept a fee of £12.50 for a hotel licence. Given that this man will have to pay an extra £13,000 it seems that we are pushing ourselves to the limit.  The increased duty payable in respect of public houses and hotels will be passed on to the person who spends his few pounds on a pint each week or to the visitor.  Publicans and hoteliers will not absorb this cost out of their own profits, which may be marginal. I can assure the Minister that this will place us at a competitive disadvantage with other European countries which attract tourists.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the increased cost, in turn, will have to be passed on to the consumer, as I said, adding to inflation and that this is an inequitable charge which is based on an already inequitable rates system.  I have dealt with that matter in some detail.  He also said that it is a penalty on hotels which improve their facilities and are revalued upwards accordingly and that it is a disincentive to investment.  It is worth listening to someone like him in the business world and taking his views into account.</P>
    <P>If we are to make progress in the tourism industry we must look at any charges which make us less competitive and we must be very slow to apply <Col N="2171" /> increases.  On the one hand, the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications are spending taxpayer's money all over the world to attract tourists, but on the other the Department of Finance are imposing a penalty.  Therefore we are back to the old problem of one Department spending taxpayer's money to advertise our wares and the boot being put into the same industry by another Department.  Surely, the then Minister &mdash; there has been a change of Ministers since the budget was framed &mdash; should have voiced his annoyance and hostility to this change.</P>
    <P>While I accept a concession has been made in this area, my party will be tabling amendments to sections 134 and 135 of the Bill as it is a mistake to make this change.  I hope when the Ministers come to realise that they have made a mistake they will undo it because, as I said, this industry is now employing more people, is expanding and generating wealth.</P>
    <P>People will also have to show that they have received a tax clearance certificate in seeking to renew their licence.  This means that a publican or hotelier could find himself in difficulty if he is having problems in making his tax return.  This amounts to a further penalty on the industry.</P>
    <P>I said I would be brief and I do not intend to cover any other aspect of the Bill.  I am concerned that our tourism industry could be affected by the changes in the Bill.  I am disappointed that the Bill will not encourage job creation; indeed it will have the opposite effect.  Our spokesperson, Deputy Quinn, voiced his criticisms of the Bill and, for many reasons, we will be opposing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this reforming Bill which provides an incentive to those at work while, at the same time, caring for the people who are forced to rely on social welfare benefits.  More important, it creates a climate for investment and Members on all sides are anxious to ensure that the prevailing climate will <Col N="2172" /> encourage Irish and foreign investment to solve our very worrying unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, introduced a reforming budget but two matters caused great concern to many Deputies.  One was the proposal to set the liquor licence fee on the basis of rateable valuation and I compliment the Minister for reviewing this.  If we had committed ourselves to this decision many publicans, particularly in rural areas, would have gone out of business. I should like to take up a point made by Deputy Kavanagh.  The Government will have to look at rateable valuations as a basis for collecting commercial rates.  It is inequitable and will not encourage the commercial sector to expand business.  If we had insisted on granting liquor licences on the basis of rateable valuations there would have been little refurbishment or extensions to existing public houses.  We are all very proud of the role publicans have played in ensuring that there are good facilities for tourists. Indeed, the Government have recognised that the tourism industry is very important in helping to solve our high unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on reviewing the increases in regard to benefit-in-kind. The original proposal would have caused major problems for many companies, particularly for company representatives. As a businessman, I am aware of the contribution many company representatives make to the success of their companies and I welcome the decision of the Minister to review that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Martin that there is a need to extend the urban renewal programme.  However, it must be on the basis of success which particular counties or boroughs have had; it would be foolish to extend urban renewal to counties where little or no commitment was given to that concept.  I make this point in relation to my county where, in Wexford town, there was an outstandingly successful £10 million urban renewal programme which has changed the whole facade of the town.  The Minister should <Col N="2173" /> extend this programme to counties and boroughs who have worked hard to ensure the success of the concept of urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The day, Wednesday, 29 January 1992 was, without doubt, an important and historic one in the lifetime of this Government. It will go on record as the day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, introduced a reforming, socially caring and socially conscious budget. It was also a courageous budget, once again stressing the Government's intention of addressing many of the ills of our society and in seeking fair and equitable treatment for all.  The budget &mdash; and the Finance Bill &mdash; when looked at objectively have a very positive and forward looking framework.  Many will benefit from their measures.  All income taxpayers will benefit because the standard rate tax band has been widened from £13,400 to £14,950 for a married couple and from £6,700 to £7,475 for a single person.  The lowering of the income tax rates &mdash; from 29 per cent to 27 per cent standard rate and the top rate from 52 per cent to 48 per cent &mdash; will benefit taxpayers in a very significant way as it will give them an increased disposable income.  Such measures will be a positive boost to employee and employer alike.  They will act as a great motivating force among the employed and will give the jobless a greater incentive to work.  Employers will find such tax reforming measures very supportive in encouraging and motivating the workforce.  These measures, together with employment initiatives announced by the Minister, can only be seen as a worth-while boost to increasing employment and encouraging growth in the economy.  The two-tiered tax rate structure also offers a much simpler and more efficient system.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare recipients will also benefit with weekly welfare payments being increased by 4 per cent, short-term welfare benefits being increased by a further 2 per cent and other appropriate measures, which will more than adequately take account of the predicted inflation rate for 1992.</P>
    <P>I do not have any hesistation in reiterating <Col N="2174" /> the Government's commitment and willingness to grapple with the current employment situation.  The Minister spoke of his concern in relation to safeguarding existing jobs and encouraging the creation of new jobs.  The Government know the road ahead, the creation of a single European Community market from January 1993 and the establishment of political, economic and monetary union.  Ireland must be ready to grasp the opportunities such events will present and share in the economic prosperity that such ventures will undoubtedly bring. Given the world situation, Ireland has fared quite well.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that unemployment is the single greatest social problem with which this country must contend because our labour force is growing.  I referred earlier to the stimulus that the tax reforming measures specified by the Minister will give to employment.  I commend the Government for initiating two schemes, an employment subsidy scheme and an in-company training scheme.  This marks a most important and significant new development with clear long-term viability.  The employment subsidy scheme will cater for up to 15,000 additional employees and will be open to a wide range of employers.  The in-company training scheme will provide training for up to 10,000 people and the Government's commitment to both schemes is further indication of the thrust of the budget to confront the problem of rising unemployment and to speed up new employment opportunities.  There is evidence in my own constituency of many companies expressing an interest in availing of these schemes and I have no doubt they will create badly needed employment. These initiatives will give them all the encouragement they need to advance their positions and create further employment in a county which has the second highest unemployment rate in the country.</P>
    <P>However, I also have to point out that significant improvement has been achieved in jobs in the manufacturing area under this Government.  Jobs in manufacturing in the Wexford district <Col N="2175" /> increased in 1990 by 1.74 per cent to 5,140.  That achievement was the third successive annual net increase and in 1991 jobs increased by 3.75 per cent, making a fourth yearly increase.  The figure stood at 5,012 in 1983 and in 1987 it stood at 4,700, a decrease of 6.2 per cent at the hands of the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government.  Between 1987 and 1991 manufacturing employment increased to 5,333, a remarkable increase of 13.4 per cent.</P>
    <P>At this stage I wish to recognise and commend the work of the IDA and the positive role they are playing in enhancing the employment prospects in our country.  I have no doubt that the 143 small business companies in County Wexford will find heartening and encouraging reading in this year's budget, as will other such firms throughout the country. I also commend the IDA for their commitment of £15,000 per annum for five years to Wexford Enterprise Centre resulting in the creation of 73 jobs in 23 projects.  The IDA have also approved assistance for an enterprise centre in New Ross and are supporting a feasibility study into an enterprise centre for Enniscorthy.  I welcome and appreciate the work and money committed to such projects but I feel that the time is now ripe for the IDA to locate an advance factory in Drinagh on the main Rosslare-Dublin road.  That is an exceptionally good site.  The IDA have committed more than £1 million on site development work.  As I said at the commencement of my speech, Wexford town is facing dire problems because of unemployment.  I ask the IDA to locate a significant factory on the Drinagh site on the Rosslare-Dublin road as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The general infrastructure of Wexford has much to offer.  At Rosslare Harbour a major investment programme has been approved, including the provision of a new jetty, to enhance even further the modern facilities there.  There is an ever-improving road infrastructure, IDA sites will be improved by ongoing drainage schemes at Enniscorthy and Wexford; <Col N="2176" /> and of course, we have an educated and available workforce.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the initiatives introduced by the Minister, I suggest that the Government could and should complement those measures by seeking to implement such recommendations of the Task Force on Employment as increasing access to higher education, which would have many positive side effects; reviewing the imposition of stamp duty on new houses, allowing the exemption of new houses with a floor area of up to 140 metres square; and a greater emphasis on a higher proportion of residential development in further development under urban renewal schemes.</P>
    <P>This budget, despite a difficult financial climate, has responded very positively to the demands of providing an efficient and improving health service in 1992, underlining this Government's responsibilities in this area.  Expenditure in health services is being increased by 5.8 per cent, a significant increase in real terms and a further indication of the Government's response to the needs of the health services and a definite and major commitment in advancing the already high standards of our health services.</P>
    <P>Of great interest to my constituents will be that the health estimates will make it possible to fund several hospital developments commissioned in 1991, particularly the new and eagerly awaited hospital at Wexford.  That hospital has been a major bone of contention for several years.  Various Ministers have promised to allocate funds for the building of the hospital.  I am particularly pleased that it was under a Fianna Fáil Administration that the new hospital commenced and I hope that it will be opened in the coming months.  The new facilities, which will include a new surgical department, new operating theatres and recovery area and new radiology, outpatients and casualty departments, will provide the people of Wexford and the south east in general with the top class facilities they deserve.</P>
    <P>Of special significance will be the provision of a specialist paediatric service for Wexford.  I pay a special word of thanks <Col N="2177" /> to Deputies Rory O'Hanlon and Chris Flood for the work they have done in this area.  I know that there was a very strong view within the Department of Health opposing the allocation of a paediatric service in Wexford County Hospital. Because of the work of both men our appeals were very successful.  I have no doubt that the people of Wexford are very grateful to both Deputies for their work and commitment and for the finances provided to ensure the provision of the new paediatric service.</P>
    <P>I especially welcome in the budget the extra £10 million provided for services to the mentally handicapped.  As the Minister for Health pointed out, this is the most significant annual increase ever for people who are handicapped.  It is most important that we support such people, beautifully described in our native language as &ldquo;daoine le Dia&rdquo;, the people of God.</P>
    <P>Later today a meeting will be held with the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, to seek funding for Saint Clare's and Saint Michael's Centre in Wexford town.  Those involved in this area of health care are doing an exceptionally good job but in deplorable conditions. Mentally handicapped and retarded people are lying on floors in Wexford town because of the failure to provide money for this service.  Knowing the Minister for Health, I am sure that today's meeting will have a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that the Government have seen fit, despite the current financial restraints, to respond positively to the needs of people in receipt of social welfare.  I have no doubt that these improvements, together with others announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, will lighten the burden of those who depend on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Education and the provision of the best facilities possible in furthering what is widely regarded as one of the most highly educated cohorts of young people in Europe is of the utmost importance.  The reduction of the pupil:teacher ratio at both primary and post primary levels to 25.2:1 and 19.25:1 and a commitment to <Col N="2178" /> improve further these ratios next year is indicative of the high priority standing of education and the young people of Ireland in this Government's programme. A very substantial number of schools will benefit from the decision to recognise a significant number of vice-principals and school guidance teachers on an ex-quota basis.  Also welcomed is the introduction of a programme to expand the provision for caretaking and clerical services at primary and post primary schools.  These measures mark a very important step in redressing the position that this Government inherited from the Coalition Government of 1983 to 1987.</P>
    <P>I pay special thanks to both the former Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and to the present Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, for the allocation of funds for the building of a new community school in Gorey at the cost of £5 million and also for a major extension to the Wexford Vocational School in Wexford town. Construction of the Gorey school commenced last month and I expect the extension to the vocational school to commence early this year. Those two problems have been with the Department for the past ten or 15 years and I am again particularly pleased that it was a Fianna Fáil Government which addressed the situation and solved the very serious problems.</P>
    <P>This budget recognises the current problems of the motoring trade and goes some way in improving the situation.  I particularly welcome the reduction in excise duty on cars and its removal from heavy commercial vehicles.  Particularly welcome is the 2p per litre reduction in petrol duty.  On balance, the changes are for the better and should help in creating additional sales and an increase in jobs in the long term.</P>
    <P>Tourism should also benefit from measures introduced in relation to the motor industry, particularly the reduction in petrol duty.  One must welcome the £1 million fund to assist the car hire sector and the retention of VAT at 12.5 per cent on accommodation and meals.  This underpins the Government's drive in <Col N="2179" /> helping the further development of tourism here.  Tourism is one of our major earners and is fast becoming one of the world's major industries.  It is in our interests that these measures be taken and, if possible, improved on in later years to help our competitiveness in what will be a major income earner for the rest of the nineties and into the 21st century. We are competing in a very competitive market, but we must do all in our power to attract an increase in the number of tourists to our country, boosting earnings and enhancing job prospects.</P>
    <P>This budget which the Minister has declared as being realistic and ambitious is that.  The Bill shows social concern with the problems of the people.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of speakers on the Government side, including the Minister, have repeatedly stated that the simple objective of the Finance Bill was to support the fight against unemployment. I fail to see how the provisions in this Bill will have any significant effect on our spiralling unemployment.  We need a more radical approach than that in the Bill if we are to arrest the decline in jobs.</P>
      <P>This Bill removes some of the incentives to employment creation.  I am concerned about the imposition of VAT on commercial, sports and leisure facilities. At a time when we are trying to encourage people to take more exercise and live healthier lives, this is an unfortunate imposition.  Health clubs, golf clubs and outdoor pursuit centres will have to increase their fees to stay in business.  It will also mean further price increases for tourists who come here to play golf and so on.  This is really a tax on health.  The Minister should reconsider it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill makes life assurance less attractive.  The holder of a typical life assurance policy will lose about £250 on average in tax relief as a result of the Minister's action.  What the Minister is giving to the wage earner through tax reduction and widening the standard tax <Col N="2180" /> band he is taking away through increases from 12½ per cent to 16 per cent in VAT on a wide range of goods and services and through the removal of tax relief on life assurance policies and the curtailment of other reliefs.  The Bill could be said to rob Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision in section 17 to reconsider his proposal to abolish the revenue approved share schemes which allowed employees to take shares to the value of £5,000 in their companies on a tax free basis.  The scheme worked exceptionally well in companies like Kerry Group plc., and others.  Over 200 companies, I understand, were involved in this innovative scheme which was introduced by Deputy John Bruton as Leader of Fine Gael. The scheme encourages workers to take a more active interest in the welfare of their companies and it gives them a greater incentive to work harder.  That is in line with the policy purused in the USA, Japan and in most industrial countries.  I am disappointed that the Minister reduced the ceiling to £2,000 and I appeal to him to restore it to £5,000 on Committee Stage, or to at least reconsider it when framing next year's budget.</P>
    <P>I am glad, too, that the Minister had modified his original proposal on taxing co-operatives.  The co-operatives are major contributors to rural Ireland and employ about 15,000 people.  The Minister's original proposal would have put huge pressure on the small co-operatives. However, he should look at this section again as co-operatives will be taxed at the full 40 per cent corporation tax rate by 1994.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has modified his proposal to charge liquer licence fees on rateable valuation.  No doubt the wave of opposition from publicans throughout the country influenced the Minister to change his mind.  The proposal framed in the budget was unfair and inequitable and took no account of the varying conditions in the licensed trade.  Many publicans are experiencing severe financial difficulties because of the fall off in their business over the last number of years. Publicans have hidden expenses &mdash; rates, <Col N="2181" /> water and refuse charges, heating, lighting, insurance, sponsorship, glass breakages and so on.  When it comes to any charitable cause in any village or town, the publican has to give support, mostly in financial terms.  Several small publicans are doing very little business and they are in danger of going out of business because of all the charges they have to pay, the doubling of the licence fee, etc. We talk about the threat to small farmers but I would remind the Minister of the threat to publicans and the small businessman.</P>
    <P>The Minister's modified proposal will still mean that the minimum licence fee for publicans will be £200 compared with Northern Ireland where it is £75 and England where it is £12.50.  Although the Minister has made a major concession, he should have another look at the licence fee and take into account the fact that a 100 per cent increase in the fee will impose a major burden on many small businesses throughout the country.  At the moment a number of licence holders with a low turnover are contemplating closing down. Most of these people are living in small towns and villages in rural Ireland and are providing an important social service because the public have no other social centre to go to.  People go to the pub to meet each other because there are no recreational centres in many towns and villages.</P>
    <P>This proposal was an attack on the publican with a small income.  It was an effort to put these people out of business. The Minister should review the increase again before he makes a final decision. This certainly should be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not include a provision in this Bill to allow tax relief for families who do not qualify for higher education grants.  The rising costs of maintaining students at universities and other colleges cause many parents severe financial hardship; in particular, the burden on middle income families maintaining students away from home has become intolerable.  Parents who are not entitled to fees subvention or maintenance grants are subject to great <Col N="2182" /> financial pressure, in many cases having to forego their life savings or they resort to second mortgages or loans to maintain their children at college.  The financial burden is particularly difficult when students are required to live away from home in order to pursue their third level studies.  The total cost to parents over the four years of a normal university course is in the region of £18,000, an alarming figure since these costs must be met from their income after payment of income tax, mortgage repayments, life assurance premia, VHI contributions, service charges and all the other costs involved in rearing and maintaining a family.</P>
    <P>The increase in the rates of VAT on household goods and services from 12.5 per cent to 16 per cent will add further to overall housekeeping costs, subjecting parents to further financial pressure, particularly those who must pay for their children's higher education.  The time has come to allow parents offset at least course fees against their tax liability at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to effect certain changes which will reduce the impact of the benefit-in-kind reductions announced in his budget.  This is a welcome change since they will reduce its impact on employees, such as company representatives and commercial travellers who incur very high mileage travelling throughout the country in pursuit of their businesses.  However, the Minister should re-examine this section, otherwise, sales representatives will be forced to reconsider the value of a company car as opposed to receiving generous mileage allowances from their employers similar to the tax-free mileage allowances of public servants.</P>
    <P>There is very little about which to enthuse in this Bill.  There is no obvious incentive to investment or job creation. I am convinced that its provisions will do little to stem the spiralling growth in unemployment, the scourge of urban and rural areas.  When contributing to the Finance Bill last year I predicted that our unemployment figure would exceed 250,000 by the end of 1991; it exceeded that figure.  Unfortunately I predict <Col N="2183" /> today, with some degree of confidence, that we shall face an unemployment rate of 300,000 people by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that our macro economy appears stable, something which is to be welcomed and in respect of which I must give the Government credit over the past five years, nonetheless their fiscal plicy is not creating the necessary climate for job creation for our large labour force which warrants greater, more radical changes than those proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, who has been involved in the Department of Labour, who has a great deal of insight into job creation, to examine more radical proposals to ensure greater incentives to both employers and employees. Because of the gap between social welfare payments and the standard income of low wage earners, it is no longer profitable to work in this State, particularly when one considers that low wage earners lose their medical cards when in receipt of earnings.  It will readily be appreciated that these people are being victimised and discriminated against.</P>
    <P>It would appear that budgets are being framed with an eye to larger economic forces rather than on what would really benefit the ordinary wage earner.  It would also appear that focus is concentrated on the top level of our economy rather than on the medium or lower level. There should be scope within the overall financial regime to create the type of climate desired and about which we all speak.  I heard a number of speakers from all sides of the House refer to the creation of the proper climate.  If we continue these traditional approaches to budgets and Finance Bills, I cannot foresee the requisite radical proposals being introduced to impact on our major unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>While I have acknowledged some provisions in this Bill as being welcome, they do not go far enough to effect the radical changes needed or the necessary climate within which to stem the growth of unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to follow <Col N="2184" /> Deputy Deenihan on an occasion when he has not pilloried me as having overall responsibility for the national debt.  I had been hoping he would have done so and then I would have set the record straight on one or two matters.  However there will be another day for that.</P>
      <P>As a number of Members have said, this is a singularly complex Finance Bill giving legislative effect to one of the most comprehensive Budget Statements ever made in this House.  It illustrates a number of things.  First, it illustrates that the Minister for Finance, while attempting to fulfil many frequently competing objectives in his budget and in this Finance Bill, has a quality not often attributed to Finance Ministers, that is, the ability to listen.  A number of Members on all sides of the House have been generous in accepting that the Minister has listened to lobbying from all sides of the House, has listened to our representations and has, dare I say it, improved this Bill as a result.  The Minister's openness and attentiveness to the advice of Members from all sides of the House is shown in the very welcome changes proposed, for example, in the deposit interest retention tax regime, in the amendments to the employee share ownership scheme &mdash; very important changes which Members from all sides sought and got; in the changes in the calculation of benefits-in-kind and in the method of calculating the renewal cost of licences for publichouses and hotels.</P>
      <P>This Bill has rightly been described by at least one financial commentator as being the mother and father of all Finance Bills; weighing in as it does, at a hefty 246 pages, with 232 sections, not to mention its explanatory memorandum which weighs in at a further hefty 60 pages of, at times, less than sparkling prose.  The sheer size of the Bill, the virtual impossibility of any one Member, or even tax specialist, being capable of grasping the full range of the impact of its provisions, leads me once again to question our overall approach to the manner in which this House exercises a very important constitutional role as guardian of the public purse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2185" /> I believe that the nation's tax affairs and the level of Government expenditure have reached a height and the point at which public administration is so complex that the traditional budgetary approach is no longer applicable or appropriate.  I very much doubt if any Member, with the possible, even the evident exception, of the Minister, has absorbed the full impact of this Bill and all its provisions intend to achieve.</P>
    <P>I listened very carefully to the contributions of Finance spokespersons from the main Opposition parties.  It was evident, to put it at its most charitable, they were struggling to make comprehensive, valuable, if occasionally, politically critical contributions to this debate.  Whatever about marks for method-acting, even the most loyal and myopic supporters of the leading spokespersons would find it difficult to persuade an impartial observer that their spokespersons had any real impact on this legislative behemoth.  I say that not in a sense of criticism but rather in a sense of appreciating just how difficult a task the spokespersons of the two main Opposition parties faced endeavouring to address this extraordinary leviathan in the House.</P>
    <P>As always the pirouetting of Deputy Michael Noonan of Fine Gael was enjoyable but, dare I say it, he is still a little heavy of foot to make it to the front benches of the Kirov.  Deputy Quinn of the Labour Party was censorious with sufficient <i>gravitas</i> to be almost convincing. The simple truth is that they and all of the other contributors who spoke after the Minister are little more than bit players in an obscure drama which we all know will march on gobbling up Dáil time to the point where we can say that the Bill has been sufficiently chewed over to be passed into law.  Of course, the reality is that the Bill which is ultimately passed into law after many worthy hours of effort will be overwhelmingly the same Bill introduced by the Minister.  If we are honest with ourselves, we know that the vast majority of nuances, details and clauses in the Bill will not be touched on on the Second or subsequent Stages.  The <Col N="2186" /> only comprehensive changes made will be introduced by the Minister, some of which, like the new car registration tax, he has already highlighted and others which he probably has in mind in any event.</P>
    <P>The failure of the House to make any really serious or major impact on this Bill is not attributable to Members but rather to the system we operate here.  I wonder whether the whole budget process makes sense any longer in a world where virtually all public expenditure programmes are multi-annual and the Estimates are now being cast on a multi-annual basis. Does it really make sense in this circumstance to continue to operate on the Victorian principle of the annual budget? I wish to briefly consider that principle and the related principles on taxation which effectively are the core of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that the budget format which we inherited from the British was created at a time when parliament was in its infancy; the constitutional democracy experiment was only a few years old when budgets in their modern format began to be formulated. The idea of contributing the supply of funds on an annual basis was derived from the Victorian notion that this would force the Government &mdash; the Cabinet, which was a new concept at that time &mdash; to come before the House at least once a year to give an account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>The motivation for re-enacting the tax provisions each year are even more obscure, lying in the myth that income tax was introduced as a once-off, short term measure to tide the State over financial problems when dealing with Mr. Bonaparte.  Whatever validity those notions had when the Victorians put in place the type of regime we still dance around with, they have no validity today.</P>
    <P>Clearly it is time to consider replacing the traditional budget with a statement covering the financial and economic state of the nation.  Obviously we should be considering the formulation of what exists in reality, producing and enacting multi-annual programme budgets for individual areas of Government.  The <Col N="2187" /> Estimates cycle which we go through here is high farce.  Formally adopting the programmes in the Dáil when the costs and objectives can be established in public policy and then leaving the ongoing monitoring of programmes to Ministers and their Departments in the first instance while delegating parliamentary committees focused on specific areas of public administration to carry out day-to-day political supervision of how the policies are performing, is the only realistic way of achieving the constitutional responsibility of being the controller of the public purse.  That would deal with one side of the financial cycle, the expenditure side.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the &ldquo;black arts&rdquo; of the budget process, the taxation provisions &mdash; provisions which are only understood in the most hidden recesses of the Department of Finance.  The taxation provision of the budget and the Finance Bill cannot be handled by a Parliament in plenary session in the way we are attempting to handle this Bill.  It is not possible for a Parliament in plenary session to deal with a Bill of this magnitude, with all of its complexities &mdash; even if it were half the size I would make the same contention &mdash; in any comprehensive way. Clearly we need to establish a standing House committee on finance and taxation and to leave to that committee the responsibility for vetting the detail of taxation and reporting back to the Dáil in plenary session.  Such a committee could clearly process the work of this House more expeditiously and efficiently than a House in plenary session can do.  It would allow Members with the expertise and inclination to make a greater input into taxation policy.</P>
    <P>By removing the political debate from the crucible of the Dáil Chamber where frequently contributions have more to do with political posturing than with policy compromises taxation changes could more easily be achieved.  Ministers could listen in more detail to the statements which come from all sides of the House and Members of the Opposition could have a role to play in building a truly <Col N="2188" /> effective taxation system.  Thus the impact of the democratically elected representatives of the people could be enhanced, re-establishing the democratic linkage between taxation and representation. Above all else, this is what the current system fails to achieve.  The reality is that by going through this mythical process here year after year we have dis-established the link between taxation and representation which runs to the very core and essence of the democratic process.  Clearly the time has long since come to effect root and branch reform of the budgetary process.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to specific areas of the Bill.  I commend the Minister on the Bill and welcome a number of changes he has introduced.  The change proposed by the Minister in regard to the DIRT is both welcome and sensible.  It has been publicly recognised by financial commentators that this measure will have a major impact on the savings market and will attract back funds which are currently illegally held abroad.  This carrot, applied in conjunction with the stick of better control and reporting, will mean more funds in savings in this country. This will inevitably mean more funds for investment, which, in turn, will mean more investment for jobs, and of course, that is the aspiration of Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his modification of the taxation of employees share ownership schemes.  The Bill proposes to modify the stance taken in the budget by curtailing rather than abolishing the relief.  This is very welcome.  I lobbied the Minister in this regard and he has adopted a very sensible approach to the issue in the Bill.  I recognise that the spokespersons from the other parties have accepted the legitimacy of the Minister's concern that this tax incentive should not become a loophole for tax abuse.  I think we all recognise that the Minister has made an honest effort to square the circle, so to speak, and achieve what we all want to achieve, that is, the closing off of loopholes which are abused while at the same time holding in place valuable incentives.  The employee share <Col N="2189" /> ownership scheme which, as Deputy Deenihan said, was introduced by Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Finance, is a very good scheme as it gives workers a very real sense of ownership and involvement in the firms for which they work.  However, this scheme is evidently being abused.</P>
    <P>On the question of practical patriotism, I listened recently to extensive coverage on RTE by a leading member of the Irish business community who lectured the Government on how they might better improve their transportation networking and transportation hub out of Shannon.  He made very sensible and worthwhile suggestions.  However, I thought it was a pity that it was not accompanied by practical patriotism &mdash; a willingness to stay in this country and contribute to the economy through the taxation system.  As I have said, the Minister's approach on the employee share ownership scheme is very sensible, logical and welcome.</P>
    <P>Another issue on which I and many others, including my colleague from County Wicklow, Deputy Jacob, have lobbied the Minister is the question of duty on licensed premises.  Apart from the detrimental impact which the dramatic increase in licence fee renewals was likely to have on the profitability of small family operators and therefore on employment, the move to a valuation base was a departure from the principle of taxation on income.  Smith's tenets of what constitutes a just taxation scheme was that of tax on income because it was progressive and it recognised the ability to pay.  Tax on a valuation is not related in any sense to ability to pay.  By changing the basis of calculation to turnover the Minister has moved back closer to the principle of assessment of tax on income and therefore on ability to pay, an equitable and progressive principle on which I compliment him.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister said in his speech that if there is a disappointing yield under this heading he will further review the matter.  However, I suggest that he should not move in the direction of a valuation.  If there are problems with <Col N="2190" /> assessment of income in the licensed trade they are likely to be on the control side, the accounting side and the reporting side and they can be resolved by appropriate mechanisms at the revenue collection stage rather than by changes in the principle of taxation.</P>
    <P>Having praised the Minister I want to prod him a little also.  The Bill introduces additional powers for the Revenue Commissioners. I have no gripe with this element of the Bill.  I wholeheartedly commend the Minister for further extensions of power in this regard.  Tax avoidance, evasion and dodging are still endemic in society.  We have to inculcate into all Irish people the view that taxes are the price we pay for living in a just and democratic society.  There is too much of a nudge and a wink attitude towards taxation.  We still have the attitude that we are willing to tolerate tax avoidance and evasion, which is little more than putting hands into each other's pockets and removing each other's funds.</P>
    <P>Taxes are our individual and collective contribution to running a civilised society and supporting those less fortunate than ourselves.  However, I am concerned &mdash; I hope that the Minister and his officials will note this concern &mdash; about the impact of some recent measures.  I have already outlined my concern to the Minister about the impact of the requirement to produce RSI numbers on the home help service, particularly in north County Wicklow but also, I understand, throughout the Eastern Health Board area.  I have urged the Minister to make some changes in this regard.  The payment to home help workers is little more than pocket money.  It barely covers the cost of travelling to the site of the person requiring help.  The State derives a phenomenal benefit from the unselfish contribution made to society by home help workers.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, is a compassionate man and I know from my conversations with him that he recognises the contribution of these people.  What I ask now is that the officials in his Department and in the Revenue Commissioners turn their collective <Col N="2191" /> minds to resolving the problem, which should not be difficult.  By giving groups of home help workers an individual PRSI number to cover the entire group it would assuage the fears that have led home help workers to remove themselves from the service to the detriment of the service and of this caring community who in recent times have helped people who need assistance.  I have urged these changes on the Minister for his consideration and I anticipate that he will respond positively.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the impact of circular F49/13/87 on various activities within public administration.  This Finance circular dealing with tax avoidance causes unnecessary red tape in a number of areas.  I know of a case where its implementation is delaying Wicklow County Council from processing a disabled person's grant.  I have a letter from Wicklow County Council referring to my personal representations in this regard. It states that in the case of two elderly people who have applied for disabled person's grant they must obtain tax reference numbers and due clearance from the Dublin Tax District No. 1 office, that this information is required under the aforementioned circular of the Department of Finance and should be forwarded before the application for grant assistance can be considered.  I can understand and I approve the principle of what the Department of Finance are trying to achieve.  They are trying to ensure that at least those who are paid from the public purse do not avoid their tax responsibilities. However, red tape can result from the application of a good principle and we should certainly ensure that that does not happen in this case.</P>
    <P>Another serious concern which I have brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment is the negative impact of strict adherence to the Finance circular on self-building operations under the new shared ownership scheme.  It is becoming impossible to exploit the creativity in the new social housing programme because of the level of bureaucracy which is in <Col N="2192" /> place.  I have a case in mind where a young couple and their builder, who has a scrupulous tax record, cannot progress because the builder has been told at the 11th hour, just as he was about to put in the foundations, that he must produce a C2 certificate.  Some application of common sense at a bureaucratic level is all that is required to resolve this case, which is now entering its twelfth month of delays.</P>
    <P>The irony in this case is that the builder in question has an exemplary record of tax payment but because of the strict adherence to the circular within the context of the new shared ownership scheme it is impossible for the officials in the county council to tell him to go ahead with the building without deducting tax at the emergency rate.  That is not what the Minister, the Government, the Department or the Revenue Commissioners sought to achieve when they put in place administrative controls.  I urge that a degree of ingenuity be used to free these controls to ensure that they do not have an undesired impact on small people legitimately going about their business but that they are addressed more precisely to tax dodgers.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider section 24 of the Bill which deals with restrictions on capital allowances on holiday cottages.  This will have the same impact this year, if it is implemented as it was introduced, as the change in the BES would have had last year had the Minister not adjusted arrangements to allow a degree of phasing in.  A holiday cottage project in my constituency which is under way at present is endangered by this change.  I will read into the record a couple of points relating to this project. It is being built in an extremely sensitive area and, therefore, the planning process took many months.  The local council, Bord Fáilte and the community at large were involved in helping to establish parameters which would be acceptable for the project.  Much consultation took place and in July of last year the application was given the go ahead.  The project includes the building of 20 holiday cottages, with 50 rooms for holiday <Col N="2193" /> accommodation.  The total cost of the project is £3.65 million, the holiday cottages costing over £2 million.  Because of the complexities in planning it has taken a while before expenditure can be incurred, although some expenditure has been incurred.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill as currently drafted provides that tax incentives for schemes such as the holiday cottage scheme are withdrawn with effect from 24 April.  The consequences, unless the Bill is changed, are that this project will no longer be viable and cannot proceed. Construction will cease.  Already 15 construction workers are on site and at the height of the construction phase there is potential for almost 100 workers.  The long term job prospects on this site are 15 jobs.  As my colleague, Deputy Jacob, will attest 15 jobs in any part of County Wicklow is something we will fight for. More than £1 million has been invested in the scheme and it is neither right, fair or proper that the scheme should be cut short in this manner.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the scheme wrote to me yesterday and said:</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be grossly unfair and contrary to natural justice that a scheme which is promoted in response to the tax incentive proposed by our Government should be forced to be terminated mid-way through its construction phase by the withdrawal of those very same tax incentives without any previous notice.  No intimation was given by the Minister for Finance in the budget and no intimation was given in any official communication about this change.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review section 24 and do as was done last year when we encountered similar difficulties with the BES.  I remember my colleagues and I in County Wicklow were particularly upset about this and we asked the then Minister for a phased element in the BES and the Minister responded to our request.  I am confident the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, will return to this and help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2194" /> I ask the Minister to look again at section 28 and, more precisely, at the final extension of the tax advantages of the urban renewal scheme until 31 May 1994.  Through no fault of either local authorities or site owners progress on some schemes has been delayed inordinately by the application of the planning process.  In one project in Bray, which is just behind my house the enthusiasm of a site owner for development of a scheme covered by urban renewal, a marginal scheme but on a highly important site, has been blunted by the lengthy planning process and by the downturn in the market during that process.  If this site continues to lie in its present state of semi-dereliction, nobody will gain.  Moreover, jobs which could come with the development, will be lost forever.  Let me suggest to the Minister that the Minister for the Environment and he should give this matter some further consideration. Where the planning process has clearly delayed a project or prevented its implementation, either an extension should be negotiated at local level which will take into account local considerations or else, where the project is permanently stymied, the local authority and the Department of the Environment should be permitted to identify any alternative site in the locality on which urban renewal status could be bestowed for a specific and finite period.  When the Government designated individual sites for urban renewal, they did so because (a) the sites in question clearly fulfilled specific criteria; (b) they wished to create jobs, particularly in the construction industry and (c) they wanted to get economic activity going again in areas of blight hoping at the same time to enhance the environment.</P>
    <P>In towns such as Bray, relatively small areas were designated for urban renewal. The urban renewal status was welcomed and good work has been done under the urban renewal scheme.  For example, the town hall scheme in Bray is a model.  This remarkable building which had fallen into disrepair has, effectively, been rebuilt in an arrangement with private <Col N="2195" /> interests for the joint development of the site.  That is very positive.  It has created jobs and at the same time enhanced the local environment.  It has produced a civic focal point in the town.  There have been other developments under the urban renewal scheme in the town but the major site earmarked for development by the Government was stymied by the planning process.  Given the current state of the market, even with the extension of the scheme to May 1994, it will be very difficult to put an economically viable package together to produce worthwhile high quality development on the most sensitive of the urban renewal sites.  I suggest renegotiation to extend the period after getting specific commitments from the builders and developers.  I do not accept that site owners should be given an open-ended right to an extended scheme, but it should be put to them that if the site is developed by a certain date the tax breaks will apply in full.  If this cannot be done areas which were unsuccessful when they applied for urban renewal status should be re-examined and the benefits of the scheme should apply to an equal acreage for a finite period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes the Minister has made and I am confident that the Minister &mdash; who has shown enormous ability to grasp the detail of this Bill &mdash; will listen to the suggestions I made.  Perhaps it would be too much to hope that he would respond to everything I said. However, a number of speakers and I have made the same point on areas designated for urban renewal and the difficulties that affect small businesses on the tax side, for example section 24.  I am confident the Minister will attend to those issues when he replies to Second Stage debate and deal with them in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a fine Bill.  It is extraordinarily difficult for an individual to come to grips with its intricacies but it goes a long way to achieving what the Government set out to do in 1987, to reform the tax system.  Members were critical about the removal of certain tax concessions but the only way to produce tax equity and a <Col N="2196" /> bearable rate of tax, particularly on the PAYE sector, is to remove some of the more exotic schemes which give tax concessions to minorities.  Any scheme which gives a tax concession on analysis should be capable of showing that the benefits to society are greater than the cost to the tax system.  Ultimately, the only way to have a just system of tax is to return to the old principles of tax on income, related to the ability to pay and with very few special arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in commending this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill but, like other Members, I consider it outrageous that so little time is available to Members to discuss it.  The Finance Bill runs to 246 pages and consists of 232 sections.  One must ask what is happening when it takes so much legislation to run a small country with a population of about three million and decreasing.  In 1926 we had more than five million people but in my constituency people are leaving in their hundreds. Why?  There is so much red tape and bureaucracy that people will not take it anymore.  Everybody is under suspicion. Every corner of the country is being raked for tax and initiative is being stymied.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche &mdash; I welcome his contribution &mdash; spoke about the carer's allowance for people who are anxious to look after the elderly but now they are being asked to fill in PRSI forms.  This is charitable work.  The PRSI scheme for part-time employees was designed to attack large multiples that were exploiting young people but we did not help small business that take on people legitimately to work for an hour or two a day for a small amount of money to help with household expenses.  They must fill up a form for everything now.  Many young couples refuse to apply for the £2,000 new house grant as they feel it is not worth the effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No initiative is given to people to come together to help themselves.  Time and again I come across a young couple who are building a bungalow and hope to get <Col N="2197" /> a grant, yet their friends who can do brick work and carpentry work cannot come together and help them because they must fill out a form which must comply with various regulations.  For heaven's sake give a little backbone to those who administer the schemes and allow them to use their common sense.  The lowest ranking official is afraid of the highest ranking official who in turn is afraid he will lose his job.  He turns his back on common sense and says: &ldquo;No, that `i' is not dotted, that `t' is not crossed&rdquo; and it must go back down the line again.  That is why, as a nation, we are coming to a standstill.</P>
    <P>I welcome parts of this Bill.  I have not come in here to say there are not some good sections in the Bill.  I welcome sections 128 to 130 which deal with the reduction of excise duty on televisions, videos and petrol.  As long as I am in this House I will fight the issue of the Border region and the north west, the disadvantaged area, because we have a particular problem.  Since I came into this House in 1987 I have highlighted the one way traffic system to Northern Ireland because of the serious disadvantage in relation to petrol prices.  Because of people travelling north of the Border to buy their petrol with household shopping there was a major loss of income to local traders and revenue to the State.  I am not against people travelling north or south. Nobody wants to promote it more than I, but I would like to see that it is not all one way traffic.  We welcome people to our county from Northern Ireland and further afield and from the fair city on shopping sprees or whatever.  Likewise I have no objection to people who do it occasionally but when there is a constant flow of people north of the Border then somebody must suffer and we suffered drastically.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill and the budget were introduced by our new Minister for Finance, Deputy B. Ahern, who was heralded as the bright boy in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Coalition Government and the great Minister for Labour who could resolve any dispute in our semi-State bodies and restore peace.  When he <Col N="2198" /> moved into the Finance portfolio we thought he would sort out all the unholy mess in the Department of Finance. Officials in the Department of Finance who got tangled up in their red tape cried blue murder when they were called to task.  I am not blaming them; I am sure they are doing their best.  I suppose the Minister has to take the blame at the end of the day because it is he who comes before the people.  One wonders how much thought was put into the budget in the first place in view of the fact that so many U-turns had to be taken before the Finance Bill was produced.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Daly, who is in the House at present &mdash; and I do not wish to revert to sad memories &mdash; that the pub licence is not unlike the rod licence.  We will not open that chapter again.  The pub licence was as ill thought out as the rod licence at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly.  This Finance Bill is anti-rural Ireland and anti-initiative. I have spelt out how I see it as being anti-initiative so far as young people coming together to help each other are concerned.  A new section in the Bill deals with the royalties from patents, which will now be taxed.  That section should be spelt out clearly to ordinary people. When a person works on an idea, develops it and patents it, he is entitled to royalties.  He has spent many hours, days and weeks developing the idea; but now, lo and behold, the Government have said they will tax that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I noticed a machine on the Dublin road putting in cats' eyes in the centre of the road.  That was a marvellous idea developed by a Swede 50 or 60 years ago.  I read recently that he died a millionaire.  How many lives did that man save by that simple idea &mdash; simple when we see it in operation, but which took so much thought.  He was entitled to every penny of royalty he received.  I understand an old penny was one item plunged into the centre of the road. <Col N="2199" /> Initiatives must be encouraged if we are to develop new ideas, patent them and manufacture them in this country. Instead the Government have decided to stem that initiative and will not allow it, just as people will not be allowed to come together to help themselves.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is anti-rural on three points: the new licensing arrangements for pubs, the co-op tax and the car tax.  I should like to deal first with the tax on co-operatives. Originally the idea was that there would be a 40 per cent tax on non-manufacturing co-operatives.  We have a system in my county of Cavan of small co-operatives who collect milk and deliver it in bulk to a processor.  Because of the geographical position of the county it is difficult for farmers to travel to a central unit where processing takes place.  This is an excellent system using small lorries to save our roads &mdash; small tractors had been used in earlier days.  Those co-operatives have now been hit by the Minister for Finance with a tax of 40 per cent. There was consternation in my county and in rural Ireland at this move.  This is a tax on the co-operative movement set up by people who have come together to protect their livelihoods.  It is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the co-operative movement on their well thought out campaign which they brought to the Chamber of this Dáil and the Minister backed off. What has he done instead?  Instead of a sudden death of the 40 per cent in 1992 he has decided on a slow death, one-third this year, two-thirds next year and the full tax in 1994.  I am asking the Minister to back off before he does untold harm. These co-operatives are a necessary part of the farming structure in counties Cavan and Monaghan and in rural Ireland generally.  Farmers are experiencing sufficient difficulty at present because of falling milk prices.  Milk quotas are leaving my county as a result of the buy up scheme introduced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in whom I had faith while he was a Minister of State.  I am beginning to think differently about him now that he has become a Minister and I wonder whether he will <Col N="2200" /> be as good a Minister as I had expected and a good bargainer for farmers.</P>
    <P>We have no apology to make to anybody in Europe or elsewhere for producing quality food.  We can produce the best quality food in Europe.  There is a market for quality food and I have said that continuously both before and since I came into this House.  The system of producing quality food is the system we have in Ireland.  The tax which the Minister intends to introduce gradually will strangle the agricultural community and I would ask him to back off.  On top of the 40 per cent tax we have a 10 per cent tax on the manufacturing companies who are buying up the small co-operatives, thus resulting in a 50 per cent tax rate.  If they sell into Bord Bainne there will be a further 10 per cent tax, amounting to a 60 per cent tax on the gallon of milk collected at the farmer's door.  That is outrageous.  It is not applicable to any other section of the community and it is not on.  I am asking the people and the farmers of rural Ireland to continue the campaign they started until the Minister opens his eyes and sees the folly of what he is doing.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Cavan-Monaghan committee is one of the groups approved under the Leader Programme this year.  This programme is designed to encourage groups to come together to provide alternative enterprises in rural Ireland.  It is not based only on farming enterprises.  People in villages and towns can also get involved. However, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance are taking away the very business we know so much about, the production of milk and quality food products.  It does not make sense.  One wonders how, when these people become Ministers, they become so far removed from reality.  Milk production is vitally important in my region.  It is the only activity from which the hilly drumlin soil will give a reasonable income.  Sometimes our people are involved in beef production and store cattle but milk production is the main occupation.</P>
    <P>Under the buy-up scheme announced <Col N="2201" /> by the Minister, the milk is moving to the south of Ireland.  I defy anybody in this House to say that is not true.  A large volume of milk was offered; why was it offered in my region if there is such a clamour?  Farmers who have reached a certain age or who have decided to get out of milk production have quotas of 5,000 gallons and 10,000.  However, there are young men anxious to take up those quotas.  The co-operatives will help to get those young farmers operating a reasonable sized quota of 30,000 to 40,000 gallons, the type of quota needed to derive a livelihood.  It is those small co-operatives that the Minister is slowly strangling.  I am asking him to back off.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody in the urban and greater city areas might think that the people in the country do not want to pay tax, the trading elements of those co-operatives pay 10 per cent tax, as does every other trading store in this country.  They supply fertilisers, feedstuffs, hardware, etc. They also give credit facilities to farmers to take them over the lean periods. People think that because of our entry into Europe milk can be produced 12 months of the year.  That may be possible in the south and south-east but where I come from, it is a seasonal business &mdash; generally from March to November.  The winter period is difficult but some farms are producing winter milk.  However, they can make a living from small quotas combined with other enterprises which the Leader Programme is bringing in I welcome that.  However, there is no point in introducing initiatives on one side and taking away a farmer's livelihood on the other.  I have stressed that point because it is important.</P>
    <P>In regard to the licensing of pubs, are the people of rural Ireland not as entitled to enjoy themselves as the people in the towns and cities?  Small rural pubs are family run businesses where a husband and wife can go to enjoy a drink after a hard week's work.  These pubs will be closed down because a pub with a turnover below £150,000 will have to pay £2,000 under the present licensing system.  When would a small rural pub have a turnover of £150,000?  Many of <Col N="2202" /> those pubs have a turnover of only £5,000 a year.  Coupled with that there might be a grocery business or a small hardware, one complementing the other, and providing a service for local people.</P>
    <P>Tourists enjoy the peace and tranquility of these pubs and provide a little extra business.  I believe the threshold should be £100,000, or maybe £50,000 and if it is below that, the licence should be a nominal fee of £10.  There is a huge difference between a turnover of £10,000 and £150,000.  I have no figures but everybody is aware that the turnover of these small pubs is minimal.  However, it is sufficient and the pub is a place for people to meet and have a little refreshment.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point about the present blitz against drink driving.  I am totally opposed to drink driving but, like everything else in this State, when we get an idea, we hammer it until we take the good out of it.  I have no objection &mdash; and I do not see how anybody could &mdash; to a husband and wife, a bachelor, spinster, young fellow and his girlfriend, going into their local pub to have one or two drinks. However, they cannot get to that pub without a car.  Again we are becoming urban orientated.  It is easy in large towns and cities to get a taxi or, if the pub is only up the road you can walk, but in rural Ireland you must drive.  Because of the present campaign on drink driving many honest, decent people who would not break the law are afraid to travel to their local pub for the little enjoyment they have had over the years; and that is wrong.  Again it comes back to the application of commonsense.</P>
    <P>An important factor in the loss of life through road traffic accidents is speed.  It is not all young people who are driving fast.  I come to Dublin three mornings a week, travelling at 60 or 65 miles an hour, and people are passing me at 70 and 80 miles per hour, and they are not all young people.  It is speed that the Garda should be watching out for, along with the erratic drunk driver.  The person driving carefully to his country pub and minding his own business should be left alone.  Unfortunately that is not happening, and again this shows the lack of discretion and <Col N="2203" /> application of common sense.  This has affected life in rural Ireland and it has affected the pub scene.  I am asking the Minister to leave people who are going about their business alone and not to turn the country into a police state.  It is wrong and will have an adverse effect.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of the Maastricht Treaty and the Taoiseach's outrageous outburst threatening people if they did not vote in a certain way.  That attitude is wrong.  The same can be said about the application of law in relation to people having a social drink.  The position should be clarified.  There is talk about lowering limits.  I think they are satisfactory.  I have the highest regard for the Garda who are doing an excellent job.  However, we have to acknowledge there are many road traffic deaths and all are not attributable to drink, but to other factors that should also be looked at.</P>
    <P>Car tax has been increased by 20 per cent.  Have we a 20 per cent increase in the road fund?  Has there been a 20 per cent increase in the quality of our roads? We have not.  A car is a necessity in rural Ireland; young people cannot get to their jobs without a car, elderly people cannot get to towns and villages to do their shopping. A car is a must.  In the larger cities and towns there is a bus service but there is practically no public service in rural Ireland, and yet there is an increase of 20 per cent on car tax without a corresponding increase in the road fund to provide proper roads for people who are paying an exhorbitant tax on cars, commercial vehicles and tractors.  We have gone over the top without making the necessary improvements in our road structure to ensure that people can travel safely and get some enjoyment when they take their cars on the road.  Under the present system the grants from the European Community &mdash; the Structural Funds &mdash; the IFI and the national Exchequer are combined and then redistributed.  I would prefer to see the funding from the Exchequer and the European Community allocated under separate headings to the local authorities so that they <Col N="2204" /> could see exactly where the money is coming from.</P>

      <P>for the <b>Minister for Labour:</b> The job training scheme involving training on employers premises is a major new departure in our training arrangements.  I indicated at the launch on 2 March 1992 of the scheme that the provision of quality training involving the preparation of training plans, structures and supervision would not be simple.</P>
      <P>Since then, detailed manuals have been prepared for the guidance of FÁS and CERT staff and for employers themselves. I am happy to advise the Deputy that this development phase is now being finalised and FÁS and CERT are in a position to meet employers interested in participating in the scheme with a view to recruiting trainees.  I anticipate that the first trainees will be recruited by the middle of May.</P>

      <P>While the Minister <Col N="2205" /> may describe it as a major new departure how significant will this scheme be in relation to job creation?  Can he indicate the number of jobs the Department estimate will be created under this training scheme and how is he going to ensure that it will not amount to another handout? Would he also explain the reason for the delay in implementing this scheme which was launched some time ago?  Was it not remiss of the Minister for Labour to launch the scheme before approval was granted in Brussels and the scheme was fully thought out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's latter point, given that the scheme was only launched on 2 March, I reject the idea that there has been any undue delay.  Second, as I mentioned in the reply, I wish to emphasise that it is a new departure and, consequently, there will be some teething problems, but we will be able to recoup 75 per cent of the cost from Brussels.  We think it will be a very successful scheme under which training on the job will be provided with backing from Europe.  I do not think it is possible to estimate how many people will get new jobs or to assess the impact it will have until the scheme is launched.  The Department of Labour are hopeful that it will have a significant impact.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister assure me that this scheme will not merely replace other FÁS schemes, that it will be an additional scheme to help people find new jobs?  Surely, the Department of Labour have assessed its potential to create jobs.  Why would one invest so much money in a scheme if it was not going to create long term jobs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>The fact is that it is a new departure in the sense that FÁS provide training off the job, but under this scheme training will be provided on the job.  It is so attractive that the Department of Labour are of the opinion that it must be successful in the creation of jobs. <Col N="2206" /> The conditions are right to bring about an increase in jobs.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Labour</askee>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have indicated in response to the NESC <i>Report on Women's Participation in the Irish Labour Market</i> that they will develop specific policies and mechanisms to improve child care for working parents. This report identifies three central policy issues relating to female labour force participation &mdash; taxation, social welfare and child care services.  The NESC consider that there are strong arguments in favour of a national policy on child care for working parents and suggest that research should be undertaken to identify the priorities to be addressed when formulating such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing a national policy on child care the Government will also take into account such developments as the <i>Report of the Working Party on Child Care for Working Parents</i> which was set up to devise specific recommendations for the development of child care partnerships between parents, local employers and community groups &mdash; this group are due to complete their report by the end of May; the deliberations of the task force on employment which is to examine and make recommendations on the employment implications and potential of a national child care system; the Child Care Act, 1991 which provides for regulation and standards; the recent EC child care recommendation enjoins member states to encourage a combination of interests, including the public authorities, the social partners and voluntary bodies, to co-operate in the interests of developing and making widely available good quality, accessible, and affordable child care arrangements; and the report of the <Col N="2207" /> Second Commission on the Status of Women which is expected to be completed this summer.</P>
    <P>In developing a child care policy, the Government will further encourage strategies on the part of training bodies and employers generally to facilitate the participation of married women in the labour force.  Measures to promote labour market flexibility such as flexible working hours, job sharing and career breaks are being encouraged in order to provide a wider range of employment choices for women and men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from the reply that the Government are still talking about the provision of child care facilities and doing nothing about it.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, when Minister for Labour, established the task force on child care services.  Can the Minister assure us, now that Deputy Ahern is Minister for Finance, that he will provide the finance to implement the recommendations of that task force?  It is stated in the EC Social Charter that we should work towards providing equal opportunities in the work-place but in order to do this we must have adequate child care facilities.  May I ask the Minister what the Department of Labour intend to do to meet the aspirations of the EC Social Charter in this regard?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 41, 46, 55 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the social employment scheme in 1992 is projected at £72.9 million compared with £68.943 million in 1991.  Activity on the scheme in 1991 amounted to approximately 11,500 man years while the 1992 level of activity will be in the region of approximately 11,000 man years.</P>
      <P>The scheme will continue in operation. The scheme is no longer eligible for assistance from the European Social Fund and is now fully funded by the Exchequer.  The level of Exchequer funding for each year will be agreed in the context of the annual Estimates process.</P>
      <P>I intend to pursue the question of the reintroduction of European Social Fund assistance for the scheme in the context of the negotiations now under way on the Structural Funds in the period after 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mr. T. Ahearn Mr. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the effect of the cutbacks in the social employment scheme?  The Minister said that it amounted to 10 per cent but in my constituency, of which I have practical experience, the reduction is as high as 30 per cent.  Is the Minister aware of the hardship this is causing to the long term unemployed because it is their only hope of experiencing or getting work?  Any decision by the Government to eliminate the chance of escaping unemployment is a very bad one.  Will the Minister also agree that much of the work in local <Col N="2210" /> communities carried out by people on the social employment scheme was excellent? Will he further agree that any reduction in the social employment scheme will have a very negative effect on local communities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>From personal experience I know that the social employment scheme has worked exceptionally well in local communities.  Good work has been done which has given job satisfaction to the people involved.  However, the Deputy was tilting at windmills when she talked about discontinuation of the scheme because, as I pointed out, the Government have committed £72.9 million to the scheme in 1992.  I emphasise to the House that this is purely and simply Exchequer funding; hitherto, the Exchequer had assistance from the European Social Fund and it is a measure of the Government's commitment that they are providing £72.9 million from the Exchequer this year.  I stated quite clearly in my reply that the scheme will continue in operation.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the severity of the constraints which have been imposed and maintained on current public expenditure, the Government provided an increase of 6.3 per cent for 1992 over the level of the Employment Equality Agency's 1991 allocation.  I am satisfied that the funding is now at a level which will enable the agency to discharge their functions satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The additional funding which has been made available to the Employment Equality Agency this year will enable them to develop the equality focus award scheme, which was instituted in 1990 to stimulate companies to incorporate equal opportunity programmes within their personnel policies.  The Government's support for this kind of promotional activity reflects their acknowledgment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that progress on employment equality is dependent on statutory protection, complemented by positive action programmes at the level of the individual organisation and at national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the funding provision for the Employment Equality Agency, it is relevant to mention that my Department are also responsible for supporting the equality officer service of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour <Col N="2212" /> Court in carrying out their investigative and adjudication functions.  The agency's function as an independent statutory body with advisory and enforcement powers under the equality statutes is complemented by the equality officer service of the Labour Relations Commission and by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>There are few member states of the European Community which have a counterpart to the Employment Equality Agency in terms of their role as an independent, statutory body responsible for discharging a combination of advisory, promotional and enforcement functions.</P>
    <P>I propose to use the opportunity which will be provided to me in advancing proposals for reform of the two employment equality statutes to look closely at the agency's organisation and structure and at their capacity to discharge their promotion and law enforcement roles.  I have been considering the views of the Employment Equality Agency, the ICTU and the FIE in this regard.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that Ireland has a good record among EC member states in terms of the responsiveness of our public policy instruments, and the policy and practice of employer and trade union organisations to the problem of what has become known as sexual harassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2214" /> It is most important to emphasise that legal redress is available, under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, to those who are victims of sexual harassment at work.  Research undertaken by the European Commission in 1987 found that Ireland was at that stage one of only two European Community member states where there is an unequivocal acceptance that proven sexual harassment is unlawful sex discrimination.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency of the European Community, a resolution on the protection of the dignity of women and men at work was adopted by the Social Affairs Council.  As a direct result of the adoption of this resolution, the European Commission undertook the preparation of a recommendation and a code of practice on the subject which were published on 4 December 1991.  The aim of the code is to ensure that sexual harassment does not occur and, if it does occur, that adequate procedures are readily available to deal with the problem and prevent its recurrence.  I am undertaking consultations with both sides of industry and with the Employment Equality Agency and the Labour Relations Commission about the best means of promoting and implementing this code.</P>
    <P>While the guarantee of legal redress for victims of sexual harassment is necessary, I believe it is most important that employers and trade unions, while acknowledging the availability of legal redress to the victims of sexual harassment, should put policies and procedures in place at company level to enable such issues to be handled, where possible in a non-conflictual, non-adversarial manner because of their impact on both the complainant and the alleged harasser.</P>
    <P>I know that this preventive approach is fully endorsed by the Employment Equality Agency and by FIE and ICTU, all of whom have devised material for employers and employees regarding the development of policy and the handling of complaints.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the number of cases where legal redress is sought does not <Col N="2215" /> reflect the magnitude of the problem of sexual harassment at the work-place.  I would also agree that this problem is by no means an isolated phenomenon and that it can have severe effects on the health, confidence, morale and performance of those affected by it.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency are available to offer advice to employers and trade unions in drawing up positive action programmes and advising generally on action that can be taken in individual cases.  The agency are also available to offer advice and assistance to persons in processing a case before an equality officer or the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Employment Equality Agency's 1992 grant, extra resources have been made available to the agency this year having regard to the Government's commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to enable the Employment Equality Agency to encourage companies to pursue equal opportunity initiatives.  I consider preventive procedures relating to sexual harassment as falling within a broad classification of equal opportunity initiatives. I should emphasise that I am particularly pleased, in the light of the current constraints on the public finances, that it has been possible to assist the agency in developing this aspect of their promotional work.</P>
    <P>Proposals to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, are being finalised and will be ready for introduction shortly.  I do not wish at this stage to comment on the detailed provisions of the proposed amendments other than to confirm that consideration has been given to an extensive range of proposals put forward by the Employment Equality Agency, including their proposal in relation to sexual orientation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's reply but I do not consider that it really <Col N="2216" /> deals with the problem.  Would the Minister not accept that there is still a great reluctance on the part of those affected, particularly women, to raise the issue of sexual harassment?  In this regard I think especially of those employed by small, unorganised firms in which the harasser could possibly be the employer himself. In view of that would the Minister not agree that there is an urgent need to strengthen the Employment Equality Act, 1977, to encourage claimants to come forward?</P>

      <P>Finally, I point out that resources must be made available to ensure that education, both in the work-place and in schools, might bring this important issue forward and encourage women to recognise its importance. There are great constraints on time but I ask the Tánaiste and the Minister to give this issue the urgent priority it deserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply indicated that the Department of Labour are anxious that employers' organisations, trade unions and workers themselves should be aware of the facilities available under statute for dealing with this problem. Everybody in public life and in any of those organisations should use every available opportunity to inform people that those statutory provisions have been made for their protection.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's commitment under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review the position of agency workers and the Employment Agency Act, 1971.  Action in relation to the <Col N="2217" /> review of the position of agency workers under labour law has already commenced and preliminary consultations with both sides of industry are taking place.  It is intended that the work will be completed during the currency of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>The main purpose of the 1971 Employment Agency Act was to enable the Department of Labour to control and regulate employment agencies so as to avoid exploitation of the job-seeking public.  The Act also sought to restrict the advertising of vacancies outside the State and to make particular provision for agencies seeking persons under 18 years of age for employment outside the State. The 20 year period since 1971 has seen dramatic changes in technological development, in communication, in transport and in the operation of the labour market.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Department of Labour have undertaken a major review of the legislation affecting employment agencies. Proposals to amend the 1971 Act, the regulations and their administration are being examined with a view to promoting amending legislation as soon as possible.  Consultations with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and relevant professional organisations have taken place and further consultations are planned.</P>

I ask whether something will be done about the position of agency workers during the lifetime of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Would the Tánaiste not agree that it is very unfair that agency workers operate in conditions that offer no protection and that it is women who are generally employed as agency workers?  Would he give an assurance that positive action, in the form of legislation or otherwise, will <Col N="2218" /> be taken to give agency workers the protection enjoyed by other workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 7, 39, 43 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister hopes to get the approval of the Government shortly to enable the drafting of a comprehensive Bill which will replace the Anti-Discrimination <Col N="2219" /> (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Ireland has a good record in relation to implementing our EC equality obligations and the machinery devised under our equality legislation has provided an effective means to obtain legal redress in instances of discrimination in employment.  However, it is necessary to keep pace with EC developments and the changing nature of European Community law.  The proposals to amend the legislation are intended to update and increase the effectiveness of the basic legislative provisions and to ensure that all statute law on employment equality can be found quickly and conveniently in the one Act.</P>
    <P>The average industrial earnings of women are lower than those of men.  A significant imbalance exists between male and female industrial earings, with women earning 68 per cent of the hourly male rate in June 1991.  Deputy O'Sullivan's question was wrong in fact in that regard.  This represents a major problem which requires our attention.</P>
    <P>Some of the reasons for the persistence of sizeable male-female earnings differentials are well known.  Women tend to occupy low profile, low paid jobs, are under-represented at supervisory and managerial level and in the highly technical professions.  The Minister, in association with the Employment Equality Agency, has commissioned the ESRI to undertake a research study to determine more precisely the reasons for these differentials. The aim is to identify those factors which account for the wage gap, such as differences in education and experience and to isolate any residual factors which may be attributable to discrimination. It is hoped that this research will provide direction for future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's plans to upgrade employment equality legislation and make it more effective are important, he attaches equal importance to improving access for women to a wider range of jobs and in creating the environment to make this possible.</P>
    <P>In this regard several steps are being <Col N="2220" /> taken, particularly in the area of improved training and access to employment and positive action.  The Minister is particularly anxious that positive action programmes are implemented in both the public and private sectors.  To motivate employers to take action in this regard additional funding has been allocated to the Employment Equality Agency to undertake the equality focus award scheme in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also monitoring positive action in public sector bodies and many organisations are implementing programmes of positive action based on organisational needs.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency are actively continuing their work in the area of promoting positive action and earlier this month the Minister launched the agency's model equal opportunities policy, which is designed to assist employers and equal opportunities officers to develop and implement equal opportunities policies and programmes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister specifically tell us what measures he envisages to improve the position of women with regard to promotion in the private sector?  Platitudes are fine, but because of the failure in the private sector in this area of equality there is need to harden the legislation.  Will the Minister indicate what measures are envisaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply covered that area.  There was the question of the awareness of both employees and employers.  I mentioned how important positive action programmes were in this regard.  In many cases, in some areas of which the Deputy will be aware, at times positions were not applied for by people who had very fine qualifications for filling them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that it be used across the board.  In my reply I indicated that this was not targeted at private employers only but also at public bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to a positive action programme. I fear the financial allocation to the EEA will not be sufficient to deal with this.  Will the Minister accept that there is a need to appoint in each company a senior employee of the company with sole responsibility for equality of opportunity within the firm?  This person could be called an equality opportunities officer.  It is important to give this the priority it needs and that type of recommendation should come from the Department of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general thrust of the Deputy's suggestion that the more widespread the information the better.  That in itself will be effective.  In firms, trade unionists, shop stewards and people who have representative roles in trade unions on the factory floor will become increasingly aware of the necessity to make sure that there is equal opportunity in both employment and promotion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand what the Deputy means by sanctions.  There will be other factors to be taken into consideration if that occurred.  I would favour bringing the information to bear, so that everybody would be aware of the possibilities and this would bring efforts to fruition in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions numbers 8, 22 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Projections on employment and unemployment have been prepared by the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.  The recent report &ldquo;Industrial Training in Ireland&rdquo;, commissioned by the Industrial Policy Review Group, also contains projections in this area.</P>
      <P>Depending on assumptions about the level of migration flows, all these projections suggest that the labour force could increase by between 22,000 and 25,000 a year and, depending on the scale of net job creation, unemployment could also increase.</P>
      <P>The present increase in unemployment can be traced to the increased inflow of new entrants into the labour force, arising from the exceptional population growth in the sixties when many emigrants and their families returned to Ireland and, more recently, the virtual elimination of net migration.  The unemployment problem was compounded for a small open economy like Ireland by the downturn in world trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2223" /> While unemployment has been growing for the reasons I mentioned, Labour Force Surveys have shown increases in employment.  Since 1987, overall employment has increased by 41,000 and employment in the private non-agricultural sector by over 70,000.</P>
    <P>Over the last five years a transformation of the economy was achieved on the basis of the consensus approach contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programmes involve maintaining the position of the Irish pound within the exchange rate mechanism, the restoration of order to the public finances and the achievement of a low inflation rate.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the present policies, endorsed by the EC, the OECD and reputable independent commentators are correct and their implementation cannot be relaxed.  There is no viable alternative to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> There are no soft options in this area nor are panic measures likely to produce long term solutions.  At the same time, the Government will take whatever action is possible, within Exchequer parameters, to alleviate the problem.  Two such initiatives are the job training scheme and the employment subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>The consensus approach to solving the unemployment problem will be strengthened by the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment.  The committee will have available to them the work of the National Economic and Social Council, the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group and the studies commissioned by the group, including the study on industrial training in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The conclusion and recommendations of the study, <i>Industrial Training in Ireland</i>, will be taken into account in the White Paper on manpower policy which I intend to publish later this year.</P>

      <P>Question No. 8 specificaly asks what are the implications for labour policy arising from the study <Col N="2224" /> on industrial training in Ireland.  Can the Minister indicate whether he considers the projections of this report to be accurate?  The Minister indicated that the NES and ESRI have also made studies. Does he consider these to be accurate? Apart from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the general policy outlined in it and the training programme, have the Government any proposals other than the Oireachtas committee, to deal with the fairly huge numbers that are expected to emigrate during this decade and the huge numbers who will be unemployed during this decade arising from the demographic conditions that exist in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the body of my reply, the social and economic policy of the Government is geared to create the conditions that will arise when an increase in the numbers employed take place.  I outlined the demographic factors.  These are subborn facts that have to be coped with.  I also outlined the problems that arose from world trade, particularly recession of the UK and the US, as being factors also.  There are some hopes of an upturn.  However, if there is an uplift in the economies in the UK and the US we will inevitably get more people into employment to produce exports for those countries.  I do not believe in getting into prophesy but the intellectuals, when I was growing up, were writing about the vanishing Irish.  The direct opposite is true now, in that our population figures have increased considerably. I remember reading, and, of course, at that time was naive enough to pay heed to, intellectuals, but while becoming somewhat wiser as I got older, I was confronted with the problem of building schools for the increasing population in the late seventies and early eighties.</P>

      <P>We are all intellectuals in our own way.  The Minister indicated that the Government are concentrating on getting conditions right.  In replying he also spoke about inflation, the national deficit and, I think, interest rates as having been kept under control.  All of these have been kept under control over the past three of four years but the reality is that our unemployment figures continue to grow.  Apart from looking forward to the cessation of the recession in the United Kingdom, will the Minister say whether the Government have or are examining any other policy options?  Furthermore, what proportion of the unemployed does the Minister believe would be taken out of unemployment as a result of an upturn in the United Kingdom economy and what proportion he predicts would simply emigrate to participate in the United Kingdom economy as a result of that upturn?</P>

      <P>I might make three points. First, one I made already, that overall employment has increased by 41,000 since 1987.  Second, we look forward to the jobs forum, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Employment being a fruitful source of ideas.  With regard to proportionality, I would not have any idea. I do not think any living person could make such a forecast with any kind of accuracy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that lack of qualifications is a major cause of unemployment among the under-25s?  Have his Department had any meetings with the Department of Education in order to devise jointly a programme for adequate training for our young people?  Furthermore, would the Minister not agree that training for many 15 to 16-year-olds is being provided at a time when they will have already experienced failure and rejection within an academic educational system?  What steps will his Department take jointly with the Department of Education to provide training at an earlier stage concurrent with the overall education system?</P>

      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy about training and education. The fact is that the figure for unemployed people bear a direct proportional relationship to the qualifications of those concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to training, as the House will be aware, the Treaty of Rome did not make provision for education, it being thought that education was not relevant to the original Economic Community, whereas under the new Union Treaty that will not be so, education will have its proper place.  Despite the fact that it was not mentioned in the original Treaty of Rome, under the heading of training, substantial investment was made by the European Social Fund in training in this country under the auspices of the Departments of Education and Labour.  Of course there is liaison between those two Departments who co-ordinate their respective policies.</P>

      <P>I have indicated that the policies put in place since 1987 resulted in an increase of 41,000 people employed and, in the non-agricultural sector, 70,000; that the job training scheme has that objective in view, as has the employment subsidy scheme.  Indeed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment will be exercising their collective minds on that as well.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the 41,000 jobs to which the Minister referred as having arisen between the years 1987 and now, at a time of unprecedented growth which we are unlikely to achieve again in the course of this decade, and having regard to the fact that the <i>Industrial Training in Ireland</i> report forecast that 242,000 people will emigrate in the latter part of this decade, can the Minister indicate what policies the Government have other than awaiting a turnaround or cessation of the recession in the United Kingdom?  What policies do the Government have to deal with this potential disaster here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I only mentioned the question of the recession in the United Kingdom and in the USA as one of the factors which had led to increased numbers unemployed.  I would not be quite as pessimistic as the Deputy about the potential for growth in the future; I do not know; neither does the Deputy or anybody else.  But since nobody would have believed that, in one of those years, we had a 7.5 per cent growth in our economy it could very well recur.  I am convinced the Government are seriously concerned about this problem, more concerned about this than any other problem, and that the best possible minds will be brought to bear &mdash; on an across-the-House basis &mdash; to endeavour to improve the position overall in relation to employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 28, 37, 68 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>During the course of the recent dispute involving the Associated Banks and the Irish Bank Officials Association a number of people contacted my Department in connection with incidences of alleged intimidation and expressing fears about possible victimisation when the dispute ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from these concerns the question of victimisation was addressed by the <Col N="2229" /> Labour Court in its clarification of its earlier recommendation on the dispute. The court pointed out that it was vital to relationships on either side arising from the dispute.  Specifically this was intended to mean that members of staff should not be at any disadvantage in their employment arising from their activity during the dispute.  In my discussions with the IBOA and the banks this no-victimisation arrangement was endorsed.  If necessary any complaints arising under this heading may be referred by either party to the Labour Court for final resolution.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that with the return to work both sides will now act in a responsible way which will enable an improved industrial relations atmosphere to be developed in the Associated Banks and facilitate a movement away from the position of tension and mistrust referred to by the Labour Court in its recommendations. In this context it is essential that the review of industrial relations in the banks, as recommended by the Labour Court, be undertaken without delay.</P>
    <P>In relation to industrial relations generally I would call on all sides involved in industrial disputes to behave responsibly and refrain from actions which would heighten industrial relations tension.  It is my role as Minister for Labour to ensure that procedures and institutions exist whereby issues in dispute can be addressed and resolved. Machinery is already available, both in internal grievance procedures and third party institutions whereby employees can have incidences of alleged unfair treatment or victimisation investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the acceptance of a no-victimisation clause in the agreement reached by both sides in the banks' dispute.  However, the problem of intimidation can still arise during disputes. What steps do the Department of Labour intend to take to try to ensure that victimisation by either side does not arise in disputes?  Is it the Minister's intention to introduce a code of practice dealing with conduct during disputes? <Col N="2230" /> Will the Department of Labour provide some refuge for people on either side who experience victimisation at such a very sensitive time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that these people should contact the Department of Labour immediately.  The Department of Labour have at their disposal agencies which are highly skilled in industrial relations and geared towards ensuring peace in industrial disputes.  That would be the most advisable way to act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the commitment by the Minister for Labour that there will be no victimisation following the banks' dispute, I hope he will ensure that any complaints about intimidation after the strike will be investigated.  I have passed on the details of such cases to the Department of Labour.  In view of the totally unacceptable threats of intimidation during the banks' dispute, I ask the Minister to bring in the employer organisations to the Department so that he can stress to them that the type of intimidation which took place during the banks' dispute is totally unacceptable in our industrial relations climate?  We do not want to see a recurrence of what happened before where people were told that they could lose their jobs or would not be promoted if they went on strike.  That is a thirties attitude which is not acceptable in Irish society today.  I hope the Minister will make this very clear to the employers and various companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I believe intimidation is such a serious <Col N="2231" /> problem that it is not good enough for the Minister to say that those who experience intimidation can ring the Department of Labour who will make someone available to help them.  The Department of Labour should take the necessary steps to establish a code of practice which will ensure that intimidation will not arise during industrial disputes.  It is not good enough to tell people they can ring the Department of Labour to complain about intimidation. What protection do the Department of Labour intend to provide to ensure that people do not experience such intimidation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply, the philosophy of the Department of Labour is such that they are able to deal effectively with any such complaints.  As I also indicated in my reply, a no-victimisation clause was agreed by both sides in the banks dispute, a dispute with which the Minister for Labour dealt very effectively.</P>

      <P>Youth unemployment must be viewed in the context of unemployment generally.  The Deputy will be aware of the various measures adopted by Government to tackle unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Minister's area of responsibility is concerned, FÁS provided opportunities in 1991 for around 23,000 people under 25 years of age and a similar number will be catered for in 1992.  The vast majority of these people participated in training programmes such as apprenticeship, skills foundation, the community youth training programme and Youthreach.  Approximately 2,300 participated on Teamwork, which provides work experience opportunities for young people on projects of benefit to the local community.  In addition, CERT <Col N="2232" /> provides training for school leavers and unemployed persons interested in employment in the hotel, catering and tourism industry generally.  Approximately 3,600 people under 25 years of age will be trained by CERT in 1992.</P>
    <P>The new employment subsidy scheme and job training scheme will provide opportunities for unemployed people both under and over 25 years of age who have been on the live register for at least eight weeks.  The overall target for the schemes is 25,000.  Significant vocational training opportunities for young people are also provided within the education system and by Teagasc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that many of the schemes he has listed are not successful in getting to the root of the unemployment problem? Many of these schemes are merely stop-go measures which fill in for a while. The Minister referred to the Teamwork scheme.  If the Department of Labour consider this scheme so important in tackling unemployment why is it intended to abolish it?  Is it intended to expand the number of places made available by CERT, who cannot cope with the number of applications they have on hands at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect a certain logic in the Deputy's approach.  I agree with her that the most important single factor in dealing with unemployment is training and education.  The schemes to which I referred during the course of my reply give skills and educational advantage to the people for whom they are provided. I would reject the suggestion that there is a stop-go aspect to those schemes.</P>

      <P>I have always encouraged the involvement of workers in the running of their companies and I welcome and support any initiative, including financial participation schemes, which help to meet this objective.  Financial participation schemes can make a positive contribution to the development of employee involvement but, to be fully effective, such schemes should not exist in isolation but should form part of an overall approach by employers to employee involvement.</P>
      <P>Financial participation schemes are well established in Irish industry with some 50,000 employees belonging to approved profit-sharing schemes.  The Finance Bill provides for the continuation of tax concessions, though in modified form, and gives the necessary incentive for the developent of further schemes leading to better employee involvement and contributing to improved industrial relations generally.</P>
      <P>The FIE-ICTU Joint Declaration on Employee Involvement in the Private Sector recognises that financial participation can play an important role in fostering employee involvement and is one of a broad range of initiatives put forward for consideration by employers in the context of developing an overall employee involvement strategy.</P>

    <P>At EC level discussions are taking place on a draft EC recommendation on the promotion of employee participation <Col N="2234" /> in profits and enterprise results.

I have details of that but I am sure there is no point in going into them now.  The relief ceiling was reduced from £5,000 to £2,000.  In general, the Minister for Finance wanted workers to get the benefit of this type of scheme while at the same time covering areas where the scheme was being used for other purposes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 44, 61 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Under our system of industrial relations, which is voluntary in nature, it is generally a matter for the parties to disputes to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions.  The State facilitates this process by providing machinery, such as the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, to assist the parties.  In keeping with the voluntary nature of the system, their role is not one of imposing settlements or of coercing one or other side to adopt a particular solution.  Unless and until there is a willingness on both sides to reach a settlement, a resolution of any dispute will not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the recent dispute in the associated banks, both the Labour Relations Commission and the court played a very active and full role in helping to find a solution.  The Labour Court recommendation was not at first acceptable to the IBOA but, following clarification, it formed the basis on which the dispute was resolved.  The Minister for Labour is satisfied that the Labour <Col N="2236" /> Relations Commission and the Labour Court have played and will continue to play an important and effective role in industrial relations.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's aspirations that the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court will play a very important part in disputes. In the recent bank dispute a satisfactory conclusion was not reached through the Department of Labour but following the intervention of the FIE and the ICTU, and I should like to know if the Minister accepts that those vehicles were not successful in that dispute?  In future disputes will we once again have to rely on the intervention of third parties?</P>

      <P>From my experience as a trade unionist, after the resolution of a problem such as that one cannot point a finger and say that the FIE or the ICTU resolved it.  A number of people are involved, the Minister and his Department, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  For all we know, the other organisations mentioned by the Deputy and their expertise was called upon those I mentioned.  I am satisfied that the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and the Department of Labour are very effective in dealing with industrial disputes.</P>

Will the Minister accept that the Labour Relations Commission have a vital role to play in ensuring that disputes are resolved quickly?  Is there not a lesson to be learned from the recent bank dispute, that the Labour Relations Commission should intervene in the An Post dispute to ensure it is resolved before there is an all out strike?  I note the Minister for Labour is not present but I ask the Minister for Defence to request him to get involved in this dispute and direct the Labour Relations Commission to bring both parties together to <Col N="2237" /> ensure it is resolved before there is an all out strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, the Department fund management development and training through the training support scheme, which is administered by FÁS under the industrial restructuring programme, and through the annual State grant to the Irish Management Institute (IMI).  The training support scheme aims to assist small and medium-sized industries improve their competitiveness in the context of the Single European Market. Grants are paid for training in key skills which can increase competitiveness in areas such as strategic planning, management, production, technology and marketing.  In 1991, total expenditure under the scheme came to more than £4 million.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years the IMI have received over £1.5 million pounds in Exchequer funding towards their management training activities.  In recent years, the level of the grant has been reduced gradually in accordance with the report of the Advisory Committee on Management Training (Galvin committee) which recommended that State funding of management development should be directed towards the users of management training rather than the providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Labour, together with the EC Commission and the IMI, have funded during the past year the <Col N="2238" />&ldquo;Year of the Manager Campaign&rdquo; aimed at increasing the awareness, on the part of enterprises, of the contribution of management development to business development.  The developments I have mentioned are additional to management education, training and development undertaken in the educational system. Finally, I would like to emphasise the point that primary responsibility for management training rests with enterprises themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the original statement of the Deputy that good management makes for good business.  My experience has been that if there is bad management we generally hear about it through the collapse of the business.  An important philosophic change with regard to funding of management effort was brought about as a result of the Galvin committee which I mentioned, namely, that the user should be funded rather than the provider.  That is being adhered to and should result in an improvement in the quality of management education.</P>

      <P>Government support to industry is provided in the main by the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Labour provide assistance to industry in the area of training through the activities of FÁS and CERT.  That Department also are <Col N="2239" /> responsible for the administration of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, employers employing more than 20 workers and proposing to make collective redundancies must enter into consultations with representatives of the workers involved, at least 30 days in advance, and must also inform me at the same time.  The consultations under the collective bargaining system must include questions of avoiding or reducing the proposed redundancies and of minimising the consequences.  Employers and employees are best placed to consider the options which may be available.  In each case, the Department advise FÁS so that they are aware of the situation and can offer whatever assistance is possible.</P>
      <P>A review of the operation of the legislation, in the light of practical experience, has recently been undertaken by the Department.  The Minister is now considering the results to see if any changes are needed.  The Department are also actively participating in discussion at EC level to amend the relevant EC Directive on collective redundancies.  Any changes in the directive would entail an amendment of the 1977 Act.</P>

Should we not provide more resources in an effort to identify industries that face problems just as we should solve disputes before they reach a crucial stage?  Do the Department intend to provide resources to identifying the problems facing industries that could result in closure?  Would the Department then take steps to facilitiate industry through research in order to help them get through a temporary crisis so that by stepping in at a crucial time we would protect jobs?

There are very strict obligations on employers who <Col N="2240" /> employ more than 20 people if they find themselves in a situation where they will have to make workers redundant.  The obligation resting on the employers, in consultation with the employees, is to avoid the redundancies, if possible, or to reduce or minimise the consequences of redundancy.  As I indicated also in the course of the reply, the Act is being looked at and cognisance is being taken of activities in Europe to see if it can be improved.  The original idea behind the Act was good and it should be updated in the interests of the continuation of industries and businesses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 69 together.  I assume that Deputy Currie is referring to public holidays as the regulation of bank holidays does not come within the scope of my functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to increase the number of public holidays.  The issue of introducing more public holidays and in particular the possibility of designating May Day as a public holiday was raised in discussions on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> between the Government and the social partners. There was no agreement to include the issue in the current programme. However, there is a commitment in the <Col N="2242" /> programme for a general review of the legislation relating to holidays.  The question of increasing the number of public holidays and of designating May Day as a public holiday will be among the matters for consideration as part of that review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the former Minister for Labour, Deputy B. Ahern, announced in January 1991 that it was intended to make May Day a public holiday by 1994.  Is that commitment now being withdrawn?  We have eight public holidays; and may I point out that Ireland is among the countries in the European Community that has the least number of public holidays?  Denmark has 14 and we are one of only three EC countries that do not designate May Day as a public holiday?  In view of this, does the Minister consider it fair that labour should be marked by a public holiday?</P>

      <P>Second, four countries of the Twelve are on a par with Ireland in this regard. Finally, the question of increasing the number of public holidays and designating May Day as a public holiday will be part of the review that I mentioned in the body of the reply.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the social employment scheme is to give as many long term unemployed as possible opportunities to become involved in a work <Col N="2243" /> related situation on a part time basis for one year.</P>
      <P>FÁS have been given authority in exceptional circumstances to allow the re-engagement of persons who have completed projects.

I have no statistics about how many are involved or when this started.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance for presenting this very impressive and important legislation.  It is a lengthy and detailed Bill and it is obvious a great deal of skilled work has gone into its preparation.  Many years have passed since tax changes of such magnitude have been incorporated in a Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obvious EC implications, one of which relates to DIRT where there will be a reduction of £80 million.  This change was necessary in the context of the abolition of exchange controls, otherwise vast sums of money would leave the country.  That happened some years ago and it was to the detriment of our economy.  Obviously there are positive <Col N="2272" /> aspects of it: there will be more savings, more investment and, hopefully, more jobs.  We should concentrate our efforts and our energies more on jobs than other issues, which at present are taking up a greater portion of our time in this House and outside.</P>
    <P>The European situation and European Union were obviously in the minds of the Minister and those who helped him to prepare the Bill.  Incorporated in the Bill since 1987 is a continuation of fiscal policy in the macro-economic area.  The phenomenon is that while things are going well in the macro-economic area, the jobs are not forthcoming.  The sooner the issue of jobs is tackled the better.</P>
    <P>The period of industrial peace which we have had over the past few years has helped our economic situation; when the Minister for Finance was Minister for Labour he played a major part in that period of extended peace.  Recently, the boat was rocked by the lengthy bank dispute.  I compliment the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, for his excellent handling of that dispute.  Thank God, commonsense prevailed and we are now able to get on with the job.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately we have serious postal difficulties which, if they were to be prolonged, would have major implications for the economy. The rural post office comes to mind.  I recall speaking on the Finance Bill two years ago when the closure of rural post offices was first mooted.  I sounded warning bells at that time but unfortunately, I had to raise this matter again when speaking on last year's Finance Bill when the prospect of closing these post offices was a real threat.  I voiced my concern and my aversion to any policy of closure of rural post offices. I hope commonsense will prevail and that the major difficulties in An Post will be dealt with.  I do not believe any substantial savings will be gleaned in the context of the present difficulties by closing rural post offices.  Older citizens depend on them because there are many areas where public transport is not available to bring them to the bigger post offices in the nearest town.  I do not have time to dwell <Col N="2273" /> on the many other reasons.  I object to such closures but I hope this policy will not be proceeded with.  However, I am sure we will have an opportunity to talk about that again.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no improvement in the incentives for transferring farmland from the older to the younger generation.  It is vital that such transfers be encouraged and facilitated and that all disincentives are removed. Because of the disincentives, some people stay on their farms until they reach a ripe old age, and at that stage, the younger, up-and-coming farmers, are no longer young.  As a result, some of these younger people get frustrated and leave the land altogether.  I would exhort the Minister to address this matter on Committee Stage or somewhere along the line, with a view to encouraging the older members of the farming community to retire happily and contentedly to enjoy the fruits of a lifetime's labour and allow the younger generation who are equipped with education and skills to get their teeth into the job of farming.  God knows, there are enough difficulties without having that disincentive.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his re-examination of the public house licence system.  He spoke to me about it in the run up to this Finance Bill, and has changed his mind: somebody said the man who cannot change his mind cannot change anything.  Some people on the Opposition benches said the Minister had made a U-turn in this regard.  That was astute thinking on his part.  The small family run pubs are part and parcel of rural Ireland and would be decimated if the original plan to base licence fees on the valuation with a multiplier attached went ahead.  That was a non-starter.  I am pleased the Minister has seen fit to depart from that and to put in place what is a much more equitable system.  While there will be an increase, it is a scaled one which will be equitable and will take into account the ability to pay.</P>
    <P>There are 10,000 of these pubs around our country.  They are an integral part of our nation.  We are trying to promote and expand tourism and provide a welcome <Col N="2274" /> for tourists who will find a welcome in those family run public houses, and any disincentive to keeping those houses of welcome open is to be avoided.  I am delighted the Minister has seen fit to put this new format in place.</P>

      <P>Anything else I have to say will be related to job creation which are an integral part of what the Minister is trying to achieve.  By-pass roads all around the country funded by Europe have made massive improvements in our infrastructural programme.  In my constituency, we are screaming for a by-pass on the main Euro route to Rosslare.  The town of Arklow is stagnating because of traffic congestion; it is an employment black spot.  Industrialists do not want to know about it.  They cannot be attracted there because of congestion and the town itself and the south Wicklow hinterland are suffering.  It is imperative that we get on with the job of providing a by-pass for Arklow, and that should be proceeded with as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In by-passing towns and villages we must have regard to the interests of local people and how by-passing a town or village affects its way of life and economy.  A town that is suffering because there is a by-pass is Kilcullen, the new constituency of Wicklow-East Kildare.  That is a typical example of how a town can be affected.  The new road, excellent though it is, is by-passing the town and cutting off the town's economic lifeline; it is detrimental to the economic life of Kilcullen.  There is a solution &mdash; build a link road.  I have already written to successive Ministers for the Environment about this and I hope my words will be heard, The solution is there; it is only a question of having the will to carry it out.  I hope that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill refers to the restriction of capital allowances on holiday cottages.  I referred to the effort that is going into promoting national tourism. <Col N="2275" /> Our tourism industry is growing at 15 per cent, three times the world rate.  That is very commendable but we should not do anything to restrict that growth.  I believe that, incorporated in this section of the Bill, is a restriction on the growth of tourism.  There is also an injustice incorporated here.  Once again let me give an example.  There is a company in my constituency, within ten miles of my home, which has expended £1 million solely on the strength of the tax allowances that are and have been available prior to this section 24.  The project will involve £3.65 million, there are 100 jobs on the construction side and thereafter, there will be 15 permanent jobs.  That is music to my ears and it is worth fighting for.  If this section is agreed it may remove the possibility of this project proceeding. It is unjust and unacceptable to cut it off at this stage after all the work and planning has been done.</P>
    <P>Last April we found ourselves in a similar position in relation to the business expansion scheme.  I recall appealing to the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, to allow hotel projects for which plans had been made, which were ready to proceed and for which finance had been secured, to proceed.  He considered this request sympathetically and was very astute because he allowed those projects to proceed.  I made representations to him on behalf of two hotels in my constituency and that the work has since been completed and jobs have been created.  I ask the incumbent, who I have no doubt is a positive gentleman &mdash; we are very fortunate to have him as Minister for Finance &mdash; to consider this request as sympathetically as his predecessor considered the request in relation to the business expansion scheme last year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish to compliment and congratulate the Minister who put a great amount of effort into producing it.  I hope it has a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and Deputy Jacob.  There are two main features which we, in the Green Party, look for in a Finance Bill, first, what it does for the environment, and, second, does it address in a serious way the dual scourge of unemployment and involuntary emigration.  I regret to say that this Finance Bill, like previous Finance Bills introduced by the Government, fails dismally on both counts.</P>
      <P>In relation to the environment, there are no additional provisions over and above those included in the Estimates. There is no sign that there will be speeding up of the process to establish the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>The energy crisis is not addressed in the Bill.  Indeed, the situation will worsen with the proposed reduction in the price of petrol.  This proposal flies in the face of the likely introduction of some form of energy tax by the European Community. The reason the Minister gave in his budget speech for this extraordinary proposal was the cross-Border factor. However, he did not bother to give any facts, figures or estimates of the effect this proposal will have in Border areas.  I accept that a large differential in petrol prices between the North and South would result in considerable loss of trade but the Minister did not make his case.  I should remind the House that in spite of the fact that the estimates for energy conservation have been cut by 44 per cent and 26 per cent in the Estimates in the past two years, there is no supplementary provision for extra spending in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to comment on some aspects of the Minister's speech.  I note he used the term &ldquo;sustainable economic growth&rdquo;.  While I commend him for his wisdom in using the word &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; I am very dubious as to whether he understands it fully.  The unpalatable truth is that our economy is not structured in a way that will enable us to operate in a sustainable fashion as the basis of our economy is the continuing profligate use of fossil fuel resources.  Our open economy <Col N="2277" /> encourages the unnecessary transportation of goods from one side of the world to the other.  This has also caused our frightening unemployment rates.</P>
    <P>Once again, the Minister refers to tax reform and claims that major progress has been made but surely what is needed is simplification of the income tax code. This Bill extends to no less than 246 pages and we have been told by the Minister that a further Finance Bill will be needed later in the year to deal with the other budgetary changes.  Assuming we need an income tax system it is time to realise it is better to start again and sweep away all existing provisions in the Income Tax Act, 1967 and in subsequent Finance Acts as there has to be a better way.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the problem of unemployment and involuntary emigration. The Minister admitted in his speech that his target for average unemployment of 272,000 has already been reached.  Therefore, we are talking about a year end figure of close on 300,000.  All parties in the House have failed to face up to the reality of this unemployment figure which everyone agrees cannot be substantially reduced even in the medium-term.  It must be obvious to all that the main reason for the increase in unemployment is that modern technology has killed jobs.  This trend has been exacerbated by our membership of the European Community.  I should remind Members that unemployment is now running four times the level it was at when we joined the European Community in 1972.  In the unlikely event of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty being passed this figure will undoubtedly increase further.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the draconian provisions in section 8 which deal with benefit-in-kind on company cars.  These measures represent an attack on the living standards of company representatives who use a car as a tool of their trade.  Let us by all means hit hard the managing directors who drive their cars daily into town and have free parking even though they live perhaps 50 yards from a DART station.  We oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and to respond as comprehensively as I can in the time available to the major issues which were raised.  Other points relating to individual sections can be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to overall budgetary policy issues.  I cannot let this opportunity pass without putting one or two points on the record in reply.  First, there has not been a doubling of the real EBR over the past two years.  The 1990 outturn for the Exchequer borrowing requirement was 2 per cent of GNP: this year's budget projection, which has been generally accepted as a prudent estimate, is for an EBR of 2.4 per cent.  To abstract the EBR from the prevailing economic context is not, in any event, realistic.  In 1990, the economy was benefiting from an uplift abroad while the subsequent international economic downturn which <Col N="2279" /> has dramatically shifted Irish migration patterns correspondingly increased the pressure on our social spending.</P>
    <P>There is no question of any weakening in the Government's resolve to maintain fiscal discipline.  On the contrary, I would remind Deputies that an EBR of less than 2.5 per cent could not have been envisaged as in any way attainable in the mid-eighties, when the Exchequer borrowing requirement stood at almost 13 per cent of GNP.  That achievement, in the context of the pre-emption of over 9.5 per cent of GNP in debt-service costs, should not be so lightly discounted.  The progress we have made, and which we have consolidated despite the continuing difficult budgetary situation while making room for real reform of our tax structures, is something which all sides of the House recognise, and take pride in. The national consensus which transformed our public finance and our economic performance is recognised widely abroad and there should be no place for designation of these achievements at home.</P>
    <P>I should also put to rest the Deputy's fears about Ireland's ability to meet the budgetary convergence criteria envisaged in the context of European Monetary Union.  The fact is that we already meet these requirements.  The general Government deficit in both 1991 and 1992 is calculated at virtually a full percentage point below the ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP set out in these criteria.  The debt-GDP ratio is declining steadily.  Having reduced from about 117 per cent in 1987 to 95 per cent last year, this ratio will fall again in 1992.  This is not just my opinion. At a meeting on 10 February last which considered Ireland's economic convergence programme, the ECOFIN Council welcomed the fact that Ireland at present complies with the objective criteria for the move to the third stage of European Monetary Union.  I trust that these facts will reassure the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I now turn from these broader issues to the narrower area of taxation.  Deputies' contributions ranged across the full spectrum of the taxes and I will try to address <Col N="2280" /> their major issues as fully as I can in the limited time available to me.</P>
    <P>I will begin with income tax, which as usual seems to have attracted the most comment.  Much fire was concentrated by Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn on what they implied was the Government's policy of concentrating on cutting tax rates.  Deputy Noonan raised doubts about the Government's way of paying for it, while other Deputies, including Deputy Rabbitte, questioned the value of doing it in terms of job creation; also, Deputies Noonan and Quinn indicated that they would have had different priorities if they had been framing the budget.</P>
    <P>Let me say at the outset that the Government's policy is not one of exclusive concentration on cutting tax rates.  It is true that the review of the Programme for Government sets out the Government's firm intention to endeavour to achieve the objective of reducing tax rates; but it also sets out our objective to begin working towards a considerable widening of the standard income tax band and increasing the basic personal allowances.</P>
    <P>The review promises a radical overhaul of the entire tax code, involving a systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates.  Despite what Deputy Noonan seemed to imply, this was not, and was never intended to be, confined to the income tax system: radical overhaul of the entire tax code is what it says, so that it was quite within the terms of the review to consider other taxes &mdash; for example VAT, and corporation tax.  Finally, the review is crystal clear that the overall budgetary parameters consititute the framework within which tax reform would be pursued.  This is what was done and there is no basis for Deputy Noonan's implication that the Government somehow abandoned responsible budgetary policy in framing this year's tax changes.</P>
    <P>The essence of this tax policy is to extend the tax base, reduce tax rates and extend the standard band.  It is not a policy which has sprung from the Government in defiance of all previous thinking on the subject.  On the contrary, <Col N="2281" /> it has been recommended by the Commission on Taxation, the National Economic and Social Council and the Industrial Policy Review Group as well as by several international bodies.  It is based on the view that exemptions and reliefs narrow the tax base and make tax rates higher than they would otherwise need to be, which in turn leads to avoidance, evasion and inequity, to distortion of economic choice, to complexity for both taxpayer and Revenue alike, and to disincentives for effort and enterprise. By contrast, widening the tax base and reducing tax rates can, as the review of the Programme for Government says, contribute significantly to improving incentives to work, to reducing economic distortions, reducing the opportunities for avoidance and evasion and simplifying the tax code for taxpayers and the administration.  It can also make a significant contribution to simple equity by ensuring that as far as possible all income, however received, is liable to tax, but that the rates of tax applying to it are kept as low as is consistent with equity and the need to generate revenue to meet expenditure.  I hope on Committee Stage we will have adequate time to talk about these issues.</P>
    <P>The contributions to this debate were excellent and I thank Deputies for them. No previous budget ever had such political input because of the long review of the Programme for Government and the various discussions which involved a number of Ministers.  I know that Deputy Quinn wanted me to restate that the in-depth examination fully involved the officials of my Department because they supplied all the data on which the Government made decisions.  I have been speaking on Finance Bills for 15 years in this House.  Between 1977 and 1981 I argued with Deputies on the backbenches who said that they could not understand a system which had high rates of tax and expounded the theory that nobody would invest in the economy unless they got tax breaks.  The system was wrong and unfair to the PAYE sector and it was the reason that there were marches in 1980.  I made my first speech <Col N="2282" /> in regard to this issue before 1980.  I look forward to talking about this on Committee Stage.  If the only way that anyone will invest is by hiding behind tax shelters and reliefs, then God help this country, because it is wrong.  However, we can argue about the implementation of justifiable reliefs.</P>
    <P>The basis of this Bill - and I have had the pleasure and honour of working on it for six months &mdash; is that 750,000 taxpayers will pay less tax.  I should like to do more and I hope I will be in the job long enough to make more improvements. I do not argue with points made by Deputies in relation to improving the system and I will take their views into account.  However, the policy is that income in whatever form is taxable and if we have lower rates of tax everybody will pay some, removing discrimination. For example, a person in one house may pay a certain amount of tax and someone in the next house on a similar income pays a different rate of tax, for various reasons.</P>
    <P>I have had major disputes with some Members of the House in relation to providing relief in respect of the purchase of shares or anything else.  If I allow reliefs of this kind it means that others must pay tax so that these people can play their little games and make money.  That is incompatible with everything in the income tax system and against everything in which I believed during the years I studied taxation and accountancy.  I also studied the PAYE system and VAT capital allowances and it took me 15 years in this House to get to a position where I can do something about it.  I make no apology for trying to change an unfair, bizarre system so that 750,000 people will benefit while penalising a small handful.</P>
    <P>We must be sensible and try to make an unfair system equitable.  That is the principle behind the Bill.  I want to give one example regarding investment and jobs, although I will not mention the names of companies or individuals. People seem to think that curtailing tax shelters or reliefs stops investment.  I could give many examples but I shall give just one: a group of 40 per cent <Col N="2283" /> companies came together to set up a structure of a limited partnership, with substantial resources from the 40 per cent profits; they constructed an arrangement under which a massive amount of money was invested in a US gas exploration location, which I shall not mention, thereby gaining the relief of 90 per cent of the allowances against their Irish tax. That is the kind of thing that is going on.  I know that this may not be fair on Deputies who do not have all the information, but if people want to defend such arrangements on the basis of equity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  In the interests of the 750,000 people who want to pay their tax, who want to be honest and honourable and who want to pay their contribution to society, we have an obligation to protect them from those who do not wish to be so honourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say that every single allowance and every shelter that I did away with was being abused but a fundamental feature of the Commission on Taxation, which reported almost ten years ago, was that there would be losers and winners.  The basis of that was equity and the objective was to achieve an equitable transfer from the losers to the winners. That has concentrated my efforts for the past four or five months.  I have listened with great interest to all of the interested groups and lobbies.  I have listened very carefully to what must have been about 100 deputations and have heard people agree with the principle of tax reform, say that they fully accept what I am trying to do and assert their belief that the Government should tax the disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, maternity allowance and every other kind of benefit. They have said that to switch the money around within the system is great tax reform.  Then, they have pointed out that their own little tax shelter should not be taxed.  I have no sympathy with that attitude.  I do not know how Ministers <Col N="2284" /> have defended that in the past but I have no intention of doing so.  It is perhaps true that in the past couple of months I have lost my temper more than I would normally, when dealing with such groups. In no way do I apologise if some of them left my office in rather a more strange way than they thought my personality would allow.  How could I advocate the taxation of the disability benefit, for example, which will take a few pounds off someone, and then allow someone else the benefit of a few million pounds by way of tax relief or shelter?  The Committee Stage will provide an opportunity to go through that at length.</P>
    <P>My statement has provided some figures. I do not want to start preaching to Deputy Noonan and Deputy Quinn about all of the things that have happened through the years, wherein both Deputies accepted changes in different times.  However, I would like to point out that a taxation policy has to try to have regard to the position of all taxpayers. The Government's policy has been doing that: there has been special provision for the low paid, via the exemption limits and child addition; relief for the low paid and the middle paid, via the reduction of the standard rate; extension of the standard band to raise the point at which taxpayers face higher rates; and reduction of the top rate, so that the top rate, when met, is not so onerous.  I readily agree with Deputy Noonan that the standard band needs to be extended further.  I have no difficulty with that idea and I have made that point constantly since becoming Minister for Finance.  I hope to be in a position to make much further progress in this area.  Nor do I disagree that that is the area we should be working on.  I have much sympathy with the view that it does not matter too much what the top rate is if very few people are on it.  I understand that view but I consider that the top rate is still too high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan made much of the provisions in the Bill to restrict or curtail income tax reliefs.  He almost seemed to imply that the Bill attacked the mortgage interest and health insurance reliefs.  Of <Col N="2285" /> course it does not, although I have noted and will bear in mind the Deputy's view that in the interests of equity all taxpayers should get relief at the standard rate only. But if the Deputy looks at the income tax reliefs and exemptions which are restricted or eliminated in the Bill he will note that they mostly have to do with ensuring that income, however received, is regarded as such for tax purposes.  The budget did not curtail recognition of expenditure of income on mortgage interest and health insurance.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that there are very considerable equity arguments for treating income, however received, as income for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>It has been said that some of the measures I have introduced will restrict reliefs and diminish incentives.  I have dealt with that point but I reiterate that eliminating and restricting reliefs as provided by the Bill will help to ensure that income, however received, is subject to tax, and that will help to reduce tax rates. In this way, the Government will be able to improve incentives for enterprise and initiative across a broad front for taxpayers generally, not just for a privileged few.  We can help to ensure that incentives are found, not by going around the tax system by means of special reliefs but within the system by way of lower rates and a wider band.  We can also ensure that the considerable enterprise shown by tax planners in recent years is diverted into much more productive pursuits, that is, in giving advice and in making decisions not for tax reasons but for commercial reasons.  In other words, we will be able to operate a tax system that, far from diminishing incentives, makes much more sense in terms of incentives and enterprise.  That is what the Finance Bill is about.  In a real sense, it is pro-effort, pro-enterprise and pro-employment.</P>
    <P>In relation to individual reliefs, I welcome the support from Deputy Quinn for the removal of the exemption for patent income for individuals and for its retention for companies.  I point out that innovation and enterprise across a broad front now have a simpler, fairer and less onerous tax system with which to contend.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> As regards pension refunds, I am sure Deputies will accept the fact of life that changes can be made.  I have considered the points made by several Deputies.  A number of Deputies referred to the changes I have made to the budget proposals on benefit-in-kind in regard to company cars.  It was suggested that I had not gone far enough with my concessions.  I want to emphasise that what is being taxed is the availability for private use of a car provided by an employer.  There is no question of the business use of a car being taxed.  The old rates were too low compared with the cost of private motoring. Tapering relief started too early at a level of 10,000 business miles a year, which works out at an average of about 40 miles a day.  There is no way that anyone can argue that 40 miles a day is high business mileage.  Finally, under the old system, tapering relief could wipe out the complete benefit-in-kind charge.  That was unrealistic, as there is always some benefit in having a company car for private use in the evenings or at weekends.  I have met several groups representing commercial travellers and business representatives and my officials met others. I proposed to the Government, and they agreed, that certain changes should be made which will reduce the impact of the benefit-in-kind increases, particularly on people such as company representatives and commercial travellers who drive very high business mileages.  I again stress that the benefit-in-kind charge arises only where a company car is available for private use.  The benefit-in-kind charge does not apply where employees arrange with their employer that they will not have the use of the car other than for business purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned the reference in my opening speech to bringing forward on Committee Stage provisions setting down the final time extension for the urban renewal tax reliefs in the designated areas.  While I do not wish to anticipate the details of those provisions, I shall make the following general observations. In setting down final and definitive timescales at this stage, the intention is to remove any uncertainty that may <Col N="2287" /> exist in the construction and development sectors as to the timeframe available. It is not realistic to expect that the present urban renewal scheme, with its generous package of tax reliefs, will continue to be extended, and certainly not until 1996, simply to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the scheme's inception.  Due and fair notice is being given of the scheme's cessation, and, as from now, developers have two full years in which to expedite their projects in the designated areas generally and almost five years in the case of the Custom House Docks area.  I am confident that the effect of that will be to bring forward pipeline projects and also to accelerate those currently in progress.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with some other points made by Deputies Noonan and Quinn in this regard.  I agree with the idea of the date being final.  It is difficult to be extending all of the time.  I have a great deal of information, although I recognise that Deputy Quinn has specialist knowledge in this area that I do not share.  I do not argue with the Deputy on that score; I have heard him speak on this matter for a long time.  However, there are developments that have been on the books since September 1986, when the then Minister, John Boland, asked me as Lord Mayor of Dublin, to launch the urban renewal scheme.  I have been a strong supporter of the scheme.  I consider it to have been one of the better decisions of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government and it has achieved a lot for Dublin city.  Many developers, however, have merely sat around, held planning permissions and have no intention of developing the site in question. The extensions to the scheme in recent years have not been the success that they should have been.  I should like to close off this scheme in the hope that I or some future Minister will then have the opportunity to focus better on what areas should have designation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked for my comments on the provisions in the Bill dealing with section 84 loans in so far as they affect the IDA package of incentives and <Col N="2288" /> commitments.  The Bill caters for such IDA commitments.  It abolishes new section 84 loans on and from 20 December last with the exception of loans for two lists of new manufacturing projects where the IDA or SFADCo had made commitments that section 84 loans would be available for the projects concerned. The total amount of loans on these two lists is £420 million, which is a very large amount.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Noonan and Quinn criticised section 24 of the Bill which restricts the scope of the capital allowances on holiday cottages.  The section does not abolish these allowances but confines them for offsetting purposes to the income arising from the holiday cottage renting activity or the trade for which the holiday cottage is used.  This change is totally in line with the Government's policy of reducing tax rates while at the same time widening the tax base through the curtailment or abolition of various tax reliefs and tax shelters.  Holiday cottage investments were being advertised in the press as the last great tax break and were being used as a tax shelter against their other income by persons not involved in the tourist industry. The change in section 24 has been designed in such a way that it does not adversely impact on those situations where holiday cottages are being developed as a self-contained business. However, in view of points raised in connection with situations where construction of a holiday cottage is already under way, I will look in detail without commitment, at the possibility of an appropriate transitional provision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn referred to the new wear and tear capital allowances for plant and machinery which he said had been welcomed.  He claimed, however, that the new seven year tax write-off period for these assets does not fit in with the duration of leases of such assets in that these leases are usually for periods of three to five years.  As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, the new improved wear and tear regime in the Bill includes a significant Exchequer cost.  This cost is estimated as £6.5 million in 1993, which <Col N="2289" /> cost will rise progressively afterwards to about £45 million in 1996.  A reduction of the write-off period from seven years to five years would considerably increase this Exchequer cost.  If the period were reduced to three years it would virtually amount to the reintroduction of accelerated capital allowances, which would result in the oversubsidisation of capital as against labour.  As the Deputy will also appreciate, it is considered that for tax equity and other reasons, the capital allowances for leasing should be the same as for non-leasing situations.  In the past leasing was unduly favoured in the tax system and measures had to be introduced in a number of Finance Bills to tackle the problem of unacceptable tax-based leasing practices.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made points on co-operatives.  In the note I circulated to Deputies I tried to deal with these points and I have moved towards dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to DIRT tax, I am fully aware that the changes here represent a radical change in the taxation of interest income.  These changes are an inevitable result of capital liberalisation.  The alternative to the changes is not, as some Opposition Deputies suggested, taxation of 27 per cent or 48 per cent on this increase, but rather an outflow of funds from the country caused by the desire of individuals to avail of tax free nonresident accounts abroad.  There are many arguments on this which I will make on Committee Stage.  I will just make the point that where a person pays tax on the interest on these special accounts, the capital sum does not get off scot free.  It is the interest on the amount which is no longer followed by the Revenue.  It is <Col N="2290" /> wrong to think that the capital sum if used again cannot be taken up by Revenue.</P>
    <P>In my examination prior to the budget with regard to money abroad I found that the 10 per cent incentive would not attract money from abroad.  It would take more than a 10 per cent rate to attract money in offshore accounts back into the country.  I will have more chance of explaining my arguments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their time and I acknowledge the fact that some Deputies were not able to get in.  On this occasion, however, the Second Stage had a full week of Dáil time.  It is only right that the finance spokespersons who follow this matter all year should get more time than other speakers.  Between the Whips we have worked out a novel arrangement for Committee Stage.  I hope it works.  I thank Deputies Noonan and Quinn particularly who asked me to consider this arrangement last December. In the event this year we will get double the amount of time we usually get for a Committee Stage.  We will sit in the other Chamber for Committee Stage.  I thank our colleagues in the Seanad for giving us these facilities for the Special Committee.  I look forward to the debate. I again thank the spokespersons, particularly Deputy Rabbitte for his long considered view of this Finance Bill.  I will consider amendments as open mindedly as possible on Committee Stage and I will answer Deputies as fully as I can.  I again thank Deputies for their work on the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Compensation for Widow of Irish Soldier.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to pay tribute to the Department of Defence, the Minister for Defence and Mr. Michael Martin of PDFORRA in responding to the needs of Mrs. Margaret McCarthy.  It is gratifying that this financial burden will be lifted from this woman, as reported in the media this morning.</P>
      <P>The Irish Army have a proud record in the service of the United Nations.  They carry out peacekeeping operations in very trying and sometimes dangerous circumstances.  The Irish Army have responded magnificently to the calls made by the United Nations.  The members of the Irish Defence Force serving in troubled spots throughout the world have been a source of pride to all of us at home.  Irish soldiers are not at war; they are agents of the United Nations and should not be penalised for this.</P>
      <P>The case of the widow of Corporal McCarthy is a particularly sad one. Indeed I would even go further and say it is a disgraceful case.  Corporal McCarthy, a young married man, lost his life on a peacekeeping operation.  His wife and family have not only suffered the loss of a husband and father but have had to deal with financial problems due to the rigid regulations imposed by an insurance company and the insensitivity of a local authority.  There is now an urgent need for a total re-examination of this type of insurance policy.  Soldiers involved in UN peacekeeping operations should be exempt from any such clause in mortgage protection policies.  It would appear that Mrs. McCarthy was an innocent victim of the group policy taken out by Cork County Council.  I urge the Minister to immediately clarify the position and take action to rectify this totally unacceptable situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a comparison between Irish soldiers on UN peacekeeping operations and gardaí who are constantly at war against crime.  If, God forbid, a garda was killed during the course of duty, would his mortgage policy be declared null and void?  I do not think so.  I am sure every right thinking person would agree that the same conditions should apply to policies taken out by members of our Army as apply in the case of policies taken out by gardaí.  Our Army are not at war; they keep the peace.  Very often they have to do their duty under the most severe provocation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to immediately intervene in this case to ensure that this woman and her family do not have to suffer any more than they have suffered already.  I put it to the Minister that never again should the widow of a soldier who has given his life in the service of this country and the United Nations have to suffer such a traumatic experience.  I ask the Minister and the Department of Defence to rectify this unacceptable and scandalous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey) Minister for State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this matter.  I fully share the Deputy's concern at the problems encountered by the wodow of an Irish soldier who died in the Lebanon in securing death benefits payable under a mortgage protection policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that the insurers declined to pay death benefit on the basis <Col N="2295" /> of a war exclusion clause in the insurance policy.  As the Deputy said, Irish soldiers who serve overseas are engaged in peacekeeping missions; they are not at war.  Neither are they within a war zone in any commonsense meaning of those words.  I understand that since yesterday proposals have been drawn up by the insurance company for consideration by the lending institution, Cork County Council.</P>
    <P>For more than 30 years Irish soldiers have served the cause of peace in many countries around the world.  Sadly, military personnel have lost their lives on a number of occasions.  So far as my Department are aware, this is the first and only occasion on which a war exclusion clause has been invoked. Ireland's international prestige has been greatly enhanced by the work of the Defence Forces overseas and the success of our soldiers in international peacekeeping has been a source of considerable pride for Irish people.  It is most inequitable that the service of a soldier with the United Nations should be advanced as a pretext for declining to honour a mortgage protection policy which was taken out in good faith, adding greatly to the stress of the recently bereaved family.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to reassure the relatives of other personnel serving in the Lebanon and whose local authority mortgages are covered by the same policy that the Department of Defence, on becoming aware of the problems being encountered, took immediate steps to remove any possible ambiguity about the situation by arranging and paying for additional mortgage protection insurance for all such personnel.</P>
    <P>The widow of a soldier who is killed while serving overseas with the United Nations receives an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £38,245 plus a lump sum equal to one year's pay and a pension ranging from 50 per cent to 90 per cent of pay, depending on the number of dependent children.  In addition, the social welfare contributory pension is paid.  In general the compensation provisions in operation are <Col N="2296" /> designed to ensure that a widow with a family will receive an income at least as great as that provided by her late husband.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Threatened Closure of Waterford Plants.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter because of the disturbing statements made in recent weeks by both the chairman and chief executive of Waterford Crystal, Mr. Don Brennan and Dr. Paddy Galvin, who expressed doubts about the continuation of the glass manufacturing enterprises at Waterford and Dungarvan.  It is not my intention to be scaremongering but the threat of closure must be addressed by the Government and the relevant State agency, the IDA. Closure of these enterprises would mean the loss of 2,500 jobs and devastate the local economies of Waterford and Dungarvan. I am aware that a study into the viability of the operation is taking place at present.</P>
      <P>I am extremely concerned that as a result of the findings of this study there may be a shattering announcement from a boardroom in New York.  The company are now effectively controlled by the American bank, Morgan Stanley, in conjunction with Mr. Tony O'Reilly of the Fitzwilton Group.  Sentiment does not appear to be a consideration in their deliberations, as they have shown by their manufacturing of the new Marquise range in mainland Europe.  The Marquise range is a lower priced line of glassware which is machine manufactured.  This glass is now being manufactured in three or four different countries in mainland Europe such as Portugal, Germany and Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be admitted that the technology in the Waterford plant is outdated. I am asking that the Government, together with the IDA, give every assistance to update the equipment so that the company can compete effectively in the market-place.  The Government should monitor closely the company's problems <Col N="2297" /> and intentions.  That is why I am raising this matter in the Dáil today.  Specifically I am asking the Government to monitor what is taking place.</P>
    <P>Since the strike of 1990 there has been a very poor relationship between workers and management.  Short-time working has been the order of the day, inflicting severe financial hardship and stress on the workforce and their families.  An initiative is badly needed to improve the position.  The workers feel that their grievances are being totally ignored and that they are being starved of information as to the company's intentions.  The workers' conditions have been considerably worsened by the cuts in pay-related benefits introduced by the Government in the recent Social Welfare Bill.  It is bad enough for people to be on short-time work, which may involve working 12 out of 52 weeks in the year, but to have their pay-related benefit cut by £17 a week is adding insult to injury and there is very bad feeling about that legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government should repeal this section of the Social Welfare Bill while the present position pertains in Waterford Glass.  In addition, the Minister for Labour should involve himself immediately in creating a better understanding in the work-place.  A labour relations officer should be appointed on a full-time basis to keep workers informed of developments within the company.  I do not say that lightly, because there is a lack of information permeating through to the workforce.  Public relations in the company is extremely poor and they are very dismissive of the workers' wishes.  A labour relations officer should be appointed on a full-time basis to keep workers informed of developments within the company so that they would not read of decisions taken days later in the newspapers.  It is important that the whole atmosphere, which at present is decidely unhelpful, be improved considerably. It would be much preferable to act now than to try to retrieve what may be an impossible position at a later date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share Deputy Deasy's concern about the difficulties being experienced by this company.  Let me say at the outset that I agree that it would indeed be a major tragedy, not only for the employees directly affected but for the wider area if the company were to cease manufacturing in Ireland.  However, it is to be sincerely hoped that that will not happen.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Malley recently had a meeting with the company and the IDA have also had recent meetings with them.  The Minister will meet members of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union on Sunday next to discuss the situation.  It is clear to all concerned that the company face considerable problems.  Their major markets in the United States and in the UK have been in recession for some time now.  The company have suffered losses for a number of consecutive years.  I am somewhat heartened to note that the recently announced results for 1991 show some relative improvement, but not, however, to the extent that the directors can recommend the payment of a dividend.</P>
      <P>I am assured that the company are doing everything possible to improve their competitive position and to seek to increase market share in a declining market.  Their decision to source some crystal products outside Ireland for the American market has caused some concern. It would of course be preferable if all the company's products could profitably be made in Waterford.  However, I think that this has to be seen as an attempt by the company to fight back in a difficult market situation.  It is aimed at tapping into a new market segment in order to increase the company's overall sales.  This will help generate the extra business needed to bring the company back to future viability and profitability and ensure greater security of employment for the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not underestimate the task ahead.  If it is to succeed, a positive constructive attitude must be taken by all concerned.  I am advised that the company <Col N="2299" /> are preparing a development plan the aim of which will be to bring them through the current difficult period to a secure future preserving the maximum possible number of jobs in the company. I understand that all aspects of the company's operation are being looked at. Until the plan has been completed I understand that no decisions will be taken by management about the company's future and it would not be helpful at this point to try to speculate about their plans.  In the meantime the company need the patient support of all concerned, shareholders and other financiers, management and workers alike, so that they can regain as soon as possible their former vigour and profitability and their pre-eminence in this increasingly competitive market.</P>
    <P>I have asked the IDA to continue to monitor closely the situation and to keep me informed of developments.  While I still have concerns, I have an inherent faith in the commonsense and ability of both workers and management in the firm to work together so as to ensure the future viability of the operation and thus to preserve the maximum possible number of jobs in the company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Pádraic McCormack has been given permission to raise the urgent matter of <Col N="2300" /> Gaelscoil Dara, Renmore, Galway, and whether the Minister for Education will provide a premises for the school to operate in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mian liom tagairt a dhéanamh do Ghaelscoil Dara i Renmore, Contae na Gaillimhe agus cad tá i ndán di.  Bunaíodh an bunscoil lánGhaelach seo in 1984 le 17 páisdí agus múinteoir amháin.  Beidh 245 pháisdí agus naoi múinteoir inti i Meán Fómhair na bliana seo, 1992.  Tá siad i bhfoirgneamh sealadach ó thús agus iad ag íoc cíos trom air, £1,105 in aghaidh na míosa faoi láthair.  Tá fógra faighte ó na Brothers of Charity go gcaithfear an áit a fhágáil roimh 20 Meitheamh 1992.  Cé go raibh go leor cainteanna agus cruinnithe le roinnt blianta anuas leis an Teachta Frank Fahey nuair a bhí sé in a Aire Stáit, chun foirgneamh buan a fháil don scoil, níl aon dul chun cinn déanta ar chor ar bith.</P>
      <P>The parents, who are very much involved in this school, have collected £46,140.90 from the time of the opening of the school in 1984, £18,300 of which has been paid in rent and will never be recouped from the Department of Education.  The Department have paid £34,141 as their percentage of the rent. As I have said, the school board have been notified by the Brothers that they have to vacate the present premises on 20 June this year.</P>
      <P>We understand from the former Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Frank Fahey, that the Department's first choice is to locate the school in the nearby Holy Family school &mdash;sin scéal eile.  The Holy Family school is not vacant at present; it is being used as a school for mentally handicapped children. An earlier suggestion was that Gaelscoil Dara could move to an under utilised school, St. Brendan's.  This school is situated near a dangerous roundabout and we have since discovered that it is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Gaelscoil Dara has been built up from a very humble start in 1984 to the present numbers.  I can vouch that it is first class. Two of my own children had the privilege <Col N="2301" /> of attending that school and I take this opportunity to compliment the eight teachers and the board of management for the excellent educational service they are providing as Gaeilge.  The teachers involve themselves in after school and community activities and take part in drama and traditional dancing.</P>
    <P>The board of management would accept vacant rooms in the Holy Family school, which we think may be on lease to the Department of Education.  However, we want the Department of Education to give an undertaking to pay the rent for this school.  Parents cannot be expected to continue to raise £1,500 per month, apart from other running costs.  The parents already pay £20 per child and participate in other fund-raising activities. This is a far higher contribution than applies to any other school in Galway. The school are only looking for a permanent premises to continue with the excellent work by the Gaelscoil in Renmore, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity of outlining the situation in relation to Gaelscoil Dara.  He has given a lot of detail in relation to the school, its history and its problems. However, it would be no harm for me to deal with this situation from my Department's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school was established in 1984 when it got provisional recognition from my Department and it has gone from strength to strength since then.  I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the school authorities and everybody associated with the school, both now and over the years, on its ongoing success.  At present, the school has an enrolment of 217 pupils and a staff comprising a principal plus seven assistants.  It is accommodated in premises which are leased from the Brothers of Charity and the rent is grant-aided by my Department.  I accept that the school's ongoing contribution towards the rent has put strains on their resources. I am also fully aware from representations <Col N="2302" /> to my Department and from my own direct knowledge that the owners of the property have put Gaelscoil Dara on notice that they must vacate the premises and let me say that I accept completely the position of the owners in this regard.  This, of course, makes the provision of suitable alternative accommodation for the school an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a number of options in this regard have been under consideration in my Department.  First, however, it would be useful to outline current official thinking on the provision of permanent accommodation for national schools in major urban areas. As everybody concerned will appreciate, there has been a decline in the birth rate for some years past.  For this reason, the question of the provision for new school buildings has to be considered carefully especially when there is a possibility of other school buildings becoming available or the numbers of pupils reducing significantly.  Therefore, it is often very difficult to justify the provision of new school buildings in the case where the birth rate has been falling with obvious implications for school accommodation and having due regard to budgetary constraints. It is fair to acknowledge that most school authorities accept this situation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that discussions with other school authorities in Galway about the possibility of their accommodation being made available to Gaelscoil Dara must be carried out in a sensitive, reasonable and practical manner.  In these circumstances, negotiations must of necessity be protracted and have appropriate regard to the rights of the other schools involved.  Balanced against this, of course, is the right of Gaelscoil Dara to have reasonable and early expectations for suitable permanent premises.  These matters have been under consideration for some time and I accept there have been delays in bringing them to a successful conclusion.

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to the Minister for Finance.  I propose to call Deputy Michael D. Higgins on a matter appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity of raising the position that prevails in the Horn of Africa, indeed in southern Africa in general and Somalia in particular.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has been watching the reportage from Africa, transmitted by RTE, must be deeply concerned about the dreadful circumstances there and of the death and deprivation in Somalia, in particular.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is personally oriented to being positive in his response. The southern countries of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe which were traditionally the food suppliers of southern Africa are themselves in difficulty and that will necessarily have a knock-on effect on those to whom they supplied food.  At Community level there is need for an action plan to run until July 1993, at least, and to be supplemented by an emergency aid plan to deal with the worst aspects of the crisis in the short term.  I believe this is necessary, and I say so with great care, to avoid the catastrophes of 1984-85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Somalia, as I mentioned <Col N="2304" /> in my note to the Ceann Comhairle aid workers are asking for international protection for the supply of aid when it becomes available.  They say that the number of deaths is on a scale they cannot manage.  They are asking for the basics of food, water and shelter.  These horrific deaths, shortages and deprivation are taking place against the background of a decline in human rights.  This is a dimension in the Somalia problem.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the Department to address what has happened in Malawi and how this has affected Irish citizens.  Again, in another part of Africa, there is the suggestion of what is to happen in Eritrea in the context of the referendum to be held there.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will want to be as positive as he can but I cannot impress sufficiently the need at present, when international attention has shifted to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, with the necessary pullback in aid and investment in other parts, for us both nationally, as Irish people and as a member of the Community to address the situation in Africa as a matter of very grave urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly appreciate the Deputy raising this matter which has concerned the nation generally over the past number of weeks as we have been looking with concern at the horror story on our television screens.  Sometimes I feel utterly helpless in the face of this ongoing human tragedy.</P>
      <P>The current situation in the Horn of Africa is of serious concern to the Government and to the international community in general.  It is estimated that 23 million people are threatened by the effects of drought, food shortages and conflict.  It is clear that a major international relief effort will be required to avert a catastrophe in the region.</P>
      <P>The food shortages are immense.  The World Food Programme has estimated that the total food requirements in the area in 1992 will be over two million metric tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has responded both bilaterally <Col N="2305" /> and through multilateral organisations, in particular the EC which is a major donor to both long term and emergency food aid to the region.  In 1991 the EC Commission and EC member states combined provided over £80 million worth of food aid to the Horn of Africa in the provision of which, of course, Ireland participated.  Ireland also provided generous bilateral emergency aid.  The Horn of Africa has been the biggest single beneficiary of Irish Government bilateral relief aid, which since January 1990 amounts to nearly £2 million.  This month Ireland provided a further £200,000 in bilateral emergency aid, through multilateral agencies and Irish NGOs, to Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the region as the Deputy properly said, is not just one of food aid. In Ethiopia, despite the ending of a 30 year civil war in 1991, the devastated infrastructure, drought and large numbers of refugees and displaced persons have led to a situation where a large section of the population is at risk from infectious disease as well as from famine.</P>
    <P>In the Sudan the world food programme estimates that, despite an increase in food production, between seven and eight million people will require food aid.  The situation is compounded by drought and the continuing civil war, which has resulted in a large number of refugees and displaced persons. Relief flights to the south have also been hampered.  We welcome the recent decision of the Sudanese Government to allow the resumption of a food air-lift to the south for one month and wish to see this extended.  The need for peace negotiations to resolve the long-running civil war has also been stressed by us in recent contacts which the Irish Ambassador has had with the Sudanese authorities.</P>
    <P>There has been growing concern in Ireland and among our EC partners at the efforts by the Sudanese Government to forcibly relocate large numbers of displaced persons and refugees from camps near urban areas to remote sites.  It is estimated that around one million people are living in such camps around the capital, <Col N="2306" /> Khartoum.  Ireland has joined with its EC partners and the United Nations in making strong protests to the Sudanese authorities and has insisted that any relocation of the displaced must be carried out in a phased and humanitarian way which takes full account of the welfare of these people.</P>
    <P>The situation in Somalia is particularly critical due to drought, food shortage and the effects of civil war.  Over two million people, out of a total population of seven million, have fled from urban areas to rural areas in search of relief assistance. Ireland has fully supported and continues to support the United Nations mandatory arms embargo imposed in January of this year and the United Nations initiatives to obtain a halt to the fighting in order that the humanitarian assistance may reach the suffering civilian population. Deputies will be aware of the UN Security Council decision last week to deploy a unit of 50 UN observers to monitor the ceasefire in Mogadishu in accordance with the Secretary-General's report. We also welcome the appointment last week by the Secretary-General of Mr. Mohammad Sahnoun as his Special Representative for Somalia and will continue to support the Secretary-General's endeavours to bring peace to Somalia.</P>
    <P>Being aware of the Deputy's deep commitment to human rights and his outstanding record in that area, if he feels that any further action by the Irish Government would help the situation I would be anxious to hear from him in that regard.  My own view, as the Deputy is well aware, is that Dáil backbenchers' services are not sufficiently availed of in bringing the message of aid, hope and peace to those Third World areas the Deputy so properly addresses.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear a two minute statement from Deputy Mattie Brennan on a matter appropriate to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter on behalf of meter readers employed with the ESB, a number of <Col N="2307" /> whom have contacted me.  They receive 17p for reading urban metres and 43p for rural meters.  The difference between the two, which is 26p, is considered to be expenses.  However, on their P60 their overall income is taken into account and expenses are ignored.  Most of these people are part time and are paying class S1 insurance.  They drive hundreds of miles every week.  The people who contacted me in my constituency cover parts of Sligo and Mayo and others cover Leitrim and part of Roscommon.  They receive no car expenses whatsoever. They have also been debarred from receiving headage payments on the ground that their income is over the limit. However, if their expenses were taken into account they would be well under the specified amount of headage qualification.</P>
      <P>The ESB do not pay any PRSI contributions for them; therefore they are deemed self-employed.  Recently a person from Enniscrone, County Sligo, informed me he has a child who will be attending a third level college this year. That child will not qualify for a grant if his income from farming is taken into account with his income from meter reading. The reason I raise this very important matter this evening was to try to ensure that the 26p, the difference between what they receive for urban meter reading and rural meter reading, is not put on their P60 and taken into account for tax purposes; otherwise they would qualify for third level grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Labhraím ar son an Aire Airgeadais.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that all meter readers paid by the ESB are regarded for income tax purposes as being under a <Col N="2308" /> contract of service.  Accordingly they are subject to tax under the PAYE system. The decision by Revenue to treat meter readers as being under a contract of service, PAYE, rather than of service, self-employed, was confirmed by the Appeal Commissioners, in another case, on 5 June 1986.</P>
      <P>As regards the taxpayer specifically mentioned by the Deputy, I am informed that he is subjected to tax on his gross payment from the ESB and the gross amount must, therefore be included on his form P60.  An employee under the PAYE system is allowed a deduction from taxable income in respect of expenses incurred wholly, exclusively and necessarily in respect of his employment. The inspector of taxes has agreed to allow the taxpayer a deduction of £3,250 for the current tax year in respect of such expenses incurred by the taxpayer and his wife, who is also a meter reader. The question of PRSI is of course one for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The question of the income to be taken into account in determining the taxpayer's eligibility for headage grants is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture.  However my understanding is that the off-farm income limit for headage payments has been abolished. The taxpayer should however check this with the Department of Agriculture.  I think the Deputy will be able to assist him in that regard.</P>
      <P>I hope this answer addresses the Deputy's concerns.  If the Deputy requires any further assistance, the Minister for Finance has indicated to me that he will be glad to deal with the matter again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 1 May 1992.</P>

      <P>The position of the Government in relation to the agreement reached among eleven member states on social policy was set out fully by the former Taoiseach in his statement in Dáil Éireann on 12 December on the outcome of the Maastricht meeting.</P>
      <P>The implications of our adherence to the new Protocol on Social Policy agreed at Maastricht will depend on the nature and content of any particular measures which may be brought forward at the initiative of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that there are a number of important safeguards within the agreed arrangements.  I would like to enumerate some of these safeguards.</P>
      <P>The new Treaty contains a strong and comprehensive definition of subsidiarity, a principle which will have to be taken into account in the formulation of social legislation in particular.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Agreement on Social Policy, concluded by eleven member states, including Ireland, contains provisions which may be invoked if any proposals are brought forward which contain implications for the competitiveness of the Community, including obviously the conditions in particular member states vis-á-vis the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a requirement that the Council should have regard to the conditions in each of the member states.  The UK, our major trading partner, is not party to the new social policy arrangements. I acknowledge that concern has been expressed about the implications this could have for competition.  We expect that this factor will be fully taken into account by the Commission.  There is a further requirement that social policy <Col N="2248" /> directives must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal burdens on small and medium sized enterprises in a way which would hold back their creation and development.  We will be insisting that all of these requirements are fully observed by the Commission in the formulation of its proposals.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that the special arrangements provided for in the Protocol are likely to be used very sparingly as the existing Treaty provisions applicable to social policy will continue to be the norm, and will be used to the greatest extent.  I would like to emphasise in this regard that the pre-Maastricht social policy chapter of the Treaty stands and will continue to apply to all twelve member states.  It may be expected that the Commission will wish to have social policy arrangements apply to all member states, wherever possible.  I am confident that it will, so far as it sees it as legally possible and as likely to be a basis for acceptance by the Council, base its proposals on the pre-Maastricht Treaty articles that will apply to all twelve rather than on the separate agreement among eleven member states.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that some of the proposals for Directives which have given rise to concern on the part of employers, such as those on working time and on maternity rights, were based by the Commission on Article 118A of the Treaty which will continue to apply to the UK, as to other member states.  The Portuguese Presidency of the Council has indicated its intention of carrying forward with all due dispatch the processing of these two proposal and of others based on the existing Treaty provisions.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that our social policy commitments should be viewed positively and that the overall outcome of the two Intergovernmental Conferences can be judged as very satisfactory.  The agreements reached at Maastricht will help to advance the process of European construction. It has, moreover, been the policy approach of successive Irish Governments, endorsed by all the parties to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and</i><Col N="2249" /><i>Social Policy</i>, to strive for the fullest participation by Ireland in every stage of advance towards European integration. While differentiation in regard to specific aspects of Community policies may be appropriate in certain circumstances, any major opt-out from the entirety of major elements of integration would not be in Ireland's interest.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the position of Irish people who find themselves homeless not only in London but in any part of Britain is a matter of very serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>State aid for voluntary emigrant welfare organisations in Britain is distributed on the recommendation of DÍON &mdash; the British-based Advisory Committee on Emigrant Welfare services.  Despite the fall-off in net emigration (down to 1,000 in the year up to April, 1991) and the severe budgetary situation, the Government have maintained the funding of the DÍON committee of IR£0.5m. per annum for the last three years, having regard to the continuing needs of emigrants in Britain.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the housing problems faced by some emigrants, the committee has given priority consideration to applications from organisations or projects concerned with arranging accommodation for the homeless.</P>
      <P>Included in the list of approved grants in 1991 are several organisations catering specifically for the needs of the homeless. However, I should emphasise that nearly all the organisations funded by DÍON concern themselves with problems of homelessness and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> I would remind the Deputy that problems of homelessness in Britain are essentially matters for the relevant authorities in that country.  Recently the British Government announced the launching of an £800 million Government-backed scheme using public and private sector capital to make more housing available for the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that because of Exchequer considerations and the obvious high cost of accommodation in Britain, capital expenditure on the provision of hostel accommodation could not be funded from the DÍON allocation.  As it is, applications for funding each year are at least three times as great as the moneys available.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate the Government's concern for any homeless Irish people in Britain.  The DION committee keep me fully briefed on matters relating to the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain and in the circumstances the question of my travelling to London to review the situation does not arise.</P>

      <P>The Framework Agreement on Hours of Work negotiated under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided for a reduction of working hours by one hour in cases where the normal working week was at or above 40 hours.  This agreement has generally been implemented throughout the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any move towards making a further reduction in the working week would be a matter for negotiation and agreement between all the interests involved.  This was discussed in the negotiations on the <i>Programme for Economic Social Progress</i> but agreement was not reached on the issue.  The Programme states that the ICTU have indicated that they will, in <Col N="2251" /> the event of negotiations for a further Agreement, be seeking a general reduction in working time in the context of international developments and the economic and social situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not have any plans at present to commission a study along the lines suggested but the parties negotiating a future Agreement could choose whatever studies they deemed appropriate.  The costs and benefits of any further reduction would in any case be primarily a matter for individual companies and employments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86, and 88 together.</P>
      <P>An agreement was reached in 1988 between my Department, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, and the managerial authorities, which amended the rules for national schools so that, henceforth, the staffing for the school year will be based on the total number of pupils validly enrolled in the school on the 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>Criteria were established to allow for the appointment of additional teachers over and above the number warranted by 30 September enrolment, in schools which could be designated as developing or where my Department's guidelines on maximum class sizes were being breached.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have operated satisfactorily since 1988 and I have no plans to alter them.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with the agreement on staffing made between the Government and the INTO.</P>
      <P>In the case of Our Lady of the Assumption senior girls national school, Walkinstown, there were 338 pupils enrolled on 30 September, 1991, which warrants a staff of Principal plus ten assistants for the 1992-93 school year.  The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>The post of eleventh assistant is to be discontinued with effect from 31 August, 1992, as the enrolment on 30 September, 1991 did not warrant its retention.</P>

      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, national school going children are entitled to free dental treatment in respect of defects noted at health board dental examinations.</P>
      <P>Health boards are now adopting a school based system for the delivery of dental services to school children in preference to a demand based system.  The school based system ensures a more equitable distribution of the dental resources available.  This approach aims to examine all children in specific classes and to provide treatment if necessary. The classes chosen are usually first or second and sixth.  These classes are chosen with preventative treatments in mind and to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that, in this way, children for whom a service was previously rarely, if ever, demanded and those in greatest need of dental care, will be screened, advised of the services available, educated in dental hygiene and referred for treatment as necessary.  This development seeks to provide the optimum service to those in need, within the resources available.</P>
      <P>All eligible children can, of course, avail of an emergency service for the relief of pain which is available on demand.</P>

      <P>Following a review of his unemployment assistance claim, the person's claim was disallowed by a deciding officer from 10 July 1991, on the grounds that he had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for receipt of assistance.</P>
      <P>He appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office, and following further investigation by a social welfare officer, an oral hearing of his appeal was held on 30 January 1992.  On the basis of the evidence available the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer in the matter.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of further representations, the appeals officer proposes to have a further oral hearing.  This hearing will be arranged for an early date.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the national level of absenteeism in 1992; the way in which this compares with our European partners; if he will further outline the measures his Department have taken and intend to take to reduce absenteeism; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Absenteeism is a cause of concern because of its detrimental effects in terms of increased costs and reduced productivity and competitiveness.  The control of absenteeism is an essential element in managing an enterprise and is the primary responsibility of the management at each work place.  Enterprises which have adopted specific control policies and kept necessary records have been successful in reducing the problem.  I would encourage all enterprises to consider undertaking similar strategies.</P>
      <P>There are significant difficulties in attempts to measure levels of absenteeism due to the absence of a single, generally accepted definition and the lack of statistical data.  In addition, studies undertaken suggest that there are substantial variations in absentee levels between different sectors of employment. Various surveys undertaken in this country put the absence rate in the range 8 per cent to 13 per cent.  The difficulties are multiplied if one attempts to make comparisons across countries.  An EC survey undertaken in 1988 put the Irish level of absence due to illness below the Community average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, the Federation of Irish Employers is undertaking a major survey involving 1,200 of its member companies in an attempt to quantify the level of absenteeism.  I believe that this survey should provide very useful and comprehensive information covering manufacturing industry, business and the <Col N="2267" /> services sector.  I understand that it is intended to publish the results of the survey during 1993.</P>

      <P>Up to 1988, all of the proceeds of the youth employment levy were allocated to youth programmes and details of the allocations are set out in my Department's Vote in the Book of Estimates for each year in question.</P>
      <P>Under the Labour Services Act, 1987, the scope of the levy was extended to employment and training generally and since then has been used towards the funding of activities of FÁS, CERT and certain programmes run by the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Details of levy receipts are set out in the Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts.

      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990, put in place an improved framework for the general conduct of industrial relations and for the resolution of trade disputes. The Act has been in place for a relatively short period, and the provisions in relation to secret ballots and injunctions do not come into effect until July 1992. However the indications are that it is operating successfully.  There are, therefore, no plans at present for further legislation in this area.</P>
