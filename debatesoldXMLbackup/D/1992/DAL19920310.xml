    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The judgments of the Supreme Court have raised a number of complex issues which will need careful consideration.  It is vital that these issues be treated with insight and care so that their precise <Col N="3" /> implications can be fully understood. Because of the constitutional, political, humanitarian and other questions involved, this process will inevitably take time and it would be irresponsible to attempt to come up with instant solutions or suggestions.</P>
    <P>I have already invited the Leaders of the Opposition parties to consultations this afternoon.  I would like to assure the House that when these consultations are complete, and all the implications of the judgments have been fully examined, we will be able to announce our proposals to deal with this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Following his preliminary examination of this matter over the past few days does the Taoiseach see any need to modify the constitutional position in the matter as set out by the Supreme Court in its majority judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much too early to give a definitive answer in that regard.  I am certainly of the view that we must look again at the protocol of the Maastricht Treaty, and I will be discussing the details of that with the Leaders this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's inability to give a definite answer on that question, which I understand, may I ask him if he is considering any proposal to modify the provision in the judgment in regard to the right to travel, in view of the implications of that for the Maastricht Treaty and for the debate thereon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Government are considering the question of the right to travel as it affects the protocol in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am calling on the Deputies in the order in which their questions appear before me on the Order Paper.  Deputy Shatter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach received advice which indicates that dealing <Col N="4" /> merely with the Maastricht Protocol will not resolve the problem of the right to travel?  Is the Taoiseach giving consideration to an amendment to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution to ensure that nothing contained in that Article can be used by the courts to impede the right to travel in future?  Would the Taoiseach agree it is essential that in future alleged victims of rape or sexual abuse should not find, if a private decision is made to travel outside this country, that they are brought before our courts, and that there is a repetition of the type of court proceedings that took place over the past three weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is attempting to ascertain definitive answers to very complicated questions.  The question of the right to travel is being fully addressed as it affects the rights of our citizens to go elsewhere within the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the complexities he spoke of arising from the judgment of the Supreme Court more specifically arise from the nature of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution and that essentially it would be better if that Article was not in the Constitution thereby freeing the hands of this House to legislate for the termination of pregnancies in circumstances which this House would agree to?  Would he agree that that is the only clear way of avoiding the type of interminable court cases that are likely to arise regardless of how this House seeks to deal with the matter as long as the 1983 amendment remains in the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I must repeat that definitive answers are being sought here.  The point is that Article 40.3.3º is in the Constitution and we must consider the matter on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept from what the Taoiseach said that we are dealing with a number of very complex issues which, as he said, require insight and care.  Will the Taoiseach at this stage give the House the benefit of the briefing he and his <Col N="5" /> Government colleagues shared this morning in relation to the complexities of this issue, particularly in terms of Article 40.3.3º and the legal position that exists in relation to abortion as specified by the Supreme Court judgment and the restriction on travel?  Would the Taoiseach not give some details to the House in relation to the necessity for either withdrawing the Maastricht Protocol or substantially amending it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly try to be as helpful as I can at this stage &mdash; that is the approach I always adopted.  The withdrawing of the protocol is not the advice I am getting at this stage.  I will be discussing with the party Leaders this afternoon the details of the advice I have been given.  The question of amending the protocol certainly arises in regard to the problem of the right of our citizens to travel, and that aspect is being addressed. The Deputy will be fully aware that the Supreme Court decision has altered the situation in relation to legal termination of pregnancies here.  That is a very complex matter and one that has to be handled with care and sensitivity.  It will need much deeper study than took place at our short Cabinet meeting today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several Members offering.  Perhaps Deputies could ask brief questions and I shall try to facilitate all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the mechanism for amending the Protocol, if that were to be the Government's decision, and what is the Taoiseach's current thinking on the timing of the referendum to ratify the Maastricht Treaty as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter part of the question, it would be pure speculation for me to attempt to put a date on that before I have had an opportunity to find out whether we can get agreement, first on amending the Protocol and, second, on the content of that amendment.  The procedure to be followed would be to contact the legal department of the Commission and the permanent representatives in <Col N="6" /> Brussels and then to contact all of the other permanent representatives.  The matter would have to be agreed by all of the other 11 member state governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the distaste expressed throughout the country on the restriction to the right to travel, including the distaste expressed by the Taoiseach himself, would the Taoiseach agree to consult the Attorney General for the purpose of ensuring that, pending the determination of the complex issues referred to, no further application for an injunction will be applied for by the Attorney General in the name of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I shall take up with the Attorney General the question he has asked me to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is essential that the whole issue does not become intertwined in the debate on the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty?  Would he confirm to the House that it is unrealistic to expect that referendum to take place in June of this year, as was originally intended, and that the referendum will probably have to be postponed until the autumn?  Finally, will he assure the House that the necessary Government action arising out of the Supreme Court judgments will be taken in advance of the Maastricht referendum so as to avoid the issues becoming intertwined and so as to avoid the main issue of the Maastricht Treaty, being further political and economic union, being lost sight of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hope that the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty will not become intertwined with a debate on this question.  That would not be in the interests of this country or in the interests of Europe.  If anything should happen that the Maastricht Treaty were not approved in this country then it could not proceed for any of the other member states, either.  It is a highly important national issue that I hope will be dealt <Col N="7" /> with on that basis.  Consequently, I shall immediately move to try to determine whether changes in the Protocol can be effected and agreed in time to hold a referendum at the earliest possible date. It would not be my choice to have the referendum held later in the year, and I shall certainly endeavour to have it held in the earlier part of the year, before the end of the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the Taoiseach's earlier reply to me that Article 40.3.3º is part of the Constitution and therefore something that has to be dealt with as it stands, may I take it that he does not intend to agree to the kind of amendment to that Article for which Members of his own Oireachtas party are planning to campaign, an amendment that would seek to reverse the decisions of the Supreme Court?  Can I take it that the Taoiseach's Government will not agree to an amendment that would seek to reverse the current position as defined by the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not draw any such conclusion from what I have said.  I want to make it clear that the Government are in the early stages of consideration of that aspect of the implications of the Supreme Court decision.  I am moving in the first instance on the issue of the right to travel and the way in which we can deal with the right to travel as it is affected by the Maastricht Protocol. The other issue needs much more detailed examination and understanding and I am not in a position to say one way or the other at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that at this stage three things at least seem to be necessary: first, a definition of the scope of what the Supreme Court has characterised as &ldquo;limited circumstances&rdquo; in which a termination of pregnancy must now be legal in this country; second, a definition of the extent of the right to travel, and would the Taoiseach not agree with me that that is a right now dealt with anachronistically in <Col N="8" /> our courts and that it should be characterised as an inalienable, fundamental human right that does not need to be conferred by either a constitution or laws; third, that whatever resolution is found to those two issues needs to be applied to the Maastricht Treaty?  Furthermore, does the Taoiseach not agree that the wording of the Maastricht Protocol itself is another example of the kind of impetuous rush to decision that occurred in 1983 in relation to the wording of the offending amendment to the Constitution?  Is the Taoiseach aware that there is a very definite problem in relation to timing in that the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty is due to take place in June and that if we are to resolve the issue of the Protocol, so precipitately and without consultation put in by his predecessor, it will have to be resolved before the Danish referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to bring these questions to finality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree that it should be resolved before the Danish referendum.  I would have to reject totally the question of the wording of the existing Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, based on the best advice available to me.  Everyone was clear in his or her own mind, and I do not think it was disputed, that the wording of the Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, prior to the Supreme Court decision, in no way affected Ireland's situation.  The position is now different&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the Supreme Court decision that has been delivered.  The Supreme Court decided &mdash; and I am sure that Deputy Dukes has studied their judgments &mdash; that the right to life was superior to the right to travel. As I read the judgments, that is clearly what came out of them.  Consequently, that situation has to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to get on to other questions.  However, I <Col N="9" /> shall hear a final question from Deputy Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that whatever happened in relation to the Protocol he would seek agreement on an amendment to the Protocol.  Can I take it that the Taoiseach was talking about agreement from the high contracting parties to the Maastricht agreement?  I further ask the Taoiseach whether any contact has been made at this stage, at the level of his office or at ministerial level, in relation to the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Government initiated preliminary inquiries yesterday and again today in that regard.  On the question of agreement, it relates to agreement by the other 11 member states.  As the Deputy knows, the question is being debated in the European Parliament this week.  We will all be interested to know the reaction of the Commission.  The Deputy may take it that the initiative has already been taken to find out what procedures the Government have to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 5, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, could I ask a very brief question, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It will have to be very brief, Deputy.  The Chair is conscious of an element of repetition involved in these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has not been raised before.  In relation to the Maastricht Protocol and in the context of some of the EC member states whose parliaments have to ratify the Maastricht Treaty, is the Taoiseach aware that a number of parliamentarians have reservations in regard to ratifying the Treaty until we resolve the problems in relation to the Protocol?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that, if a form of wording is produced to amend the Protocol, that wording will be brought before the House for debate and will not be secretly <Col N="10" /> inserted as an amendment in the Protocol in the same way as the Protocol emerged in the first place, without any prior consultation with the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter question is not relevant at this stage because, as I am sure the Deputy appreciates, my approach to this matter from the start has been one of consultation with the Leaders. I intend to continue that consultative policy and to keep them fully appraised of the direction in which I am going. On the question of ratification by other Parliaments, I am aware of individual Members of Parliament who have been expressing various views about this attitude, but I am not aware of any Parliament, in total, expressing a view that they have any serious reservations in this area because they are waiting to see how we handle the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether any procedure exists to have the European Court examine the wording of the Protocol or indeed any proposed amendment thereof, to satisfy itself as to whether it affects the right to travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the question of asking the European Court to decide on such a matter would arise in circumstances in which the matter would be referred either by the High Court or Supreme Court to the European Court for adjudication.  That has not happened in this case.  Mr. Justice Costello made the point that he had not been posed that question during his hearing.  In relation to the Supreme Court judgment, because they decided the matters before them on the basis of domestic law, the question of referral to the European Court did not arise in their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Treaty &mdash; Article 169 &mdash; where the Commission itself, in given circumstances, could refer a matter like that where they feel that a member state was infringing parts of the Treaty in some way.  I am not too clear whether the Commission might perceive these circumstances as warranting such referral, nor am I travelling that road at <Col N="11" /> present.  I will keep an eye on what the Commission will be saying in relation to questions raised in the European Parliament today.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if it is intended to extend the term of the present Irish Commissioner to the EC beyond the original terms of appointment or if it is intended to renew the appointment upon termination of his term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An announcement on this matter will be made at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the term of office of the Commission expires on 5 January next.  Under the present treaties, persons are in the first instance nominated by the member states and are then formally appointed for a four year term by the Governments of the member states by common accord.</P>
      <P>At the Maastricht European Council last December, it was agreed that the term of office of the Commission should parallel that of the European Parliament. Accordingly, the Treaty on European Union effectively provides that, in order to bridge the gap to the next elections to the European Parliament scheduled for mid-1994, the term of office of the new Commission to be appointed in January next year will be for two years only.</P>
      <P>At the end of this period, in other words, beginning from January 1995, the term of office of the Commission will be five years, as is the case now for the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Maastricht Treaty provides for the European Parliament to have a greater role in the appointment of the President and the members of the Commission.  This new procedure will be applied for the first time in the appointment of the Commission whose term of office will begin in January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in their decision on the Irish Commissionership from 1993, <Col N="12" /> will, of course, take fully into account the best interests of this country and of the European Community, including the fundamental importance we attach to the Commission's pivotal role under the treaties.</P>
    <P>The distribution of portfolios will continue by collegiate decision of the Commission itself.  I should also mention, for the information of the House, that the proposal that there should be one Commissioner only per member state was not resolved during last year's intergovernmental conference and, in a Declaration to the Maastricht Treaty, it has been agreed that this issue will be considered by the member states before the end of this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the Maastricht Treaty is passed and in the knowledge that the Commissioners must operate from a European perspective, is the Taoiseach satisfied, as head of Government, with the performance of the Irish-appointed Commissioner?  If an extension of his term is to be approved, would it be the Taoiseach's intention to reappoint Commissioner MacSharry for the further two years involved, or might the Taoiseach be in any way nervous that he might return?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy be nervous, because I would not?  I fully endorse the Commissioner's very difficult role, if I may say so, in performing the task of Agriculture Commissioner in Europe in recent years.  The question of reappointment has not arisen yet.  We wish him every success in his continuing deliberations in the GATT; indeed, it would be in all our interests that that matter be resolved to our satisfaction and, of course, in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy as well.  He is doing a good job.  We will consider the other two years in due course.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect that a pattern will be agreed at the European Council to the effect that most of the existing Commission will be reappointed for the remaining two years, or does he expect that the pattern will be, in most cases that new appointees will be appointed for a two year period?  Has there been any such discussion to date at European level to establish some general pattern?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Attorney General occupies a seat at the Cabinet table although he is not a member of the Cabinet, that he has had new roles conferred on him by the Supreme Court, given that he is adviser to the Government and not to Parliament &mdash; as is the case with his British counterpart &mdash; and taking into the account the <Col N="14" /> fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has very considerable independence but no accountability, would the Taoiseach agree that the office of Attorney General has now evolved into one which should be directly accountable to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the Supreme Court have given the Attorney General any new role.  They have recognised that his role is as it was always understood to be.  Article 30 of the Consitution provides that the Attorney General should not be a member of the Government.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that his legal advice to the Government is independent, and not based on political considerations.  As Deputies know, independent legal advice is the best type of legal advice any person, or Government, can receive.  Indeed, the importance of his independent position has been emphasised on many occasions by the courts.  In fact, as far back as 35 years ago the Supreme Court ruled:</P>
      <P>... the Attorney General is in no way the servant of the Government but is put into an independent position.  He is a great officer of State, with grave responsibilities of a quasi-judicial as well as an executive nature ... while he is in office he holds and, if he is to do his duty and discharge his responsibilities, must hold an independent position.  He is specifically excluded from being a member of the Government, which again underlines his independent position.</P>
      <P>That was established as far back as 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the evolution of Governments since the year mentioned by the Taoiseach and the fact that the Taoiseach specifically said that the Attorney General not only has quasi-judicial but also Executive responsibilities, is it not time the Attorney General was given right of audience in this House or in the Seanad, so that, whenever the Attorney General is not a TD &mdash; and there were precedents in recent years, for example, between the <Col N="15" /> years 1973 and 1977, when the Attorney General was a TD and took questions in this House &mdash; he should have right of audience either here or in the Seanad so that he can be questioned on these executive duties to which the Taoiseach referred in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not comparing like with like.  In the period 1973 to 1977, the Dáil and Seanad Standing Orders were amended to allow for right of audience by the then Attorney General who was a Member of this House.  That is basically what the Deputy is seeking.  I have no plans to change that position.</P>

May I take it from what the Taoiseach said that he has not thought out his position as Taoiseach in relation <Col N="19" /> to the issues in question?  I am glad the Taoiseach had the interview.  The Taoiseach went into some detail in regard to the Shannon stopover and a commitment that a national sports centre would be built in Dublin, while his junior Minister responsible for sport was saying there would not be a national sports centre built in this country.  Perhaps the Taoiseach should be more careful in future when giving interviews.  If he is not prepared to discuss issues or answer questions on them in the Dáil I suggest the Taoiseach make it very clear in the course of interviews, that they are private interviews not interviews in his capacity as Taoiseach, and that he is just giving his opinion.  Getting the Government Press Secretary to follow those interviews by saying that the Taoiseach was merely speculating on eventualities is something we could do without.  It does not do the Taoiseach any good.</P>

      <P>As recently as the weekend people were looking at a different location and trying to put a proposition for a sports centre together involving private sector moneys and possible allocations from the lottery.  I hope they succeed.  I was involved in discussions with the various sporting bodies and I am aware that the FAI do not have a home and that they could do with a <Col N="22" /> stadium in Dublin.  I am also aware of the reconstruction that has to take place at the IRFU grounds in Lansdowne Road, that the seating capacity will be severely curtailed when their plans are carried through, and we are all only too well aware of the national debate in relation to Croke Park.  Bearing all that in mind, I believe Dublin should have a national stadium.  If that project does not go through it will not be because I did not support it.</P>
      <P>In regard to public transport and congestion in Dublin I am familiar with the proposition because as a former Minister responsible for transport I started to do something about it.  When the major road works are completed there is a contribution to be made by public transport in this city towards relieving congestion and from an environmental point of view. Those are the sort of indications and thinking out loud that I was doing in that article.  I am happy to discuss my views at any given time in this House.</P>

      <P>In the light of the Taoiseach's reply does he now accept that the interview with the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> was merely a piece of political flim flam and thinking aloud, making it appear as if the Government were giving a commitment to a whole series of projects when no commitments were being given?  Clearly the remarks of the Taoiseach stimulated debate.  In the context of the debate that was stimulated will the Taoiseach indicate to the House in relation to the Shannon stopover, the nature of the debate that took place between him and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications on the evening the <i>Dublin Tribune</i> was published when he and the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications appeared to be standing in the middle of Mount Street, waving arms and yelling at each other, while onlookers looked on somewhat embarrassed?  Was this the type of debate the Taoiseach intended to stimulate in dealing with the Shannon stopover?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 February 1992, accompanied by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance, Agriculture and Food and Labour, I met the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reaffirmed on behalf of the Government our full commitment to the consensus approach enshrined in the programme and in its predecessor, the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The meeting discussed a number of specific matters including the new employment and job-training schemes, the negotiations on GATT-CAP reform, the area-based response to long term unemployment, tourism development, <Col N="30" /> employment opportunities in the European labour market, the capital acquisitions tax, rural development, planning procedures and the roads construction programme as well as the most appropriate structure with political input to develop new ideas and proposals to deal with employment and unemployment. Copies of the joint statement which issued after the meeting have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The committee welcomed the renewed commitment of the Government to the principle of consensus through the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> All of the social partners welcomed, and indicated support for, the concept of some new structure to initiate new ideas and proposals to deal with employment and unemployment.  They stressed that the input of the social partners including the unemployed and young people as well as the political input should be assured and that the NESC may have a role to play in that respect.</P>
    <P>I informed the House on 6 March that the Government Chief Whip would be putting detailed proposals to the other Whips this week for the creation of an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment to identify and recommend proposals and measures to accelerate the creation of employment and alleviate the grave problem of unemployment.  The committee will be able, as recommended by the social partners, to have an input from representatives, concerned views, for example, the unemployed, youth and religious bodies and will work with the social partners through the NESC as well as having direct bilateral meetings if desired.</P>
    <P>I have separately outlined my views most recently last weekend on key areas I believe now need to be addressed urgently to provide a basis for additional job creation and to provide support for those who unfortunately become unemployed. I had in mind, in particular, the action to implement the recommendations of the Culliton Industrial Review Body, the elimination of disincentives to work in both the tax and social welfare systems, the fostering in <Col N="31" /> a practical and fully inclusive way of a modern enterprise culture, and the giving of new emphasis to the area-based strategy of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to deal with the long term unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline how the proposed Oireachtas Joint Committee on Employment will work?  Will he clarify the position of the social partners?  I understand they were looking for participation in a forum of this kind rather than the right to make an input.  How does he propose that this committee should provide for participation as distinct from input?  Given the way in which virtually every committee of this House is under-resourced and under-staffed, does the Taoiseach propose to provide for additional resources so that this committee, in whatever form it is established, will be capable of doing the job effectively, with adequate staff to carry out research and do the job quickly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect this committee to be one of the most important, if not the most important committee of this House. On the question of structures, the Government Chief Whip will be laying out the terms of reference to the other Whips this afternoon.  On the question of servicing the committee, I intend that each Department associated directly with job creation and the tackling of unemployment will have an officer servicing the committee.  In addition, I see the NESC as the consultancy arm of the committee in reviewing strategies in existing areas and producing new strategies and studies.  For instance, the first study I would envisage would be in respect of the mismatch in the Irish economy, the problem that large GNP growth in any particular year does not translate into jobs as we would expect.  Many of us thought there would be a better transfer into jobs.  There is a mismatch there which does not exist in other economies of the OECD.  NESC are the ideal consultancy organisation to do that work. <Col N="32" /> They are representative of all the social partners and I see a major input from NESC.</P>
      <P>The committee will have the full responsibility of calling in groups to make an input, either collectively or in a separate bilateral manner.  I have indicated that they can call in everybody, religious, the unemployed and any arm of the social partners.  There will be full involvement by everybody and the political process will also be involved.  One of the strong criticisms in recent years was that the only input by politicians in regard to the largest unsolved problem in the economy was in the political process in this House. They now have the opportunity to make an input in whatever way they wish. Consequently, I expect the committee to function very actively and to be able to take on board all sorts of ideas and initiatives and have them tested by NESC.  The Government will proceed with the implementation of the recommendations of the Culliton report through the structure already there.  There is a task force on tourism which this committee can call in, as well as other task forces.  It is a question of pulling together all the strands, with the political process in control. I hope it will make a very meaningful contribution to employment creation and tackling unemployment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect Deputy Bruton to start politicising a committee like this already.  I hope he will change his view as he goes along.  There are 93 reports in existence.  The only report I have mentioned in relation to this committee refers to an exercise which is well worth doing, that is, finding out why we do not get the jobs when we are producing good growth rates.  In 1990 we had <Col N="33" /> a 7.25 per cent growth rate.  Ten years ago somebody might have said that if we got an average of 5 per cent growth over four years we would be making a big indent in our unemployment problem. We have had four years with an average growth rate of 5 per cent but we have not got the jobs.  An exercise of the kind I have mentioned is worth doing.</P>

The Deputy can take it there will be action on the Culliton report.  We are fully committed to it and to its implementation.

      <P>The social employment scheme commenced in 1985.  Up to the end of 1991, a total of £315.618 million was expended on the scheme in respect of 75,504 participants.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for participation on the SES, one must be over 25 years of age and in receipt of unemployment assistance or in receipt of unemployment benefit for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>The scheme offers participants work related opportunities for 52 weeks.  FÁS do not maintain data on the proportion of participants who are engaged for a second time regardless of the intervening period on the live register.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the scheme offers worthwhile opportunities for a significant number of participants which would assist them in their efforts to find employment in the open labour market.</P>

      <P>I estimate that almost 30 per cent of the total budget for FÁS is spent on the social employment scheme, yet not one permanent job comes from this large investment of money.  Does the Minister agree that this is wise investment of such a huge sum of money when compared with the sum of £253 million spent by the IDA over a seven year period which resulted in creating 24,000 permanent jobs?</P>

      <P>It is important to understand <Col N="35" /> the purpose of the social employment scheme which is a scheme for the long-term unemployed.  It is totally Exchequer funded.  Many of the other FÁS schemes are ESF funded.  While it is important that we sharpen the focus on economic training I do not agree we should decide that the long term unemployed should not be dealt with in an equal fashion.  As the Deputy will be aware from her own constituency work this scheme has provided employment and training for people who have been without work for some considerable time.  It helps them to reintegrate into the community and to acquire basic skills for a work routine.  For example, this year 12,000 people will avail of the scheme.  It would be wrong if we were to marginalise long-term unemployed people by diverting resources unduly to those who are already funded from EC supported schemes.</P>

      <P>In view of the Culliton report and, in particular the section dealing with education and training which emphasises the importance of training to encourage prospects for long term employment, would the Minister not agree that perhaps we would be moving more in the right direction if we provided training which would prepare these people for work and try to convince reluctant employers to employ them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the long-term unemployed are availing of the various FÁS schemes.  The number of man hours involved in the schemes in the current year is in excess of 35,000.  What we are talking about is an additional scheme, one which is different in character from the FÁS training schemes, and it does serve a purpose.  It is my intention, as Minister for Labour, to investigate the efficacy and relevance of the schemes pursued by FÁS, and to continually monitor and look at the social employment scheme in that respect also.  The <Col N="36" /> social employment scheme has been a success in terms of helping long term unemployed people to reintegrate and get back into a work routine which would not be possible were that scheme not in existence.</P>

      <P>I have not asked that they discontinue the schemes.  It is true that the Teamwork fund has been reduced from over £4 million last year to £3 million this year.  I am pointing out that there are new schemes in existence which will meet the requirements of people for whom Teamwork was originally directed, those between the ages of 18 and 25 years of age or those who had been on Youthreach programmes.  The job training scheme is now ESF funded to a higher degree than would have been the Teamwork scheme.  That scheme is now available to those people and I am asking, in order that we get the maximum value from ESF funding, that we use the job training scheme in addition to the Teamwork programme for which there is £3 million.  If more applicants have applied for Teamwork schemes there is now available to them the job training scheme.  I am trying to ensure that people who are interested in that category would receive funding under a different scheme based on the fact that there has been a reduction of £1 million this year.</P>

I regard schemes involving help for the mentally handicapped as a priority.  I would point out also that under section 68 (1) of the Health Act, 1970, the health boards have a responsibility in relation to the education of the handicapped and in helping to find placements.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 30, 69, 71 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>FÁS already provide relevant information to Irish people interested in securing employment abroad.  Indications are that there are job vacancies in some member states which might be of interest to Irish job seekers.  Irish people do accept jobs abroad but there is evidence, e.g. from the NESC report entitled &ldquo;The Economic and Social Implications of Emigration&rdquo;, which shows that Irish emigrants fail to enter occupational categories appropriate to their qualifications.  Against this background, I would propose locating FÁS employees in employment offices of appropriate EC member states following official discussions. Such persons will also help out in relation to accommodation and acclimatisation generally.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the voluntary nature of this initiative and to categorically deny any question of forcing unemployed persons to take up such employment.  I think, however, in view of the serious unemployment position and the Single European Market come 1993 that I would be failing the young people of this country in particular, if I did not bring job opportunities to their attention and to assist them in every way possible when working abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What level of European Community funding will be available in setting up these offices?  Which European Community countries has he in mind when he refers to other member states, and what category of employee will be eligible to apply to the FÁS offices being set up abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We believe that the cost <Col N="40" /> involved in setting up and placing personnel at the National Manpower Offices will not be significant and we expect to get European Community funding.  There is already in existence what is called the SEDOC programme which is being revised at present by the European Commission. We are taking advantage of that in putting forward this proposal.  We think, in relation to the cost of this scheme to the Exchequer, that if we place as few as 100 to 150 people in Europe, that the scheme will pay for itself. Indeed, at a time when they had not staff in European Community countries, FÁS were successful in placing 2,000 people within the Community last year.  There are job vacancies in the highly-skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled areas.  I should point out that many of the job opportunities available in Europe at present are being taken up by non-European Community nationals.  When we look at the European Community and bear in mind the principle of free movement of capital, services and labour, this is the obvious approach to take in respect of those who wish to take up these opportunities. Unfortunately, the final part of the Deputy's supplementary question escapes me.</P>

      <P>First, I wish to welcome the Minister to the House for his first session of questions as Minister for Labour.  Having said that, I very much regret that he chose to ignore my Priority Question completely.  In reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Kenny he identified some of the locations where offices will be set up.  Would the Minister <Col N="41" /> accept that any measure to assist Irish skilled and professional talent in moving to jobs in Europe is in direct conflict with the need to achieve cohesion through a proper regional policy to direct funds into areas of high unemployment and that in trying to come to grips with the problem he has taken the soft option?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy that the two propositions are mutually exclusive; this is but one of a number of initiatives which we intend to take to deal with what we all agree is a serious unemployment problem.  My first initiative was to seek clarification in respect of European Community funding for the job subsidy scheme and the job training scheme which will be worth in the region of £70 million to us when those two schemes reach a conclusion.  My second initiative amounted simply to an announcement and I felt that I was stating the obvious.  Given that we have a labour surplus in this country, that there is a labour shortage in parts of the European Community and that job opportunities are presently being taken up by non-European Community nationals, we should not throw up our hands and say to people that once they leave this country we are no longer responsible for them because there is statistical evidence which suggests that those who are leaving are not getting the jobs for which they are well qualified.  I am simply suggesting that if they decide to go to these European countries we have a responsibility to make sure that we have a structure in place there for them to help them find the jobs that are available, to obtain accommodation and become acclimatised. This is only one of a range of initiatives which I agree have to be taken to deal with the unemployment problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree, given modern technology, that it should be possible for an unemployed person to walk into his local FÁS office here and obtain information on the range of opportunities which exist in a different country?  If people are to staff FÁS offices abroad, will the Minister provide a series of language courses for them so that they will be competent to deal with these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, given that this question relates to job creation, when I checked with my local FÁS office this morning I discovered that there are 300 approved places available under various social employment schemes but these cannot commence because of a shortage of <Col N="43" /> funds.  As I have been refused the right to ask questions in the Dáil, perhaps the Minister will check the matter for me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of what is going on in Mayo all the time but I will check the matter for the Deputy.  In relation to the need for language skills, the idea is that we will use European Community-funded staff exchange programmes, some of which have already been availed of by FÁS employees so that they will know what to expect once they take up places at these National Manpower Service offices.  Second, I agree with the Deputy that the ideal is that this information should be available in our own FÁS offices but our aim in revising the SEDOC programme within the European Community and placing people out there is to improve the access to information which we want people in this country to have.  As a result, if a person goes into a FÁS office here and a job in which that person is interested is available somewhere on the European mainland not only will they be informed about this but also, once they go out there we will have people to ensure that they are acclimatised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the five Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the United Meat Packers Group have been under the protection of the High Court since the appointment of an examiner on 17 February 1992.  The current crisis facing the group arises because of the major problems being encountered by the examiner in putting together a financial package to keep the group operational, <Col N="45" /> while he prepares a report for the court on its viability.  Yesterday his period of examinership was extended by a further week in order to allow more time for the ongoing negotiations with the relevant financial institutions to proceed.  I understand from meetings which have taken place at official level that an amount of some £4 million is needed to meet the group's immediate cash flow requirements.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have met representatives of the company who indicated the problems facing them and possible means of solving those problems. Also, officials of the Department of Finance have had discussions with the chief executive of the company and with the banks.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the negotiations have reached a very delicate phase.  In these circumstances it would be totally inappropriate for me to say anything that might jeopardise a successful outcome.  I am hopeful that all concerned will be able to overcome the obstacles involved and my officials have been instructed to give every assistance to this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister may not want to be specific, will he at least outline what the Government are doing to influence the banks in regard to this issue?  It appears that the difficulty lies with just one Irish bank in putting forward something in the order of £4 million.  A French bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, with one branch in this country, have been very willing to come forward.  Will the Minister say whether he has had any discussions with the banks in relation to this case and in regard to the money which is needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, my officials have had discussions not alone with the company but also with the banks.  They are making every possible effort to resolve the immediate difficulties, which will be resolved by an immediate injection of £4 million. However, in the longer term it will take <Col N="46" /> a considerably larger sum to resolve the difficulties of the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate difficulty seems to be one of cash flow.  Since the abolition of the State rescue agency, Fóir Teoranta, is there any procedure whereby the Government can assist an industry in dire financial difficulties, such as the industry in question?  Has that type of rescue operation been abandoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past week not alone have the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Finance been in constant touch and had meetings with the company and the banks, they have also had meetings with the IDA to enlist their support in this matter.  United Meat Packers are a commercial company which have been restructured over the past year.  They have been under the care of the examiner since 18 February and it is a matter between the company and the banking institutions with every possible assistance being given by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance, as well as the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned that this case seems to have exposed a pattern felt by Irish business that the securing of capital for working or other purposes from the Irish banking institutions is virtually impossible unless it is asset backed?  In the context of the worsening unemployment, does the Minister consider that the Government should give a higher priority to job retention? In the event of the main Irish bank concerned not being able to hammer out a deal with this company, is it the Government's intention to intervene to ensure that 900 jobs currently in existence are not lost as result of a short term problem?  Finally, will the Minister say whether an assessment has been prepared for him of the underlying soundness of this company and if he agrees that the problem is a short term one due to cash flow problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, there is a short term aspect which requires a sum of £4 <Col N="47" /> million but there is also the more serious long term aspect and that is why an examiner was appointed under the Companies Act &mdash; to try to sort out the company's problems in the long term.  The relevant Government Departments have given every possible assistance in relation to this matter.  As far as Irish banks are concerned, I understand that a considerable part of the difficulties of this group occurred outside this State with companies owned by the group outside the State.  It is fair for banks to get reasonable collateral when they are putting in very large amounts of money.  To look on the bright side, this morning the group tendered for a considerable quantity of beef for the intervention arrangement and have got the support of the major banking group involved, Banque Nationale de Paris, to support the tender.  It means that the group and the bank concerned are optimistic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was BNP in this case, but it indicates an optimism by the group and the bank that the company will continue in the short-term at least.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his ongoing efforts in this regard.  Will he agree that since Banque Nationale de Paris have agreed to give first charge on the company's assets to the native Irish banks, those banks could be accused of inflexibility and intransigence in regard to an Irish industry?  Will the Minister further agree that the amount being sought &mdash; either the short or long term amounts &mdash; is a mere fraction of the amount required of £550 million to bail out the Goodman enterprises over 18 months ago?  Finally, will the Minister agree that competition is vital to the livestock and meat industry?  If this industry, with 20 per cent of the beef kill and 30 <Col N="48" /> per cent of the lamb kill, goes to the wall, we will virtually hand over the monopoly to the Goodman enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>God deliver us from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons the Government Departments are making such a great effort in this case is, first, because of the importance of the group in the beef and lamb industry and, secondly, because of the social implications of the 900 jobs, many in the west.  I am not aware of any such effort being made in regard to any other company in the meat business and I am hopeful that the efforts of the various Departments and the IDA will encourage the banks to facilitate this company to continue as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As thousands of farmers are involved in the livestock trade and are customers of the two major banks &mdash; and contribute to the huge profits made by Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland &mdash; will the Minister and the Taoiseach approach these organisations to point out that fact to them?  They should also point out that it would be in the interest of not just the agriculture industry but the company involved and their employees to supply the money being asked for to keep the company going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already said, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Finance have been in touch with the banks concerned and the company.  The banks have been told that not alone are there very great social implications in regard to the plants themselves but there are social implications for the many farmers, who are customers of the banks, who supply the plants.  It has been made very clear to them that it would be in their interest also to sort out this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his personal involvement in <Col N="49" /> this issue.  It is vital that the examination continues and is completed as quickly as possible.  The Minister is aware of the importance of this company which accounts for 30 per cent of sheep killings and at least 20 per cent of beef killings to the entire industry.  In view of the many orders which the company have and must maintain, it is vital that the uncertainty is discontinued immediately.  Farmers should be given an assurance that they will receive payments which they are due and work should be recommenced in all the plants, including the plant in Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon, which is in the Taoiseach's and my constituency. It is absolutely vital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, 1989: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Bill concluded last Thursday week I was about to refer to the failure to implement certain promises made in 1983.  The principal promise was that a land authority would be set up on the dissolution of the Irish Land Commission, but, unfortunately, that authority was not been established despite the fact that Governments of both parties had an opportunity to do so.  The main function of such an authority would be to oversee the equitable distribution of land among the smaller landholders.  Nowadays when land becomes available on the market it is purchased by the person with the fattest purse.  Anybody familiar with land and income from land will realise that the man with the fattest purse is certainly not the farmer down the road with 40 or 45 acres of land.  The chances of such a farmer becoming the owner of a viable unit are very slim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fine to allow the play of market forces in the sale of most properties but, for the reason I have just given, that is distinctly undesirable when it comes to the sale of land.  A man with 40 acres is not likely to ever have enough funds to be able to compete on the open market. Unfortunately, it will not be his neighbour who buys the property, because his chances are just as slim.  Invariably, it will be an individual or a group of individuals who have joined together to form a company who purchase the property having decided to take the land out of agricultural production and put it into forestry. There is nothing wrong with what is being done by the forestry people so long as everything is above board and in accordance with the law; as is said in other parts of the world, it is a &ldquo;legit&rdquo; deal.  The people I blame for the present impasse are ourselves, the politicians, for <Col N="279" /> not ensuring at any stage since 1983 that the promises then made to set up a land authority were realised.</P>
    <P>In the past most of us paid lip service to the preservation of the family farm unit but, unfortunately, that was not backed up by practical application.  The consequences of that have been a further flight from the land to the cities in our own country or elsewhere, and to have our small farmers sit at home and collect the dole.  I am not looking for anything outrageous to support family farms, but it should be realised that the creation of one industrial job costs the State £14,000. A family farm provides full time employment for a farmer and his wife: the creation of two industrial jobs would cost the Government £28,000 and that amount could go a long way towards subsidising the purchase of extra land for a family.</P>
    <P>Even though we have done nothing about establishing a land authority in the past nine to 11 years, we now have a chance to redress the wrongs successive Governments perpetrated on family farm units.  Those wrongs can be redressed by the establishment of a land authority whose main function, as I have already said, would be to ensure that when land became available in a locality it was retained by local farmers for the production of food.  That would provide practical help for those to whom we have paid lip service for so long.</P>
    <P>From certain quarters comes the advice that too much land is used in the production of food.  I do not subscribe to that way of thinking.  Perhaps there is a surplus of food produced in certain pockets of the world, but we cannot say too much land is used for the production of food when half the world is starving. It must be borne in mind that people are becoming more &ldquo;green&rdquo; in outlook and that there will be less demand for food produced with a liberal use of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.  If the day came that the use of such aids were not required to the same degree &mdash; and it appears that it may come sooner than we expect &mdash; the quantity of food produced <Col N="280" /> per unit would be reduced greatly.  If we wanted to maintain the present level of production we would need more rather than less land, as appears to be the thinking in certain quarters at the moment.  It is not uncommon for the powers that be to make a forecast and then, some years later, to turn that forecast on its head.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission officers &mdash; about 60 throughout the country would be ideal people to oversee the operation of a land authority.  To my mind, the sooner we allow them, or other people of their calibre, to operate such a scheme the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Winding up the Land Commission is very obvious when one looks across the road at the &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; signs on the old Land Commission offices.  Throughout its history, the Land Commission were a source of anxiety and concern to a great number of people, principally because of the responsibility and the authority they carried.  Few people really understand what it means to own land in Ireland.  Land ownership is a very personal, sensitive and emotive subject.  Families and villages in rural Ireland have been split for generations over land acquisition and the dispensing of land.  The history of the Land Commission is littered with anecdotes about the way cases were presented, how the commission inspectors were treated and the way expectations in relation to the division and allocation of small pieces of land rose and fell.  The feeling for land ownership is as strong in Irish people today as it always was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies referred to the growing incidence of the purchase of land by people outside the State.  One of yesterday's newspapers contained an article on an Australian interest purchasing more than 3,000 acres here.  I assume that the section of the Act that applied to people from outside this jurisdiction applies to non-EC nationals in this instance.  We have to determine what is the national land policy of this and future Governments taking into account the EC requirement for certain kinds of production and the availability of certain <Col N="281" /> markets.  Along the west coast, from Donegal to west Cork, isolated, remote, rural areas of great scenic beauty, land has been acquired by EC nationals, as is now their right.  It appears that the ambition to own land in this country is held with equal strength by our EC counterparts.  If that trend continues, with greater wealth being placed at some people's disposal, we must then ask: will we be allowing a new form of European landlordism to take root here?</P>
    <P>I know that Irish nationals attempting to acquire property in any other EC country always faced difficulties, in particular in relation to the acquisition of land.  The Minister of State present should certainly understand the ways of life and attitudes of our rural areas.  Indeed recent conferences called by our bishops have highlighted not only the demographic trend, with the drop in population, the drift from the land and the drift from the west to the east but also its consequences socially, agriculturally and environmentally. That if further aggravated by the loss of milk quotas in many western areas, the existing buy-out scheme, under which those with wealth at their disposal have acquired small holdings with small quotas and have transferred those quotas within the country leaving the land idle or for planting, clearly illustrates that the nature of the terrain and its ability to sustain the fabric of rural life is being changed dramatically.  Other Members' appeals for the Government not merely to examine that aspect but to establish some alternative land authority structure are well founded.  Otherwise business people here, or those abroad with access to wealth or funds at their disposal will buy up every available square inch of land coming on the market.</P>
    <P>I must agree with Deputy Foxe's comments on the last occasion this Bill was discussed in regard to the soil survey being undertaken throughout the country, that the destruction of that material was nothing short of criminal.  Whether that material was intended for use to devise some type of land tax based on structured acres is immaterial in that it would have formed a modern, wellfounded <Col N="282" /> information base on the potential of various types of soils in different areas.</P>
    <P>Having raised the matter in the House on several occasions previously I read with interest that the esteemed Justice of the High Court, Miss Justice Carroll, has apparently made a recommendation in regard to the division of commonages which has been a serious bone of contention to very many farmers nationwide. I might add &mdash; and this is a personal view &mdash; I would have no wish to see our hilltops fenced off and divided.  It is a different story entirely with low land commonages. I understand the Justice's recommendation was that, where agreement had been reached with tenants, or a proportion of them in a commonage, an area thereof could be divided by agreement among those tenants; that where objections existed the remaining portion would obtain as a commonage between the objectors, with the right of division if they so agreed at a later date.  I understand that to be the general nature and thrust of her recommendation. Obviously it will be of continuing interest to farming organisations and those involved in agriculture generally.  The use of commonage has been individual and particular, in many cases, those who might object vehemently being those who might have made greatest use of a particular commonage by grazing sheep and reaping the relevant annual headage and premium payments per animal.  When replying the Minister might comment on the division of commmonages.  Indeed I remember raising the matter in this house way back in 1976 with the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Jim Gibbons, when he agreed with me that having animals on commonage certainly can lead to the continuing spread of TB.  However, where divisions take place, by agreement, it means that those involved can fertilise and drain those lands putting them to much greater use than had been the case before.</P>
    <P>The matter of areas of scientific interest, at present the subject of appeal, has been raised by many Deputies. Obviously if the EC wildlife and habitat directives are to be implemented by the <Col N="283" /> Government, action will be required.  I have letters on file from emigrants in England who attempted to dispose of their properties, some to Coillte Teoranta some to private individuals, others to organisations, who were refused the right to do so because of a possible change in the usage of the land, it being deemed to be an area of scientific interest by the Office of Public Works.  As a public representative I have been given details of the areas in the west deemed to be areas of scientific interest.  Certainly I am not competent to judge why many of them have been so defined.  Nonetheless I understand that a change of category, to environmentally sensitive areas &mdash; ESAs &mdash; would allow the Minister and the Government to make compensation of sorts available to those people wishing to dispose of their properties.  There is much confusion among farming folk about the difference between areas of scientific interest and environmentally sensitive areas.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this for their benefit.  If it is possible to redesignate an ASI area to being one of ESA, with attendant EC funding under the specific wildlife and habitat directive, that might be a source of agreement and be attractive to those wishing to dispose of property at present prevented from so doing, it being contended that if the property were to be disposed of it might lead to a change of usage.</P>
    <P>In his remarks Deputy Deasy referred to the potential of many of our hillsides. From a reading of earlier records it becomes obvious that at the turn of the century shooting of grouse was a popular activity along the west coast and indeed all over the country.  It was then possible to import grouse from Scotland but that is no longer possible because of fowl pest and so on.  It is fair to say that the Government actually pay farmers on Scottish hillsides to systematically burn mountainsides.  It is well known that the grouse population live in one kind of heather and feed on another, so that, if this is burned indiscriminately, it can destroy the habitat <Col N="284" /> and breeding cycle of grouse. Possibly that is an untapped source of income and wealth and could well lead to a new interest here if properly examined and exploited.  It can readily be contended that many of our hillsides lend themselves to that kind of treatment; the controlled burning of heather, under licence from the Department &mdash; bearing in mind the interest of gaming people &mdash; might well be worthy of examination from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission were given a very difficult brief.  It was not easy to be a Land Commission inspector.  The inspector was expected to rearrange and satisfy the claims of a great number of people with regard to a commodity which was not available in sufficient quantity. The theory was put into practice in a number of model cases that the Land Commission can produce.  In these cases the farm was consolidated and there was a reduction in fragmentation of the land and there followed an improvement in the ability of the farmer to derive an income from his holding.  Other divisions did not work out as well due to envy or differences of opinion, and villages and families were turned against each other because of the difficulties in trying to grapple with a social, personal and traditional problem.  Deputies used to receive letters from Land Commission inspectors and, depending on how the letter was phrased, the farmer involved could expect to get a portion of land.  There was a subtle way of conveying information, long before the advent of the computer and a smile was brought to many faces by a particular phrasing in some of the letters from Land Commission inspectors.</P>

      <P>They were.  Will the Minister comment on the position of the Land Commission staff who have nothing to do?  That is not good enough when we consider there are almost 300,000 people out of work.  These people have experience and are willing to work but they have nothing to do.  If one asks for a <Col N="285" /> file from a particular county it is very doubtful now that the file could be produced because of lack of staff and lack of co-ordination in the service.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a rural man who understands the difficulties.  On the dissolution of the Land Commission I hope a land authority will emerge which will do what we want with regard to land and its ownership in the future.  Our history has been intertwined with the land question for hundreds of years.  It is part of what we are.  I hope that what emerges from the dissolution of the Land Commission will not result in a great change in our traditional philosophy.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> When I went to primary school many years ago I went to a two teacher school where we left Mrs. Honan's junior section to go into Master Conway's during sewing time.  I must have been up to second class only when I went into his classroom one evening and on the blackboard was written &ldquo;The farmers of Ireland began to feel courage and hope when Michael Davitt founded the Land League&rdquo;.  That was in the days when parsing and analysis was done.  It should still be done, although it often is not taught in schools today.  The teacher had that sentence on the blackboard for parsing and analysis.  For some reason that sentence never left my mind and I reminded my students of it several times as I taught them about the Land League and the impact Michael Davitt had made on the <Col N="286" /> land scene here.  Were it not for Michael Davitt we might not have had the Land Commission and the Bills that were introduced as a result of the stand he took for the three Fs &mdash; fair rent, fixity of tenure and freedom of sale.  Later, under the Land Commission, fair rent turned out to be a difficult proposition for many farmers.</P>
      <P>We got the Land Commission because of the agitation in those years and the Land Commission produced one great writer, at least, in Hugh Leonard who luckily left the Land Commission to devote his talents to writing.  It is amazing that one of our leading playwrights, John B. Keane, wrote a play, The Field, based on the land and it made a great impact. The power and importance of the land has not diminished over the years.</P>
      <P>When I left college and went to Carlow in 1957, on the road was written &ldquo;divide Browne's Hill&rdquo;.  Browne's Hill, which was not owned by ancestors of mine, unfortunately, was a very big estate and there was agitation to have it divided for the small farmers.  It was eventually divided and many of the smaller farmers were set up.  Some of them did extremely well, and some, perhaps because they did not get enough land or they were not really into farming to the extent that they should have been, had to sell land, which was a blessing for those looking for sites on which to build houses.  Those farmers were criticised because that was not why they got the land.  On the other hand, they had to have an income to repay their loans.  It is easy to be critical when one is not in that position.  Even in the heyday of farming when we joined Europe and money seemed to be coming back in bucketsful, many farmers started off from a bad base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then prices have dropped. Senator Tom Raftery raised this issue in the other House and gave some startling figures relative to incomes.  The Senator compared 1985 and 1990.  Cattle prices were 10 per cent lower in the autumn of 1990 than in 1985 whereas the price of beef to the consumer was 18 per cent higher.  That is a startling figure; milk prices were 7 per cent above the 1985 <Col N="287" /> level in 1990 but butter and cheese prices were almost 40 per cent higher; cereal prices were roughly the same in 1985 and 1990 yet the price of bread was roughly 25 per cent higher in 1990.  Because of the price of foodstuffs the public might imagine that farmers are making a fortune but they do not realise that the price might drop for the farmer while it is rising for others.  Senator Raftery also mentioned that the margin between what the farmer got and what the consumer was paying widened in many cases.  For example in the case of steak the difference was 32 per cent, lamb, 46 per cent and pig meat 56 per cent.  With that sort of drop in income farmers were not as well off as it would appear.</P>
    <P>People often fail to realise that farmers sustain losses.  Cows are calving at present, but many calves are dead at birth and some of the cows may die after calving. This goes unnoticed and only those involved in farming realise the losses they suffer quietly.  An outbreak of tuberculosis can devastate a farmer and annihilate his herd.  Nothing must be more distressing than to see your herd being wiped out while you look on and have to wait for nine months or whatever length before restocking and then have to accept the possibility that the replacement herd may be wiped out.  That must be absolutely heartbreaking for a farmer, and all of us know someone who has suffered this fate.</P>
    <P>Some farmers are in difficulties with their repayments because they bought land at a very high price.  The banks seemed to contribute to the madness of spiralling prices and some farmers thought that no matter what one paid for land one would manage to repay the loan. That turned out to be a complete farce and has led farmers into all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have been abolished and I join with others in asking that the promised land authority be established. Land is very valuable and it is appalling that there is not a land authority to deal with problems arising out of the use of this valuable resource.  I realise <Col N="288" /> that staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food are very busy and should I get the opportunity I will raise on the Adjournment the issuing of regulations on the Abattoirs Bill because this is a very important issue.  In the motion I submitted, I have explained that Carlow County Council are down £75,000 as a result of employing a veterinary officer to fulfil the legal requirement but this is the fourth year the Government have failed to bring in the regulations.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Department of Agriculture and Food are going to do the work carried out formerly by the Land Commission in addition to carrying out their day-to-day work.  I sincerely hope the Department will not get bogged down completely.</P>
    <P>We do not know what may happen to farming as a result of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is very important to have a section dealing with land use.  If farmers are to be paid to do nothing with their land it will be very important to ensure that the land does not become an absolute wilderness and used for purposes other than its former use.  This greatly worries me.  Financial incentives may be given to farmers to stop production but after a year or two I can see these payments being reduced or ceasing eventually because taxpayers will get very tired of paying people to do nothing.  I consider this an abuse of land. when one considers the hunger in the world it is amazing that we can even think of what I would call a mad scheme.</P>
    <P>Some milk quotas are being sold out of necessity and others because the farmer no longer wants to continue with the difficult life of a dairy farmer.  He is tied down morning, noon and night and if he goes to a wedding or a football match the cows have to be milked when he gets home.  There is a possibility that some of our farmers will get bigger and that the small farmer will disappear.  At the risk of upsetting those who think I do not read modern poetry, may I again quote from the Deserted Village by Goldsmith, as I am always amazed at his wisdom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey,</P>
    <P>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay;</P>
    <P>but a bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroy'd can never be supplied.</P>
    <P>Our rural areas could be decimated and it appears this is the trend as smaller farmers will not be able to survive.  They will only survive if they will accept payment to do nothing.  Goldsmith was certainly thinking of something like this many years before we ever joined the EC.</P>
    <P>The role of Teagasc does not appear to be taken seriously.  We had rows some months ago about the closure of research stations but surely this is the time that research is needed most.  As farming is getting into more and more difficulty, should we not put more money into research to find alternative uses for milk, in particular, so that other products can be made of it?  The fact that somebody has been chosen to fill the post of director in five years time is very discouraging for the staff because no matter what skills they accumulate or talent they have, they can take it for granted that they are not at the races as far as the top job is concerned.  That should never have happened.  I hope sanity will prevail in the coming months.  The researchers have had to work under difficult circumstances and financial constraints, yet they have slogged on and done what they could for farming.</P>
    <P>The land authority could be given a leading role in regulating land and ensuring there is no abuse.  Farm pollution can damage our rivers and lakes.  It would be no harm to carry out research into the long term effects of the chemicals put on land.  The land authority could take an overall view on this valuable resource. The various Ministers have to look after different aspects of agriculture but it is important that we take an overall view and do not forget that land is a valuable resource and the land authority have an <Col N="290" /> important role to play in protecting our environment.</P>
    <P>I do not know how farmers can budget at present as their premium and subsidy payments are made at irregular intervals. The Government have difficulties in trying to live within their budget, but farmers have even greater difficulties because they never know when the premium payments may arrive.  As a rural Deputy the Minister is well aware of the difficulties being experienced by farmers in completing their application forms for the various schemes.  For example, if a farmer submits a tag for a heifer he may be disqualified from all EC schemes. I accept that the scheme is administered by the EC, but the farmers deserve something more sensible than the Mickey Mouse regulations that disqualify them from getting their entitlement.  As long as it was quite clear that the farmers were making valid claims and were not claiming for sheep dogs, they should receive their headage payments.  It is time the Government took on the EC and ensured that sensible arrangements are made to see that justice is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can be relatively brief on this topic because we debated it at the end of 1989 before the dissolution of the Dáil.  We are now back to dealing with the dissolution of the Land Commission. Many speakers have referred to the history of the Land Commission and the valuable work done in the 110 years of their existence.  We could say the Land Commission is a tale of two Deasys.  In 1860 the then Attorney General and the Chief Secretary implemented the Act laying down that the land of Ireland belonged exclusively to landlords.  The basic reason for bringing in the Act was to make landlords completely powerful over their tenants.  There was no idea of basic rights or the fixing of fair rents for tenants.  The fixing of rents was to be exclusively the province of the landlord under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agrarian protest against the Act brought about the setting up of the Land Commission which in its early days was <Col N="291" /> involved in fixing fair rents and the like. Subsequently landlordism was abolished and the Land Commission were involved in the division of huge estates among smaller farmers and tenants.  They then proceeded to acquire land to be used for the expansion of holdings or the transfer of farmers from congested western areas. That history is well documented.</P>
    <P>It was decided that the activity of the Land Commission was winding down during the eighties.  The second Deasy came on the scene as Minister for Agriculture and he spoke in this debate a short while ago.  It was his decision that the Land Commission should be abolished, but it was postponed by another election.  Then in 1989 the second attempt was interrupted.  I know that things took a little more settled at present but having listened attentively to the Taoiseach's speech at the Árd Fheis, one never knows when the minor partners might find that they are not so cosy.  I think he was suggesting that if they wanted to go they could do so at any stage.  Let us hope that this Bill will be completed before anything like that happens.  None of us particularly wants to face the country for a few months anyway and we will be quite prepared to see this legislation completed before that.</P>
    <P>The Minister, whom I congratulate on his appointment, will be interested in following up the vast amount of work that will remain when this Bill is completed. If my party have a reservation it is that there is no structure left when the Land Commission is finally dissolved to deal with land use as an instrument which could confront the structural problems which will remain.</P>
    <P>When I became a Member of this House in 1969 many questions were put on the Order Paper concerning land which the Land Commission had acquired but not distributed.  Many of these holdings were in my constituency and it was the practice regularly to ask what acreage remained in the Land Commission's possession and whether it was being let out rather than divided.  Representing an east coast constituency, we <Col N="292" /> had mixed feelings about the Land Commission in the seventies because it seemed that many of the small farmers in counties like Wicklow were at a great disadvantage when compared with some of our friends from the west who could get land much more easily from the estates being held by the Land Commission. The rule was that a farmer, in order to expand a small holding had to live within a mile of the estate and in exceptional cases that it might be stretched to two miles.  It had something to do with the speed and distance a cow could walk.  It was said that farmers who did not live within two miles of the estate could not drive cattle from their original holding to a property they might seek to acquire in a share out of land.</P>
    <P>This caused some problems for those of us who represented the farming community in Wicklow.</P>

      <P>They certainly were not Traceys or Ben Johnson; they could only move at a certain speed.  They could not be taken along the roads at present because they would either fall into potholes or be run over.  There are many stories about the Land Commission.  I am sure a definitive book will be written on the Land Commission and perhaps a television series will be made.  It would be most interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the weekend I watched an old black and white film, <i>Captain Boycott,</i> which featured many Abbey actors, some of whom are still alive.  It reminded me of the problems which are part of Irish history in former centuries.  The Land Commission played a spectacular role in settling land in Ireland and when it is dissolved there will be a void.  We will not oppose this Bill because when we were part of Government we would have been involved in proposing it.  I am concerned that there will be no instrument available to confront structural problems such as farm size, distribution, fragmentation and the age of farmers.  My party favour a progressive farm structure set up on an agency basis capable of <Col N="293" /> dealing with the problems I have mentioned and implementing a land policy. There is no other comparable instrument to carry out that policy when the Land Commission disappear.  Without their replacement, the Government are signalling the abandonment of a land policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in 1980 produced a White Paper on land policy. It was not simply a party document; it was a Government document.  It was radical and positive and contained very definite proposals for streamlining and enhancing the role of the Land Commission.  It contained proposals for surcharges on land purchases by non farmers which were very specific and detailed; assistance with the purchase of land for small holders, 20 per cent of the price to be provided for land holders with a £30 valuation or under; control of land purchase with non farmers not being allowed buy more than five acres of land without the consent of the the Land Commission; a priority list or a register of people for land allotment by the Land Commission.  Paragraph 31 of the 1980 Fianna Fáil White Paper on land policy states:</P>
    <P>Even with the introduction of the foregoing measures, there will still be a need for compulsory acquisition for as long as a substantial acreage of land remains under-utilised in the hands of owners who are not interested in its development.  It has been estimated that over 30 per cent of the land of the country is taken up by farmers which have shown no significant growth in recent years.  To abandon the compulsory machinery of the Land Commission would be to accept, if not encourage, bad husbandry.  Accordingly, in line with a policy which aims at the promotion of more efficient land use for agricultural development, the main thrust of acquisition in the years ahead will be directed at those lands which are substantially under-utilised or neglected and not contributing their share to agricultural output.</P>
    <P>That was a well worded document at the time. Paragraph 32 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> In western areas there are, additionally, structural and demographic reasons for the continuance of a programme of land acquisition and division in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It also dealt with the retention of the use of land bonds rather than direct financing and the purchase of land by non nationals.  They would have to acquire land bonds in order to acquire whatever land would be allowed by the Land Commission. Paragraph 42 states:</P>
    <P>The Government have considered whether the Land Commission as an institution should be abolished and they have decided that, on balance, the establishment of a second body to implement land policy would not be justified at this juncture.  The intention is, therefore, that the Land Commission will be responsible for putting the new policy measures into effect as well as operating the existing programme on whatever scale may be determined by the Government from time to time.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 46 of that White Paper reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government intend to introduce legislation at an early date to give effect to the new measures outlined in this White Paper.  In arriving at their conclusions, they have been conscious of the economic and social importance of land tenure and of the complex and sensitive nature of the subject.  They are satisfied that the policy proposals now being put forward will have significant economic and social effects and will make an important contribution towards creating the conditions in which Irish agriculture can develop further in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>If those proposals have not been brought to the attention of the Minister I would ask him to take the opportunity to examine them and to consider putting into effect some form of a land agency.  If those proposals were put before us in a Bill we would be in a position to enact the appropriate legislation.  The policy <Col N="295" /> was a forward thinking one and would commend itself to most people in rural areas.  We in the Labour Party would find much to agree with in a new land agency which would implement those proposals. Such an agency would receive the fullest co-operation from our party.</P>
    <P>There is a need to examine structures and to give some hope to young people who at present have no possibility of getting into farming.  Macra na Feirme members have often written to me &mdash; and I am sure to other Members of this House &mdash; telling of the difficulties they encounter in becoming involved in agriculture despite having pursued a certain path in their education.  There is not much hope of a future on the land for these people unless some type of agency is set up by the Government to ensure that proper arrangements are made to allow people to leave the land.  There are many bachelor farmers over the age of 50 &mdash; some without successors &mdash; who, if there was a proper retirement scheme would make land available for our young people.  I suggest the Minister look at that situation rather than bringing in a Bill, which puts an end to an historic and worthwhile body, albeit one for which perhaps there is little use at present.  There will be a void as a result of the demise of the Land Commission and this void should be filled as quickly as possible by means of legislation along the lines of the proposals of the Fianna Fáil White Paper of 1980.  If that is done we will be able to discuss how the resulting land agency can ensure that young people are brought into agriculture and the dwindling numbers involved in agriculture can be reduced or, at least, stemmed in the future.</P>
    <P>I am happy that we in County Wicklow are involved with proposals emanating from the EC which seek to stabilise the number of people in rural areas.  Pilot companies have been set up under the Leader programme and I hope some money will be made avilable in the near future to ensure that the stabilisation of the population in rural areas can be achieved by way of that programme.  It is only one initiative &mdash; the allocation is <Col N="296" /> reasonable for a pilot programme &mdash; but it is one I hope can be expanded in the future.  Allied to that type of programme, the Labour Party would be proposing that a land agency be set up to ensure that any moneys under the structural side of farm funds could be best directed from such agency.  Perhaps the Minister would be put in charge of some such agency &mdash; in former days we had a Minister for Lands &mdash; and have responsibility to ensure that the benefits and the ideas emanating from Europe, such as the Leader programme, could be utilised and expanded and we could put our proposals to Europe for additional aid and resources from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to dwell unduly on this subject.  We will not be opposing the Bill but I have given my ideas on the void what will result from this legislation.  I earnestly suggest to the Government that that void be filled.  Many problems which could have been dealt with by the Land Commission will remain after this Bill goes through.  I urge the Minister to consider the ideas I have put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As others have said, the enactment of this legislation, which seeks to abolish the Irish Land Commission, is an historic event just as its establishment by Gladstone's second ministry in 1881 was certainly an historic event.  That government who, of course, were dependent on the Irish Members for their survival, adopted this radical approach in response to the major social problem in Ireland at the time, the land question. The Irish Land Commission flourished during the remaining 20 years of that century and perhaps the first 40 years or a little longer of this century.  While they were subjected to a great deal of criticism there is no doubt that they made a major contribution to social development in rural Ireland in that an enormous amount of Irish land, which had predominantly been in the hands of large estates up to the turn of the century, was redistributed in an orderly way to the Irish tenant farmer.  This was a major step, although it was a long and tortuous process.  Most people would have criticised the Irish <Col N="297" /> Land Commission for being too slow but nevertheless they attained many of their goals.  At the end of the day they made an impact which is imprinted in the history, in particular the social history of this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kavanagh quoted from the White Paper on land policy which was published by the Government in 1980. I would like to quote from that document the first paragraph of the introduction.  It is interesting to note that a great gap now exists between the aspiration expressed in that document and the reality of having no land policy today.  Incidentally, that White Paper was laid before the House in December 1980 by the then Minister for Agriculture, the present European Community Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Ray MacSharry. I presume that this was the Government's and I presume, his policy at the time.  That paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>In Ireland, agriculture is of fundamental importance to the national economy.  Therefore an effective land policy must take account of the country's economic aims by ensuring the highest possible return from the use of the land.  Such a policy must, however, also concern itself with the national social principles as enshrined in our Constitution.  These principles dictate that as many families as practicable be established, in economic security, on the land.  In effect, this has meant that the family farm is afforded a special importance, not alone as the basic unit of agricultural production but also as a fundamental part of the structure of rural society.  The reality of the land holding pattern and traditional attitudes to the possession of land are further factors which must be taken into consideration in the formulation of land policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that that was a good beginning to the document published way back in 1980, 12 years ago.  While there have been changes of Government in the interim we have to admit that no initiatives have been taken in relation to a land policy.  Literally, it <Col N="298" /> was taken off the agenda following the publication of that policy document. While we are all to some extent to blame I would apportion most of the blame to Fianna Fáil Governments because they wrote this White Paper on land policy and made many specific promises in subsequent general election campaigns to introduce a land policy along the lines enunciated in that policy document.  As I said at the outset, we are a long way from what is contained in that policy document.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that we pay so little attention to the need for a land policy given its fundamental importance to people. Last year exports of agricultural produce amounted to some £3 billion.  Approximately 16 or 17 per cent of the labour force is employed directly in agriculture while 30 per cent of the labour force is employed in agriculture when we take allied industries such as food processing into account.  For some strange reason and against that background, we still do not have a land policy.  I often wonder if we have an agricultural policy which refers to production and to what we will be doing in ten years time in this sector which forms a major part of the economy. We do not have a policy which addresses this major national resource which is still in many minds our only national resource.</P>
    <P>Some amazing things have happened in the meantime.  We do not have a proper analysis of the 1991 census, which I am sure will raise our eyebrows, but the findings of the 1986 census, which covered the period from 1981 to 1986, showed that 32 per cent of our farmers disappeared from the land during that five-year period.  Strangely enough, the number of landholdings decreased by only 5 per cent.  On the census form, completed on 6 April 1986, 120,847 people declared themselves to be full-time farmers who depended solely on the land for their livelihoods, whereas five years earlier the figure was 32 per cent greater.  Therefore there is an astonishing development in relation to the profile of rural society.  I am sure that an analysis of the 1991 census figures will show that <Col N="299" /> a further 30 per cent or perhaps more will have disappeared from the land.  Mr. de Valera and others of his era often quoted the words of the Constitution, in particular as regards the need to maintain as many families as possible in secure employment down on the farm but this is what is happening all around us.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need for a land policy we have never addressed the age structure of our farmers.  It is interesting to note that in 1986 there were only 14,400 farmers aged between 25 and 34 out of a total of almost 121,000 full-time farmers; there were 23,000 farmers aged between 35 and 44, while 50 per cent of all landholdings and farms were held by people aged 50 and over, and that trend is continuing. We will therefore have to look at the 1991 census figures to discover what happened in the following five-year period but I predict here in this House this evening that we will find that the figure has accelerated with the result that the basic structural problem in agriculture is being exacerbated.  If we do not have enough young people with initiative and innovativeness, agriculture cannot survive, and therefore, the land must be retained by these people.</P>
    <P>In reply to a Dáil question recently the Minister informed me that the number of young farmers entering education and training is declining at a time when we are withdrawing finances from that area and from research and development in agriculture.  It is amazing that we allow this to happen out of neglect when we depend so much on this industry.  We have policies written down on paper and there are plenty of ideas; every second day we read good articles in our agricultural newspapers and our national daily newspapers about land policy and structures, but there is no will on the Government side to do anything about it.  There are good articles in agricultural newspapers and in our daily newspapers about land structures.  However, there is no will to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It was said a few years ago that the food industry would be the motor of our economy and that from it nearly everything <Col N="300" /> else in the economy would grow.  It was said it would be one of the areas of greatest expansion in terms of output, employment and exports.  However, to implement a policy of that kind we must have a correct land structure and land must be in the hands of people who will be able to make a success of that kind of policy.  Over 50 per cent of farms are in the hands of people aged 55 years and over and 10 per cent are held by farmers between the ages of 25 and 35 years.  That terrible imbalance needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are now new requirements under EC laws about nationals buying land here and it is not easy to put an agency in place to regulate the land market.  However, something should be done to improve access to land for young people who cannot afford to buy it.  Financial incentives should be given to young trained, educated people in agricultural disciplines or practices to enable them to acquire land.  The number of new people entering agriculture has declined from 6,000 a few years ago to fewer than 2,000 per year at present; more than nine-tenths come into agriculture as a result of family farm transfer.  Somebody who does not have land and takes an agricultural education to work in that area finds that the whole system shuts them out, primarily because of our land-owning problems but also because farms are passed on as part of the inheritance system and because there is not a pool of land for enthusiastic, trained young people who want to make a career in agriculture.  There is something wrong with our structures when a land pool is not an inbuilt part of our land-owning, land-working system.</P>
    <P>The age profile of new entrants to agriculture as a result of succession is very high.  I know a person who became an owner of land at 65 years of age, his father owned it until he was 90.  A very high proportion &mdash; not as bad as the example I have given &mdash; of people enter agriculture at an age when they are closer to retirement than to the years when one is innovative and ambitious regarding a new career.  It does not augur well for the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> There are about 170,000 farm holdings, 40,000 of which are held by people who declare themselves as having off-farm employment.  The figures for 1986 are the last we have in this regard, of the 120,847 full-time farmers only about one-third are commercially viable.  In other words, two thirds are either non-commercial, transitional, marginal or uneconomic. There is no policy to address the problem of a whole pool of land, a potentially wealth creating national resource, in the hands of people who do not have an incentive to give it up.  There is also no incentive for people who have the ability, training or education to work it properly for the wider good of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what is happening on the rural scene in the absence of land policy; I am thinking in terms of integrated rural EC development policies. Some of them certainly touch on land policy, use and holding but they all lack a certain vision.  In spite of all that has been said about it, it is merely an <i>ad hoc</i> system.  For instance, all the money allocated to the agri-tourism programme had been spent before the Department could process about one-tenth of the applications.  It was amazing to see the number of people interested in agri-tourism. It was trumpeted in this House how great a scheme it was and the tremendous potential it had in offering alternative employment to people in agriculture who were not farming viably at present. However, it lacked vision and after eight months in operation there is no money left.  If my information is correct we will have to wait for two years before the fund is replenished.  The Department of Agriculture and Food or any other Department, should be planning for the future to see how many non-viable farms could be made viable with the alternative enterprise of agri-tourism.  However, it was a piecemeal system.</P>
    <P>It is the same in regard to all the other programmes which will be introduced, there will be no long term commitment and nobody to say that in five years they will have preserved a certain sector of the rural population or contributed to <Col N="302" /> preserving it.  We must tackle this fundamental point.  When we put in place new sets of proposals which are fundamental to the future of the industry we must have proper planning.  I know there are faults in the market supports but, at the same time, it meant the transfer of about £1.2 billion to this economy.  While 80 per cent went to the largest and most successful farmers &mdash; I do not know whether that is true &mdash; 20 per cent went to poorer farmers.  There is some truth in that because the average family farm income in the west was only two-fifths of the average family farm income on the east coast in 1987.  Nevertheless, it was money coming into our economy and being distributed &mdash; however unevenly &mdash; through the economy.  Teagasc estimate that we will lose perhaps £450 million to £500 million of that transfer within the next couple of years as the Common Agricultural Policy &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; are put in place.  I do not consider them reforms. To compensate us for that loss of transfer there will be transfer through the rural development programmes which, of course, in money terms will amount to about half the loss on the market intervention side.  To make matters worse &mdash; I hate repeating the point &mdash; when they are implemented it will be in a piecemeal fashion.  The Government have no plans. They cannot say what impact the proposals will have on rural development in terms of maintaining the rural population, maintaining viable farms or giving people new livelihoods in enterprises and activities which are allied to agriculture but which are fundamental to owning land.  While the word &ldquo;integrated&rdquo; sounds good, there is very little integration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny made a very interesting point which again goes back to our dearth of a land policy, that is, the need for a new soil classification office.  The previous soil classification office was the first attempt to assess the land since Mr. Griffiths concluded his famous valuation of Ireland in 1847.  All our information on the size of farms and fields and the type of land we have &mdash; the term &ldquo;we had&rdquo; is probably more appropriate as it is very <Col N="303" /> much in the past tense &mdash; is all based on the survey carried out by Mr. Griffiths and the slightly earlier ordnance survey of Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the early eighties the the Coalition Government set up a soil classification office to reclassify all of the land of Ireland, tell us what the land was worth, how much was primary agricultural land, how much was appropriate to forestry, how much should be designated and environmentally sensitive and how much should be used for recreation. However, in one of our greatest pieces of policy madness we closed that office in 1987.  We were using Land Commission inspectors, who have since been made redundant, to carry out that work for us.  This office did not cost any additional money to what the Land Commission cost the country at that time.</P>
    <P>There was great opposition to this office because it was believed that the results would be the basis of a new land tax.  However, this was only part of what they were going to tell us.  They were going to tell us what we do not know about the land.  How can we have a land policy when we do not know the real valuation of our land in present day terms?  Instead, we have to refer to a valuation which is almost 150 years old. It is extraordinary that this can happen in a country which depends both directly and indirectly on agriculture.  If the Government want to do one thing which will be of benefit, they should reopen the land classification office.  I am not saying it should be opened as the basis for a land tax, but to glean information which we badly need.  I hope the Minister takes this proposal into account.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the farm retirement scheme.  I see in this additional measure &mdash; this is more EC jargon &mdash; a proposal for a new farm retirement scheme which provides financial incentives for a farmer over 55 years to hand over his land to a younger member of his family or to someone who has been properly trained. I sincerely hope the Government implement this scheme, which is one of the better parts of the Common Agricultural <Col N="304" /> Policy reforms.  However, I question whether it will be like the last farm retirement scheme which was a disaster and in many ways was tailored to be a disincentive to people to hand over their land &mdash; and the results are there to prove it.  Only a few hundred people availed of the scheme and every one of them regretted it.</P>
    <P>An old friend of mine who died recently availed of the scheme in the early seventies after its introduction.  It was one of the greatest regrets of his life because for the next 20 years he had to live on a small fixed pension.  It was only two years ago under the revised rate of means for qualification of an old age pension that he was able to get the minimum amount in a non-contributory old age pension of about £5 per week &mdash; and he was in his eighties at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Government should implement this new farm retirement scheme.  I understand it will be up to the member states to implement this scheme which will be co-financed &mdash; I think we will only have to put up 25 per cent of the finance. The scheme should be implemented in an imaginative way so that it will be a real incentive and give proper compensation to people who ought to retire. It should also be implemented in such a way that it will make a contribution to the well being of the country and to economic growth.  I plead with the Government to ensure that the scheme is comprehensive, contains enough vision and is sensitive to the needs of people who want to retire. If the scheme is successful it will make a major contribution to economic growth and the national income in the long term which will far outweigh the 25 per cent contribution this country will have to make initially.  We need to think in the longer term when we are dealing with such matters.</P>
    <P>If we accept the logic of the Common Agricultural Policy reforms we will be shutting out the contribution Irish agriculture can make to economic growth. During the ten year period 1980-90 the Irish economy grew by 22 per cent or 23 per cent in GDP terms.  I estimate that Irish agriculture &mdash; many people would <Col N="305" /> argue that it made a greater contribution &mdash; accounted for 8 per cent of that growth by increased output.  However, as a result of the quotas which have been placed on virtually every product, we will shut out for the next decade, or even in perpetuity, the contribution agriculture, perhaps our single greatest industry, can make to economic growth.  That is the reality, and no agricultural expert will dispute it.  Because production will be frozen agriculture will not be able to make even a 1 per cent contribution to economic growth over the next ten years. The contribution made by Irish agriculture to the economy over the past ten years &mdash; they were not good years for agriculture; they were not nearly as good as the seventies &mdash; was probably 8 or 9 per cent. This shows how badly askew our thinking and policies are in regard to land and agriculture.</P>
    <P>At the outset I praised the Land Commission and the historic role they played in the social revolution in Ireland and I do not take back what I said.  However, there was an enormous number of irritants and vexatious problems associated with the commission and one of these related to vesting.  In some cases land which had been redistributed by the Land Commission was not vested in the new owner for 20 years.  If the new owner wanted to sublet some of the land he could not do so because the vesting had not been carried out and the examiner of title in the Land Registry had not completed his work on it.  As a result, the person who had been allocated the land seven or 20 years previously was not the registered owner.  I believe the average delay in vesting land which has been allocated by the Land Commission in the name of the new owner is between seven and ten years.  On the dissolution of the Land Commission our priority should be the non-vested allotments made over the last seven to ten years.  That would be greatly appreciated by many people who have been allotted land which still has not been properly vested.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to land annuities on land purchased by the Land Commission in the seventies and early <Col N="306" /> eighties when land prices were very high. At that time the Land Commission were forced to pay £3,000 or £4,000 per acre, which was uneconomic and unrealistic. That resulted from gross over-optimism about EC membership and gross irresponsibility on the part of financial institutions in giving money to anybody who wanted it to buy land.  As a result, a totally inflated land market was created which ruined many farmers.  The Land Commission were very active in the early and mid-seventies, at the time of the land boom, and up to 1983.  Land was allocated to farmers at annuities of up to £1,000 per acre per annum.  So great has been the collapse in prices since then that there are many acres of land that could be sold today for the value of the annuity at that time.</P>
    <P>We have asked in this House that land annuities be rescheduled taking account of the fact that they were unrealistic in the first instance and that they no longer reflect the economic return from the land, which in the mid-seventies and early eighties was twice that of today. Something should be done now because tenants are finding it extremely difficult to pay the annuities.  I plead with the Minister, in dissolving the Land Commission, to solve that problem.  Relatively few people are involved but for them it represents a major problem.  The Land Commission have accumulated arrears from these people and there is no way they can recover this money because the economic resources are not there any more.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one final point about forestry.  Many complaints have been made, about afforestation, particularly in the west and in County Roscommon. I am not against afforestation. It is important that a greater share of the national land be planted with trees.  As has often been said, of all the countries in Europe Ireland has the lowest percentage of the national estate under trees.  If we are to believe the experts &mdash; one has to be careful about these predictions &mdash; the developed world will be very short of timber for the next 40 or 50 years.  A synthetic substitution for timber may be <Col N="307" /> found with the result that no economic value will be placed on trees, but trees are environmentally important and enhance the visual beauty of an area.  The problem in Ireland is that there has been a great deal of forestry on unsuitable land.  There are too many conifers on unsuitable lands.  In my county there are many raised and blanket bogs, and people perceive a relationship between raised bogs and poverty.  Nowadays this type of land is unique in that it is the last of its kind in Europe.  Indeed, all these areas are now the subject of ESAs.  The Department planted conifers on thousands of acres of raised bog.  That is an example of a totally inappropriate use of land.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are angered to see good agricultural land being planted with trees while marginal land that is appropriate only to forestry is not being used for that purpose.  There are tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of acres of good agricultural land in this country and our farmers, especially young farmers, would like to buy it.  However, they cannot compete for it because the banks are no longer open to farmers who want to buy land.  There is a gloomy outlook for farming for the foreseeable future.  The banks and financial institutions are buying this land because they are the only customers in the market.  They are paying what is generally regarded as the market price, and then they plant trees.  Very often they plant broad leaved trees, which is acceptable, but they plant conifers on good agricultural land when everyone knows they would grow on marginal land. That matter needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>What is needed is an afforestation policy, but distinctions should be drawn between lands that are appropriate and lands that are inappropriate to forestry. We should not lose the natural resource of productive agricultural land to forestry. One bad harvest in the United States or perhaps in the Ukraine or the great grain growing countries of Asia, could change the food production scene for several years in the developed world. I repeat that we need to consider carefully a policy of afforestation.  We need <Col N="308" /> to plant more trees from an economic and an environmental point of view, but we must be careful about the kind of land on which we plant these trees.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of making my contribution. I hope the Minister will take on board some of my suggestions.  Our party have no fundamental opposition to the dissolution of a body that have been redundant for ten years.  On Committee Stage we will have a good deal more to say about a replacement for the Land Commission when they are finally abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted for the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  When I was growing up in the sixties a large number of small farms were allocated to people from the west so that many families got the opportunity to become involved in proper farming.  The Land Commission were involved in taking over many large estates in my county, and in other counties.  As a result as many as ten new families were allocated land on the one estate.  The size of those new farms, including houses and out-offices provided, was usually about 45 acres.  At that time each farm was an economic holding.  Changes have occurred since Ireland joined the EC and for a dairy farm to be economic today it should consist of about 100 acres and 150 to 330 acres is required for any other farming activity.  Especially in the past ten years many owners of those small holdings have either retired or are about to retire, and none of their families are prepared to get involved in agriculture because of the lack of confidence in any future in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that the Land Commission are redundant and there is no point in them continuing but we must have a vision and proposals to put forward for the development of rural Ireland in the next 20 years.  There had been a lack of proposals to date.  It will be an indictment of all Members if we do not replace the Land Commission with a system that ensures that families are able <Col N="309" /> to provide for themselves on small holdings. Proper development will not take place if we do not introduce a rural development policy for alternative enterprises. Throughout the length and breadth of this country, but especially in the west &mdash; this is happening in my constituency &mdash; many young to middle-aged farmers are giving up hope for a future because of the proposals of the European Commission and Commissioner MacSharry.  The Government should produce proposals for alternative enterprises.  Through the Leader programme &mdash; about which we heard so much and which both parties in Government hailed as the saviour of rural Ireland &mdash; the rural development proposals and other mechanisms, people should be given the opportunity to develop and change their units to help them make a living from an alternative enterprise such as agri-tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor's comments about the retirement scheme are very true.  The scheme gave no incentive to many farmers to retire early to give younger members of the family the opportunity to take over the running of the family farm.  The scheme was a failure and any new scheme will fail if it is not realistic. The retirement scheme provided for a fixed pension and 20 years later the pension was still fixed.  Who thought up such a scheme?  More to the point, who introduced it in the House?  With all due respect, whoever was involved at the time was not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>The development of rural Ireland will not take place, whether under the Leader programme, the rural development policies or any other proposals, unless there are changes.  At the moment the Department of Agriculture and Food deal with some aspects of the development of the tourism policy while Bord Fáilte carry out inspections and make proposals on applications for a development grant. The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications told the House only two weeks ago at Question Time that everything was rosy and that the tourism plan for the next three or four years would be the saviour of the nation in that it would <Col N="310" /> result in a big increase in the numbers of visitors.  There is no point in having an agency working with the major tourist interests to increase the number of visitors to this country from three million to 4.5 million if the Government reduce their investment in the main organisation that carries out the work.  Why should that happen?  The Government are not reducing their take of the amount of money being collected by the tourist sector.  In each of the past five years that take has increased.  To ensure that rural Ireland is developed properly to accommodate the extra visitors, the Government, whether through the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications or through the Department of Agriculture and Food, must produce a proper policy for rural Ireland so that a percentage of the people can earn a living outside of farming.</P>
    <P>We are now proposing the dissolution of an organisation that helped thousands of families.  The organisation was based in every county within our jurisdiction &mdash; one of the recent &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; words in the Dáil.  Changes must take place in the two Departments I mentioned under rural development schemes or the Leader programme. I do not say that merely because the Culliton report recommended that in the industrial sector there should be an international and national arm of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Our tourism regions should be reorganised, perhaps reduced to five in number throughout the Twenty-six Counties, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications giving to the people in those regions dealing with tourism the overall task of dealing with all grants, applications and the work involved in redeveloping the country under those two headings.  I do not say this because the Culliton report advanced this proposal from their overview of industry.  I have been making this contention for the past four or five months arising from my interest in and investigation into how tourism is or is not successful in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> If this Government are in earnest about our rural areas they should advance proposals on Committee Stage of this Bill to change our antiquated system which is clearly not functioning properly, eliminating the overlapping of work of various Government Departments which leads to ever more duplication and greater hassle for applicants with, in turn, less progress on the ground in the expenditure of the moneys coming onstream from the different EC schemes to ensure the development of tourism in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil component of this Government over the past five years have been hailing the increasing number of tourists, applauding the extra numbers who have travelled here in the years 1987 and 1988.  I heard the new Minister engage in this exercise some three weeks ago.  However, she did not say that the summers of 1985 and 1986 were the worst we had experienced in 25 years.  The only thing for which she did not claim credit on that occasion was the change in the weather.  Those of us who remember further back than the Minister was prepared to go will fully realise what brought about that change.</P>
    <P>Many farmers who received land from the Land Commission have become involved in planting some of that land with forestry as an alternative enterprise.  Deputy Connor referred to the principal people involved in the planting of major tracts of land nationwide, namely, the banks, life assurance and investment companies.  While welcome in itself I contend that the next stage of that type of development has not been addressed by this Government. We must provide the requisite facilities to deal with mature timber at home rather than sell it for export, reimporting it in its final processed form to be used nationwide.</P>
    <P>I accept the philosophy of selling State assets as long as two things are done with the relevant funds.  No later than three weeks ago in the case of one of our food companies which had been privatised, a substantial proportion of those funds having been used to offset our national <Col N="312" /> debt, the remaining £35 million of shares it was agreed with the social partners would be sold in order to balance the books for the budget for 1992.  For the life of me I cannot understand how the social partners agreed with Government to sell off State assets for the day-to-day running expenses of Government. I should be delighted if somebody could answer that question.  If such funds are not used for the reduction of the national debt then they should be invested in, say, afforestation or the establishment of a company to deal with the proper marketing of our food produce.  Those are the only two areas in which funds from the sale of State assets should be invested.</P>
    <P>We have approximately 170,000 farmers here, many of whom have part-time jobs in an endeavour to make ends meet. If the proposals on the table in Brussels are implemented I predict a substantial number of them will decide to opt out of farming altogether in the belief that their holdings will no longer be viable.  In addition, we have a number of major co-operatives, some of whom have decided to float their shares on the open market and are now plcs, leading to their competing with their Danish and other European counterparts who have invested large funds in the marketing of their produce from factory farms across Europe.</P>
    <P>Germany has been a main contributor of funds to the European Community and the Common Agricultural Policy. German unification has meant that they have a major part of their united country in which to invest their funds, resulting in their having fewer funds to support the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT.</P>
    <P>Had there been any vision on the part of the Government, especially on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, over the past five years, of future events in Europe in so far as our EC supports were concerned, in circumstances in which 82 per cent of our beef would go either into intervention or be sold to Third World countries in respect of which we would receive export refunds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly is making a very comprehensive and far-ranging contribution.  I know that he has the capacity to relate it to the defunct Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My point relates to the small farmers who will no longer be protected by the Land Commission.  About 82 per cent of beef we produce is either going into intervention or for export refunds.  There is a proposal to reduce that to 68 per cent with the balance being made up with supports to the producer. I mentioned what happened in other countries and asked if the Minister or the Government have any vision with regard to investing pound for pound in our co-operatives in order to develop products to be marketed on the European markets. We have only a small part of the market for the products we produce while we are losing perhaps thousands of families because co-operatives who also rely on intervention, did not develop alternative products.  The Government should have got involved with the co-operatives and invested in them in order to develop new products and new markets.  This would have kept many thousands of farmers on the land.  The new Minister and the Government should reinvest the profits of food companies in which the State has a share &mdash; food companies which were established through farmer involvement down through the years &mdash; in order to develop other products, thus keeping small farmers on the land, farmers who are now deciding to get out of the business because there is no future in it.</P>
      <P>It is not up to Opposition Deputies to develop policies.  That is the Government's duty.  I hope changes will be made on the basis of my proposals in order to help small farmers.  The Land Commission provided many farmers with a start.  As a result small farmers could provide for their families.  They want to continue doing that but they cannot unless there is co-operation with the powers-that-be in the food industry in the production of alternative products and in researching the market opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> From my experience in agriculture and in this House I can say that we never had appropriate policies or provided enough investment in order to develop alternative products.  We can still keep many thousands of farmers on many Land Commission farms if we have the will to do so.</P>
    <P>Some of the Land Commission officers are to be given alternative employment dealing with Leader programme applications and implementing the Leader programme.  The county development teams in the west were allowed to deal with the Leader programme applications and to implement the programme but in the midlands and a little further out many of the counties were left naked in so far as approval of applications was concerned. The country as a whole should have got a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>There are county development teams in our part of the world who are not allowed to deal with Leader programme applications.  I conclude that the Department of Finance have control over some of the development teams.  They have not control in my county and in the surrounding counties.  It looks as if the Government and the Department of Agriculture agreed to allow the Department of Finance overall control of this work.  I do not agree with it.  I believe two people are to be appointed to my area.  That will duplicate the work. Where will offices be provided for them and how much will it cost to set them up? We already have development teams in the counties to which I am referring.  A decision was made to reallocate staff for the sake of reallocating staff without taking into consideration whether or not it would cost money, because the job could have been done by existing teams. Was it all because the Department of Finance wanted control of the overall set up?  I believe that was the case.</P>
    <P>The dissolution of the Land Commission was inevitable.  Land was extremely expensive over the past ten years and the Land Commission had to compete when the banks, the ACC and other financial institutions were free and easy in providing loans to farmers.  Small <Col N="315" /> and medium sized farmers acquired land at between £100 and £120 per statute acre.  Other Members have mentioned that farmers who succeeded in acquiring land have now run into difficulties with their repayments.  Indeed, I had a case no later than three weeks ago where a farmer with five children owed £6,500 in annuities and his grants and headage payments amounting to £3,500 and £4,000 were transferred directly and he got a note from the Department to say they were doing this.  He has no income.  I do not accept that Government bureaucracy should deal with people in that way.  I believe every problem can be negotiated.</P>
    <P>Many families across the length and breadth of the country are in similar difficulties.  Have the Government given any consideration to taking on board these services by restructuring, or possibly writing off, some of the moneys owing because of reducing farm incomes over the past two years?  I have no doubt that the Minister knows what I am talking about because, in fairness, these people have not a hope of paying off their loans.</P>
    <P>If the land acquired by these people over the past five to ten years is repossessed and put on the open market and sold to someone who can afford it, the original owner is left with no chance of providing for his family.  If the Government do nothing, the debt grows and eventually the land is repossessed and the person no longer has an economic holding.  He will then receive some form of social welfare.  That is the reality as I see it.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the figures with a number of farmers and if the farmers are not dealt with on a one-to-one basis with the Government willing to resolve the problem, the State will end up providing social welfare forever and a day when the land is repossessed.  Which is better in the long term?</P>
    <P>Any Member from a rural constituency is very much aware that many farmers who never received land from the Land Commission have ended up in financial difficulties as a result of excessive borrowing. However, to their credit the <Col N="316" /> banks and financial institutions have decided to restructure the loans and allow the family to remain in the family home and get on with living.  Because of developments in the late seventies many people got into difficulties in the early and mid-eighties, but I am sorry to say that the problem is on our doorsteps again.  I know of cases where people are working full-time on re-negotiating their loans with the financial institutions in the same way as they did before in order to save the family home from being sold. The financial institutions are prepared to look at the overall problem and allow the individual to start again and try to deal with the long term problem.  At least those people can live on the land.  Those who do not accept that this is happening are not living in the real world.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise to the Minister of State that he must ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to bring to Cabinet a proposal to deal with the people's problems today and not in 12 or 18 months time because at the end of the day if we do not deal with this problem, their land will be repossessed and they will be on social welfare for years.  Many of these people do not want social welfare, they want to make their own living if they can. Even though they are in receipt of beef and suckler cow subsidies they are working, which is in the interest of the family. The problem should be faced head on, because it will not go away if we do nothing about it.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should bring this to the notice of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>Many Land Commission officials did trojan work over the years and I thank them and, indeed, many farmers owe a debt of gratitude to them for the way they dealt with them.  Years ago there was a saying that if one did not belong to a certain organisation one would not have a chance in hell of getting an allocation of land.  I do not believe that was true, but it was said in rural parts.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may not know anything about that because migrants would not have been looking for land in his constituency.</P>

While the Land Commission did a good job, the legislation was not kept up-to-date so that they could adapt to changes in the eigities.  This was probably a missed opportunity.  Many Members have mentioned that Land Commission officials were still dealing with the assessment of land in the eighties. It was a mistake that it was not finalised to the benefit and knowledge of the country.  If that survey had been finished, we might have had a far better case in looking for a greater part of our country to be designated as disadvantaged. The whole country should have been declared a disadvantaged area, with a ceiling on incomes to prevent people, who did not require them, getting subsidies.  It is believed abroad that we have brilliant land, most of which should not be included in the disadvantaged areas, but factors not taken into consideration are the distance from markets and the cost of transporting our produce. Why was the decision made to stop the inspections?  It was a political decision.</P>

    <P>On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I will be opposing this Bill. I realise my opposition is merely symbolic because the commission has ceased to operate.  Had I found anything in the Minister's speech to indicate a Government commitment to issue a White Paper on land policy I might not be so opposed to this Bill, but there is nothing in the Bill to hold out any hope of this.  The Land Commission basically ceased to operate in 1983 and this Bill is merely a tidying up operation.  Hence I suspect <Col N="319" /> the Minister did not give a great deal of thought to the contents of his speech.  If he had given the matter any great thought he would not have displayed the degree of complacency and smugness which showed up at every turn of phrase.  He set out briefly what the Land Commission was set up to do and rightly praised the commission for putting the land of Ireland back into native hands.  However, he is not on such sure ground when he talks about the completion of land purchase. This implies that there will be no likelihood in the future of a commission being required to deal with large land holdings which are being accumulated both by nationals and non-nationals.  I will refer to this in more detail later.</P>
    <P>One could, of course, criticise the way the Land Commission worked and the policy of increasing farm size.  Obviously, the larger the farm the fewer people employed on the land.  We do not want rural Ireland to be a large rural slum, grossly over-populated and poverty stricken.  In the sixties and seventies those leaving the land could to some extent obtain work in the towns and cities or perhaps in Europe, but this is no longer the case, as we know from the appallingly high rate of unemployment here and the quite serious rates of unemployment in other EC countries.  It is quite clear that many of these people cannot find employment abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the commitment in the Constitution regarding the settling of people on the land.  He did not quote it in full but it is worth quoting.  We have in many ways a very fine Constitution.  Article 45.2 states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing:</P>
    <P>.... that there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that this aspiration or directive principles on Social Policy has been consistently ignored by successive <Col N="320" /> Governments.  What is needed in rural Ireland is the adoption by the Government of the principle of an unconditional basic income for all its citizens. This would replace the so called farmer's dole which is an impediment to progress in rural areas, as was pointed out by Fr. McDyer of Glencolmcille in his autobiography.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the exercise of control over purchases of land by non-qualified persons, namely, companies and EC nationals.  He did not spell out how this is to be done.  Is adequate legislation in place? He does not say so.  If not, does he propose to introduce such legislation?  These were roles which the Land Commission carried out very successfully. The Minister has not spelled out to my satisfaction what he proposes to put in its place.</P>
    <P>Many of us have been saddened by the purchase of land by EC nationals who have closed off rights of way and have prevented access to beaches and other amenities by both locals and tourists.  The fact that reciprocal arrangements are in force is of little benefit to us.  Stronger legislation is needed to replace the traditional acceptance of these rights-of-way in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the necessity to produce viable farms.  That is a rather narrow concept and should be replaced by the philosophy which would regard a small farm as only providing a partial income which is topped up by a basic income scheme and, perhaps, temporary work during the tourist season.  The viability of people rather than farms is what we should be aiming for.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to a very disturbing fact which is becoming more evident in the land business: that is that business and professional people have emerged, particularly over the past year, as the single biggest force in the land market, edging out farmers in the competition to buy farm land.  In some areas around large population centres, as much as 60 per cent of the farms which came on the market in 1991 were bought by non-farmers. These include people in nearby big towns who are often in business <Col N="321" /> related directly or indirectly to farming, such as butchers, livestock hauliers, dairy co-op executives, greengrocers etc.  They also include professional people who have been buying medium-size &mdash; 40 to 50-acre &mdash; residential holdings as country homes to keep a few horses for sporting activities for themselves and their children. Another category of buyers last year comprised emigrants who had businesses abroad, notably in the building trade.  Usually they are farmers sons who manage to fulfil a lifelong dream of owning their own farm back in their own locality.  Of course we would have no objection to this provided they were coming back to farm the land and not to let it.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any official figures it is safe to put the business professional buying at about 40 per cent to 45 per cent.  When one adds to this the buying by non-nationals, a figure which varies between 10 per cent and 20 per cent depending on the area, this puts farmers in the minority of buyers in the market for the first time.  This development, although not unexpected in the circumstances, is surprising because the business and professional buyers are by no means moving in for a killing in the market which has collapsed.  In fact there are very few bargains to be had because the price of farm land has held up remarkably well, despite the continuous battering of farming confidence throughout the year from the proposed Common Agricultural Policy and GATT reforms.</P>
    <P>Farmers could be said to be victims of their own propaganda because of their over-energetic campaigns against Common Agricultural Policy and GATT reforms, which convinced their bank managers that this was the end of civilisation as we know it; and it may have been the unusually high level of interest among business and professional classes that kept farm land prices up.</P>
    <P>Finally, where the Minister really goes off the rails and shows his inability to think this problem through is in his references to Common Agricultural Policy.  He makes the most amazing statement that the Government no longer <Col N="322" /> need a land policy because of the support for agriculture through Common Agricultural Policy.  On re-reading his speech I wondered whether the incoming Minister of State found it on his file, perhaps written in 1989, when the Bill was first moved.  Surely everyone in this House knows this game is up.  The EC taxpayers are no longer prepared to bail out Irish agriculture.  For the reasons I have given I will be opposing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation. I regret the passing of the Land Commission.  It is very easy to be critical. On the sideline we can all be critical of the player on the pitch but if any one of us were given a pair of boots I wonder whether we would be any better: generally not, but it always seems when one is at a football or hurling match in this country the best players are on the sideline.  So it is with the Land Commission, people are very critical of their operations and their slow progress.  The Minister would be well aware, as I am, that dealing with land and land ownership is a very difficult problem. Nobody was more aware of that problem than the officers of the Land Commission.  I held in high regard those with whom I came in contact in my own constituency and occasionally further afield, when relatives or friends of somebody in my own county, was in touch about land in a different county.  I always found them prepared to listen and to go into the background of the problems involved.  They knew the families and the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ownership of land is cherished in Ireland.  Maybe that is unique in Europe, but certainly the ownership of land was always prided, the inheritance of a farm from a father by a son was aspired to; a bachelor would pass on his land to a close relative or an in-law who was interested in developing the farm.  When the Land Commission became owners of large tracts of land, generally estates, its division was a difficult task.  It was difficult to get farmers to give up a parcel of land in order to gain another parcel <Col N="323" /> closer to their own homes so that the unit could become more compact.  The field of two or four acres had been passed on to them and it was their intention to retain it and hand it on to their descendant. The Land Commission officers had to deal with that problem which necessitated sitting down in the kitchen, having a cup of tea, and chatting to the husband and wife or the bachelor or spinster as the case might be and advising them that it was in their interest to give up that parcel of land.  They had to give the people an opportunity to consider the proposals put to them and to bring them gently towards concluding a deal, and they succeeded.  In the meantime large tracts of land built up and they were criticised.  I was as critical as anybody else and I tabled questions in the Dáil.  The Land Commission were understaffed.  In the lead-up to 1983 we were told the Land Commission would be phased out and that there would be no replacement.  That was wrong.  We need a land authority even more now than ever.  Some people say there is not much interest in the land and that driving around the country one will find a number of houses closed down. I accept that but that is because the farms are too small to provide a livelihood. Statistics indicate that the transfer of ownership of lands in this country is at an all-time low.  Because of the tax net people are reluctant to transfer ownership, yet, there is a tremendous interest in it.  I have known farmers with 40 acres of land and a 30,000 gallon milk quota who are anxious to procure, ten, 14 or 20 acres adjacent to them but, lo and behold, as the previous speaker said, a professional person from the local town or a foreigner outbids them.  German and French buyers are commonplace in the market and the local farmer, aware of the result of excessive borrowing in the seventies and early eighties is reluctant to seek a loan.  If we had a land authority, a unit which would give a livelihood to a husband and wife and their family, could be developed.  The person who puts up the parcel of land for sale is entitled to get the highest price but at the same <Col N="324" /> time if somebody with the knowledge and experience of a Land Commission officer discusses the matter with the owner it may be possible to reach agreement. In the past much time was taken up in reaching such agreements.  When very little progress was being made the Land Commission were criticised in that they performed a task for which they were never intended and were accumulating large acreages of land and setting it for ten, 15 or 20 years, but there was a background story to most of that.  Nevertheless there is still a considerable amount of land to be divided.  I presume that before the Land Commission are dissolved all the land on their books will be divided and handed over to those who have an interest in it.  I hope, however, that a land authority will be set up for numerous reasons.  As I have already said, while driving through the countryside, one comes across progressive farmers who have excellent buildings and green fields.  It is obvious that their farms are being developed; yet, around the corner one comes across farms which have been neglected, but there is probably a reason for this.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business - Equal Status Bill, 1990: Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill, 1990, was first published, by permission of this House, in the name of Deputy Spring on 10 April 1990.  Since then there has been something of a revolution in Ireland; at least, at first glance it might seem so.  In April 1990, the only people talking about the possibility of a woman in the highest office in the land were a few wide-eyed idealists dismissed by all and sundry as anything but realists, but the impossible happened and the election of a woman President opened a new window in Ireland.  This Bill, in large measure, is about opening that window further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two previous equality Acts of the seventies are aimed at outlawing discrimination in the workplace on grounds <Col N="325" /> of sex.  The aim and purpose of this Bill is to create a climate of understanding and mutual respect in which all are recognised as equal in dignity and rights.  In this respect this Bill goes further than any equality legislation we have had in the past.  It could hardly be more appropriate that we are debating this Bill now.</P>
    <P>For the last month, Ireland has been convulsed by a wave of emotion and agonising about the tragic plight of a 14 year old girl pregnant as a result of rape. Her situation and that of her family caused many of us in this House and outside to question values and attitudes that we have taken for granted but the Supreme Court judgment has confronted us all yet again with what can only be called a crisis of equality.</P>
    <P>It is possible to state quite simply that unless and until we address the issues arising from the Supreme Court judgment we will have created a new and oppressed minority in Ireland.  That minority consists of every woman who becomes pregnant.  In future, to put it at its simplest, no pregnant woman will be able to leave Ireland for any purpose without fear of being stopped, unless presumably she is leaving Ireland on a stretcher.  That is a horrific scenario and it is the inevitable consequence of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution whose promoters always claimed they never wanted to target individuals.  It is a classic example of the sort of double think and double standards which have permeated this debate since it began.</P>
    <P>It may seem fanciful to some to describe the abortion controversy as an issue of equality but, in essence, that is what it is.  The restriction on the right to travel within the European Community for purposes which are perfectly legal throughout the Community is something which a largely patriarchal society has imposed on some women.  Could you image the furore there would be if a court decided that a man wishing to secure a foreign divorce, for example, should be restrained from leaving Ireland?</P>
    <P>The effect of the travel restriction is that we are telling Irish women that we simply do not trust them.  Why should we <Col N="326" /> trust them?  We do not pay them, we do not promote them, we do not encourage them towards education and we do not even let some of them run something as complex and as difficult as a golf club.  Of course, we talk eloquently about apartheid or about injustice anywhere in the world, but when are we going to recognise the injustices we see every day here at home? It is not just women who are the targets of inequality; within the last year, for example, there was a great deal of media coverage of the fact that many Dublin pubs had a policy of preventing travellers from entering simply because they were travellers.  How many physically handicapped people could testify to the difficulties they have had in securing jobs not because of any lack of ability but simply because of the nature of their handicap?</P>
    <P>The background of inequality against which this Bill has been published is real and substantial.  The debate about equality has been going on since the early seventies but discrimination against minorities still exists.  There is, it will have to be said, a fund of goodwill in Ireland towards the idea and the principles of equality, yet, Governments have been slow to translate that goodwill into action.  Indeed, we have tended to follow rather than to lead in this area, often waiting for a European Directive before we act.</P>
    <P>The need for change in this area is obvious.  This has been highlighted in a number of reports, including the reports of the Council for the Status of Women and the Employment Equality Agency.  Yet, the Government have contented themselves with the appointment of yet another commission in this area &mdash; the Second Commission on the Status of Women established in the spring of 1990.</P>
    <P>When our Bill was published two years ago we, in the Labour Party, predicted that no matter how well intentioned and busy that commission are it will be another two years before there is a call on the Government to act.  In fact, there is as yet no sign that the report of the second commission is about to be published. Of course, even if it were to be <Col N="327" /> published tomorrow it would no doubt gather dust for another 12 months before Government action began to materialise.</P>
    <P>We believe that action is appropriate now and that it is appropriate over a wider area than that envisaged by the Government in their terms of reference for the second commission.  That is the reason we are calling on the Government parties to support this Bill, at least in principle.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I am offering tonight to allow a reasonable period to elapse before seeking Committee Stage of the Bill, if it passes Second Stage.  I can tell the House that this Bill has already been widely welcomed by many bodies involved in the rights of minorities.  Indeed, the second commission themselves have shown a great deal of interest in the Bill in their contacts with us.</P>
    <P>We sincerely hope that the Second Stage of this Bill will do more than carry on a debate.  We want to bring the debate a decisive step further by translating into action a set of principles widely shared in the community.  The time for action has now come.</P>
    <P>I will outline the principal features of the Bill.  The grounds on which this Bill prohibits discrimination are wider than those in any previous legislation.  It prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the objective of the Bill is to make discrimination unlawful, not only in the workplace but also in education, in the provision of goods, facilities and services, including recreational and banking and other financial services, entertainment, accommodation, transport, the services of any trade or profession and in the disposal of management of premises.  In the existing equal pay legislation, before a claim for equal pay can be established the person making the claim must make a comparison between the treatment afforded to a woman and that afforded to a man <Col N="328" /> in similar circumstances.  Under our Bill a comparison can be made between the way a woman is treated and the way a man would be treated in similar circumstances. This is known as the &ldquo;hypothetical comparator&rdquo; and it is a reform which has been long looked for by the Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>To give an example of this, it is a fact that many of the lowest paid industries are those which employ all women.  At least part of the reason for this low pay is the absence of male comparisons. Another traditional reason is the relatively low level of trade union organisation in all-women employments. Under our proposals, women in these industries &mdash; the contract cleaning industry, for example &mdash; would be able to make a case for equal pay with men if they could demonstrate that pay rates in the industry would be higher if men were employed to do their cleaning work.</P>
    <P>Our Bill defines three types of discrimination, direct, indirect and victimisation.  Direct discrimination is self-explanatory; in fact, it seems to be the case that many of the cases of overt discrimination against women, especially in the area of recruitment which were common as recently as 20 years ago, seem to have disappeared.  It is certainly the case, however, that there remains a high degree of discrimination against women in such areas as pay and promotion. Indirect discrimination can and does arise in situations where, on the surface, the same conditions apply to men and women but where the conditions are geared to ensure that a higher proportion of one sex can meet them.  For example, an employer who advertised for machine operators and made it a condition that all applicants had to be over six feet in height would be guilty of indirect discrimination against women unless, of course, the intending employer could prove that it was an essential height for dealing with the machines.  It is not that long ago since it was a common practice among employers to take a careful note of the women applicants for jobs to see who were wearing wedding rings.  Nothing in the job advertisement would specify a <Col N="329" /> bias against a married woman applicant but the bias would be there all the same. The Bill also defines as discrimination the victimisation of anyone who asserts his or her rights under the legislation.  This is a usual feature in legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against any employee or prospective employee on the grounds listed.  One of the effects of the Bill would be that any discriminatory terms or conditions of employment in any contract or collective agreement would,<i>ipso facto,</i> be null and void.  Every contract of employment will be deemed to contain an equality clause which will become a guarantee to the employee that he or she is not and cannot be discriminated against.  It will also be illegal under the Bill to discriminate in the terms of membership of any partnership or trade union, employers' organisation or any professional or trade organisation or to discriminate in the terms of the benefits attaching to such membership.  At present, to take just one example, the barristers' profession forces people over a certain age to pay higher entrance or registration fees.  This would become illegal under the Bill; so would the unspoken attitude, still present in some craft unions, which has ensured that only a tiny proportion of women succeed in becoming apprentices in quite a wide range of crafts.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises that there are certain situations in which people with a handicap may have to be refused particular jobs because the nature of the handicap may make it impossible for them to undertake the duties associated with the job.  However, in general terms it will be illegal to discriminate against people on the grounds of handicap and it will also be illegal to discriminate against a handicapped person in any situation where the special needs of that person can be met without undue hardship.  Too many employers automatically reject people in wheelchairs, for example, when relatively minor adjustments to the working environment would make employment not only possible but readily <Col N="330" /> practicable.  This Bill will enable people with a handicap to challenge employers about why they would not be prepared to make such changes.</P>
    <P>Disputes about equality in employment will be referred under the Bill to the Labour Court.  At present such disputes must be referred within six months of the commencement of the alleged inequality but we propose a substantial improvement under our Bill whereby the dispute need only be referred within six months of the date it ended.  Procedures for dealing with disputes are simplified in this Bill.  There is a new provision to assist a person who believes he or she has been discriminated against.  They will be given a standard form on which to put questions to the employer about the reasons for the treatment which they believe to be discriminatory and on which the employer can reply.  These questions and answers will be admissible in evidence before the Labour Court and the court will be entitled under the Bill to draw appropriate inferences from any evasion or equivocation on the part of the employers in their replies and, likewise, to draw inferences from the failure of the employees to reply to those queries when that turns out to be the position.</P>
    <P>At present the burden of proof in equality cases is on the employee.  The Bill proposes to transfer that burden of proof to the employer who will have to establish that his actions complained about were non-discriminatory.  This is not a unique provision.  For example, in unfair dismissals cases the employer also carries the onus of establishing that a dismissal is fair.  The Bill also includes provision for appeals and enforcement of equality recommendations.  In cases where determinations made by the Labour Court are not carried out they can acquire the same status as a determination of the Circuit Court and can be enforced accordingly. This is a much simplified version of the present procedure.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill it will be unlawful for anyone involved in the provision of goods, facilities and services to discriminate against anyone on the grounds of sex, marital or parental status, sexual <Col N="331" /> orientation, religion, age, handicap, race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origins, including membership of the travelling community.  A discrimination in this context can include the refusal of access to the goods or services, or failure to provide them, or the provision of inferior quality or service. The following are examples of the facilities and services to which the Bill applies: access to or use of any public place; accommodation in a hotel, guesthouse and so on; banking, insurance, loans, grants, credit or finance; entertainment, recreation or refreshment; education facilities; transport or travel facilities and the services of any profession or trade or any public or local authority.  There are a number of specific examples of areas which require to be addressed and are addressed by this provision.</P>
    <P>I referred to the practice of barring travellers from public houses simply because they are travellers.  It is well known too that anyone whose surname suggests membership of the travelling community will have great difficulty in securing bank loans or insurance policies. The Bill proposes to compel the providers of services, ranging from recreational services to financial services, to apply the same rules to everybody looking for those services, and no more or no less.  This Bill will not force pubs to serve anyone who is violent or troublesome whether they are members of the travelling community or members of the settled community.  It must be said that members of the travelling community by no means hold the monopoly on violence or causing trouble or problems in pubs; the settled community are as equally guilty in that respect on occasion.  Neither will the Bill force anyone to extend credit to people who have a bad track record of repayment.  What it will do is force companies to re-examine their attitudes and end any discrimination based on ethnic status or gender or any of the other labels we all too often attach to people.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make it unlawful for a person who has power to dispose of premises or who is involved in the management <Col N="332" /> of premises to discriminate in the terms on which he offers those premises for disposal, or in relation to aspects of the tenancy, or in rejecting or accepting applications for the premises or in his treatment of individuals in relation to lists of people in need of that kind of premises.</P>
    <P>It will be unlawful also for any educational establishment in receipt of public funds to discriminate in terms of admission policy or in the way it treats individuals who apply for admission or in the way it treats individuals after they have been admitted.  Exceptions are made in the Bill for single sex schools and schools which admit members of one nationality or one religion only. However, these exceptions apply to admission only.  Thus, a girls' school will not be compelled to admit boys but will be obliged to offer the same facilities and subject options as are provided for boys in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>All complaints relating to discrimination outside the employment field are to be dealt with by way of civil proceedings for damages in the same way as any other claim in tort.  In certain cases damages may include compensation for injury to the feelings of an individual.  A principal can be liable for acts carried out by his agent and an employer can be liable for any act carried out by his employee.  The Bill will also make it unlawful for a person to procure another person to do anything which constitutes unlawful discrimination.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the Constitution guarantees the right of citizens to form private associations and clubs. That is a right which should not be lightly interfered with.  Accordingly, the Bill does not seek to impose conditions on such clubs which would be in conflict with the constitutional right of association. However, there are two provisions in the Bill which apply to any sporting or recreational clubs which discriminate on the grounds of sex.  The first will make it unlawful to give any payment or grant out of public funds to any such club.  The second is that no such club may apply for registration or the renewal of registration <Col N="333" /> under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904 to 1981.  As the House will be aware, a club not registered under these Acts is not permitted to sell or supply excisable liquors; in other words, is not allowed to run a bar.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the Employment Equality Agency would be renamed the Equal Status Agency and their powers would be widened.  They would have the general functions of working towards the elimination of discrimniation, drawing up codes of practice, assisting individuals to press claims under the Bill, promoting equality of opportunity and advising the Minister for Labour on the working of the legislation with a view to making it as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to outlaw discriminatory advertising.  Under it the Labour Court will be allowed to award interest on any compensation awarded. Employers can be obliged to display notices containing information on equality in prominent locations in the workplace.</P>
    <P>There is a number of exceptions in the Bill.  In general terms, the purpose of these exceptions is to ensure that positive discrimination or affirmative action aimed at ensuring greater equality in the long run is allowed and encouraged; that preferential treatment in particular cases of need is recognised, for example, preferential treatment in the case of pregnancy, or special action to recognise the paticular needs of the handicapped, the elderly or members of the travelling community. They seek to ensure that people are not penalised for acting in good faith and without an intention to discriminate and that people are not forced to take unreasonable actions.  For example, it would not be unlawful to restrict eligibility to Irish national teams to Irish citizens and so on.  It is not the purpose of the Bill to penalise the ICA, the Catholic Boy Scouts or Shamrock Rovers.  Exceptions have been carefully drafted with the aim of encouraging equality and ensuring that the dignity of every citizen is fully realised.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which is aimed at the promotion of equality.  The Labour Party <Col N="334" /> believe that this is an aspiration shared by every Member of this House.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to enable all citizens of Ireland, in every walk of life, to regard themselves as being on an equal footing as every other citizen.  If this Bill becomes law it will require employers, landlords, publicans, bankers, public officials, hoteliers, educators, indeed all of us, to re-examine the prejudices which are part and parcel of an unequal society. It will require changes in structures, in rules and regulations, in some cases in factory and business premises but, above all, in attitudes.  Deputies will see that the Bill has been drafted with great care. Meticulous attention has been given to details, to providing for necessary exceptions and to envisaging a framework that can operate in a practical manner on this important subject.  However, the Labour Party do not claim to have universal knowledge on this subject.  If this Bill goes forward to Committee Stage the party will be more than happy to adopt the universal wisdom of all sides of the House.  I know that many Members of the House will be very anxious to make valuable contributions to the Bill.  The Labour Party will be more than happy to discuss the matter at length and to take on board whatever amendments or adjustments are found to be necessary or desirable, both from the Opposition side and from the Government side.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to recall that only 100 years ago, a relatively short time in legal history, the law of this country and of the adjoining island, sometimes referred to as the mainland, prohibited a married woman from having in her name any property whatsoever.  That was the law until the Married Women's Property Act, 1882, came into force.  The development towards equality for women has been a very gradual process over that time. There is no doubt that we have achieved much, but much remains to be done.  The present position is not acceptable in the nineties.  I venture to think that in decades ahead, when historians look back on this period in Ireland, they will be appalled at the fact that so many discriminations have been allowed to continue <Col N="335" /> in legislation and are still there in 1992.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are trying to be of assistance across the board in this matter.  We went to very considerable trouble in drafting and preparing this legislation to try to take on board these outstanding matters which should have been legislated for long ago.  However, the opportunity for dealing with them arises now.  I hope that the Government and the Minister will be practical about this matter and will not automatically go for the reflex action of nit-picking at the Bill and finding difficulties with it.  There is already on the Statute Book some very valuable additions to our legal system, which are operated daily in our courts, which were the result of Private Members' legislation.  With the co-operation and assistance of the Government, the Minister and all sides of the House, this legislation can also fulfil that role.  I am asking the Minister to support the Bill and allow it to go forward to Committee Stage.  He should make suggestions on it and let us discuss proposals for its improvement.  We will be more than receptive in taking on board any such suggestions or proposals on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is time we confronted open and hidden attitudes that contribute to residual instances of inequality in Ireland.  This Bill will help in a very large measure to do that.  Let us not wait for directives from Brussels, putting ourselves yet again, as we have done so often in the past, into the humiliating position of not doing the right thing because we should do so but of reacting to directives and mandatory injunctions from the European Commission in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Irish people as a whole and Members of this House support the concept of equality and are against the concept of discrimination in all walks of life. Therefore let us translate that into action and let us do it now while we have the opportunity to do so.  Let us not be told that the Government at some future date will come up with their own measure.  We know from the Order of Business every <Col N="336" /> day of the delays in the parliamentary draftsman's office and much legislation is deferred until a later date.  This Bill has been skilfully prepared by lawyers; all aspects of it have been examined and it is now before the House.  Now is the time to act, not at some vague future date when the Government may get around to dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The effects of not dealing with this matter are felt every day of the week. Next week or next month a handicapped person or a married woman looking for a mortgage will be discriminated against. I have experienced many instances of discrimination.  There is still discrimination against married women in financial matters.  The legacy of 1882 still persists whereby a married woman seeking a mortgage from a bank, building society or local authority is discriminated against.  Perhaps it does not apply as much to a single woman as to a married woman.  Lending institutions, including local authority lending institutions, discriminate against married women who seek mortgages or loans in their own name.  They ask about the husband's position and his earnings.  The wife's position as an individual person is not taken into consideration.  She is entitled to that as a matter of morality and, if this Bill is adopted, she will be entitled to it as a matter of law.  On behalf of the Labour Party I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ireland has rightly been credited with developing one of the most effective and accessible legal mechanisms among the European Community member states for the investigation and adjudication of complaints of discrimination on grounds of sex, whether in relation to pay or other employment conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="337" /> In the period since the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 came into operation there has been a number of significant developments affecting our whole perception of employment equality, both nationally and in a European context.  The Labour Court, in fact, recognises the increasing complexity of the issues arising in equality cases in the field of employment and has itself had regard to important European Court of Justice cases in reaching its determinations. In 1987 my predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, initiated a process of review and consultation by publishing a discussion document which commented on a range of shortcomings that were found to have appeared in the two Acts which have been on our Statute Book since 1974 and 1977 respectively.</P>
    <P>This Government have recognised, within the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> that progress on employment is dependent on legislation, complemented by positive action programmes.  I have underlined my commitment to bring forward proposals for legislation to amend the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, in fulfilment of the undertaking given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I hope to get the approval of the Government shortly to enable the drafting of a comprehensive Bill which will replace the two original statutes and incorporate in the one Act a succession of statutory instruments which have been issued over the past 16 years.  I believe it is vitally important that the basic principles of equality law should be accessible and comprehensible to the public.  It is my intention to update the basic legislative provisions and also to ensure that all statute law on employment equality should be found quickly and conveniently in the one place and in the one Act.</P>
    <P>I propose to address most of my remarks on this Bill in the time available to its implications for the nature and scope of the two major legislative measures which have already been enacted in this country in relation to <Col N="338" /> equality between men and women.  I refer, of course, to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  Other colleagues from the Government side will address the adequacy of the type of catch-all measure proposed in this Labour Party Bill as a means of tackling discrimination on grounds other than sex and the extension of the scope of the anti-discrimination legislation to cover the fields of education, the provision of goods, facilities and services, etc.  Set against the clearly stated reform objectives to which this Government are committed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Labour Party's Bill suffers from four serious deficiencies: first, it fails to provide a single, satisfactory and comprehensive source of law relating to the employment field.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the present Bill, which was originally presented in April 1990, has already been overtaken by some significant statutory provisions affecting equal treatment in relation to employment rights in the form of the Pensions Act, 1990, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991. The establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women also marks a watershed and is evidence of the Government's commitment to wider reforms.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there are few instances in which the present Bill proposes changes to the provisions of the existing equality Acts as they affect the sphere of employment which were not originally heralded in Chapter Two of the discussion document published by my Department in 1987.  In fact, the present Bill has simply left most of the changes originally proposed in the discussion document in a state of &ldquo;deep freeze&rdquo;.  Proposals have been lifted straight from that discussion document of 1987 with little regard to developments which have occurred in the meantime, either in the context of the European Community's social policy or in the context of our continuing domestic <Col N="339" /> programmes of labour and social reform legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the present Bill sets out to graft a vastly expanded range of responsibilities on to the existing promotional advisory and enforcement machinery established under the equality Acts without any apparent consideration for its capacity to discharge such wideranging brief efficiently or effectively.  There is already evidence across the European Community of dissatisfaction with the institutional frameworks established to provide advice and assistance and to discharge a strategic enforcement role going beyond individual complaints.  It is hardly the answer to such problems to increase the level of demands on such bodies regardless of the staffing and financial constraints within which they must operate and the limitations of the managerial and specialist expertise available to them.  This is one of the aspects of institutional change on which I particularly look forward to clear-sighted thinking and objective setting on the part of the Second Commission on the Status of Women under the chairmanship of Justice Mella Carroll.</P>
    <P>Of course, the first difficulty which confronts anyone concerned with a problem of unequal treatment is to find the law relevant to his or her situation.  That is not a simple matter; there is a variety of sources of law &mdash; European and domestic &mdash; which form a hindrance to the simple application of the law.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, did not purport to provide a single comprehensive approach to the elimination of discrimination between the sexes in employment.  The earlier Act of 1974, which related to equal pay, was already in existence and had only come into force at the end of 1976.  It was retained, however, with some minor modifications and with the addition of a somewhat ambigious provision which provides that the 1977 Act and the 1974 Act are to be construed together.  The 1977 Act has been subsequently amended in major respects by regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1982.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> In fact, the principle of equality in employment between men and women already enjoys a special status under European Community law and the Community has since the mid-seventies gradually built up a wideranging legislative code which presently consists of five equality directives which cover pay, employment and vocational training, aspects of statutory and occupational pension schemes and self employment.</P>
    <P>I believe that we must seriously address the challenge of incorporating Community law in our national legal order.  To do so requires a new and comprehensive Act dealing with employment matters to ensure that it will no longer be necessary for practitioners, equality officers, the Labour Court and the higher courts to continually refer to different sources of law located in a variety of different texts. The aim should be to construct a single and comprehensive code framed to meet current Irish employment circumstances and recognising the applicability of European Community Law.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Labour Party's Bill does little to assist those practitioners, not to mention managers and those conducting negotiations in employment or those considering whether to put forward claims relating to equal pay or sex discrimination, to arrive at a clear understanding of their responsibilities.  Instead of advancing a comprehensive new code, the Bill proposes to add to a new statute alongside the skeleton of the two earlier Acts.  Instead of replacing the 1974 Act completely, it proposes to repeal nine out of the total of 14 sections contained in that Act.  It proposes to leave the 1977 Act in an even more ragged state.  At section 67 in Part IX of the Equal Status Bill it is proposed to repeal 31 of the 56 sections contained in the 1977 Act. However, eight of the remaining 25 sections are wholly or partly amended by the provisions of Part VIII of the Bill. The last section of the Bill blithely states that the proposed new measure and the remnants of the 1974 and 1977 Acts &ldquo;shall be construed together as one Act&rdquo;.  What this really amounts to is legislative revision by salami technique or even <Col N="341" /> chain-saw confetti.  The outcome of such an approach would make it impossible for the practitioner to establish what law is applicable in any set of circumstances without undertaking an elaborate and time-consuming paper chase.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised my concern that the content of the law be made more accessible and comprehensible to the public.  The benefits this kind of approach can yield should be obvious enough when considered from the point of view of those asserting &mdash; or contesting &mdash; claims before the equality officers and the Labour Court for whom the additional costs and the delay, if an appeal to a higher court is required, are very damaging. But the purpose of the law in relation to employment equality is not just intended to provide compensation when rights are infringed or to induce potential discriminators to refrain from particular Acts; it should also serve to establish a framework for social behaviour within which best practice can be fostered.  Employers and workers can only be expected to make equal treatment part and parcel of their day-to-day relationships if they can be given a clear understanding of their responsibilities, so as to be able to give effect to best practice, thus ensuring that there is only recourse to legal action as a last resort. The Labour Party Bill, unfortunately, fails to pass this crucial test.  It purports to offer a radical new approach but really presents us with a Bill that has the appearance of an over-stretched suitcase complete with the skeletal remains of two older statutes.</P>
    <P>The suitcases packaging is very strained and the contents likely to cause much confusion.  The Bill would be meaningless without the surviving features it retains, from the original Acts, the latter elements remaining uncomprehensible without careful scrutiny of the former.</P>
    <P>In bringing forward a comprehensive reform of the employment equality legislation, I will also be able to complement the provisions of the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 which was enacted after the drafting and introduction of this Bill.  That Act <Col N="342" /> represented a major social advance through the extension of the whole body of protective labour law and individual employment rights to a substantial category of employees who, heretofore, were vulnerable and increasingly subject to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.  The provisions of that Act extended the rights already enjoyed by the vast majority of employees to this rather marginalised group.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that this new protective measure &mdash; on which explanatory material has already been widely disseminated by my Department &mdash; should serve to safeguard the employment rights of many women workers.  Women account for more than three quarters of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age bands, associated with child rearing. Over 70 per cent of female part-time workers are married; about 60 per cent of the males are single; about one-third of part-time males are under 25, with a further third aged 25-44.  In the case of females, fewer than one-sixth were under 25, more than half were aged 25-44 and about 30 per cent in the 45-64 age group.</P>
    <P>Part-time work, particularly regular part-time work, has increased in the last 15 years.  While it is a predominantly female option, there are still a substantial number of men working part-time in Ireland, but for different reasons from those of women.  The classic part-time worker is female, aged 25-44 and married with dependent children.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that legislative developments in relation to employment rights should be promoted with due regard to the way in which European Community law on employment equality has developed into an advanced legal framework.  While this Bill represents a very ambitious attempt to draw upon many different sources, I fear it tries to take too much on board.  There is a very real danger that by casting the net too wide, it may actually underestimate and therefore marginalise the two key influences on the formulation of our legislative policy, namely European Community legislation and our legislator's perceptions of the correct relationship <Col N="343" /> between law and industrial relations practices.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill was also introduced in this House before the Pensions Act, 1990 was enacted on 24 July 1990. The Act provides that every pension scheme, and also every other scheme providing any kind of occupational benefits payable on termination of service or interruption of service by reason of sickness, shall comply with the principal of equal treatment.  This is defined as meaning that there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex in respect of any matter relating to the scheme.  This applies to benefits for dependants as well as to benefits for members.  My purpose in drawing attention to these developments is to highlight their significance and the danger of losing sight of the need to ensure that legislative developments in the field of employment equality proceed on the basis of coherent planning, adequate consultation and a thorough appreciation of the wider implications for Irish labour law and industrial relations policy.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> my predecessor Deputy B.  Ahern, published a discussion paper in 1987 which set out a series of options for the review of the two Acts, identifying, for the purposes of consultation, the need for changes in the following areas: (i) scope and coverage of the existing Acts &mdash; the paper identified some problems of interpretation, in addition to limitations in the scope of the legislation, and inconsistencies between the two Acts and (ii) procedures &mdash; the paper also identified the need for measures to avoid any deficiencies in the operation of investigative and enforcement procedures, and the adjudication of appeals.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government committed themselves to introducing a new Bill, which will amend both Acts. This commitment has been welcomed by the second Commission on the Status of Women and by the Employment Equality Agency.  The proposed <Col N="344" /> measures reflect the outcome of consultations with the Employment Equality Agency which has a statutory duty to keep the working of both Acts under review.  Important decisions of the European Court of Justice have also been taken into consideration as well as the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Labour Court, equality officers and other interested parties on the operation of the legislation and on the changes they considered desirable.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need to have all the legislation, and the range of changes arising from Court of Justice decisions and various Irish statutory instruments, brought together within a common format so that practitioners and other users can find all the relevant law quickly and conveniently.  This will greatly improve the operation of investigation and adjudication procedures and boost people's confidence in having their complaints handled efficiently.</P>
    <P>In addition to covering many of the proposals in the discussion document, which are incorporated in the Bill, I am also considering going further in the following areas; formalising the position in relation to work of higher value following the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the <i>Murphy. V. Bord Telecom</i> case; introducing an enforcement mechanism to ensure that collective agreements on pay and conditions may be the subject of a complaint and, if appropriate, duly declared null and void or amended; adding to the powers of the equality officers so as to enable them to require persons in possession of relevant information to co-operate with the investigation; clarifying the purpose of codes of practice on equal opportunity, removing the restriction on their being addressed exclusively to employers; providing that codes may be admitted in evidence in proceedings; providing for an equality officer's findings to be given the status of a Labour Court determination if the finding has not been appealed within the prescribed timescale; providing that the Labour Court should, at the request of the parties to a dispute, state the reasons <Col N="345" /> it upheld or reversed an equality officer's findings, and providing that the Labour Court may refer a matter arising in the course of an investigation to the High Court for decision on a point of law.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot support this Bill on the grounds that it reflects a centralising, catch-all approach which is unnecessarily cumbersome, legalistic and bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>My preference is for a single comprehensive measure on equality between men and women in employment which will bring all the relevant law together under one cover.  This Bill seeks to cover too wide a field and in attempting to do too much may even pose a threat to the effective operation of well-established mechanisms and procedures which have served to advance women's interests in the sphere of employment over the past 17 years.  Also it threatens to swamp or marginalise what has come to be recognised as the most serious and pervasive form of discrimination in our society &mdash; the practices which operate, directly and indirectly, to isolate, segregate or even eliminate the contribution which women can make in all areas of employment.  In addition, the Bill seems, by virtue of the attempt to put such a wide-range of issues into a single legislative measure, to reflect ri = "4"an over-emphasis on the effectiveness of legislative enforcement mechanisms, <i>per se</i>, to the detriment of other complementary methods of developing good practice.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill fails on some of the most critical tests of any social policy. What a policy is about cannot be divorced from how it is implemented.  How good a policy is cannot be divorced from whether it can be implemented effectively. Whether a policy can be effectively implemented depends on whether the design of its implementation matches the strategic aims of the policy.  The Equal Status Bill fails on all these counts. Irish workers and managers, legal practitioners and the enforcement and adjudication processes will be best served if we maintain the coherence and the integrity of our employment equality code and <Col N="346" /> ensure the early enactment of a single comprehensive statute.  While the Labour Party measure offers some useful ideas which can be taken into account in that regard, it would undermine the integrity of the code which has been developed to date.  I hope to bring such codified and comprehensive legislation to the House some time in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is my first opportunity to do so, I congratulate the new Minister and wish him every success in his new portfolio.  Before Deputy Mervyn Taylor leaves the House, I will say to him that when Deputy Cowen says that we will do something, he most definitely will do it.</P>
      <P>As indicated by the Minister, this Bill, which was presented in the House in April 1990, has been overtaken by many significant statutory and non-statutory developments, particularly the Pensions Act, 1990, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 and the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991.  In terms of positive non-statutory developments affecting women's employment opportunities, since the Labour Party Bill was introduced perhaps the most significant development has been the establishment of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which was set up in 1990 with a wide-ranging mandate to make comprehensive recommendations to the Government on the means by which women would be able to participate on equal terms and conditions in economic, social, political and cultural life in our society.</P>
      <P>The commission made great strides to discharge their task within their allotted time.  They issued a first interim report in April 1991 identifying a series of recommendations which they considered would complement the thrust of Government policy in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The re-emergence of the Labour Party Bill at this stage has the appearance of an attempt to pre-empt the recommendations in the commission's final report due in July.  Notwithstanding the wholesale borrowing of the proposals for <Col N="347" /> reform of the employment equality Acts outlined in the discussion document published by the Department of Labour in 1987, it is clear that the Labour Party want to lay claim to all the initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for awaiting the outcome of the deliberations of the second commission.  To proceed as the Labour Party proposes puts inordinate emphasis on the role of legislation as a catalyst and instrument for change.  The commission's approach, as reflected in their first statement of April 1991 is evidence of a more rounded perspective which is likely to foster a more positive atmosphere for future development than the &ldquo;catch-all&rdquo; legislative sledge-hammer approach favoured by the Labour Party. There is a real danger that the all-encompassing legalistic focus of the Labour Party Bill will overload the mechanisms already established to combat discrimination based on sex in the employment sphere, dissipate resources and deflect attention from the kind of initiatives already under way to promote changes in social behaviour on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The positive outlook of the second commission is also reflected in this Government's view that while legislation has a crucial role to play in the achievement of equal opportunities in employment, it needs to be complemented by positive action initiatives at the level of every firm.  The Government's commitment to action at national level is illustrated in the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>In the area of training arising out of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, FÁS have expanded the opportunities for women to take up careers in non-traditional areas.  This was achieved through the FÁS positive action programme which included among its features precise target-setting and pre-apprenticeship courses.  The first programme was developed in 1990 and was further developed in 1991 and again is being revised and updated.  This programme <Col N="348" /> was devised because of the importance of training as a provider of opportunities for women to broaden their career options into new and non-traditional areas of work.</P>
    <P>A range of practical actions, designed to contribute towards the goal of a better balance of men and women in the labour force, are developed in the programme which has the following objectives: to promote actively the breaking down of traditional patterns of occupations segregation by encouraging increased female participation in sectors of the labour market traditionally dominated by men and to promote actively the participation of women at all levels in growing, future-oriented sectors of the labour market including technical and managerial occupations, in order to achieve better use of human resources.</P>
    <P>This programme is an example of the type of positive action training that can be implemented under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants for training courses should be relaxed to facilitate women who wish to return to the workforce.  To give effect to this commitment persons signing for credits are eligible to participate in the new job training and employment subsidy schemes provided that they have been on the live register for at least eight weeks immediately preceding recruitment.  In addition, women participating in FÁS return-to-work courses are eligible to participate in the job training scheme provided that participation would involve further development of skills.  As a result of these initiatives the level of women's participation on FÁS programmes continues to increase annually.  While in 1971, only 5 per cent of all FÁS trainees were women the figure for 1991 was 42 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to positive action at enterprise level. On the premise that the public sector can be a providing ground for new concepts of <Col N="349" /> positive action, and that it has an obligation to give leadership to the private sector, the process of monitoring equality of opportunity initiatives was started in the Civil Service by unions and management in 1987.  In 1989 this process was extended to semi-State bodies.  In accordance with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> this monitoring process was extended to health boards and local authorities in 1990.  In order to help these bodies in the furtherance of equal opportunity initiatives the Department of Labour together with the EEA, assisted the Institute of Public Administration in the planning and organisation of a workshop on equal opportunities for public sector bodies in 1991.  The Employment Equality Agency also hosted seminars on equal opportunities for local authorities, health boards and voluntary hospitals in 1991.</P>
    <P>Within the private sector a number of companies are operating positive action programmes and clear guidance has been provided on this matter by ICTU and FIE.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour's award scheme, Equality Focus, sponsored by the Employment Equality Agency and the EC, in co-operation with the Irish branch of the Institute for Personnel Management was introduced in 1990. This scheme is designed to encourage Irish employers in both the public and private sectors to develop positive approaches to equality at work; offer recognition to those companies that had already adopted equal opportunities policies; and contribute to the awareness among Irish employers of positive action as a human resource issue.  This scheme was very successful in 1990.  I am glad that the Minister for Labour has made extra funding available to the Employment Equality Agency in 1992.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of age except where, by reason of the physical strength or physical or mental stamina required to perform the duties attached to a position, employment in positions of that nature must be confined <Col N="350" /> to persons beneath a particular age.  The Government committed themselves in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to a policy of substantially raising recuritment age limits throughout the public sector having regard, however, to the need to hold competitions for school leavers, trainees and graduates.</P>
    <P>Many of us who are on local authorities have seen the fruits of this in that the age limit for many posts in public sector organisations is now 50 years.</P>
    <P>The recently published NESC report on women's participation in the Irish labour market shows that child care services are a significant factor affecting married women's decisions about participation in the workforce.  In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, the Government acknowledged the need for a policy to encourage the development of child care services as a collective responsibility.  This not only calls for a co-ordinated response on the part of the different Government Departments involved, but will also necessitate collaboration with employer and community interests.</P>
    <P>The working party on childcare for working parents was established by the Minister for Labour in 1990 to devise specific recommendations for the development of childcare partnerships between parents, employers, etc., having regard to the EC Council recommendation on childcare.  This working party are due to produce their final report shortly.  I hope this report will be considered by the Government in developing specific policies and mechanisms to improve childcare for working parents.</P>
    <P>Women Members have been trying to emphasise the importance of such reports in encouraging further participation by women in the workforce.  I look at my colleague across the floor, Deputy Barnes, who has been trying to encourage the provision of such facilities not only in her own constituency but also in the House, and, in joining the ranks quite soon, I will be most supportive.  It is clear from the commitments in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the actions taken to implement them that <Col N="351" /> the Government are committed to the achievement of real equality between men and women in employment.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ní aontaím leis an Bhille seo agus caithfidh mé fanacht ar an mBille úr a raibh an t-Aire ag caint faoi.  I believe that the Minister's proposal to amend the Acts is the best way to go.  As I said before Deputy Taylor left the Chamber, I hope the Minister will introduce such legislation as soon as he can.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Coughlan's contribution.  I would never try to stop anybody making a contribution particularly when he or she is in a positive mood and Government commitments are being made.</P>
      <P>I was very glad the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen's speech was circulated so quickly, although unfortunately he left the Chamber before I got the chance to challenge him.  I had to read his first sentence three times because even on the second reading I could not believe what he was asking us to accept. It reads:</P>
      <P>Ireland has rightly been credited with developing one of the most effective and accessible legal mechanisms among the European Community member states for the investigation and adjudication of complaints of discrimination on grounds of sex, whether in relation to pay or other employment conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have much preferred if the Minister had stated what conditions are really like for women.  Even if he wished to register some criticism of the all embracing sections of the Labour Party Bill &mdash; indeed I welcome those all embracing sections &mdash; we could still have a certain amount of reality.  I would have preferred him to acknowledge the reality and to have said that Ireland has rightly <Col N="352" /> been credited with the lowest number of working married women in the European Community who probably have to face the greatest obstacles; the lowest level of childcare facilities and the lowest level of commitment to the provision of facilities; with next to no commitment to the retraining of women or the encouragement of such women to leave the home once they have reared their children, having voluntarily contributed to the State, without which the good of the State could not be achieved and for which they get next to nothing.</P>
    <P>If we start with some sense of truth and reality and acceptance that Ireland has a right to be ashamed and embarrassed about the position of women in Irish society, we may get somewhere.  I find it very difficult to take this whitewash of reality.  Collectively we should be insisting that not alone should claims that are patently not true not be made but we should try to work together to begin to catch up with the rest of Europe not only in the area of legislation but, as the Minister said, in regard to the social attitudes to women.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to use my 20 minutes outlining the European perception of women in Irish society over the past three or four weeks.  There will be time for that in another debate.  However, we cannot claim to be proud of the treatment of women in Ireland, and Irish women can claim to be frightened.  In his speech the Minister attached great importance to the discussion document on the employment Acts and their potential for the training of women.  The discussion document was circulated in 1987, but it is now 1992 and we are still in the process of discussion.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister paid tribute to some of the agencies and other groups who took that discussion document very seriously and responded very positively to it.  He said that important decisions of the European Court of Justice had been taken into consideration as well as the views of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federation of Irish Employers, the Labour Court equality officers and other interested parties.  Let me remind the Minister that in early 1988 <Col N="353" /> the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights also put in a very substantial document with regard to the updating and strengthening of such legislation. Yet the position in 1992 is that amending and strengthening legislation has not been enacted.</P>
    <P>On the whole, women are paid 68 per cent of the male rate of pay.  The differences in average earnings of men and women &mdash; and this is of crucial importance &mdash; are not confined to traditional industries as we had hoped, but also prevail in new industries, such as the electronics and mechanical engineering industries.  What opportunities are there for women in industries?  Women are still on the conveyor belts, on the assembly lines; they are not at management or design levels.  What are we doing about this?  When we talk about positive action, this is where we should start.  I would love to stand up in this Chamber and welcome such action, but unfortunately I cannot.</P>
    <P>I would like to think, however, that in the Government's response there will be evidence of such positive action but, unfortunately, I do not think there will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister waxed eloquent on the opportunities for part-time work and the protection of part-time work for women. When we compare Ireland with other member states, we find that we have a higher number of women part-time workers than most European countries. Women account for more than three quarters of all part-time workers in the 25-44 age group &mdash; the group associated with child rearing.  Over 70 per cent of female part-time workers are married, whereas 60 per cent of males are single. About one third of male part-time workers were under 25 years of age.  The classic part-time worker is female, aged 25 to 44 and married with dependent children.  I put it to the House that this is not a matter of choice; this is imposed on them by a denial of any real commitment to providing childcare facilities.  While the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> may have promised this, and I welcome what was said in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> what worries me is that when the Oireachtas <Col N="354" /> Joint Committee on Women's Rights attempted to get a créche set up in co-operation with the existing Civil Service créche, we were told we would probably be duplicating facilities, that there would probably not be enough parents interested and that we should enter into discussions and negotiations with the trade unions in case we would set up so many facilities that we would not be able to fill the places.  That came from the Department of Finance and the Public Service and I think it was written by someone who had no concern or fear about being pregnant or having to worry about where children would be or the social acceptability of recognising what is already accepted throughout the industrialised world, namely, that there is no equality of opportunity for women without the provision of child care facilities. I will leave the Minister's speech aside, particularly since he is not here.  It is a fine irony that we talk about the accessible legal mechanisms in Ireland when in fact case after case which should have been won by women was rejected, appealed and had to be taken to Europe. I rest my case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the all-embracing nature of the Bill before us.  Legislation which focuses narrowly on vocational training and employment in the rigid sense leaves out the whole area of living and the whole climate of changing attitudes regarding sharing domestic responsibilities, taking women seriously and giving women equality of status.  This Bill includes not only discrimination against women on grounds of sex, marital or parental status but also discrimination on grounds of age, handicap, sexual orientation, religion, race or membership of the travelling community.  All of us would agree on that.  I know The Labour Party would agree that another area which needs urgent attention is the Planning Acts which allow designs to be approved without consideration of the access needs of people in wheelchairs or suffering from other handicaps.  We need to raise the sense of awareness and not marginalise and penalise such people.  We must build in supports and positive discrimination. <Col N="355" /> Deputy Taylor and I have talked about this matter, as has the Minister.</P>
    <P>The onus of proof should not lie on the employee but on the employer and we must build positive programmes to discriminate in favour of the women who comprise over 50 per cent of the population and other marginalised groups included within the scope of this Bill.  It is ridiculous to suggest that the playing field is level.  It most patently is not.  The goal posts are constantly moved. Obstacles may be removed at one stage but hidden obstacles replace them.  This legislation must be underscored by positive discrimination and positive programmes. All parties on this side of the House would agree that no legislation should be introduced at any level in any area by any Minister without criteria with regard to gender, sexual orientation and the rights of the disabled.</P>
    <P>One of the definitions within the Bill is particularly welcome.  Marital status is defined as meaning the status of being married, single, widowed, divorced or separated and includes the status of cohabiting with another person.  That is the definition which all of us should operate.</P>
    <P>The denial of credit facilities is not just a denial of rights to women and other marginal groups who are not trusted.  We are losing out on possible enterprises.  It has been shown in other countries that five out of six small enterprises have been started by women.  Until we let women have credit in their own right, not based on marital status, we will not lay the foundation for small enterprises worked by women.  This is one of the areas for which we should seek EC funding.  We must ensure that a proportion of the money we receive goes to women.  Hitherto they have been denied credit and the type of guarantees they need to set up in business.  The economy would benefit. The small businesses agency set up by Deputy Fennell when Minister of State showed a most incredible pay back and gave encouragement to women far beyond what was envisaged.  This is an aspect of this Bill which has not been included in other Bills.  We still have the <Col N="356" /> remarkably insulting situation where women with their own income can be asked to give the name of a male guarantor when they seek credit facilities.  In some cases the male guarantors would not have one-tenth of the income of the women but the sacredness of the act and the deed must include the male signature regardless of ability to pay.  This is the attitude we have to deal with.  I am disappointed that in the Government's response so far there has been no indication that these fundamental, deeprooted traditional discriminations are being taken on board.  If this Bill is not adequate to challenge them, we should have an all-embracing Bill, outside the employment legislation, that will deal conclusively with what has until recently regarded women in Ireland as chattels in legal language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is fitting that the last speaker in the debate should have been talking about women and the difficulties experienced by them in certain situations. This is another case, almost solely confined to women.  On a visit to the plant in Nenagh a fortnight ago I came across 40 women outside the factory premises, closed for a number of months, but the women were staying at their post because they felt they had been very badly treated.  Knowing the facts of the case I am sure the Minister of State will have no difficulty in agreeing with me that they have been very badly treated by their former employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reliability Nederland BV opened and, it would appear, operated profitably for a number of years in Nenagh and had a good relationship with their staff.  Unfortunately they ceased trading and closed on 10 April 1991.  The staff and their union, SIPTU, had a meeting with the company prior to closure.  It was clear <Col N="357" /> to the union from the outset that the company would honour obligations and would negotiate a redundancy package with the workforce.  The company attended a conciliation conference in the Labour Court following a meeting with the IDA.  Unfortunately, the company seemed to withdraw from the commitments they had made originally.  The union and the workforce went through the normal channel, the Labour Court, and a recommendation was made which would have cost the company approximately £150,000, but the company did not honour it.  Certain plant and equipment was still in the premises for a number of months and the workforce felt, that while the equipment was <i>in situ</i> they had some leverage on the company. It appears this company were substantially grant-aided to the tune of about £500,000 by the IDA.  Apparently, the IDA have accepted the premises in return for the grant aid but, from the figures I have, it goes nowhere near compensating the IDA, or indeed the Irish taxpayers, for the investment made.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the IDA to see whether negotiations can be completed with the company.  Obviously, there is extreme difficulty in that the company have left Ireland and have relocated somewhere in Asia.  There are difficulties in that respect from the Government's point of view.  Nevertheless, it is an extremely difficult situation for the 40 female workers and their families.  In most cases I understand they were the sole earners in their households and they have been left in a very difficult situation. I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, if some pressure can be brought to bear on the company through a sharing of the assets of the company which they have left.  I ask the Minister if something can be done for this workforce who had a tremendous track record with the company over a long period.  Unfortunately, they are the losers in this very sad story.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Spring for raising the matter.  As Deputy Spring will <Col N="358" /> recognise, this is essentially a matter for the Department of Labour but it has been given to the Department of Industry and Commerce, to deal with the written reply which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, gave last week on the matter.</P>
      <P>The history of the firm is as outlined by Deputy Spring, one of great promise and hope when it set up in Nenagh. Everybody was delighted, as one always is, at the start of a new industry.  Matters proceeded thus for a long time until the old story reasserted itself of the parent company running into difficulties, gradually the slow down until eventually the sad news reached the small town in Ireland.  That story is familiar and sad when it is brought to people's doorsteps. I do not say &ldquo;small town&rdquo; in any derogatory sense; I mean it in the sense of the parent company looking at the other country and deciding on a course of action.  Having read the details it echoed stories from many other industries and towns.  As Deputy Spring pointed out, the workforce was mainly female.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the sadness involved in the inevitable pulling of the plug on their small, hitherto thriving, little company, serving themselves and their homes and their domestic situations and looking &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.  That was not to be.  The parent company &mdash; through no fault of their own &mdash; ran into great difficulties in the US and gradually began to pull out of their responsibilities because they could no longer afford to keep up all their activities and finally the sad news reached Ireland. The trauma of that was bad enough.  A certain Minister of State and a Cabinet Minister made valiant efforts both in the winding-down stages and in the redundancy discussions to try to have something more than the statutory payments made to the employees of this firm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring is correct when he says there was an arrangement with the IDA who accepted the premises as a payment towards the considerable grant payments which had been made to the firm earlier. What the Deputy is about tonight is in connection with the redundancy payments for the employees.  One story has <Col N="359" /> ended but not completely in that the IDA are making considerable efforts to find an alternative firm to take over the premises and, hopefully, to start employment again.  That is one aspect and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <P>In connection with the redundancy payments, which is the human side of what has happened, the statutory payments will be honoured.  The Department of Labour have informed me and the Department of Industry and Commerce that that is all the company can now afford to pay.  I have listened closely to what Deputy Spring has said on the matter.  Tomorrow, I will get in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Labour, Deputy Cowen, to see whether something further can be done with regard to those women who have been dealt with according to the strict letter of the law regarding what should be paid to them but for whom a very real effort should be made in the context of what will be done with the premises, the firm and the repayment.  Surely some component of that could be spent on the redundancy payments.  I will certainly examine that matter.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I wish to avail of the opportunity to congratulate the new Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and wish him every success in his brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the proposal to close the Garda station at Enfield, County Meath from 6 p.m. to 10 a.m.  This station has a Garda complement of two sergeants and 19 gardaí.  That is, because of the security duties they have to carry out at Irish Industrial Explosives Limited, the only factory of its kind in the country.  I would like to ask the Minister what the Garda hope to achieve in making this proposal, how much money will be saved and who will provide a security escort in moving explosives from the factory at Enfield to <Col N="360" /> Tara Mines and Gypsum Industries, for example, on a daily basis?  Will a fully manned Garda car be assigned to the station if this decision is made and how many patrol cars will be in the area?</P>
    <P>At present when there is a call for help cars have to come from Trim, which is 12 miles away, and the journey takes between 12 and 15 minutes.  Furthermore, Enfield is expanding.  Thirty to 40 new houses have been built during the past few years in the town which is situated on the main road from Dublin to Mullingar and the west.</P>
    <P>The Government spend over £1 million a day on security along the Border.  Yet, we are reducing security in the vicinity of the only explosives factory in the State. Prior to the robbery in Waterford many people said that such a robbery could not take place but I did and over £2.5 million was taken none of which has been recovered.</P>

What hope have we of ensuring that such a robbery will never take place?  A stitch in time saves nine. Given the amount of money that will be saved, this is a retrograde step particularly if one takes into account the amount of money that both this Government and each Government for the past 20 years have spent on security.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks.  No analogy however can be drawn between the matter he has raised and the robbery which occurred in Waterford.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity here tonight to allay the fears which have been generated among residents of Enfield by the rumours and falsehoods which have been put about in relation to the Garda authorities' decision to introduce revised public opening hours at Enfield Garda station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The people of Enfield have been given the impression by misleading reports circulating in their locality that they are about to witness a mass withdrawal of Garda from Enfield Garda station as part of some kind of cost-cutting exercise. There have even been suggestions that what is involved is the first step towards eventual closure of the station.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no question of Enfield Garda station being downgraded or closed.  The station will continue to have its full complement of gardaí and the financial resources needed to provide a Garda service in Enfield will remain in place.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to ask why then are the opening hours of Enfield station being revised?  The plain fact of the matter is that the new arrangements are the result of an operational decision on the part of the Garda authorities to improve the Garda service to the people of Enfield by freeing gardaí from desk duty at the local station to get out and about among the community they serve and protect.  Gardaí on outdoor duty in the Enfield area are in contact at all times with their local station and the district headquarters at Trim and they can be directed to respond immediately to any urgent call for their services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that local people in Enfield should be concerned about changes in policing arrangements which have served their community well for a number of years. They can be assured tonight that the new arrangements have been carefully planned by the Garda authorities who are satisfied that the new revised opening hours will afford a much improved balance between indoor office services and outdoor operational duty.  The Garda authorities are best placed to make decisions about policing in our communities and their assessment of the policing needs of Enfiled points to a very convincing case for getting local gardaí out from behind their station desks to <Col N="362" /> undertake more productive outdoor duty in and among the community.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has linked the revised public opening hours at Enfield station with the security considerations arising from the Irish Industrial Explosives factory which is located in the area.  This is a diversion.  Security at the factory will not be diminished by the change of opening hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First, I thank the Minister for coming into the House at an inconvenient time this evening.  I am aware that he is exceptionally busy at present.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this issue is that I was unhappy with the reply I received from the Minister to a question I had put down for written answer.  I asked the Minister for Health if he would outline Government policy on funding the various rape crisis centres throughout the country.  The reply simply listed the block grants which were being made available to the rape crisis centres and did not give any indication of what the Government's policy was.  It was the policy issue that I was interested in rather than the amounts of the capital grants which were being allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have become increasingly conscious of the horrific crime of rape during the past few years.  This House has on two occasions amended the law in relation to rape during a period of ten years.  The frequency at which newspaper reports have appeared on this crime would seem to indicate that the law is being applied <Col N="363" /> and that charges are being brought more frequently now but while the full rigour of the law will bring rapists to justice it is not enough for the unfortunate victims. The rape crisis centres are fulfilling a very useful function and are publicly recognised for their valuable contribution in counselling victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>In this context it is time the question of funding was put on a regular budgetary basis.  It is no longer good enough that organisations in different parts of the country who supply, voluntarily, such a valuable service should have a hand to mouth financial existence.  I am sure the Minister is aware, as I am, that many of the people involved in the rape crisis centres spend a considerable amount of their time fund raising when their time could be better spent in carrying out counselling and support functions for rape victims.  The Minister will be aware that everything from concerts to discos and other fund raising activities are being indulged in.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to do a number of things.  First, I would like him to make it a matter of policy that the funding of the rape crisis centres would become a normal item of Government expenditure through the Department of Health and that there would be a separate subhead in the annual Estimates. Second, there should not be a question mark on a year to year basis over funding. They start each year not knowing whether they will get any funds but they hope that the practice of previous years will be followed.  This is not sufficient in planning the work they are involved in. I appeal to the Minister therefore to put on a regular basis the question of funding of the rape crisis centres in all the towns where they are located.  I understand there is a centre in Tralee which according to this reply will not receive any funding this year.  There should be an ongoing policy in relation to the arrangements being made to remove the uncertainty so that they would know where they stand and those in charge could plan both for the medium and long term.  Naturally <Col N="364" /> they would also like a major increase in funding to be provided as well as taking the uncertainty out of it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister fully understands the points I made and I appreciate he came to the House to deal with the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Connell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise to Deputy Noonan for the inadequate reply he received on 19 February.  I hope I shall be able to clarify matters tonight.</P>
      <P>The extent of rape and child sexual abuse in our society is an issue which we have had to face in recent years.  The work of rape crisis centres has focused our attention on the trauma of rape and child sexual abuse and the need to support the victims.  I recognise the valuable contribution made by the rape crisis centres in supporting the victims of rape and sexual abuse.  There is increasing recognition in the health services of the complementary role of the work of the rape crisis centres in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford with that of the statutory health services in providing a comprehensive service for victims of rape and sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The rape crisis centres were funded from a number of different sources over the years.  Funding was uncertain from year to year.  My predecessors as Minister for Health, Deputies O'Hanlon and O'Rourke, recognised that this was unsatisfactory for the work of the centres. Following a Government decision last July, funding for the centres in 1992 and future years is being channelled through the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding in 1992 for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre will amount to £152,000 and funding for the centres at Cork, Galway, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford will amount to £25,000 each.  Included in the grant to the Dublin centre is a sum of £25,000 towards the cost of the education and training programmes run by the centre which will benefit professionals in the health services who are in contact with victims of rape and sexual abuse.  In total, the rape crisis centres this year <Col N="365" /> will recieve funding of £277,000 from the health services.</P>
    <P>The Deputy might be interested to know the range of services available to people who have been raped or sexually abused.  Specialist investigation and treatment services for such persons are available at the Sexual Assault Unit, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin.  The unit provides facilities for the effective collection and processing of forensic evidence and a structured environment for the examination and treatment of victims of sexual assault and rape.  This service is designed primarily to meet the needs of the population within the functional area of the Eastern Health Board but is available, where necessary, to persons resident in other health board areas.  Victims of sexual assault and rape outside the Eastern Health Board would, of course, have access to local general hospital services for medical examination and treatment.</P>
    <P>In the case of child and adolescent victims of sexual assault and rape, investigation and treatment facilities are in operation at specialist units located in the Children's Hospital, Temple Street and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin.  Outside the Eastern Health Board area, a special allocation was made during 1988 to each of the other seven health boards for the purpose of establishing appropriate services in their respective areas.  Services are now in place in each health board.</P>
    <P>Following medical assessment and treatment in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault and rape, victims, including those who become pregnant as a result of rape, are referred to support services, both statutory and voluntary, for on-going counselling and support to deal with the trauma of the assault.  Multidisciplinary teams of health professionals in each health board area provide the necessary psychological support services for victims.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to providing services to the unfortunate victims of rape and sexual abuse.  To this end it is my intention that the statutory services should work in tandem with the voluntary services to ensure that a comprehensive <Col N="366" /> service is established for these victims.</P>
    <P>I will heed what Deputy Noonan said and I will see to it that there will not be a hand to mouth approach in regard to the centres.  We shall ensure that the proper funding is provided in the budget for the health services.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak very briefly on the proposed transfer of customs officers from their present locations in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  The transfer will create great disruption in the family lives of the officers who, long ago, established their roots in my constituency.</P>
      <P>A total of 327 persons are affected by the move, 70 staff and their families. Their loss will be keenly felt by the communities; 57 of these families live within a 15 miles radius of Monaghan town.  One can imagine the effect on the property market if 57 houses were for sale at the same time.  County Monaghan has not figured in the Government's decentralisation plans to date and the Minister now has an opportunity to tackle this.  He should decentralise a small section of the Department of Finance &mdash; or some other Department &mdash; to Monaghan town to absorb these officers so that they and their families can continue to enjoy life as they always have.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>We are informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on current decisions and assumptions, they estimate that about 604 jobs will be lost in Customs and Excise following the completion of the Internal Market on 1 January 1993.  The impact of the Internal Market changes falls unevenly on Customs and Excise locations.  Understandably areas with a heavy customs preventive work element will suffer most.  The Revenue Commissioners recognise that the Border area is in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are <Col N="367" /> endeavouring, with the co-operation of all the Civil Service unions, to find work for all the surplus staff in their present locations.  As the Minister said in his budget speech, it is essential that the surplus Customs and Excise staff are used to the maximum in the continued drive for better collection and enforcement of taxes and detection of evasion and avoidance. Full co-operation and flexibility will be required from the staff unions to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have put foward specific proposals for the absorption of surplus staff within the Revenue Commissioners through the expansion of some existing functions of the Customs and Excise service, especially the strengthening of the common external frontier, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved Common Agricultural Policy control and post importation audit work.  Included in these proposals is the involvement of Customs and Excise staff in new areas of work which will arise post-1992 and which have the potential to provide substantial employment opportunities.  One such area involves the collection of Community intrastat statistics and the VAT information exchange system.  The Government have already decided to give the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for this new work which will generate over 100 jobs.  The Revenue Commissioners have also made proposals to Government for a major role for Revenue in the administration of a new motor vehicle taxation system and the Government's decision on this matter will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>Pending the Government decision on motor vehicle taxation and the completion of the necessary negotiations with the unions concerned, the Revenue Commissioners have not yet decided where to locate the administrative centres for the new work areas in question.  I can, however, assure the House and the Deputies who approached me on this matter that the Border area, being one of the areas which has a particularly severe surplus staff problem, will be high on the <Col N="368" /> list of priority locations for new work, or any other option, which will alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have put much effort into designing a strategy, the ultimate aim of which is to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, a career is provided for all Customs and Excise staff in, or close to, their present locations.  In keeping the human and domestic factors to the forefront, I hope that through cooperative flexibility on all sides this aim can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  I hope that having further considered this matter over the next six months or so, County Monaghan will figure in any decisions made by the Minister in regard to movement of staff.</P>
      <P>My second matter relates to a similar problem in regard to the Ordnance Survey Office field officers.  As the Minister is aware, a number of Ordnance Survey field officers from the north-east have to travel to Longford to carry out their work.  The Minister is also well aware that this arrangement is not at all suitable for the officers in question.  It takes too long to travel to Longford and back in a day.</P>
      <P>A number of options are open to these officers.  Indeed, some officers have already returned to Dublin.  The officers who have remained in the north-east have the option of either living in Longford from Monday to Friday and travelling home at weekends or moving to Longford.  Regardless of what option they take, as we can see entire families will be put under severe stress and family life will be seriously disrupted.  Moving house can be very awkward.  In some cases the officers' wives have permanent jobs in the area in which they now live. Therefore, it would be asking an awful lot of the family to ask them to move to Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only a small number of officers are involved at this stage.  I suggest that a small office, similar to the office which has been opened in Sligo, should be opened in the north-east.  The reorganisation <Col N="369" /> of the service will save the Department of Finance a great deal of money.  Therefore, it should be possible to find £5,000 to solve this problem.  I am certain that tomorrow morning a suitable office could be found in Carrickmacross or Dundalk, whichever town the Department believe is most suitable.  The Minister would be doing a wonderful job if he decided to do this.  I can guarantee the Minister that space would be found for this office and I hope he takes this option. I understand that the quantity of machinery and equipment required is quite small.  The opening of such an office would be a very cheap exercise and would be of wonderful benefit to the officers and their families.  I hope the Minister takes my suggestion on board.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to outline for this House the current position of the Ordnance Survey Office.  One of the commercial realities now faced by the Ordnance Survey Office is that the funds allocated by the State must be expanded in the most cost effective and productive manner; another is that the needs of the market must be supplied and yet another critical one is that consumers of the products supplied by the Ordnance Survey Office must be prepared to pay for that product.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the Ordnance Survey Office spend about £8 million a year, including capital investment, but they effectively earn only about £2.5 million a year in revenue from all sources.  Therefore, we have a State business supplying a product at an annual loss of some £5.5 million a year to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, it was necessary to review the operation of the Ordnance Survey Office and a very careful and detailed review took place in recent years.  There were two principal questions to be answered: first, were the Ordnance Survey Office producing the products the market wanted and, second, is production handled in the most economical and cost effective way?  The answer to the first question was that one major product required by the tourist and <Col N="370" /> security industry was not being supplied &mdash; the 1:50,000 series &mdash; and the Ordnance Survey Office were instructed to start producing this.</P>
    <P>On the second question, the answer was in the negative.  Until recently maps were produced completely by field observation and the results were manually compiled and stored in the Ordnance Survey Office's head office in the Phoenix Park.  Over the last number of years, technological progress has allowed for the field results to be translated digitally by computer into map form.  The 1:50,000 series, to which I have just referred, is produced by way of extremely expensive and complicated machinery which translates aerial surveys into stored data in the computer, so field work is reduced to a minimum.  In addition, the pace of technological progress in the whole area is so rapid now that the whole procedure for producing the other mapping products &mdash; the large scale urban and rural maps &mdash; will change dramatically.  Much of the basic work can be done by the use of imagery, consisting of both aerial photography and of satellite data, for compiling the basic product, with the result that the need to have personnel laboriously observing and measuring data in the field will be virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>Because of this, the management of the Ordnance Survey Office decided to transfer all the field staff back to their established headquarters in Dublin.  A problem then arose because some of these officers, despite being required to make themselves available for transfer if and when required, expressed unwillingness to move.  At this point I should mention that staff on field work get the benefit of generous field allowances. These allowances are, in part, intended to compensate field officers for the liability to move to different work locations from time to time.  Also, staff in receipt of field allowances are not entitled to these allowances or removal expenses on returning to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In order to minimise the disruptive effects on staff and on the work of the Ordnance Survey Office, the Minister for <Col N="371" /> Finance agreed to the establishment of six small regional offices to accommodate as many of the field staff as possible. Following recommendations submitted by the management of the Ordnance Survey Office, offices have been sanctioned for Cork, Ennis, Tuam, Kilkenny, Sligo and Longford and the field staff in question have been given the maximum flexibility as to whether to return to their established headquarters in Dublin or to transfer to the new regional offices.  Removal expenses for transfer to these new headquarters has <Col N="372" /> also been agreed.  Unfortunately, with the best will in the world it is impossible to ensure that every field officer would be able to remain at his present location. I thought that everyone involved would have liked to transfer to Longford as that area has become so important in recent times.  The fact is that the nature of the work and organisation of these offices dictate that only six offices can be established; any further offices would simply not be viable.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 March 1992.</P>

      <P>I am strongly in favour of the development of Temple Bar as Dublin's cultural quarter which is now being implemented.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the development is proceeding on the basis of a partnership between the local community represented by Temple Bar Development Council, the local authority, Dublin Corporation, and central Government, represented primarily by my Department.</P>
      <P>Two companies have been established by Government to implement the project, Temple Bar Renewal Ltd., chaired by the Lord Mayor of Dublin in office whose essential function is now to decide which development proposals merit the incentives provided by the Government for the Temple Bar area in the Finance Act, 1991 and Temple Bar Properties Ltd., whose essential function is to act as the cultural and property development company for the Temple Bar area on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked that, in the case of both <Col N="51" /> these companies, the directors, who are appointed by the Taoiseach, should declare any interest they have in the Temple Bar area, or outside it, which might give rise to conflict with the operation of the company of which they are directors.  This is being done.  I am, otherwise, fully satisfied with the legislative and structural basis for the development of Temple Bar.</P>

      <P>Financial participation by employees can make a contribution to effective personnel policies but it has to be viewed in the context of the particular circumstances of each company.  I would take the view that financial participation should not be seen as a substitute but should form part of an overall approach to sound personnel policies, in which other measures are also necessary for the achievement of increased worker motivation and harmonious industrial relations.  Financial participation must, therefore, be set in a broader context involving communication and consultation between management and workers on all aspects of the business.</P>
      <P>The budget decision to abolish the tax incentives associated with employee share schemes was based on a Government commitment to undertake a radical overhaul of the entire tax code.  This overhaul, involving a systematic curtailment of tax exemptions, shelters and allowances, is designed to ensure that income in whatever form it may be received is subject to tax and is taxed on a broadly comparable basis.  One of the factors which influenced the budget decision was that in many cases the schemes were tax driven rather than participation driven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the budget, I have received representations from FIE and ICTU and also from individual companies and trade unions, stressing their view that the schemes cannot be viewed totally from a tax perspective.  They have argued that account should be taken of the fact that the schemes can act as a significant work incentive, foster co-operation and <Col N="55" /> increase identity with the firm.  While I cannot at this stage give any commitments, I can assure the House that all aspects of the issues involved in offering fiscal incentives to encourage financial participation by employees will be fully considered in the context of the Government's intention to overhaul the entire tax code.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 56, 83 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on <Col N="56" /> Mental Handicap Service entitled <i>Needs and Abilities</i> is being considered by my Department on an ongoing basis and initial discussions have taken place with the Department of Health on the recommendations in it.</P>
    <P>The report recommends among other things that my Department should in future play a greater role in the training and employment of intellectually disabled persons capable of and suitable for open employment.</P>
    <P>FÁS courses are already open to such disabled persons and a number have completed training successfully.  In addition the Youthreach programme for early school leavers provided jointly by FÁS and the Department of Education is open to persons with general learning difficulties.  FÁS are also piloting a two year course in Galway for mentally handicapped persons with a view to establishing whether more such people can be catered for on their mainline programmes.</P>
    <P>In considering any proposals for changes in the delivery of services for the disabled I will have the benefits accruing to the disabled themselves from any such change uppermost in my mind.  I should say at this stage, however, that taking account of the present serious unemployment position in the country I am not convinced that a change from the present specialist services provided under the Department of Health to the general services provided through my Department for unemployed persons and first time job seekers would be in the best interests of mentally handicapped or other disabled persons seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to mention that the new job training and employment subsidy schemes announced by me last week make specific provision for disabled persons registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The data requested has been prepared in the form of a tabular statement which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme commenced in 1977.  Many changes have been made over the years in the scheme <Col N="58" /> and as a result the expenditure figures for the various years are not strictly comparable. The scheme was administered directly by my Department up to and including 1987 and the Exchequer expenditure was therefore the cash cost of the scheme with any ESF aid being accounted for as Appropriations-in-Aid in the Department's Vote.  FÁS assumed responsibility for the scheme from January 1988 and the Exchequer figures since then represent the net cost of the scheme after provision is made for the ESF assistance going directly to FÁS. In respect of the years 1988 to 1991, inclusive, the scheme attracted £7 million approximately ESF aid.</P>
    <P>Following an evaluation of the scheme in 1987, it was decided to limit participation to the long term unemployed, early school leavers and other disadvantaged groups.  However, the purpose of the scheme is still to encourage the recruitment of additional employees by employers.  The rates of subsidy payable at present are £60 for the long term unemployed and £45 for the other categories and are payable for 39 weeks.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce legislation to provide for the prohibition of age limits in recruitment advertising as I do not believe that the introduction of additional regulations would be an appropriate means of countering negative perceptions among some employers about the capabilities of older workers.</P>
      <P>Where a legislative approach has been adopted, as in the USA, it stemmed from demographic concerns and fears about the practice of prematurely terminating the employment of older people.  No similar circumstances apply in Ireland, where the demographic structure is markedly different to that in the USA in the late sixties.</P>
      <P>The commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to increase upper age limits for recruitment to the public service is being implemented.  This will provide a stimulus to both the wider public and private sectors.  The upper age limits for recruitment to most posts have been increased to 50 years for the Civil Service, health boards and local authorities.</P>

      <P>Job-sharing can make a contribution to the more equitable sharing of existing employment.</P>

      <P>I have seen the references to employers' attitudes to recruiting long term unemployed people, as quoted in the report in question.</P>
      <P>The conclusion drawn was based on the comments of the chief or senior executives of 15 large-scale employers. It does not follow that they would be representative of employers generally or of the owners of small and medium-sized business in particular.</P>
      <P>As pointed out in the report the reality is that, with such an extensive labour surplus, employers may be reluctant to contemplate recruiting people who have been out of work for a long time when there is a ready supply of young and, perhaps, better educated school leavers available locally to select from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was against this background that a number of schemes, such as the social <Col N="62" /> employment scheme, were formulated to assist the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I would also refer to the area-based response to long term unemployment, adopted under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The response envisages a major contibution from employers.  The integrated approach adopted under that strategy is now being implemented in 12 locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Further measures to assist the long term unemployed rejoin the work force are at an advanced stage of formulation by the Task Force on Employment.</P>

      <P>The NESC report entitled &ldquo;Women's Participation in the Irish Labour Market&rdquo; was published in January last.  The report provides an analytical contribution to certain aspects of policies affecting female labour force participation.  The central policy issues raised in the report <Col N="63" /> fall into three main areas: taxation, social welfare and child care services for working parents.  The Government issued a statement on 28 January welcoming this report by the National Economic and Social Council and responding briefly to the policy issues raised in the report.</P>
      <P>As regards those issues which concern the development of childcare services, the consultants' study commissioned by the NESC acknowledged the many different forms of childcare and identified day care facilities as only one form of provision among many.  The study did not address the balance between different forms of care, such as day-care centres, childminding, playgroups, kindergartens, work-based nurseries, and so on, but focused on the broader question of providing financial support to childcare.  Overall Government responsibility for the general welfare of children rests with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  The Child Care Act, 1991 contains new provisions for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services for children.  Regulations are being prepared which will give the health boards the lead responsibility for that task.</P>
      <P>Child care services are identified in the council's report as a significant factor affecting married women's decisions about participation in the workforce.</P>
      <P>In the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government acknowledged the need for a policy to encourage the development of child care services as a collective responsibility. This not only calls for a co-ordinated response on the part of the different Government Departments involved, but will also necessitate collaboration with employer and community interests.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provided for the introduction of childcare facilities on a progressive basis in the public service with the State providing the physical facilities and the staff paying the running costs.  In the context of Civil Service, this matter has been progressed and it is hoped to open the first such facility in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> A Working Party on Childcare for Working Parents was established in 1990 to devise specific recommendatons for the development of childcare partnerships; between parents, local employers and community groups.  I look forward to receiving this report shortly.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the Government consider that satisfactory national childcare services have a double effect on employment &mdash; they make it possible for mothers to remain in or return to the labour market and they also provide a new employment demand for child-minders and carers.  Accordingly, the Government have requested the Task Force on Employment to examine and make recommendations on the employment implications and potential of a national childcare system, including measures to develop training and related facilities to ensure that there is a proficient and adequate supply of persons qualified to be employed in this system.</P>
    <P>On the basis of their assessment of the report of the working party and the recommendations of the Task Force on Employment, the Government will develop specific policies to promote and improve childcare services for working parents.</P>

    <P>Neither in the Charter nor in the Commission's Action Programme is any reference made to the concept of a minimum <Col N="66" /> wage.  The Charter refers to the introduction of an equitable wage sufficient to enable workers to have a decent standard of living.  The Commission has acknowledged that the interpretation of decent would vary within as well as between member states.  It is made clear, moreover, that not only would the Commission be refraining from fixing such a wage it would not be appropriate for it to define decent even in qualitative terms.  The action programme leaves decisions in this area up to member states and both sides of industry.  The Commission propose to issue an opinion on an equitable wage and this is expected to be available shortly.</P>

      <P>Statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for hairdressers, including apprentice hairdressers, are applicable in the county and county borough of Dublin, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, the urban district of Bray and the Cork county borough.  These minima, set out in employment regulation orders made by the Labour Court, are negotiated and agreed by two Joint Labour Committees, representative of both trade unions and employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department have been active in enforcing the provision of these orders both in terms of routine inspections and inspections on a complaint basis.  Over the past three years it has carried out a total of almost 2,000 inspections of hairdressing premises in the areas covered by the orders and <Col N="67" /> has recovered some £38,000 on behalf of employees who were being under-paid.</P>
    <P>If it is considered that the statutory minima for hairdressers should be extended to the entire country, it is open to the ICTU or individual trade unions to apply to the Labour Court to have the scope of the existing committee extended or to have a new committee established.</P>
    <P>One of the new provisions introduced in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 allows the Labour Relations Commission to carry out periodic reviews with a view to ascertaining whether new Joint Labour Committees should be established or existing ones extended.  This and other measures in the 1990 Act are designed to ensure that the Joint Labour Committee system functions efficiently and effectively and adequately addresses the problem of low pay where it exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it has been the policy of successive Governments, including the present Administration, to create an economic environment which facilities and encourages investment as a means of stimulating viable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government's overall <Col N="69" /> strategy for achieving the twin objectives of greater economic growth and expansion of employment, as endorsed by the social partners, is set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> under the title &ldquo;Strategy for the Nineties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the programme points out, responsibility for creating a favourable environment for generating jobs rests with several Ministers and development agencies.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, over the past five years, the Government have been very successful in transforming the economy. Unfortunately, employment growth has not matched economic development.  We also had to contend with an increase of 25,000 in the labour force annually, as well as an influx of returning emigrants.</P>
    <P>Over the years, my Department have initiated a whole range of programmes and incentives, administered by FÁS and CERT, to encourage employers to take on workers.  The Deputy will be aware that I recently launched two new FÁSsponsored programmes aimed at assisting an additional 25,000 unemployed persons to find employment or job training.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the improvements that have taken place in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Irish labour law is in many respects less demanding than the equivalent legislation in many of our competitor countries. Indeed it is a fact that many of the countries with the most demanding labour law regimes have the highest levels of employment.  Therefore it is not axiomatic that labour law provisions inhibit job creation.</P>
    <P>As regards the worker protection legislation administered by my Department, I am of the view that this has no significant adverse impact on job creation.  Indeed it can be argued that this legislation, which provides basic protection to workers and clear avenues of appeal in cases of dispute, has been a significant factor in the greatly improved industrial relations climate in this country.  The existence of this legislation removes much of the justification for recourse to industrial action <Col N="70" /> in situations involving breaches of individual worker's rights.</P>
    <P>The view that labour legislation is not a major inhibitor of job creation was supported by the results of a study conducted by the ESRI at the request of the Department of Labour in 1986.  The study examined the possible disincentive effects of employment protection legislation and found that factors other than labour legislation, are the major influences on employers' decisions concerning recruitment.  Indeed, just over 15 per cent of employers mentioned labour legislation as a main factor in their decision not to recruit.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to review a number of areas of labour legislation during the life of the programme.  In my view any significant amendments in labour law should only be carried out with full consultation with the social partners.  I will pursue this course with any initiatives which I may take in this area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that the Taoiseach has already intimated to the House that he intends to bring forward shortly further proposals on the Government's approach to job creation.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions of the registered agreement is a matter for the employers concerned in the first instance. However, the labour inspectorate of my Department carries out inspections of security companies covered by the Registered Employment Agreement for the Security Industry to ensure compliance <Col N="71" /> with the agreement.  In 1991 the inspectorate carried out 69 inspections of security companies covered by the agreement and recovered arrears of wages of £4,608 in respect of eight employees in three companies.  Legal proceedings have been instituted and are currently awaiting hearing against two security companies which appear to have breached the agreement.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Labour, I have no statutory control over the terms and conditions applied by State and semi-State bodies when security contracts are being awarded.  However, I would naturally be especially concerned if security companies which hold contracts from State and semi-State bodies were in breach of the agreement.  In order to ensure that such a situation would not arise, my colleague, the Minister for Finance in his capacity as Minister for Labour, wrote to the relevant Ministers in April 1990 about the matter.  In his letter, Minister Ahern indicated that companies which were covered by the agreement should be required by all State bodies granting contracts to give an undertaking that they fully comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and he requested that an appropriate clause be included to that effect on all contracts being granted to private sector companies covered by the agreement.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any security company in respect of contracts undertaken either in the public or private sectors, which is not in compliance with the agreement, I would appreciate if he would give me the name of the company responsible and I will ensure that the matter is investigated and appropriate action is taken.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 54 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the 1989 Social Charter did not arise as a subject of discussion between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister at their recent meeting.</P>
      <P>At the Strasbourg Summit in December 1989, the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers was adopted as a solemn political declaration by the Heads of State and of Government of all member states with the sole exception of the UK.  Ireland fully supports the concept of the Social Charter, and the thinking behind it, which is that the Single Market must be accompanied by a positive social dimension.</P>
      <P>The Social Charter is being implemented through a Commission Action Programme which comprises 47 separate initiatives.  We are co-operating constructively in the examination of each proposal submitted to the Council under the programme, seeking to achieve a fair balance between desirable social progress in the interests of workers and the capacity of employers and governments to undertake the corresponding obligations. We assess each proposal by reference to its implications for employment in Ireland because employment is the overriding social priority.</P>
      <P>I might point out that the United Kingdom has continued to play a very active role in the negotiation of the various proposals which have been brought forward under the Social Action Programme and that its representatives have already indicated their support, in principle, for most of the proposals &mdash; subject of course to the usual detailed negotiations.</P>

      <P>So far as I am aware, four semi-State bodies/companies have childcare facilities. In addition, employees of another semi-State body have the use of a creche.</P>
      <P>The monitoring system on equal opportunity initiatives in the public sector indicates that a number of semi-State bodies are examining the feasibility of providing childcare facilities for employees.</P>
      <P>I think it is important to emphasise that the provision of work-based creches is by no means the only option available to employers who wish to assist employees in relation to their childcare needs. Already there is a wide range of alternative strategies for providing childcare being pursued to suit different circumstances. The range of alternative options will be highlighted in the report of the Working Party on Childcare for Working Parents which will be completed after Easter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 58 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>The original allocation of the social employment scheme in 1991 envisaged a participation level of 10,000 at year end.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting between the Government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 5 June 1991, the then Taoiseach announced new measures which would help the employment situation including, <i>inter alia,</i> an increase of 2,500 participants on the social employment scheme (SES) by the end of the year.  The number of participants has been increasing gradually as a result of this decision and on 31 December last, there were 12,344 on the social employment scheme.  The increased numbers cost about £3.5 million and this was met by Exchequer sources including savings elsewhere in FÁS.  There are, of course, offsetting savings in the Department of Social Welfare vote as all participants on the scheme come from the live register.</P>

      <P>The social employment scheme is directed at long term unemployed persons over 25 who are either in receipt of unemployment assistance or in receipt of unemployment benefit for 12 months. The rationale is that expenditure on the scheme is offset by savings in unemployment compensation payments.  Persons not in receipt of unemployment compensation payments are therefore not eligible to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> provides, in paragraph 124, section V, that the live register requirements in the case of women applicants <Col N="76" /> should be relaxed to facilitate women to wish to return to the workforce. This recommendation has been under active consideration and I am pleased to advise the Deputy that persons signing for credits are eligible to participate in the new job training and employment subsidy schemes provided that they have been on the live register for at least eight weeks immediately preceding recruitment.</P>

      <P>The employment subsidy scheme and the job training scheme announced in the budget are now in operation.  The first participants have been recruited under the employment subsidy scheme.</P>
      <P>The employment subsidy scheme is a marginal wage subsidy scheme based on increases over the firms' November 1991 employment level.  The scheme takes account of the experience gained during the administration of similar schemes since the mid seventies.  The existing employment incentive scheme is targeted at the long term unemployed and early school leavers.  The employment incentive scheme has been a feature of our manpower arrangements for some time and I expect it to continue as a permanent feature in the long term.  The scheme will continue in parallel with the new employment subsidy scheme.</P>
      <P>The job training scheme is a new departure in this country in that we are supporting training on employers' premises for those on the live register for over eight weeks.  I can see the scheme becoming a permanent feature of our training arrangements.  The scheme should not have major implications for other training arrangements.  I would, however, hope to see some participants from Youthreach and similar programmes continue to the new scheme.  I also regard the new scheme as an additional and attractive alternative to existing training and employment schemes such as Teamwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the co-operation of the European Commission, the two schemes will not involve any additional Exchequer expenditure.  In the circumstances the <Col N="79" /> question of reallocation of Exchequer resources does not arise.</P>
    <P>We have set ambitious and challenging targets for participation on the two schemes.  The achievement of these targets is ultimately dependent on take-up by employers and I appeal to employers to avail of the schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>FÁS have given a high priority to identifying the manpower and training needs of industry.  In this connection, a number of major research projects are currently being undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference in the Industrial Policy Review Group is to a skills &ldquo;gap&rdquo; defined as the gap &ldquo;which exists between skill levels in firms in Ireland and those of best practice firms in competitor countries.&rdquo; In this connection, the group also concluded <Col N="80" /> that &ldquo;training for those at work is also deficient.&rdquo;  The group recognised that comparatively few short term skills shortages are reported by industrialists.</P>
    <P>Closing the skills &ldquo;gap&rdquo; is a more difficult task then correcting for a skills shortage.  It will involve efforts by our education and training authorities and, particularly, employers.  In this connection, a start has been made with the move to a standards based apprenticeship system, the Year of the Manager campaign to improve the awareness by industry of the value of management development and the job training scheme which provides for training on employers' premises.</P>
    <P>Further measures to narrow the skills gap are being considered in the context of the White Paper on Manpower Policy. I would, however, emphasise the central role of employers in continually ungrading the skills of their employees.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the Government agreed to institute an area-based response to the problem of long term unemployment. Progress has been made in co-operation with the social partners, and discussions are taking place with the EC Commission with a view to getting a global grant from the EC for the purpose of promoting local enterprise and development.  I can say that the response of the Commission has been very positive.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret for me that the social employment scheme is no longer eligible for ESF assistance and in the reform of the Structural Funds, post-1993, I intend to press for the reinstatement of SES-type programmes for eligibility.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the problem of re-integrating the long term unemployed is a difficult one, especially in a period of high general unemployment.  The problem is not simply a shortage of EC finances.  It is often difficult to get long term unemployed persons to go on training courses, even when the courses are specially provided for them.</P>
      <P>The discussions on the expansion of the EC Structural Funds for the post-1993 period have just commenced in the Council of Ministers.  The Government will be pressing for a substantial increase in the funds for the less developed member states and I am confident that we can secure a significant increase for the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The proposal that the Structural Funds should assist the two new initiatives <i>viz</i> the employment subsidy scheme and the job training scheme was first broached by the former Taoiseach with the President of the EC Commission, in November 1991, in the context of discussion on the forthcoming European Council at Maastricht. The initial response of the President of the Commission was positive and it was decided to have the proposal followed up at official level to examine, (a) how the schemes should be implemented to secure optimum results and (b) how they should be funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC team for the discussions were drawn from five separate Commission Directorates and the Irish officials were from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Labour and Finance.  Meetings were held on 13, 16, 21 January and 24 February 1992.  The social partners, FÁS and CERT were involved in some of the meetings and a continuing liaison was maintained between these bodies and my Department.  From the outset the Commission officials were insistent that, if the schemes were to attract ESF assistance <Col N="86" /> on the scale requested, they should be genuine initiatives designed to tackle our unemployment problem, that they be well implemented and monitored and that they should satisfy the legal and financial regulations governing the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>As regards the employment subsidy scheme, the Commission accepted that the scheme was a worthwhile initiative designed to meet the particularly acute unemployment situation in Ireland at the present time.  They considered that the target figure of 15,000 was an ambitious one, but after discussion agreed to provide assistance at 75 per cent towards the weekly subsidy of £54 per week per worker, for a period of 52 weeks.  The general conditions for participation in the scheme, which I have already announced, were discussed and agreed with the Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards the job training scheme, the Commission considered that this was a very important development in training in Ireland, where traditionally the amount of in-firm training carried out on employers' premises, has been low.  For this reason the Commission was anxious to ensure that the scheme proposed was a genuine training scheme which would provide the trainees with real qualifications and was not a &ldquo;cheap labour&rdquo; scheme.  In order to satisfy the Commission that this indeed was our proposal, detailed discussions were held to establish the procedures to establish training standards, including the training of trainers, for the content of curricula and for certification of qualifications acquired.  The procedures for monitoring of the training had to be agreed as well as follow up procedures for the ultimate placement of the trainees.</P>
    <P>Eventually, an agreement was reached with the Commission officials on the implementation and monitoring arrangements which satisfied them that the scheme would operate as a genuine training scheme.</P>
    <P>I personally finalised and agreed the arrangements in a meeting with Ms. <Col N="87" /> Papandreou the EC Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs in Brussels on 24 February 1992.  The scheme will have three major characteristics &mdash; agreement of a training plan between FÁS and the enterprise, structured training and supervision.  The Commission will reimburse 75 per cent of the training allowances paid to the trainees, with the employers contributing the remaining 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>While the discussions with the Commission on the job training scheme were at times difficult, I am satisfied that in the end they resulted in a very good scheme which will provide, genuine high quality training and which I hope will become an important part of our vocational training system.</P>

      <P>The Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 was enacted in response to concerns that a growing segment of workers in regular part-time employment remained outside the scope of a broad range of protective labour legislation.  The Act is designed to take into account both the legitimate needs of employers for flexibility in running their businesses and the real need of regular part-time workers for statutory protection in relation to their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no proposals to carry out a survey of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.  I am advised that the Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991 has not had, and is unlikely to have, any significant effect on the labour market.  In this connection, it is worthwhile to note that only 23 <Col N="88" /> redundancies of this category of employee have been notified to my Department since extension to them of the terms of the Redundancy Payments Acts, in June 1991.</P>
    <P>The kind of information on part-time working that the Deputy has in mind will be available in due course through the annual Labour Force Survey.  The results of the 1991 survey will be available later this year.  Those results and results in future years will give a clear indication of any changes in relation to part-time working since the Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, most part-time workers are women and I understand that research has also been commissioned by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Womens' Rights and this should also be available later this year.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will consider the results of these studies in due course.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Council has adopted a recommendation on child care.  This recommendation should stimulate interest in the promotion of more and better child care services and highlight the link between such provision and equality of opportunity.  The recommendation will encourage initiatives on the part of a combination of interests including the public authorities, the social partners and voluntary bodies in the interests of making good quality, accessible, and affordable arrangements for the children of working parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome in particular the acknowledgement in the recommendation of the need for the progressive development of such services.  It is highly significant that the recommendation recognises the importance of harnessing the contribution <Col N="89" /> of a diverse range of groups &mdash; including, in their respective responsibilities, the national authorities, the social partners and other community-based interests.  The thrust of the recommendation is fully in accord with the approach which the Government have adopted in promoting the provision of child care services for working parents as a shared responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Working Party on Child Care has been studying the terms of the Council Recommendation.  The report of the working party is expected shortly.  The Government recently confirmed, in response to the publication of the Report No. 91 of the National Economic and Social Council on Women's Participation in the Labour Market, that it would consider the findings of the working party and will develop specific policies and mechanisms to improve child care for working parents.</P>

      <P>In the Department of the Taoiseach Vote (Subhead J), £1 million is available to the Central Review Committee in 1992 under subhead J of the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach, for the area-based response to long term unemployment outlined in section VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This allocation is towards the staff and administration costs of the twelve area partnerships established in 1991 to pilot the initiative. The money is allocated to individual partnerships <Col N="91" /> on the basis of administration budgets submitted by them.</P>
      <P>The recent Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance indicated that the Government had agreed with the EC Commission that in keeping with the area-based strategy a new global grant for local development will be instituted. Details of the grant are being worked out in consultations between the Commission and the Irish authorities. £8 million has been mentioned by the Commission as being available in 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>The twelve partnerships are preparing area action plans which will identify projects such as those mentioned in the question and these will be submitted to the European Commission for assistance under the global grant.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council assist voluntary based groups as outlined hereunder, together with the means of application:</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Development of Community Centre</i></P>
      <P>The Arts Council do not normally offer funds for the development of community centres <i>per se</i>, where these are understood to be multi-purpose buildings.  The Arts Council reserve the bulk of their capital funds for major building projects which are arts-specific buildings such as arts centres and theatres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Arts Council offer limited funds to community level buildings. <Col N="92" /> For example, the Arts Council are working in association with Dublin County Council on the development of Tallaght Community Arts Centre, located right beside the Square.  The Arts Council gave grant-aid to Carrigallen Theatre, County Leitrim.  The Arts Council offered a small development grant to an arts group in Blanchardstown to help them to develop a community arts centre.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Means of application:</i> Organisations write to the Arts Council submitting a detailed capital expenditure budget.  The project has a much greater chance of success if the project is arts-specific and if the project has received offers of capital funding from the local authority.  In the area of community based buildings, the Arts Council normally take their lead from the local authority.</P>
    <P>(b) <i>Youth Activities and Women's Groups</i></P>
    <P>The Arts Council assist voluntary groups engaged in youth activities or composed of women in the following ways.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council run their artist in the community scheme which provides for the bringing together of an artist with a local community or youth group.  The Arts Council assist about seven such projects per annum.  The scheme enables the Arts Council to stay in touch with local community arts practice.  The following are examples of those who have received assistance.</P>

    <P>The 1992 Central Statistics Office Training Programme has been prepared. It is hoped to expand the range of training courses to be given this year to include development courses for both clerical and supervisory grades.  In general there will be an increased emphasis on training in the context of the decentalisation of the Central Statistics Office to Cork.</P>
    <P>The number of staff who attended courses at the Civil Service Training Centre was 21, 12 and 12 respectively in 1989, 1990 and 1991.</P>
    <P>The above courses do not include, (a) those which are directly funded by the Central Statistics Office and to which officers are directed to attend as part of their work training, 88 in 1991 and (b) those courses organised by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and attended by officers of the Central Statistics Office, eight in 1991.</P>
    <P>The number of staff paid a refund in respect of attendance at educational courses leading to the award of degrees, certificates and other qualifications are as follows:</P>

      <Quest>his views on the criticism made in the Culliton report of the poor execution of industrial policy (p.63); whether the Telesis report's recommendations were largely ignored by his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report says at the page (63) to which the Deputy refers &ldquo;that the execution of policy in regard to industrial promotion still remains diffuse&rdquo;.  The report goes on to say that: &ldquo;partly this is due to the fact that the State sector has tried to pull so many levers to promote industrial expansion that the net effect of the different instruments is difficult to discern.  Policy measures have been adopted without adequate regards to consistency and without a clear and unified policy agenda&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree that the execution of industrial policy in relation to industrial promotion has been, and still remains, somewhat diffuse.  Similar conclusions were arrived at in the Review of Industrial Performance prepared by my Department and published a little over a year ago. At the time of publication I announced certain decisions on these matters including: that the IDA would function as the sole overseas industrial promotion agency for Ireland in order to avoid overlaps and confusion in the minds of potential industrial investors; that the activities of NADCORP and the IDA would be more closely integrated to provide a more cohesive and integrated approach to State equity investment in enterprise and that CTT and the Irish Goods Council (IGC) would be merged to form a new Irish marketing agency as part of a more coherent approach to the provision of marketing support services by State agencies.</P>
      <P>These changes have all been put into effect.  I am now examining how the further recommendations in the Culliton report can be made to work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I can assure the Deputy that the recommendations of the Telesis report published were not largely ignored by my Department &mdash; nor does the Culliton report say this.  A comprehensive White Paper &mdash; a decision document on industrial policy &mdash; was prepared by the Department and published by the Government in 1984.  It put into effect many of the recommendations of Telesis. This is fully recognised in the Culliton report which says clearly:</P>
    <P>Responding to Telesis, the policy changes of the mid-1980s introduced the first significant changes in emphasis. Some new schemes of assistance were introduced, there were modification in others, and there were changes in the structure of agencies engaged in industrial promotion.</P>
    <P>Probably the most notable change was the shift away from fixed-asset grants, which were partly substituted by greater availability of employment grants and by financial aid through the form of equity or preference share finance, loan guarantees and the like...</P>
    <P>Other initiatives included the introduction of a National Linkage Programme (1985), a refocusing of IIRS (later merged with the NBST to become EOLAS) towards industry with the introduction of the Technology Acquisition Grant scheme in 1986, reorientation of CTT's marketing supports, with an emphasis on strengthening the export marketing function in firms rather than on shorter-term logistics, and the regionalisation of the Small-Industries Programme of the IDA.  Finally, a major inter-agency initiative, the Company Development Programme was introduced with the objective of assisting the strategic planning and development of selected companies (mainly indigenous) which were thought to have longer-term potential.</P>
    <P>This refocused industrial policy was accompanied by a sharp decline in the volume of direct Government spending although the cost of tax incentives increased also.  There are alternative <Col N="111" /> ways of measuring this Government spending but they all show the same pattern.  Between 1985 and 1989 the total industry budget (direct expenditure) fell from about £390 million of £317 million (even without correction for inflation).  Despite this decline, industrial performance improved sharply in the later 1980s by comparison with the first half of the decade.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report is an important and far-reaching document.  It provides an agenda for some fundamental changes about how we think and act about the development process in this country.  It is important, therefore, that when we consider it the discussion should be about what is actually in the report itself rather than any, perhaps, subjective interpretations of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <P>(2) and (3) <i>Nature, number, grade and duration of courses in 1991:</i> (a) 1 CA Induction Course for 2 days (10 participants); (b) 4 CA Development Courses for 1 day (40 participants); (c) 2 CA/CO Development Courses for 1 day (15 CA, 9 CO); (d) 1 EO/HEO Communications Skills Course for 3 hours per week for 14 weeks (5 EOs, 7 HEOs); (e) 1 AP/PO Communications Skills Course for 3 hours per week for 10 weeks (10 APs/6 POs); (f) 6 special language courses in French and German for all grades for 2 hours per week for 12 weeks (93 participants); (g) 3 talks on work of the Department for all grades (90 participants) 1½-2 hours duration for each talk.</P>
    <P>While the above courses were managed by the staff of the training unit, the following computer-related courses were given by staff from the Department's information technology unit.</P>
    <P>(a) Two courses in computer appreciation for all grades for two hours per day for five days each (44 participants); (b) Two courses in the use of Lotus software for all grades for one hour per day over four days each (48 participants).</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Plans for Developing Training Unit:</i> Following a review in 1991 of staff development needs, the staff numbers in the training unit were augmented.  As a result, since November 1991 a broadening of training courses has already taken place and will further expand as the staff in the training unit develop their expertise.  The budget for training has been signficantly increased in 1992 and this will permit a greater degree of both in-house and external courses to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Attendance at courses in the Civil Service Training Centre:</i> 1989, 203; 1990, 55; 1991, 209.</P>

      <P>The Western development fund exists to provide assistance for worthwhile and viable economic projects in the west of Ireland which are not eligible for consideration for assistance under any of the existing State programmes.  The fund is not specific to any particular type of project organisation and could therefore be available to assist a project proposed by suitably constituted group, provided it met all of the criteria for the administration of the fund.  The fund is administered on my behalf by the Central Development Committee and by the county development teams in the western counties.</P>

    <P>Voluntary groups may also be eligible <Col N="114" /> for EC Structural Funds assistance under the joint Interreg Programme for Ireland and Northern Ireland administered by my Department if they have projects which meet the specific criteria applying to the different measures in the programme which has as a general objective the encouragement of economic development in the Border areas.  In particular, the Regional Development Sub-programme of Interreg includes a community development measure with the objective of encouraging statutory and voluntary organisations in the Border areas to consider the developmental needs of particular areas at local level and to put forward proposals.</P>

      <P>If it is found that the Newry Road office and any spare capacity at the Carrickarnon offices is surplus to requirements the State's interest will be put on the open market for disposal.</P>

      <P>Merit pay applies in the Civil Service to the grade of Assistant Secretary and some other grades at that level.  The application of a system of merit pay for these grades was recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector (Report No. 30). While the question of extending the application of merit pay systems is constantly under review I have no specific proposals in this respect at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is being carried out under the powers conferred on the Commissioners of Public Works by the Shannon Navigation Act, 1990.  The works are being undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board who were delegated the functions of the commissioners in relation thereto by order of the Minister for Finance made pursuant to section 5 (9) of the Act.  The resolution of matters relating to the construction of the work is therefore a matter for the ESB and the landowners concerned.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are engaged in the compulsory acquisition of lands acquired in connection with the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The compulsory purchase procedures prescribed in the Act have been followed in relation to three of the four sections into which the project has been divided and a number of claims for compensation in respect of the lands involved have been <Col N="134" /> received from landowners concerned. These are being processed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 1990 Act and other legislation pertinent to compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>In assessing the compensation payable to any person the commissioners have regard to the market value of the land being acquired together with such other matters as severance, injurious affection and disturbance.  Any benefit to a holding arising out of the development must also be taken into account.  In this connection negotiations are ongoing with the various claimants, or their agents.  I am aware that farmer representatives have expressed disquiet at the level of compensation being offered for the land being acquired.  Indeed, I recently met a deputation from the Irish Farmers' Association to discuss this matter and further meetings between my officials and the IFA are taking place.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are concerned to ensure that claims for compensation are dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner, in particular that realistic settlement offers are made and that matters are processed expeditiously.</P>
    <P>If, notwithstanding the best efforts of the commissioners, claimants are dissatisified with either the amounts being offered or with the rate of progress of negotiations, it is open to them to have their cases referred to arbitration.</P>
    <P>The provision for reference of cases to arbitration is available under the Shannon Navigation Act 1990 because of the concern to ensure that affected landowners would be dealt with fairly.</P>

My Department has also provided small sums to certain organisations involved in the promotion of energy conservation and alternative energy.  Generally speaking, these contributions are made towards the costs of organising conferences and seminars.</P>
      <P>In relation to (h) rural enterprise and (n) setting up community co-ops., the forest service of my Department process requests under the forestry operational programme for structural aid for associations of persons exploiting woodland. All such proposals are considered on their merits and projects are selected for assistance on the basis of their capacity to: make a particular contribution to the development of the forestry sector or the expansion of the afforestation programme; cover needs not met by existing associations/facilities in the region in question; promote the consolidation of farm forestry in the region concerned.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is payable up to a maximum of 60 per cent of the eligible investment expenditure.</P>

      <P>None of the staff of my Department is <Col N="138" /> engaged full time on staff training. However, my Department has an Information Technology Unit which, among other things, caters for the computer training needs of the Department.  This unit is staffed by one assistant principal officer, one higher executive officer (systems analyst) and one clerical assistant.</P>
      <P>At present the other training requirements of my Department are met by attendance of staff at suitable courses arranged by the Civil Service Training Centre, the Institute of Public Administration and other organisations.  While the size of my Department would not justify a full-time staff training unit, the Personnel Division is planning to carry out certain in-house training on a part time basis.</P>
      <P>During 1991, the Information Technology Unit arranged 17 training courses which covered various computer software applications used within my Department. These courses varied in duration from one to three days.  The grades and numbers in each grade catered for on these courses were:</P>

      <P>The only other heading relevant to the Deputy's question relates to Bord Iascaigh Mhara grant schemes for pilot/commercial projects in the shellfish sector which in some cases do have a local community (i.e. co-operative) involvement. In a generic sense, all assistance for aquaculture projects comes under the rural enterprise heading.  However, since the Deputy has voluntary based groups in minds, the relevance is fairly limited. My Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be glad to advise all those interested in aquaculture development in relation to assistance and eligibility criteria, licensing together with technical matters.</P>

Training duties are shared with the other duties and functions of the division.

    <P>Applications for refund of fees are considered on completion of each academic year and in the light of the financial resources available to the Department under its training budget.  During 1990 and 1991 it was possible to refund fees in full to those pursuing approved courses. Where funds are limited the Department's policy is to refund 50 per cent of the fees claimed on application and to consider a full or partial refund of the balance at the end of the financial year.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána and especially the Garda Community Relations Section avail of every opportunity to encourage and assist the public to report all crimes including assaults.  Use is made of the Garda Patrol <Col N="142" /> programme, local radio broadcasts and of other media channels to encourage the public to report suspicious happenings and offences to the Garda.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the closer links which are being fostered with the community through community-based crime prevention schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert and Neighbourhood Policing, are of particular benefit in this respect and a strong emphasis is placed in the Garda recruit training programme on the necessity to enlist public co-operation and of course to encourage the reporting of crime.</P>
      <P>An important recent initiative, a Garda confidential telephone service which was introduced in January of this year, affords the public the opportunity of contacting the Garda in a way which some may perhaps prefer.  This is a freephone telephone number which is broadcast weekly on Garda Patrol and has been circulated to representatives of the neighbourhood watch schemes.  In addition, neighbourhood Garda actively promote the use of this service by the public.  This initiative is I hope of major assistance and encouragement to victims of crime.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied that the measures they have taken to encourage the reporting of crime are satisfactory. They are however keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>It would be a mistake of course to give the impression that responsibility for encouraging people to report crime is something which rests entirely with the Garda Síochána.  It is a responsibility which rests on all of us within our own social and working environments.  In the case of assaults on children, for example, where victims may be particularly reluctant or afraid to admit that the problem exists, there is an obligation on those closest to the child &mdash; parents, friends, teachers &mdash; to listen, be observant and if there is cause for concern to report. There is now a growing consciousness of this in the teaching and other professions and this is something which is certainly welcome and should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>The current Garda building programme was launched seven years ago to tackle the serious accommodation crisis which existed in many Garda stations.  The programme, which is based on priorities agreed following consultation with the Garda representative associations, has seen the replacement of eight divisional headquarters stations, 13 district headquarters stations, 30 smaller stations and the provision of four major extensions.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Cork West Garda division is concerned, new station buildings have been provided in recent years as follows: Bandon, Ballinhassig and Ballingeary. I might also mention that renovation works totalling some £43,000 were carried out at 17 stations in the division in 1991 and to date in 1992.  Other works authorised to date this year are replacement of windows and soffit in Stuake station, replacement of the roof in Dunmanway station, new ceilings for Kanturk station and painting and decoration of Knocknagree station.  Further improvements to Garda accommodation in the Cork West division will be provided over the coming years in the light of overall priorities and available finance.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the vast majority of gardaí have received at least some training in victim support and counselling.  For some years past, all Garda in-service courses, including community relations, neighbourhood watch and community policing courses have devoted time to training and advice on counselling and assisting victims of crime and equipping gardaí with the skills they need to deal effectively and sympathetically with crime victims.  All 1,000 trainee gardaí who have had the benefit of the new training programme in place at the Garda College since April 1989 have also had the benefit of extensive training for interaction with victims of crime and this training has included an important input from the Irish Association for Victim Support.</P>

I am informed by the commissioner <Col N="147" /> that the highest divisional expenditures on overtime for each of the years 1989 to 1991 were incurred in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The highest overtime budget in the current year has been allocated to the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>The lowest divisional expenditures on Garda overtime in the years 1989 and 1991 were in the Kerry division.  The lowest expenditure in 1990 was incurred in the Roscommon/Galway East division. The lowest overtime budget in the current year has been allocated to the Kerry division.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to be confusing two different incidents, but I shall endeavour to clarify the situation for him as best I can.</P>
      <P>There was a major heroin seizure in Palmerstown in 1986 &mdash; it occurred in Palmerstown Place rather than Palmerstown Park but I am assuming that this is the incident referred to in the Deputy's question.  I have to refute the suggestion that the gardaí did not pursue this case.  In fact the Garda authorities have informed me that the matter was the subject of a full investigation resulting in a successful prosecution before the courts and that a person &mdash; who is not the person named by the Deputy &mdash; is now serving a significant custodial sentence for this offence.  If the Deputy has any evidence that another person may have been involved in this offence he should bring it immediately to the attention of the Garda authorities for investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> The person named by the Deputy was arrested and charged following a heroin seizure in 1983 &mdash; this seizure, however, occurred in Milltown, not in Palmerstown. The seizure, while sizeable, was not on the scale of the subsequent Palmerstown seizure &mdash; I understand that the heroin was valued at £30,000 to £40,000, as against the figure of £400,000 mentioned by the Deputy and an estimated £250,000 in the Palmerstown case.</P>
    <P>The person accused following the Milltown seizure absconded before the case came to trail.  When he returned to this country recently, the Director of Public Prosecutions directed that a <i>nolle prosequi</i> be entered in respect of the 1983 ofference &mdash; he was, however, charged with a more recent drugs offence and is now serving a term of imprisonment in respect of that offence.</P>

      <P>Under the 1990 Companies Act I am responsible in the first instance for the remuneration of inspectors appointed by the High Court under sections 7 and 8 of the Act.  My Department have accordingly met the costs of the inquiry conducted by Inspectors Barry and Foley over the period 16 September 1991 to 24 February 1992.</P>
      <P>As previously stated by my predecessor in oral reply to Question No. 17 on 22 October 1991, the inspectors were each paid a fee of £1,750 in respect of every certified full day's work on the inquiry.  It was up to the inspectors themselves to determine whether they worked on Saturdays and Sundays; in practice, I understand, they normally did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition the inspectors incurred expenses in the course of their inquiry to cover such items as support staff, administrative and secretarial services, office expenses, engagement of legal services <Col N="159" /> both here and in England, stenographic and security services.  These were borne by my Department, where possible on the basis of actual vouched outlay or otherwise on terms agreed with the inspectors.</P>
    <P>To date a total of £801,366 in fees and expenses (including VAT) has already been paid out, broken down as indicated at Table A below.  It is estimated that a further £351,000 in fees and expenses <Col N="160" /> (including VAT) will also arise, in connection with the inquiry: a likely breakdown of these fees and expenses is indicated at Table B below.</P>
    <P>Under section 13(1) of the 1990 Companies Act, the High Court may direct that the costs borne by my Department be recouped.  I am anxious that the taxpayers should be relieved to the greatest extent possible of this burden and I will be seeking a direction from the court in favour of full recoupment.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible to disaggegate expenditure on the education service under the headings specified by the Deputy</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding which is provided for the general education services, funding is provided for voluntary groups as part of the programmes relating to youth, sport and adult education.  The funding in 1991 for these programmes was £9.8 million, £5.6 million and £0.244 million respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the voluntary groups <Col N="161" /> which organise pre-schools for traveller children receive 98 per cent grant aid from my Department towards the cost of tuition and transport.  The same level of support is provided in respect of transport organised by voluntary groups for traveller children to national schools.  In 1991, the total expenditure in these areas was £725,000 approximately.  These grants are paid where a need for the particular service has been identified by my Department's inspectorate.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £25,000 per annum is also being made from the disadvantaged <Col N="162" /> areas fund to the pre-school groups in those areas towards the cost of materials, equipment, etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 192 and 193 together.</P>
      <P>The terms of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 and 1978, apply to approved institutions as defined in the Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the 1968 Act, as amended by section 1 of the 1978 Act, defines an approved institution as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approved institution&rdquo; means a university, university college, or other institution of higher education in so far as it proves a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course or courses of which the Minister approves for the time being for the purposes of section 2 of this Act.</P>
      <P>In principle, higher education grants could be paid to eligible students on approved courses in designated private institutions but the financial and other implications need to be considered further before a decision can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Social Fund aid is available at present only for Exchequer-funded third level vocational training programmes. <Col N="178" /> The Community Support Framework sets out the level of aid available up to an agreed expenditure ceiling for such programmes until the end of 1993.  The cost of existing eligible programmes already exceeds the expenditure ceiling for ESF aid purposes.  In the circumstances, consideration of any extension of the range of eligible programmes could only arise in the context of the renegotiation of the Structural Funds for the post-1993 period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 and 210 together.</P>
      <P>Information is not available in my Department on the numbers of appointments issued by the Southern Health Board for the provision of orthodontic treatment.  However, I understand from the Southern Health Board that since 1989 the number of orthodontic cases undergoing treatment under direction or supervision of a consultant or specialist orthodontist each year was as follows: 1989, 2,188; 1990, 2,132; and 1991, 2,772.</P>
      <P>The number of appointments offered to each individual varies.  However, there are approximately 12 appointments per completed treatment at consultant/ specialist level.  In addition a significant number of orthodontic treatments were carried out each year at primary care level by the board's dentists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Southern Health Board that a total of 347 children are <Col N="188" /> currently awaiting the provision of orthodontic treatment and a further 755 children are awaiting assessment in order to validate the numbers of children requiring or seeking treatment compared to the time when they were originally placed on the list.</P>
    <P>My Department have provided additional funding to the Southern Health Board specifically for orthodontic treatment and the increased funding has enabled the board to recruit a full time consultant orthodontist.</P>
    <P>This appointment will enable the board to provide a comprehensive orthodontic service and will facilitate the provision of training in the specialty for the board's dental staff.</P>

      <P>A consultant orthodontist was appointed to the Eastern Health Board in May 1991. I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that difficulties arose between the consultant and the health board management as to the structure and development of the orthodontic services. Following discussions on these issues between the chief executive officer of the health board and the consultant orthodontist, the chief executive officer set up a project team to assist with the development of an effective orthodontic service and to report to him through the Programme Manager (Hospitals).  The <Col N="191" /> consultant orthodontist was appointed a member of this team.  Soon after the setting up of the project team, the consultant orthodontist tendered her resignation.  Her resignation was accepted by the board.  The board are now making arrangements to fill the vacancy on a shared basis with the Dublin Dental Hospital.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, (1) there are now over 80 applications for foreign adoptions of which only five have been completed, (2) there is only one social worker employed in his area at present and (3) many of the couples wishing to adopt are at or near, the age limitation and will have gone over it in the 18 months it is estimated to take to complete the present list; whether he has plans to appoint more social workers in order to clear this backlog; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the situation in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
      <P>This backlog has arisen because of the very large number of requests for foreign adoption assessments received by the Eastern Health Board following the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991, which, for the first time, imposed a statutory duty on the health boards to carry out such assessments.  The health board are committed to completing these assessments as soon as practicable and towards this end are currently in the process of assigning an additional social worker to the task.</P>
      <P>The general position as regards age limits is that prospective adopters must satisfy whatever requirements are laid down in the internal laws of the foreign country where they propose to adopt. This is primarily a matter for the foreign authorities.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board acquired the Cork Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital building in 1989.  It is a matter for the Southern Health Board to determine the future of this building.  Initially, it was considered, by the Southern Health Board, as a site for the unified maternity unit in Cork in conjunction with the Erinville Hospital which adjoins it.  A feasibility study was carried out on the suitability of this combined site.  A second feasibility study was also carried out by the board on the suitability of the St. Finbarr's Hospital site as a location for the unified maternity service.  I understand that no decision will be made by the board in the matter pending the availability of the report of the working group which was established to review acute hospital services in Cork.  The group are expected to complete their work in the near future.</P>

    <P>The Plan for Social Housing contains a range of measures involving financial <Col N="202" /> support for voluntary and co-operative efforts to provide adequate accommodation for households in need of housing e.g. grants for the provision of voluntary housing schemes for homeless and disabled persons, etc., and the new rental subsidy scheme.  The administration of the schemes has been devolved to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department make an annual contribution up to a maximum of 75 per cent of the administrative and general expenses incurred by certain approved representative bodies undertaking research or providing information in the housing area.</P>
    <P>In 1991 and earlier years, the amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme assisted projects of an amenity, recreational, leisure or environmental improvement nature, other than projects primarily of a commercial nature.  There is no provision in my Department's 1992 Estimate for new grant allocations under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Grants are available for those undertaking the provision of group water and sewerage schemes.  Applications are made direct to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department make annual awards under the environmental awareness scheme to non-governmental organisations such as conservation, community and youth groups.  The individual awards varied from £150 to £2,500 in 1991. Notices announcing the scheme are placed in the national newspapers each year inviting interested groups to apply direct to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department pay grants up to a maximum of 90 per cent of the approved cost of equipment, insurance and training expenses incurred by voluntary teams engaged in mountain and cave rescue. Applications are made direct to my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department pay an annual contribution to the Irish architectural archive in respect of the cost of gathering records of all kinds of Irish buildings and making them available to interested parties, including local authorities.</P>

      <P>Dublin County Council have been advised that, as a matter of policy, road grants are not normally made available to meet the cost of public lighting outside the 40 mile speed limit area and that lighting at isolated junctions, as proposed by the council in this case, is not considered to be good practice.  The council's attention was drawn to a programme of low-cost engineering solutions for accident locations, which is operating with the help of the environmental research unit and it was suggested that the junctions in question should be reviewed in the context of that programme.</P>

This option was considered and rejected in the Fifth <Col N="204" /> Report of the Commission of Taxation (1985) and the report of the Prices Advisory Committee on the cost and methods of providing motor insurance (1982).  It would inconvenience law-abiding motorists who wish to split the timing of their tax and insurance payments, for financial reasons, and it would be unlikely to have any significant effect on insurance evasion. Separate discs, which must be displayed on motor vehicles windscreens, cite the dates of expiry of insurance and motor tax.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality included an indicative list of 57 major schemes for the improvement of national primary roads.  Twenty-three of these schemes were projected to start in either 1989, 1990 of 1991 and 19 of them were started on schedule.  The position regarding the remaining four schemes is as follows:</P>
      <P>The N1 Dunleer bypass (County Louth) which was scheduled to start in 1989 has been underway since early 1991.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the acceptance of a tender for the first of two major contracts for the N4 Lucan-Kilcock bypass (County Kildare) and for the acceptance of a tender for the N4 Mullingar bypass (County Westmeath), both of which were scheduled to commence in 1991, were approved in August 1991 and October 1991 respectively.  Both schemes have since started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work will get under way later this year on the Northern Cross Route element of the Dublin Ring Road which was scheduled <Col N="208" /> to commence in 1991.  Tenders will be invited shortly for the first phase of this project which includes the Navan Road interchange.</P>
    <P>In the period to the end of 1991, 17 major projects for the improvement of national primary roads, with a combined cost (including pre-1989 expenditure) of £204 million, had been completed under the operational programme.  At the end of 1991, construction was under way on a further 14 such schemes (including schemes which had started before 1989) with a combined cost of £304 million.  By the end of 1991, some £158 million in European Regional Development Fund assistance had been drawn down for road projects under the programme.  This is the maximum level of assistance that could have been paid in the period.  Overall progress on the roads element of the programme is, therefore, very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I will be making an announcement shortly on the 1992 road grant allocations. The announcement will include details of the major road schemes to start in 1992.</P>

      <Col N="212" /> The environment action programme set out a number of initiatives to encourage higher levels of recycling.  These included the preparation of recycling schemes by local authorities and, as mentioned above, the provision of grants for recycling activities.  In addition, the IDA commissioned an examination of possibilities for productive economic activities based on recycling.</P>
    <P>With a view to increasing waste recycling levels generally, my Department have commissioned a study to assess the overall potential for recycling in Ireland from the domestic/commercial waste stream; the brief for this includes examining the scope for improving markets for recyclable materials.</P>

      <P>Funding is available to voluntary based groups through the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote, and the <Col N="215" /> Vote for International Co-operation, under a number of headings as follows:</P>
      <P>Funds are available from subheads C, D and E of the Vote for International Co-operation to voluntary organisations in Ireland and abroad for activities related to development and relief in developing countries.  It is not yet possible to say how much of the funding provided for development co-operation for 1992 will go to groups and activities of the kind referred to in the question since allocations are made progressively during the year in response to applications.  The allocations made in 1990 are indicated in Annexes 3, 9, 12, 15 and 18 of the Department's report on Ireland's Official Development Assistance for that year, which is in the Dáil Library.  The report for 1991 is in the course of preparation. Applications for funding can be made to the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>A total allocation of £115,000 was made available under subhead F of the Department's Vote for 1992, the purpose of which is to encourage North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.  Applications under that subhead may be made through the Anglo-Irish division of the Department by organisations involved in reconciliation work and in efforts to create better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  I will shortly be deciding on the individual allocations to be made from the subhead to a number of organisations doing very worthwhile work in this area.</P>
      <P>The sum of £213,000 has been allocated from the national lottery to the Department in 1992 for the promotion of cultural relations with other countries. Individuals and groups, including those of a voluntary nature, may apply for funding for suitable projects under this heading to the cultural section of the Department.  Decisions on allocation of funding are made by me on the advice of the Cultural Relations Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funds are also available under subhead C of the Department's Vote to assist welfare <Col N="216" /> advice groups in the United States working with Irish emigrants.  In the current year the amount available is £50,000. Applications are considered in the first instance by the Embassy in Washington, or by the Consulates-General in New York, Chicago or San Francisco.</P>

      <P>There are four main categories of passports: standard format (32 pages), large format (96 pages), collective passports (issued to school and invalid groups) and emergency passports (issued to Irish citizens abroad whose passports have been lost or stolen and who are in urgent need of travel documents to enable them to return home). In addition, diplomatic and service passports are issued to certain categories of persons travelling abroad on official business, including members of the Government, Irish diplomats and certain members of the civil and public service.</P>
      <P>The numbers of these passports issued annually over the past five years are as follows:</P>

    <P>(a) Service passports were only introduced in 1988.</P>
    <P>Under the present computer system, passport losses are recorded with the details of the original application and are not separately filed on the date the loss <Col N="217" /> is reported.  It is therefore not possible to give exact figures of losses on an annual basis; however, it is estimated that somewhat less than 1,000 passports are reported missing each year.</P>
    <P>Our records do not differentiate between applicants on the basis of age, employment status, or other such criteria and it is therefore not possible to indicate whether any individual category of passport holders has a particularly high rate of losses.</P>
    <P>The Passport Office is currently introducing a new computer system which will have a considerably enhanced data and statistical retrieval capacity.</P>

      <P>Together with partners in the Twelve we are following closely the situation in Peru.  Terrorist violence being perpetrated on a widespread basis by the Sendero Luminoso or Shining Path guerillas against public figures, commercial enterprises and the state infrastructure has led to a state of emergency being introduced in many parts of the country. This situation has given rise to serious concern about human rights on the part of the international community, including the Twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Peruvian authorities have provided the Twelve with information on measures introduced by them with a view to upholding respect for human rights. These include the establishment of the &ldquo;Consejo Por La Paz&rdquo; or Council for Peace, comprising representatives of the civilian population including the church, the universities and the trade unions.  The Council has been charged with the task <Col N="218" /> of drafting a national peace accord and of recommending ways of strengthening the public prosecutions department and the criminal justice system.  In addition a Government decree has been passed giving public prosecutors unrestricted access and allowing the Red Cross unlimited visits to detention centres controlled by the armed forces in areas where the state of emergency is in force.  The Peruvian Government have also invited a delegation from the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights to visit Peru and to compile a report on the human rights situation there.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to remain concerned at the situation in Peru.  We will be following closely all developments arising from the latest measures adopted by the Peruvian authorities.</P>

      <P>From the beginning of the democratisation of Central and Eastern Europe my Department has been active in the promotion of Irish technical assitance to the newly emerging democracies. As well as the direct benefit to the recipient countries this has helped Irish firms and State bodies to establish contacts and relationships which have been of help in the creation of employment for Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>In 1989, when the democratisation of Poland and Hungary began, the Government decided to provide £IR650,000 for bilateral technical assistance to these two countries.  This year we are providing a further £IR100,000 in bilateral assistance to Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amounts are additional to our contributions to the substantial multilateral <Col N="219" /> funds provided through the EC, and also through the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the United Nations system.</P>
    <P>The funding which we provided for bilateral technical assistance projects has allowed a number of Irish organisations and companies from both the semi-State and private sector to gain a foothold in Central and Eastern Europe.  Through their handling of these projects they have laid the foundations for Irish involvement in further activities funded from multilateral sources, in particular the European Communities and the World Bank, as well as United Nations agencies.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is also likely to provide further opportunites when its activities get properly off the ground.</P>
    <P>My Department has been particularly active in assisting Irish organisations and companies to gain contracts in Central and Eastern Europe.  Our Permanent Representation to the EC in Brussels, our embassies in Moscow, Stockholm, Vienna and our recently opened embassy in Warsaw (which between them cover Poland, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) has been liaising closely with the European Commission and the recipient states in order to facilitate access to the various programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is committed to an active programme of training and staff development for its officers, within existing financial and staffing constraints.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for training and staff development is integrated within the personnel function.  The personnel officer (a First Secretary) has specific responsibility for this area and is assisted by a full-time staff officer and, as the need arises, by other staff in the Personnel Unit.  Consideration has been given to the re-establishment of a separate training unit.  This has not been feasible within existing staffing resources but the possibility is kept under review.</P>
      <P>Particular emphasis is placed on the provision of training courses during office hours, usually within the Department itself, where a designated and equipped training room is available.  The following courses were organised in 1991 and will be repeated this year (precise attendance figures are not available in all cases): in-house language classes in French, German and Russian &mdash; usually one class per week in each of the languages; presentation skills courses for junior diplomatic officers.  (The courses covered a period of six days and were attended on average by ten diplomatic officers); briefing sessions for officers prior to posting to missions abroad (involving contacts with other departments and relevant semi-state agencies); computer skills courses (in 1991, 53 officers attended 16 such courses lasting an average of two days each); and courses in telephone techniques and dealing with the public for junior grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefing sessions, lectures and workshops, <Col N="221" /> usually organised once a week, are a regular feature of the Department's training programme and are designed to introduce officers, particularly junior diplomatic officers and others recently recruited to the Department, to all aspects of the work of the various divisions of the Department in Dublin and of our missions abroad.  In addition, these lectures are intended to provide officers with general briefings on Irish foreign policy and the principal international issues currently facing Ireland.  (Briefings have recently been given on the following: the Maastricht Treaty; the shape of Europe in the 1990s; the EC's decision-making process; the history of Irish foreign policy).  Outside experts are invited to contribute to these lectures.  Average attendance is between 25 and 30.</P>
    <P>The Department liaises closely with the Civil Service Training Centre (CSTC) in assessing and meeting its training requirements.  The CSTC organises in conjunction with the Department annual courses for Third Secretaries (the recruitment grade for the diplomatic service). The following are the numbers of officers who attended courses in the centre in the period 1989 to 1991:</P>

Six officers attended week-long training courses in 1991 arranged by the EC Commission in Brussels. A similar number of officers will attend these courses in 1992 and the Department will also nominate officers to participate in various international seminars (such as those organised on EC negotiations by the European Institute of Public Administration in Maastricht and on &ldquo;Europe After 1992&rdquo; by the Salzburg Seminar).</P>

    <P>The figure for 1991 is a preliminary estimate.</P>
    <P>The food sector, the raw materials for which are largely sourced in Ireland, now accounts for some 20 per cent of total exports.  In spite of the depressed markets for the major agricultural commodities which obtained in 1990 and 1991 the sector, with a positive annual trade balance of some £2 billion, continues to contribute very significantly to the country's foreign exchange earnings.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that the appeals panel has received an appeal application in respect of the townland of Barnagarrane in the district electoral division of Broadford, County Limerick and that it is included in the list of areas currently being surveyed by Departmental inspectors. When the processing of all survey data is completed in the autumn, the appeals panel will be in a position to examine the survey results and make recommendations to my Department as to the areas to be included in a submission to Brussels.  The final decision on areas to be classified as disadvantaged rests with the EC Commission but it is too early to say when such a decision will be made.</P>

      <P>In the context of the completion of the Internal Market in the Community, frontier inspections of agricultural produce in intra Community trade will have to be replaced after 1 January 1993 by other forms of inspection. In these circumstances, the recruitment of additional ship inspectors at this time could not be justified.  There has been an increase in overtime working at this port in recent years.  Over the past few months total overtime worked by ship inspectors at Rosslare Harbour was of the order of 110 hours per week.</P>

      <P>The departmental training office as at present constituted is staffed by <Col N="244" /> one higher executive officer.  No internal training courses were given during 1991, but my Department arranged and paid for specialised training at outside institutions in that year for the courses and the grades of staff detailed on the following annex.</P>
      <P>The number of those attending courses at the Civil Service Training Centre in each of the years 1989 to 1991 is as follows: 1989, 72; 1990, 44; and 1991, 39.</P>
      <P>In 1991 refunds of third level course fees were paid at the rate of 80 per cent to 50 staff.  One head of techncial staff, whose course of study was an essential requirment for the area of work involved had course fees paid at 100 per cent.  The percentage of fees refunded depends on the total number and cost of eligible course applications and the amount of funds available for the training budget.</P>

His applications will be considered further when he submits statements from his local inspector of taxes as to his income for the tax years ended 5 April 1981, 5 April 1982 and 5 April 1983.</P>

      <P>The amounts allocated by the Government to my Department in respect of funding for voluntary and community groups in 1992 is as follows: a sum of £0.75 million for the scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas; a sum of £0.50 million for the scheme of grants to locally based women's groups involved in programmes of self-help and personal development; a sum of £0.60 million for special grants to voluntary organisations <Col N="248" /> which were announced in the context of the recent budget; and a sum of £1.25 million for the community development programme.  This programme, provides financial assistance to projects towards the cost of equipping and staffing local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development.</P>
      <P>Details of the 1992 scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and grants for locally based women's groups were advertised recently in the national papers.  I have arranged to have application forms and information leaflets on these grants sent to the Deputy for his information.</P>
      <P>In addition, £1.35 million is provided to the Combat Poverty Agency whose work involves, <i>inter alia</i>, support for voluntary and community groups.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance introduced in November 1990 is a means tested payment for persons on low incomes who are living with and providing elderly or incapacitated social welfare pensioners with full-time care attention.  From July last year, the allowance was extended to include carers of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>Further improvements to the scheme involving the relaxation or the abolition of the means test would have considerable cost implications and could only be considered in the light of the available resources.  I am undertaking an examination of the present arrangements to see how assistance might be directed more effectively at the needs of carers in the community.</P>

    <P>Note: Full-time equivalent of full-time and part-time staff &mdash;.5 arises from this.</P>
    <P>Variations in the ratios can be attributed to many factors, some of which are listed hereunder: (i) Claimants who are dealt with on a postal basis can affect the claim/staff ratio; (ii) Gardiner Street, Werburgh Street and Dún Laoghaire Exchanges deal with the claims of their affiliated branch offices.  These offices are located in Balbriggan, Wicklow (2) and Kildare (2). (These arrangements are at present under review).  The mix as between claimants who sign for unemployment benefit payments, for unemployment assistance payments and for credits only, thus giving rise to different levels of work, would vary from one office to the other; (iii) Temporary staff vacancies in some offices and fluctuations in the numbers unemployed also impact on the ratios; (iv) Some offices have a greater volume of information queries which also includes the keying in of disability benefit certificates; (v) Tallaght and Clondalkin are non-cash offices where claimants are paid at the local post offices; and (vi) Depending on catchment areas, some offices have more of a turnover of claims than others.  These would be offices which deal with a large transient clientele resulting in a higher level of work per claim.</P>

      <P>She was examined by a medical referee of the Department on 28 January 1992, who expressed the opinion that she was incapable of work and recommended that she should be referred for a further examination on 28 July 1992.  As a result, she has been advised that disability benefit cheques will be issued to her weekly on receipt of monthly medical certification.</P>
      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to persons who, <i>inter alia</i>, are regarded as being permanently incapable of work.

Superannuation arrangements for the employees of these organisations are currently being developed.</P>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable employees of a public authority are insured under the PRSI system (class D) for a limited range of benefits (i.e. widows and orphan's pensions and deserted wife's benefit).  A number of semi-State companies have the status of public authority and their employees are insured in this way.  Employees of semi-State companies which are not public authorities are liable to pay the Class A rate of contribution which provides cover for the full range of social insurance benefits including pensions.</P>

      <P>Since 6 April 1991, private sector employees who earn £25 per week or more are covered by class A social insurance, which gives entitlement to the full range of social insurance benefits. The employees concerned are liable for social insurance contributions at 5.50 per cent of their earnings, except for those earning £60 or less per week who are exempt from that contribution. Employees earning less than £25 per week are covered by class J, and only qualify for occupational injuries benefits.</P>
      <P>There is no specific exemption from this rule for people employed by Bord na gCon.  However, there are situations where class A will not apply, as follows: (i) People over the age of 66 are covered at the class J rate only, regardless of earnings; and (ii) People whose main employment is not covered by social insurance, or is insured at the modified rate, are insurable at class J in respect of any subsidiary employment.</P>
      <P>I would be very reluctant to grant exemptions in respect of other groups, as it would lead to a loss of benefits by the workers concerned.</P>

      <P>Employment in the service of one's spouse is exempted under Part II of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 and is not insurable.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1988, provided for the introduction of social insurance coverage for the self-employed with effect from 6 April 1988.  PRSI contributions payable by self-employed people (class S) give cover for old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension and orphans contributory allowance.  However, prescribed relatives of self-employed contributors, including spouses, who assist in the running of the business but who are not partners are not insurable. Where both spouses jointly own and operate the business, they are both covered and each spouse builds up independent rights to pension.</P>
      <P>The question of pension cover for a person who is working in their spouse's business is one of the issues being addressed by the National Pensions Board in its final report on a new national pensions system.

      <P>The person concerned <Col N="257" /> applied for unemployment benefit from 20 December 1991.  His claim was disallowed on the grounds that he was not unemployed.  Farmers and other self-employed persons are not regarded under social welfare legislation as unemployed unless their self-employment could ordinarily have been undertaken in addition to their usual employment.  The rules also specify that the remuneration from the self-employment cannot exceed £10 per day or, alternatively, that not less than 117 contributions were paid in respect of the previous three years.</P>
      <P>The person's income from farming was assessed at in excess of £10 per day and he does not fulfil the contribution condition.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office and his case was referred to an appeals officer for determination. On the basis of the evidence available, the appeals officer upheld the decision of the deciding officer in the matter.

      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1990 put in place an improved framework for the conduct of industrial relations and for the resolution of trade disputes.  While the Act has only been in place for a relatively short period, and the provisions in relation to secret ballots and injunctions do not come into effect until July 1992 all the indications are that it is operating successfully.</P>
      <P>The provisions in relation to picketing, for example, have clarified what was previously a very confusing area.  I believe that the balloting provisions which require all trade unions to have a secret ballot rule in their rule books by July of this year will provide an important statutory underpinning for the already widely observed good practice of holding secret ballots before industrial action is taken.</P>
      <P>We have recently had the publication of the code of practice on dispute procedures including procedures in essential services which is the first code to be drawn up under the Act.  It is my view that codes of practice can make an important contribution to improving industrial relations practices and procedure.</P>
      <P>A further important development under the Act was the establishment of the Labour Relations Commission in January 1991.  In its first year of operation the commission has been very active and has been very successful in the prevention and resolution of disputes.</P>
      <P>I will of course continue to keep the operation of the Act under review.</P>

Details of funding and methods of application are a day-to-day matter for FÁS.</P>
      <P>Assistance was made available under the European Community Initiatives &mdash; EUROFORM, HORIZON and NOW &mdash; to the end of 1993.</P>
      <P>The EUROFORM Initiative concerns transnational partnerships in the area of new qualifications, new skills and new employment opportunities related to the completion of the Internal Market and technological change.</P>
      <P>The HORIZON Initiative provides Structural Funds for innovative projects with a transnational dimension and is aimed at assisting the disabled and disadvantaged under broad categories identified in the guidelines.</P>
      <P>NOW is the Initiative which aims to promote equal opportunities for women in the field of employment and vocational training through the development of transnational partnerships.</P>
      <P>Further information on the three initiatives is available from the national co-ordinators in my Department.</P>

      <P>Section VII of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> outlined an area-based response to long term unemployment. The twelve area partnerships established in 1991 to pilot the initiative are now preparing area action plans which are expected to be submitted to the Central Review Committee by mid-March.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1 million has been allocated in 1992 in the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach to the Central Review Committee towards staff and administration costs of the partnerships.  This is double the amount made available in 1991 and reflects the full year costs involved.  The employer organisations have established an Enterprise Trust which will fund projects identified in the area action plans.  Discussions are ongoing between the European Commission and the Irish authorities about the global grant for local development announced in the recent Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance.  Projects identified in the area action plans will be submitted to the Commission for assistance under the global grant.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline, in view of his statement on 19 February 1992, that employment and training schemes aided by European Social Funds have the potential for removing 25,000 people from the live register in the next year, the specific means by which this reduction is expected to occur; and if he will publish a timetable for its implementation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following discussions between the Irish Authorities and the EC Commission agreement was reached on the provision of EC funding for two new schemes aimed at creating employment and training opportunities for some 25,000 people on the live register.  This is to be achieved through an employment subsidy scheme aimed at encouraging the creation of 15,000 extra jobs and a job training scheme designed to cater for 10,000 trainees.  I accept that these targets are ambitious but I am optimistic that with the co-operation of the social partners the targets can be achieved over the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme is open to employers in the private sector, commercial State bodies and voluntary bodies who can provide additional full-time employment opportunities which are capable of being sustained.  The scheme provides for payment of a wage subsidy of £54 per week for 52 weeks provided that the employment lasts for 78 weeks.  The scheme has been operational since the beginning of February and up to the end of that month over 2,000 inquiries had been received from employers by <Col N="267" /> FÁS and 36 employees had been recruited under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The job training scheme is designed as a work-based training programme provided by employers in co-operation with FÁS.  Under the scheme the world of work and training will be linked in a positive manner.  The scheme will be administered and monitored by FÁS with co-operation from CERT in the case of the tourism sector, which will award certification to successful trainees.  The duration of the scheme for each trainee will be between 26 and 52 weeks, depending on the training requirement in each case, and trainees will receive the normal FÁS training allowances.  This scheme represents a new departure from what has become our traditional approach to training. Individual firms will oversee the training within their enterprises rather than the approach adopted heretofore whereby FÁS itself provided the training. As such, this is a challenging and innovative approach which I hope can be integrated into our longterm training arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have secured a budget of £31 million, including an ESF contribution of £23 million, to meet our commitments for these schemes in 1992.  The Commission and my Department are committed to a review of the operation of the two schemes and their future funding before October.  At that time I would hope to see significant progress towards reaching our targets.  As I have already stated this will depend, ultimately, on the response of employers and I would take this opportunity of appealing to them, once again, to avail themselves of both schemes.  In this regard I am pleased to note the support of both employers' organisations and ICTU for this endeavour.</P>
