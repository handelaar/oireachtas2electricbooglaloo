      <P>I am sympathetically disposed to such legislation as a means of furthering the aim of open government However, it would require careful study and preparation and the drafting of such legislation would be a complex task. Accordingly, I propose to ask the Law Reform Commission study the operation of freedom of information legislation in the other countries where it exists, such as Sweden and the United States, and to make recommendtions as to how legislation might be introduced here, in a manner that could be adapted to our institutions and system of administration. Any such legislation would have to have regard to the right to privacy of the citizen and to the degree of confidentiality required in any system of government and administration in the preparation of decisions, especially in the financial, security, and international areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the former Government Chief Whip, in reply to me in this House on 12 November, said that the question of a freedom of information Act is a matter which the Government intend to examine carefully with a view to the framing of appropriate legislation?  Why is the Taoiseach only now referring this matter to the Law Reform Commission?  Is the Taoiseach aware that, for example, a youth aged 16, who lives in an inner city flat complex, found as a passenger in a stolen car is disbarred for the rest of his life from a job in the public service?</P>

      <P>A youth aged 19 charged with urinating in public is disbarred for the rest of his life from a job in the public service.

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept that if he is serious in his proposals with regard to open government one of the essential prerequisites is the putting in place of a freedom of information Act?  There is little point in talking about openness if the information to help people to deal with open government is not there.  Does he intend to ask the Law Reform Commission to give priority to this aspect of legislation or will it have to stand in queue along with other requests from Government made to a Commission who have not adequate resources to deal with their current programme?</P>

      <P>Precisely.  Any other matters should be raised in separate questions. Deputy McCartan will appreciate that it is a complex task to draft such legislation in relation to freedom of information to fit our system of government. The Law Reform Commission will be asked to take into consideration the freedom of information legislation in many other countries such as Australia, Canada, Sweden, USA, the Netherlands and New Zealand.  It is a new departure here and it reflects my commitment to open government.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Institute of Public Administration to examine this matter in parallel with the examination by the Law Reform Commission, in view of the fact that one of the main sources of objection to freedom of information legislation in the past has been administrative practicality as distinct from legal drafting.  An inquiry solely focused on the legal aspects of the matter would not be complete and could delay matters.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Yates</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he has any proposals to reorganise the Departments of the Marine, the Environment and Tourism, Transport and Communications so as to merge all aspects of the transport portfolio on to one Ministry and Department in the context of the increasing importance of an integrated transport policy of the Single Market of 1993; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not rule out changes in the allocation of functions and responsibilities between Ministers and Departments generally, I believe that the assignment of full responsibility for all transport functions to a single Department or organisation is not the only, or necessarily the best, way of achieving now the best integration of policy and programmes.</P>
      <P>Major organisational changes affecting Government Departments and other public sector organisations take time and while achieving integration in certain respects, can create new difficulties.  Any proposals for such changes, therefore, need to be evaluated carefully before being decided on.</P>
      <P>The key to the coherent implementation of Government policy &mdash; including transport policy &mdash; across departmental lines is proper co-ordination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, the Operational Programme on Peripherality which was drawn up by the Government and approved by the EC Commission represents a major advance towards an integrated transport policy. Although the Minister for the Environment and his Department were assigned the lead role in the preparation of this programme, the Ministers for the Marine and for Tourism, Transport and Communications, together with their subsidiary agencies, were also fully involved.  The result is a comprehensive and integrated set of measures relating to all elements of the transportation system, <Col N="226" /> including finance, planning, roads, railways, ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The Government will also ensure that a fully integrated set of transport measures are put forward to the EC Commission for assistance from the Structural Funds (including the new Cohesion Fund) in the period after 1993, and that appropriate co-ordination arrangements are made for effective and efficient implementation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that, the Government, in the discharge of their business generally, will always seek to ensure that the various functions and interests are properly co-ordinated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it makes no sense to have aviation, shipping and roads, dealt with in completely different Departments with separate Ministries?  Furthermore, is he aware that the Confederation of Irish Industry, in addition to the transport sector, have consistently argued for a single transport Ministry?  In view of the fact that Irish transport costs are twice the European average, would he not now consider merging these Departments into one single Department of Transport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree. It is not necessarily the best way to do business.  As I have already said, the Operational Programme on Peripherality clearly shows that the programme drawn up by the Government, approved by the EC Commission, represents a major advance towards an integrated transport policy.  Although the Minister for the Environment and his Department were assigned the lead role in the preparation of this programme all the other Ministers concerned have inputs.  The result is a comprehensive, integrated set of measures &mdash; which is really what we are all endeavouring to achieve at the end of the day &mdash; which relates to the various elements of the transportation system, including roads, railways, ports and airports. A committee, representative of the Departments of the Environment, Tourism, Transport and Communications, the Marine, various public sector bodies, the trade unions, CII, CIF and the EC meet <Col N="227" /> at quarterly intervals to monitor the operations of the programme with the assistance of an independent, external evaluator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in most European countries, Denmark being the latest example, there is a single transport Ministry?  Furthermore, is he aware that in the last programme on peripherality not one penny of EC funds was allocated to inter-city rail in comparison with allocations to roads?  Would he agree there is no integrated planning or interdepartmental mechanism in place for such an integrated plan?  In view of all these developments, in the context of the Single European Market coming into being in January next, would he not now review this and consider merging some of those Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not convinced by the Deputy's argument.  The Operational Programme on Peripherality is a clear example of how one draws all the strands together&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Europe thought in the way the Deputy does they would not now be talking under present headings. That is the position as I see it.  In relation to integrated rail within the overall Dublin transportation system, the Deputy should be aware that the Government authorised the commencement of work on stage 2 of the Dublin Transportation study which will produce a long term, broad transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area together with an effective process for on-going transportation planning and clear guidance on appropriate institutional arrangements for ensuring effective implementation of the adopted strategy and implementation programme.  Here again, the lead role rests with the Department of the Environment but other Ministers are and will continue to be fully involved at all stages.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>whether, in conducting the labour force survey, the CSO have employed retired people in supervisory positions; and, if so, if he will outline the number involved and his views on whether in this day of mass unemployment, such a policy should continue.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that to be eligible for appointment as a supervisor on the labour force survey an applicant's age must not exceed the normal retirement age of 65.  This does not rule out persons who may have taken early retirement from a previous occupation. Of the 48 supervisors currently employed on the 1992 labour force survey, nine indicated in their applications that they had retired.</P>
      <P>I have now asked that this existing policy be re-examined in the light of the current level of unemployment.  In general, I do not believe it to be sustainable that a retired person, with pension from previous employment, is re-employed when there are other suitably qualified unemployed persons prepared to do the work.  I understand that in the past a policy of effectively restricting recruitment to suitably qualified unemployed people was ruled as counter to equality legislation.  I am satisfied, however, that the review I have now asked for can deal with the issues involved in a constructive and acceptable manner.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will elaborate on his statement that the European Single Market will provide a context within which peace could be achieved in the North; and if he will outline the specific role the EC will play and the specific steps he will initiate to facilitate the process.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The progressive completion of the Single Market programme has steadily been laying the basis for the disappearance of the technical, administrative and taxation barriers between North and South in Ireland and should lead to significant increases in cross-Border trade.</P>
      <P>These prospects should be considerably boosted by the participation of both parts of Ireland in economic and monetary union, especially if Britain ultimately decides to participate in the move to the final stage.  The irrevocable change to a single European currency would provide a stable and predictable context for cross-Border trade, investment, economic co-operation and partnership generally.</P>
      <P>The prospect, under the Delors Package Mark II, of a further major increase in the resources which the Community devotes to regional development and of a continuation of the Interreg initiative should help further to reinforce economic co-operation between North and South and create that climate of mutual knowledge and confidence between communities and people on both sides of the Border on which political progress can be built.</P>
      <P>The Government are ready to support any arrangements for combining our respective strengths and resources, North and South, to maximise the opportunities and to overcome the problems of an intergrated economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intensification of contacts and mutual knowledge, together with the common participation in a political union which is already a focus for peace, stability and prosperity in Europe and which aims to contribute to confidence and the prevention of strife throughout the Continent, the Government sincerely hope to bring home to all concerned the <Col N="231" /> anachronistic and futile nature of the conflict in Northern Ireland which has continued for far too long, and also lend a powerful stimulus to ending that conflict by political and democratic methods.  The Government hope that, taking inspiration from Community models, it may be possible, through dialogue, to devise structures which will emulate in Ireland this positive European experience to the benefit of the people of these islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>While obviously one can be supportive of the thurst of the Taoiseach's reply and wish to assist in every way possible any measures the Government might initiate to remove barriers, would the Taoiseach elaborate on any particular structures he would envisage which might assist this process?  Secondly, would he not accept there is a distinction to be made between commercial and trade barriers being removed?  In fact the trend in Europe, despite the unification of Europe and co-operation within Europe, has been for ethnic minorities to seek their independence and to preserve their own identity within common structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If one talks about European models one could look at the broad framework where differences are accepted and where structures can be built to accommodate those differences. If one transposes that into the Northern Ireland situation one gets an idea of where progress could be made in future years.  I think we would all agree that development towards European union encourages all of us to emphasise that before the end of the decade people North and South will be fellow citizens of a united Europe and this is the context in which I believe we can make political progress.  Those sentiments were also expressed by the former Taoiseach in his address to the Institute of Directors in Belfast.  Europe can make a contribution but essentially the problem has to be approached by the Government in London and by the Government in Dublin.

      <P>Of course there is a need for a fundamental change of attitude in relation to trying to build confidence and trust between the two communities in the North of Ireland.  All of us here should facilitate that in whatever way we can.  I have said quite clearly that we can have a bottom-up and a top-down approach to it.  The bottom-up approach is exactly what I mean, for example, promoting projects under the Interreg programme which can give a stimulus to the building of trust between communities at the Border and outside those areas as well.  That is the way in which trust and reconciliation has to be built between the two communities.  The two Governments also have to consider it and involve the European Commission in trying to promote it from the top down as well.</P>

      <P>In view of the advances cited by the Taoiseach of cross-Border co-operation, may I ask if he would deal with two practical matters?  First, would he be agreeable to reverse the cut made by the Minister for Finance in the estimate for cross-Border co-operation in the Vote of the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; one of the few parts of that Estimate which were actually cut in 1992 as against 1991?  Second, would he agree that it would be desirable to amend the procedures for the new Cohesion Fund to ensure that not only this State but also Northern Ireland qualifies for assistance for a trans-Border network activity, such as, roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first question I am sure the Deputy will raise <Col N="233" /> that matter with the Minister for Finance in the budget debate which is still ongoing.  In relation to the question of Structural Funds for Northern Ireland I am sure the Deputy will be aware that there is a danger that, in the next tranche of Structural Funds, because Northern Ireland is now 75 per cent of the standard of living in the rest of Europe, they could well find themselves outside of the objective 1 regions.  Here is an area which we could promote as a common interest between ourselves and the British Government to ensure that that does not happen.  We have to be seen to look after the interests of Northern Ireland, some of which could probably be better served at European level by a single voice operated from down here.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware &mdash; I am sure he is &mdash; that the European Parliament has addressed the questions arising in Northern Ireland on a number of occasions both in the Haagerup report for the political committee some years ago and in the Ainardi report by the regional committee last year? Would he examine those reports to see what are the views of the Parliament and, perhaps, draw some proposals from them, particularly with regard to cross-Border co-operation on energy and transport and also on education within Northern Ireland itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with all of the points made, may I home in on what seems to be central to all of them?  Would the Taoiseach agree and take the opportunity, particularly tomorrow when he is speaking with the British Prime Minister, to make the point that while an eventual and lasting political solution will only be brought about by agreement between the representatives of the two traditions in Northern Ireland, there are many things which the two Governments working <Col N="234" /> together can do particularly in the situation where terrorism thrives in a political vacuum.  Disagreement among the political parties in the North or lack of progress cannot be allowed to hold up political progress.  In these circumstances may I ask the Taoiseach whether he will emphasise the point that Europe, in particular, provides a context in which much of this necessary and political agreement can be achieved and that the two Governments, irrespective of anything else, should push ahead on that issue?</P>

Would the Taoiseach not agree that his own entirely praiseworthy efforts to get Europe to spend more money on cross-Border co-operation activities in Ireland is invalidated to a great extent by the fact that his own Government have cut the amount they are prepared to spend on cross-Border co-operation in the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs? Would he not agree that his case would be enhanced if he were to say in this House he would seek, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, who is sitting beside him at present, to restore the cut that has been made in the cross-Border co-operation subhead of the Department of Foreign Affairs before he makes any more eloquent speeches of the kind he gave in response to Deputy Spring's question?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The specific public expenditure allocations, in addition to staff costs, for Women's Affairs in the Vote for the Department of the Taoiseach this year are a grant of £114,000 to the Council for the Status of Women and a grant of £44,000 to the second Commission on the Status of Women.

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts which the Minister of State quoted were those contained in the Book of Estimates for the Council on the Status of Women and for the Commission.  My question asked about the funding available in the Taoiseach's Department to be spent on women's affairs which was available in the past and identified in the Book of Estimates but which does not seem to exist now.  The Taoiseach has said there <Col N="237" /> are no funds available other than what has been given away, and I seek clarification on that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of opinion what way the Government should organise their business in this area.  It is my view that my role of co-ordinating the activities of Departments is the appropriate one.  I am aware that when Deputy Fennell was Minister of State with special responsibility for women's affairs between 1983-87 she had a budget of the order of £800,000 with which to carry out her responsibilities.  Of this, £500,000 was committed to the Council for the Status of Women who have had a meeting with me and who have not expressed the view which has been represented by Deputy Fennell.  They are very willing to wait and see how I perform in this Department and willing and anxious to judge me on my performance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>A significant proportion of the remainder of Deputy Fennell's budget was set aside for the UN End of Decade for women's activities.  The balance enabled Deputy Fennell to provide seed funding for women's groups to issue information leaflets and organise the &ldquo;Women in Business&rdquo; campaign, for example.  The reply to such criticism is that individual Ministers are charged with the task of carrying out such activities from their own budgets.  Both the Taoiseach and I &mdash; and the question was put to the Taoiseach &mdash; wish to point to the £500,000 allocated by the Minister for Social Welfare this year for his scheme of grants for locally based women's groups as a practical example of the arrangements which have been put in place.  Therefore, Deputy Fennell is wrong to suggest that the only way to conduct a Department is to have a role <Col N="238" /> similar to the one she carried out.  My colleagues on this side of the House, including my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who carried out this co-ordinating role, will vouch for the fact that the most efficient way to conduct a Department for women's affairs is to have a co-ordinating role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that women want more than co-ordination at this point; they want to see specific funds and staff being allocated to this section of Government.  Let me say to him also that I was hugely impressed by the shopping list or agenda given to him by his wife when he was appointed. I suggest it would cost billions of pounds to implement the sensible requests she has made of him and the Government.  I hope, however, that the Minister of State and the Taoiseach will note the list because I have to say it was sensible and practical.  I am disappointed at the answers and I do not have much hope in relation to that work.</P>

These officers can be put at the disposal of my Department at that time if the situation warrants it.  I am satisfied that sufficient staff are available.

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the steps which are being taken to protect cultural and heritage objects, ranking as national treasures, from being moved out of the country with the disappearance of customs checks at EC internal frontiers in 1993.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation, a licence is required for the export of archaeological objects, as well as documents and pictures.  This will still apply after 1992.  Further legislative proposls to confirm the State's rights in the matter of our archaeological heritage and to broaden the definition of such objects are at a very advanced stage of preparation and it is intended to introduce this legislation at an early date.</P>
      <P>In the context of free movement of goods, it should be noted that Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome allows for measures to be taken for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historical or archaeological value.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this, the member states are currently examining commission proposals for a directive and a regulation aimed at preventing the unlawful removal and illegal export of cultural goods from individual member states following completion of the internal market.  These proposals also include a system which will facilitate the return to individual member states of unlawfully removed cultural objects which have been defined as national treasures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, there will be free movement of works of art and cultural objects after 1 January 1993. Can the Minister of State say if this country will have a right to prevent the export of certain defined objects after that date <Col N="240" /> and, if so, how can these be controlled in the absence of internal frontier posts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this question, the first of which is, what can we do ourselves.  I will be introducing a National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, I hope this year, which will broaden the definition of archaeological objects to include treasure trove.  At the same time, under Article 36 of the Treaty of Rome, work will continue on this area at European Community level.  Two points should be made.  On 29 January 1992 in Brussels the Commission presented two proposals for Community instruments relating to cultural property for consideration by member states, the first of which is a directive on the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a member state and, second, a regulation on the export of cultural goods.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not the only country concerned about this matter; obviously Italy, Spain, Greece and other member states are equally concerned about it.  Therefore, it will be my role to monitor the position and to maintain contact with my counterparts in the Community throughout this period.  I suggest to Deputy Nealon that we should not look on this issue in the context of our national territory. I see my role in relation to arts and culture complementing my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs in that this is a European Community matter.  It is important that collectively we work together in the European Community to ensure control.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern and the efforts he made when Minister of State but I am satisfied our cultural interests will be adequately served by the legislation I intend to introduce and my links with other Ministers for culture and art within the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill he intends to introduce will bring our legislation up-to-date in relation to the Derrynaflan <Col N="241" /> judgment; in other words, that people will have the right to protect their own heritage.  However, does the Minister of State intend to introduce legislation in advance of January 1993 to strengthen our hand and to prevent the export of important works of art?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware, following the Derrynaflan judgment, that this legislation is required to broaden the definition of archaeological objects.  It was recommended by the Supreme Court on that occasion that amending legislation be put in place.  I am convinced, having looked at the position in other countries, that this legislation, combined with the Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, in addition to the work being done in co-operation with other member states, will put in place in this country controls which are better than those applied by many of our European Community partners.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that the Maastricht Treaty recognises the importance of culture.  I am convinced that in working with our partners and in tightening up legislation we will ensure protection for our cultural and national treasures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State not aware that the 1945 Act is totally useless in that all that it requries is that a picture of the object be given to the various authorities and that it is the only legislation in the entire body of legislation under which a breach is not punishable by a fine?  Given the removal of customs checks, how is the Minister of State going to ensure that our national treasures do not flow out of the country? It should be remembered that between £9 million and £10 million worth of antiques over 100 years old are being exported each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to antiques; it is important to point out that his question specifically refers to national treasures.  I am aware that the Hamilton <Col N="242" /> report, which was initiated by Deputy Nealon, said that national institutions or a purchaser resident in the State would have an opportunity to acquire objects at a fair price.  However, the report produced a constitutional minefield; in fact, the question of a fair price contained in the Hamilton report is very seriously in question.  If we try to legislate for antiques and other objects outside national treasures we will be in a very difficult constitutional area.  I intend to introduce a National Monuments Bill. The Documents and Pictures (Regulation of Export) Act, 1945, requires that export licences must be obtained in the case of all painting and documents over 100 years old.  Exporters of paintings and documents governed by that legislation require a licence from the National Gallery and through the Taoiseach's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Máire Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Plans for tourism development up to 1994 are focused on achieving the targets for the sector in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> which requires increasing annual overseas visitor numbers to 4.5 million, overseas revenue by £250 million, and creating 15,000 new jobs in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These plans involve investment of over £300 million, almost half of which is coming from the EC, in upgrading our <Col N="246" /> tourism product to international standard, greater penetration in our main markets, particularly through strong niche marketing, and pursuit of policies which emphasise the need for better value in terms of quality and price.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> target for the year is a 15 per cent increase in visitor numbers and based on preliminary indications from the markets, Bord Fáilte expect Irish tourism to return to double digit growth in 1992.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte, the lead agency for overseas marketing and promotion will this year receive £21.5 million from the Exchequer and, in addition, will be involved in a range of EC and IFI assisted co-operative marketing initiatives with the industry, involving further expenditure of nearly £10 million on Ireland's overseas marketing efforts.</P>
    <P>Finally, lottery funding of up to £3.5 million has been provided towards the cost of Ireland's participation at EXPO '92 which will be held in Seville from April to October this year where nearly 20 million visitors are expected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  What plans of her own does the Minister have in regard to the development of the tourist industry? The same things were read out on numerous occasions by the former Minister but targets were not achieved last year.  The architects of the plan to which the Minister referred stated that the industry and Bord Fáilte required between £3 million and £5 million extra to achieve their targets.  However, this money has not been provided; indeed it has been reduced from £28.5 million to £21.5 million.  Has the Minister any plans to increase the amount of money available to the industry this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Farrelly would not have expected me to have a full comprehensive plan of my own prepared in the last two weeks for the development of tourism.  Suffice to say that the Government recently, as the House is aware, appointed a tourism <Col N="247" /> task force, have given them specific terms of reference and asked them to report as soon as possible.  In my capacity as Minister for Tourism, I have already met the chairman of the tourism task force and indicated to him &mdash; and he has agreed &mdash; that it would be better not to wait for a full report from the tourism task force, with all their initiatives to come at the end, but that they should report on specific initiatives which they propose to the Minister, which will be done.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the grant to Bord Fáilte was decided in advance of my appointment as Minister. However, that is not an excuse.  It is important to realise that it is not just Bord Fáilte who expend money to attract tourists to Ireland.  We must also acknowledge the amount of money spent by airlines, shipping interests and the tremendous amount of investment by private industry.  It is also important to point out that, of course, we would all prefer Bord Fáilte to get more money but, like all the other practical realities in relation to finances at present, we ask Bord Fáilte every year to do more with less.  It is also important to say that in the period when Bord Fáilte's annual grant in aid was at its lowest &mdash; 1987-88 &mdash; two of the biggest annual increases in numbers occurred.  It is not correct to assume that because the Bord Fáilte grant has not been increased tourism numbers do not increase as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to review the role of Bord Fáilte? Is she in favour of the decision of the previous Minister not to include a member of Bord Fáilte on the task force? Will she reverse that decision and include someone with experience in the market? It is a gross error not to include such a person and I ask her to clarify the position in that regard.  Will the Minister say if she is in favour of the advertisements placed in some of the national newspapers at the weekend seeking ideas on the tourism task force and what should be done in regard to tourism?  Does the Minister intend running her Department <Col N="248" /> by asking the general public for ideas on tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be as many ideas on the development of tourism as there are people in the country and I hope that would be the way.  It is a matter for the tourism task force to decide how they should do their business and I would not like to interfere with them on a daily basis in regard to their operations.  As part of their operations, the task force have decided that they should move in this direction and I support them in this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the appointment of a Bord Fáilte nominee to the tourism task force, I have informed the chairman of the task force that if he or the task force members believe there should be additions to the task force&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in specific areas I will have a look at that.  As of now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I do not believe the task force cannot do their work by virtue of the fact that they do not have a representative of the Bord Fáilte board or executive on the board. With regard to the review role of Board Fáilte, obviously in my consideration of tourism and the commitments given in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by the Government, I will be looking at the role Bord Fáilte play in the same way any Minister who is new to the job would look at all State agencies under his or her aegis.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I should like to congratulate the Minister on her appointment.  I welcome her statement that she has no immediate plans to privatise Network 2 and she does not feel obliged to pursue the policies of her predecessor.  A rather disturbing report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 2 February stated that Network 2 <Col N="250" /> are facing privatisation.  It was also feared that as a result of the protracted strike in RTE an opportunity was being presented to those in favour of privatisation.  Will the Minister give the House a categorical assurance that she has no plans to privatise Network 2 in the foreseeable future?</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy has agreed that it will take me, as someone who is new to Communications, some time to grapple with the many complex and sometimes conflicting views involved in the entire broadcasting area. In doing this I intend to meet the various interests involved and those concerned about any review of the Broadcasting Act, 1990.  In the course of that review issues raised by all sides will be considered. It is only when that review is completed that I will be able to come back to the House and give the results of it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22, 23, 48, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>Last week, I embarked on a round of discussions with interests concerned with air services between Ireland and North America and the related issue of Government policy on the compulsory Shannon stop.  I have met with Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord Faíilte, Fly Dublin Direct Committee, Galway Chamber of Commerce, the Irish Airline Pilot's Association, ICTU, Shannon Development, Shannon Status Committee, Shannon Town Commissioners and SIGNAL representing the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the pros and cons of a change <Col N="254" /> in policy have been well articulated by interested parties I have asked for additional information on certain issues and I expect to have further consultations over the course of the next week or so.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned to ensure that the pivotal role which transatlantic services play in regional development and employment creation in the west of Ireland is in no way undermined.  At the same time I am acutely aware of the crisis facing Aer Lingus on their transatlantic operations and their inability to undertake the investment in fleet replacement so urgently needed on that route.</P>
    <P>I have not yet formulated any proposals for consideration by Government. I still have an open mind on how this issue should be resolved.  However, because of the effects which uncertainty about the future of the Shannon stop is having on investment in the region I have indicated that I will put proposals before Government within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree to once and for all grasp this political hot potato and formulate policies which will alleviate on the one hand the fears of job losses in the mid-western region and satisfy the demands of Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte to end the compulsory stop-over at Shannon on the other?  Will the Minister confirm that her predecessor proposed in his memorandum that the compulsory stop-over should be phased out over a five year period in order to allow business, industrial and tourist interests time to adjust?  Will she also confirm that he argued in his memorandum for the setting up of an independent commission, similar in structure to the review body of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to monitor the effects of the ending of the stop-over on the region?  Will she confirm he also suggested the Shannon Development Authority and Bord Fáilte should receive targeting funding to compensate for any job losses attributable to the change in policy?</P>

      <P>The consultants concluded that the railway is being operated to an acceptable level of safety.

The majority of the recommendations relate to more vigorous application of rules and regulations, training and improved work practices.  I am advised by the chairman of CIE that implementation of the report's recommendations is already in hands.  The chairman has assured me that safety continues to be Iarnród Éireann's main priority and will not be compromised.

      <P>A sum of £1 million was allocated in the recent budget to be used specifically to boost the supply of cars available for hire to tourists in the coming peak tourist season.  My Department are currently having discussions with the Car Rental Council of Ireland and with Bord Fáilte to work out how the budget provision can best be used to meet anticipated shortages in cars for hire during July and August next.  The pricing of cars for hire is, of course, a commercial consideration for individual firms.  However, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, included provision in the budget for a reduction in excise duty on new cars and on petrol both of which should help the economics of car hire and its price competitiveness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a shortage of 2,500 cars in the rental car fleet?  Will she ask the Government to postpone the implementation of import duties on new cars until the fleet owners buy those cars?  The £1 <Col N="260" /> million made available in the budget could be better spent because these cars are required for only a very short time &mdash; six to nine months.  Would the Minister consider that proposal taking into consideration that this system is operating successfully in other European countries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the point raised by Deputy Farrelly.  It is one of the points under discussion by the Car Rental Council of Ireland and my Department as well as the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners who obviously have considerations and concerns in relation to that aspect.  In answer to the first part of Deputy Farrelly's supplementary, I am aware from the Car Rental Council of Ireland that there will be an estimated shortfall of 2,000 cars, and it is to deal with that matter that the current discussions are taking place as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, given that the peak tourist season is only five or six months away, that it will prove impossible to implement the policy of Bord Fáilte in targeting, for example, the Japanese market because sufficient cars will not be available?  The Japanese cannot be expected to bring their cars here.  Considering that the car hire market is of crucial importance to tourism, would the Minister agree that it will be a disastrous year for all concerned because of the lack of availability of cars? If the Minister delays any longer it will be too late to introduce policies to facilitate the extra demand.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that it is going to be a disastrous year because this issue will not be dealt with.  It is precisely because I and the Government are concerned to address the issue that these discussions are going on as a matter of urgency.  As I said a few moments ago, I hope to be able to agree <Col N="261" /> the details that my Department and I are initiating in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 51, 52 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is already aware, An Post is in a serious financial situation. The company's accumulated losses to the end of 1991 amounted to some £15 million and by the end of 1993 could have grown to some £40 million.  I am seriously concerned about An Post's loss making situation and I am anxious that remedial measures be put in place at an early date without recourse to State subsidy or general increases in postal charges.  The main reasons for An Post's problems are increasing operating costs, low mail volume growth and competition from modern telecommunications services and couriers.  Staff costs, which account for <Col N="262" /> 80 per cent of total operating costs, have increased sharply in recent years despite substantial staff reductions.</P>
    <P>In February 1991 An Post announced their viability plan, with the objective of achieving savings of £24 million by 1995. In September 1991 my predecessor requested An Post, <i>inter alia,</i> to withdraw their viability plan as originally presented, and to put in place the means by which they can meet their statutory financial targets, the immediate priority being to agree on measures with the unions to enable the company to achieve break-even by the end of 1992.  The necessary company/union negotiations are being conducted under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission and while some progress has been made to date, I am not satisfied that sufficient progress has been made to enable the company to break even by the end of 1992.</P>
    <P>An Post have suspended consideration of their proposals to close sub-post offices and to instal roadside letterboxes pending the outcome of a socio-economic consultancy study.  The consultants' report has been finalised and I will be examining the report in detail.  As regards the closure of sub-post offices, there is no list as such.  An Post have identified criteria for closure of sub-post offices, which have formed part of the consultancy study. Closures would depend on the outcome of consultations with the Irish Postmasters Union and on the uptake by postmasters and postmistresses of severance terms.  In due course I will arrange for publication of the consultants' report and to make it available to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>As I said, discussions are continuing on enabling the company to achieve break-even by the end of 1992.  Those discussions are taking place under the auspices of the Labour <Col N="263" /> Relations Commission.  All areas of difficulty, with the exception of those issues that were referred to the consultants, are under discussion by the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of closures, even in the Minister's own constituency.  I have no doubt the Minister is aware of the closure of the office in Dominick Street, Galway.  That was not part of the deal.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister did not respond to Deputy Kavanagh's question regarding the report commissioned by her predecessor.  Until such time as that report was presented, there were to be no closures.  Several positions have not been filled after the retirement or the death of a postmaster or postmistress. In addition, the code of discipline is being tightened up.  In County Cork recently there was an instance involving a young man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In carrying out the review, An Post consider the commercial viability of the office, the distance from the nearest post office and local conditions before arriving at a decision.</P>

I explained in reply to a supplementary question asked by Deputy O'Sullivan the basis of which An Post has continued the closure of sub-post offices.  The discussions about the financial difficulties of An Post are continuing at two levels: one level at the Labour Relations Commission and the other level concerns specific points in the viability plan that were referred to the consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that by her reconfirmation in the House today that the Government propose no subvention to An Post she is leaving the company in an impossible position and that there must be drastic and widespread redundancies forced on the company?  Will she not again review the 1983 legislation and the accompanying undertaking of Government capital support for An Post to enable them to modernise and to move on?  Without that support the Minister is leaving An Post high and dry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that even though the Government have told An Post not to go ahead with their plan of sub-post office closures that is what they are doing?  Will she also do something about changing the position where the closure of a sub-post office has resulted in pensioners being asked to travel ten miles in order to collect their pension?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the decision of my predecessor to refer that aspect of the viability plan to the consultants, I am informed by An Post that the only sub-post office closures that have taken place have occurred on the retirement or death of a postmaster or postmistress and where no member of the family of the individual concerned was prepared to apply for appointment to the sub-post office.  If Deputy Farrelly has specific instances of that policy not being pursued by An Post I should be grateful if he would instance them to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unfortunate feature of much of the legislation we have passed in this House that it remains on the Statute Book, largely unenforced. We have just had exchanges on the Order of Business in relation to the Child Care Act which is a case in point.  It was enacted by this House in special committee with great attention but it remains, except for one section, unenforced.  I greatly fear the Bill before us, when enacted, will largely remain unenforced because this House has no control over resources of staff and finance we make available to the local authorities or to An Bord Pleanála.  Some of the grandest schemes can be set at naught by the Department of Finance and by the Government's financial policies.  It greatly concerns me that the same plight will meet this Bill as has met others.  It is full of good intentions in relation to planning matters but it will remain largely unenforced.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the point that the key question of the control of staff resources in Bord Pleanála must be addressed in the context of this Bill.  The Minister when replying might confirm that he will propose on Committee Stage a section dealing with the staff and resources of Bord Pleanála so as to ensure their capability of meeting the deadlines in this Bill. Otherwise planning permissions could be achieved by default.  This is a very significant danger and it would be utterly inimical to good planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said last week that this Bill as it stands could be unconstitutional and that it may need some refining on Committee State to remove any constitutional doubt.  It is well established that persons affected, and third and fourth parties, have a right to have their objections to planning applications heard and fully considered.  In some cases, because of the complexity of some planning proposals, it may take <Col N="414" /> somewhat longer than provided for in this Bill.  The average planning application may even take a little longer than is provided for unless there are some refinements to the Bill.  These include ensuring that on the day the decisions are made by the planning authority in the first place and secondly by Bord Pleanála, the decisions are communicated to each other.</P>
    <P>The local authority should have the information immediately to hand so that they can start the necessary research to provide the board with all relevant data required for a decision on planning.  If the decision is communicated through the post, there could be a delay in posting in the board or in An Post and the local authority may not receive the queries from Bord Pleanála for perhaps a week or more.  The first week of the month provided for in the Bill would be lost. The month's notice to the local authority must start on the day on which they receive the query rather than the day the query was sent.  There is a need to tighten up the provisions of the Bill.  We must legitimately reduce the time taken for planning applications.</P>
    <P>The main consideration of the provisions of this Bill is the speeding up of development based on the belief that much development is delayed, even discouraged in the first place, because of the long procedural wrangle that can be involved and which can affect employment thereby accentuating our already horrendous unemployment position. From that point of view its provisions are entirely welcome provided they do not take short cuts through the planning process or reduce people's rights in any way. Nonetheless the reality is that the majority of delays that take place, certainly in those local authorities where building by-laws are now in force, are occasioned by building by-laws in that it is those building by-laws that deter and delay development much more than planning application delays.</P>
    <P>These building by-laws will be replaced by building regulations later in the year and be effective throughout all local authority areas.  Therefore it is vital not alone <Col N="415" /> that we provide that those building regulation decisions are subjected to the same timescale, commencing on the same date as a planning application, but that appeals lodged under those regulations are also subjected to the same timescale provided in the provisions of this Bill.  It is vital that building by-laws and planning applications go in tandem, eliminating any possibility of there being two tracks, one travelling slower than another, which would have the effect of slowing down the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  At present such building by-laws have the effect of slowing down, overruling the provisions of our current planning laws because applications under building regulations take much longer.</P>
    <P>One might well ask why.  The answer is lack of adequate staff resources.  That is why I am so concerned that there is no provision in this Bill for adequate staff resources for An Bord Pleanála.  I do not mind labouring that point.  Any legislation enacted by this House carries the implicit requirement that staff resources be provided for its enforcement but, in practice, that does not happen.  This means that, in effect, decisions of this House are ignored and much of our law is not implemented.  In my view the overall position is so grave there is need for an overriding rule of this House, a Standing Order, if not a constitutional provision, making it a bounden duty on Government to implement the provisions of laws enacted and to provide the requisite staff resources.</P>
    <P>I only wish the Government, as a whole, were one-tenth as enthusiastic about implementing provisions of laws passed by this House across the board as the Attorney General is in certain specific cases.  It is an important point because effectively this House is being anchored, there being no requirement on Government, or in our Constitution, to provide adequate staff and other resources to ensure effective enforcement of any legislation.</P>
    <P>Before adjourning the debate last week I had raised the question of the potential for corruption in our overall <Col N="416" /> planning system.  It has to be said that the provisions of the Bill before us do nothing to close any potential loopholes or indeed to reduce such potential for corruption within the overall planning system.  In any amendments the Minister may table on Committee Stage I would ask him &mdash; as I will be doing &mdash; to deal specifically with the question of that potential for corruption.  For example, last year the House passed a Local Government Bill limiting the powers of elected councillors <i>vis-à-vis</i> section 4 planning matters so that it now requires three-quarters of the entire membership of a local authority &mdash; not merely three-quarters of those present at any meeting &mdash; to make a planning or rezoning decision.  It was my view that probably that provision went somewhat too far because there are occasions when an elected local authority have a right and duty to take such rezoning decisions in the public interest. Unfortunately, the position got out of hand in certain local authority areas, I regret to say, particularly in Dublin County Council under Fianna Fáil control. At least those councillors who voted repeatedly in favour of section 4 motions had to answer to their electorate.  Many of them paid the price when it came to local elections and lost their seats, the people having spoken very effectively in relation to perceived corruption with regard to section 4 motions.  Nonetheless no steps have been taken to highlight the even greater possibility of corruption that can take place elsewhere in the planning process whether in the official area of planning authorities or in the sphere of responsibility of An Bord Pleanála themselves.  At least local authority officials are answerable to their elected councils but An Bord Pleanála are answerable to nobody, not the subject of anybody's scrutiny.  I regret very much that there has been no attempt made in the provisions of this Bill to address that grievous public concern.</P>
    <P>Many planning decisions of recent years have led to a raising of eyebrows, they have caused much public concern and anger and many have led to the despoilment of the local environment. <Col N="417" /> The Minister would be doing a good day's work in inserting a whole new Part in this Bill to address this loophole.  Last week I advanced proposals on how to render An Bord Pleanála more answerable to this House on overall planning policy, efficiency and so on.  I advanced proposals also which would render them answerable for specific decisions to the local authority of the functional area involved in any such decision.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to these proposals.  I must reiterate that the power at present vested in An Bord Pleanála, enabling them to overrule existing county or county borough development plans, or the zoning contained therein, is too great.  I suggested that that power be taken from An Bord Pleanála.  I know certain circumstances will arise when, in the public interest, the precise zoning of a development plan shall be overruled, when commonsense or environmentally friendly decision-making dictates that such zoning be overruled, but it should be done only with the consent of An Bord Pleanála and the relevant elected local authority.  Certainly I will be tabling amendments to the effect that where An Bord Pleanála seek to take a decision having the effect of initiating the overruling of the zoning of any development plan, they can do so only when the majority of the elected local authority agree with that decision.</P>
    <P>Those are the principal points I wanted to make in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  My party wish to facilitate its speedy passage because we are anxious to speed up the planning procedure.  We acknowledge that the Bill will not come into effect until six months after the President has signed it into law.  Effectively that means it will be the end of the year before this Bill is implemented.  We welcome the Bill in principle because it comes in tandem with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  A major gap in that Bill, as I mentioned on Second Stage, is the lack of any real reference to the built environment.  While I acknowledge the difficulty and that we could be duplicating if we gave the Environmental Protection Agency an extensive role in <Col N="418" /> the built environment, in reality they must have an over view in this regard. However at least a large part of the gap which existed in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is potentially filled by this Bill, perhaps with some amendments. We also have the Building Regulations Bill coming on stream and these three Bills together could make this a very significant year for environmental matters generally.</P>
    <P>When many people speak about the environment they are thinking about the natural environment, the landscape, the water and so on, but the vast majority of our people live in towns and cities and for them the environment is the derelict site, the badly kept estate, air and water pollution.  They would be aggrieved if the Environmental Protection Agency do not have a significant role to play in improving their environment and yet, because of the provisions of that Bill the Environmental Protection Agency will not have a major role in urban areas.  That is disappointing. We have to read the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill to see how it will contribute to improving the urban and the built environment.  I hope the Minister will take on board some of the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on what I regard as being one of the most important and fundamental issues in the whole environmental area: the issue of planning.  In recent years, in particular, there has been a fundamental change in the level of interest of the community at large in relation to planning.  It has paralleled a change in the degree of sophistication with which we have organised our own society.  In the past we sought development as if it was an end in itself and we did not pay much attention to how we could control and regulate that development. It is only on reaching a certain level of sophistication and development that one can afford the luxury of addressing the matter, and in the context of the impact of the urban sprawl and other <Col N="419" /> planning matters on the rest of Europe, we can reflect on how we want to control the built environment in Ireland into the next century.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate and I hope we can broaden the terms of this legislation to address the whole issue of planning which is attracting interest throughout the Community.  People are as much concerned about the built environment as they are about other intrinsic matters in environmental policy.  As other speakers have said, the vast majority of our citizens live and work in an urban environment. Unfortunately, much of the focus recently has been very negative in relation to planning.  This resulted from a series of alleged or perceived scandals in planning, abuse of regulations, that culminated last year in amending legislation being included in the Local Government Act to restrict the democratic rights afforded formerly to local authority members in planning matters. Unfortunately, that was necessary because of certain abuses by a tiny minority of councillors who obviously embarked on a course of amending well-thought-out development plans and forcing decisions on councils that were not in the best interests of the community or in the best interests of proper planning.  We have seen the results of bad planning throughout the country.  They do not all result from corruption or from some get rich quick scheme.  Most of the bad planning decisions throughout the country are the result of lack of foresight or lack of thinking.  Adjoining virtually all our major routes linear development sprawls out of every town, village and urban centre.  There are large, semi-urban satellites of our large towns that obviously pre-empt proper sewerage and drainage facilities and are in no way intrinsic to those towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of planning decisions enhancing and improving our towns they have frequently acted against the best interests of our traditional towns and cities and worked instead to rip the heart out of them and give us linear urban sprawl and <Col N="420" /> satellite communities which did enormous damage to proper planning.  We are beginning to address that issue and the position has improved significantly in recent years.  We have a long way to go because it will always be a balancing act against those who demand and want development.  We need to look after the housing, social and work needs of people while at the same time catering for the aesthetics of a properly planned, developed community and countryside.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have, since the establishment of development plans, sought some controls and have argued out some strategy with the democratically elected local authority members.  In many instances local authority members have devised their own strategies for the proper development of their areas of responsibility.  In recent years imaginative initiatives have been taken by many local authorities.  It is important that we applaud those initiatives.  On the basis of charity beginning at home I will instance my own county as a properly planned area environmentally.  Wexford County Council have produced a comprehensive book, which I am sure the Minister has seen, entitled &ldquo;Building Sensitively in the Landscapes of County Wexford&rdquo;.  This is a response to some of the monstrous buildings that have appeared on the Irish countryside, that have no kinship with Ireland and are totally alien to the gentle sweeping landscapes of our counties.  In a nice pastoral setting we can find a Spanish hacienda or a huge Tudor lodge or many other blots on our landscape.  The idea of producing a book like this, which was an initiative of Wexford County Council, was to provide guidance and help, on a stage by stage basis, to those who wanted to plan properly to enhance Irish landscapes.</P>
    <P>Many people do not know how to go about getting information on what is traditional or is in character with our landscape and heritage and this publication has therefore received a tremendous welcome right across the county.  It analyses the materials which have been used traditionally and are available in each area and the design of housing which <Col N="421" /> would fit in with the landscape and the built environment <i>in situ.</i> If anybody would like a copy of this publication, it can be purchased from Wexford County Council. Indeed, each applicant for planning permission receives a synopsis which outlines in detail, the dos and don'ts &mdash; it is very simple and straightforward, what one should and should not do in relation to light, height, location, roof, window and door design. In relation to chimneys, it outlines what is traditional, modern and what would be out of step with proper planning. I draw the Minister's attention to this publication and recommend it to him as the model to be followed by other local authorities.  I hope, not by coercion but by way of encouragement, we will see a transformation in the type of building in our contryside.</P>
    <P>Our urban centres require the same attention. I draw the Minister's attention to another publication published by the Wexford local authorities, which I again commend to him &mdash; if he has not seen it already, I would ask him to take a look at it &mdash; entitled &ldquo;Shop Fronts and Street-scapes in County Wexford&rdquo;.  This was published by the local authorities' techical staff in which they look in great detail and in a clear and presentable way at streetscapes, outline what is modern, what would be out of step with what is traditional and what would be acceptable. They pick out the best and hold them up as examples.  That is the way to proceed.  Many people before they plan their shop front ask if they can look at this guide and pick out the best.  It is as cheap and easy to plan well as it is to plan badly so long as people known where to go for advice.</P>
    <P>Clearly, it is not the intention that this facility should be in lieu of proper professional advice because most of those who want to draw up a design or construct a building will need good professional advice.  However it is good for the professionals to know there is a resource they can fall back on in identifying materials, designs and structures which would be in keeping with the landscape.  I urge the Minister to use this as a model &mdash; I am sure it is replicated elsewhere across the <Col N="422" /> country &mdash; to see how he can encourage and nudge proper planning in our community. It is most upsetting when one travels the length and breadth of the country to see the most magnificant landscapes spoiled by ugly inappropriate buildings.  As I said, there is a desire and a wish to do what is right but the community need help and assistance and it strikes me that the local authorities are the vehicle to provide this.</P>
    <P>However, there is another side of the coin.  When we want to lay down planning restrictions and nudge and encourage careful and proper planning, there is always a need to balance this with the demands of development.  It is clear that the Bill seeks to address an issue which is causing concern up and down the country, that is, delays in the planning process both at local authority and at appeals levels.  There is disquiet about the time it takes to have a decision made.  The timeframe in making decisions on any planning application can have a serious impact when it comes to deciding whether a project should go ahead.  This is most true when it comes to any project which has job implications.  I believe that what the Minister is trying to do in this legislation is to strike a balance between the right of the community to monitor, to have their opinion registered and to have an input into any proposed structure in their area and the need to give a developer a fair and speedy hearing.  There is an old saying that justice delayed is justice denied.  Many projects have not proceeded because of the delay in getting permission.  I am concerned because delays do occur.  It would be ludicrous to suggest that you could order the delays away.  There is an element of that in this Bill: if, like the Queen of Hearts, we say there will be no delays, then there will be no delays.  You cannot instruct An Bord Pleanála to process appeals within a certain timeframe if, at the same time you deny them the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I welcome this attempt to speed up the procedures but I am concerned on two levels: first, it must always be seen that the individual has the right to have his or her voice properly heard and considered <Col N="423" /> and, second, that we come to the best environmental result.  There has been an increase in the number of appeals received &mdash; 35 per cent between 1988 and 1989.  In 1989, An Bord Pleanála had a staff of 58 compared with a staff of 73 in 1988.  If you want efficient decisions you cannot blame people if you do not provide them with the necessary staff and wherewithal to make those decisions efficiently and effectively.  We are not asking them to make rushed decisions, or at least they should not be asked to make such decisions; rather they should be asked to make decisions as expeditiously as possible consistent with proper planning and the best environmental results.</P>
    <P>Our objective to lay down a certain timeframe within which decisions should be made should run parallel with the objective to provide a proper number of staff.  Clearly, An Bord Pleanála are understaffed at present.  Each of us has received numerous submissions on the position relating to staff.  Indeed, An Taisce in a letter to the Minister informed him that the Bill will not entail additional staff.  I hope the Minister will inform us that the necessary resources will be provided to ensure that decisions made by An Bord Pleanála will not suffer in regard to quality because of the decision of these Houses to curtail the timeframe within which they have to make decisions.</P>
    <P>I understand that the number of staff decreased by 20 per cent between 1988 and 1989.  Indeed, the number of planning inspectors, a critical grade when it comes to processing applications and planning appeals, was reduced by 50 per cent during that period.  If we put the legal framework in place without providing a proper number of staff we will put the board under intolerable strain and put the planning procedure itself at risk.  I hope this is not the intention and that the Minister will give us a firm assurance on that matter.</P>
    <P>The delays are not exclusive to the appeals system, on which this Bill in the main focuses.  Delays also occur at local level.  Because the numbers have been <Col N="424" /> reduced in all local authorities during the past few years, only a skeleton staff is available for each local authority activity. While some areas might survive, others will cease but the planning process will have to continue because people have to obey the law.  I am delighted there has been an increase in the number of planning applications in a progressive county like my own but, unfortunately, in trying to cope with this increase many managerial decisions on the running of the planning office were forced on Wexford County Council.  For example, a decision had to be made to restrict the access time of planning officials to the general public. So they now have an allocation of time in their day to meet the general public.  I know that some of them come in at 7.30 a.m. to try to get some work done before the telephones ring in relation to planning matters.  Nobody can work under that sort of pressure.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the people who produced this sort of documentation are committed to their job.  However, we need to help them to do their job well and it is intolerable that we respond to their initiatives in producing proper frameworks for planning and guidelines to the general public by squeezing their numbers to such an extent that they are barely able to cope and are totally overworked.  We need, in isolation from the whole general staffing issue, to look at planning as a very important environmental issue and to ensure that there is adequate staff to process in a proper, efficient way, all applications coming before a local authority. We should seek to encourage initiatives like this to allow individual staff members to be seconded to produce documents like this, to look at other counties and to co-ordinate work so that planning staff can look at the overall context in a national, regional and local way.  We do not do that at present with the sort of restrictions we put on them, which is a fatal flaw in the whole planning process.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific proposals in the Bill to deal with them.  I welcome the four months general appeal period for determination of cases because the vast majority of cases are already <Col N="425" /> dealt with during that time, only the exceptional ones are not.  Obviously the Minister will have some measure of residual power in relation to exceptional applications, which is proper, because there will be very significant applications. In the late seventies one application was submitted to my local authority and I thought it bizarre that a local authority should be the body ultimately empowered to decide whether we should build a nuclear power station.  In 1977-78 the 21 members of Wexford County Council were expected to determine national policy, which was a little bit much to ask of them.  Thankfully the good sense of our people decided that issue.  However, I fully accept the need for residual power to be vested in the Minister and to vary it in relation to specific applications.</P>
    <P>Appellants will have to state in full their grounds for an appeal and the appeal will be invalid unless that is done. I hope it will work; many people are not familiar with the official way of doing things and are intimidated by a letter which bears a harp.  They are also intimidated by any building which houses a great number of offices and officialdom. I am very concerned about the individual right and we will have to put some mechanism in place to ensure that individuals do not feel excluded by some legal imperative to have a detailed case argued in order to be able to appeal.  That matter causes me great concern and I know some local authorities, particularly outside this jurisdiction, hold &ldquo;planning clinics&rdquo;, an office of the local authority where people concerned with a planning matter, those applying for planning permission for a particular scheme, house or project or who wish to object or want further information, can, without being intimidated, have ready access to the information to which they are entitled.  We must have openness in our dealings with the public. There is a reluctance to share information with the general public and we must get away from that kind of attitude.  All opinions are important and everyone should have a say.</P>
    <P>Sometimes a project can be mooted to which there is huge hostility.  However, <Col N="426" /> many of those hostile to it literally do not know what the project is about because all the information in regard to it is not readily available to them.  It is good for everybody &mdash; people who want to develop and those who want to keep development environmentally friendly &mdash; to have all information readily available to them.  On a statutory basis we should require local authorities to have some level of interface, planning clinic or facility to allow people have information in advance of planning applications and on planning applications which are being considered.  Of course, that is a matter for staffing and resources &mdash; we get back to the same issue again and again.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that parties to an appeal will have one month to comment on the appeal, which seems reasonable, and that planning authorities will have to make documents relating to a planning appeal available for public inspection from the date of the decision on the application. Again, this is a welcome move and a good requirement.</P>
    <P>A number of issues not addressed in the legislation have caused disquiet and concern in recent times, I am concerned about the whole issue of retention appeals.  There are two levels in this regard and I want to distinguish between them.  There are the everyday retention applications for a very minor adjustment, where someone built the house six feet in the wrong direction or changed the length of a window by a few inches; minor alterations which most people would not notice.  People apply for retentions so that there will not be a problem in relation to future sales and they are generally granted.  However, there is a growing practice which causes me concern, the use of retention appeals as a way of avoiding proper planning.  People have a &ldquo;build and be damned&rdquo; attitude and then submit a retention application in the hope &mdash; whatever about the expectation &mdash; that, when it is there, nobody will compel them to remove it.  It is very important not to allow the planning laws to be circumvented by a procedure which allows people to think that they can build something and rectify it legally afterwards. <Col N="427" /> Most, if not all, local authorities would take a very dim view of that.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many local authorities monitor the specific buildings which have been given planning permission to ensure that they comply with it in detail.  I do not think here are adequate levels of staffing to ensure that this is the case. Often things come to light years after they are in place, there is no planning permission for them but, unless someone objects and specifically brings it to the attention of the local authority concerned, it simply goes unnoticed.  It means that some people can run a coach and four through the planning laws and procedures.</P>
    <P>Another issue that concerns me is the definition of &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;.  It is not properly defined, as far as I can see, in relation to existing planning Acts. There is a certain discretion in the hands of a county manager to decide what is a material contravention of a development plan.  Last year under the local government legislation we rightly strengthened the democratic authority required for contravention, but there is a need for further clarification on the specifics of what exactly is meant by a &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo;. I hope the Minister will refer to these matters when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>I said the objective of the Bill was to strike a balance between the rights of everybody to have a say in regard to their environment and the community need for development.  This comes immediately after the decision of the Minister for the Environment on 17 February to dramatically increase the fees for third party appeals.  There is clearly a perceived and real lessening of the right of an individual to appeal under this Bill and, taken with the dramatic increase in fees, I believe it will be preceived as an official reaction against the right of the individual.  I hope that is not the case and that the Department of the Environment and the Minister do not hold the view that there is a group out there who will stymie the development and who have <Col N="428" /> to be knocked down.  Quite frankly, I deprecate the increase in fees and I hope the Minister will think again about it. One's ability to afford the fees should not determine one's right to make an appeal. This is a very important issue and it is one to which I hope the Minister will refer when he is replying on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell, the Fine Gael spokesman, put forward a number of very interesting suggestions, particularly when he spoke last week.  He said he would be putting forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage, one of which would have the purpose of establishing a Dáil environmental committee. While this is a very welcome suggestion, it is not new.  As in the case of virtually every democratically elected Parliament in western Europe, there should be a Dáil committee on the environment who would have a general remit in environmental matters which are of such importance now.  They should have a planning role not in terms of specific planning but of the overall monitoring of the generality of planning so as to establish a national consistency in planning. Obviously there will be regional and local variations in keeping with the environment in certain areas.  Now and again there is a visible difference in the attitude to planning between separate local authorities.  There should be some level of national consistency in planning so that people who make an application for a building will know the reaction of the planning staff in various areas.  I believe there is a role for an environmental committee in this area.  There are a number of other issues in this respect which I will not go into as they are not germane to this legislation.  As a matter of principle I strongly support the notion of an environmental committee of the House.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the specific reasons put forward by Deputy Mitchell in relation to his perceived need for an environmental committee.  He said this would subject An Bord Pleanála to scrutiny in a general way.  It is interesting to reflect on the reasoning which brought An Bord Pleanála into existence.  I <Col N="429" /> believe most people were a little concerned when all power resided ultimately in the Minister for the Environment, when he was the final arbiter in all planning matters.  Some amazing decisions were made by Ministers for the Environment and I am sure there are officials in the House who would be able to recite them but who, of course, would not do so in public.  Some spectacular and appalling decisions were made by Ministers for the Environment in relation to planning matters and I think there was a strong view at the time that we needed to depoliticise the whole issue of planning.  This is why An Bord Pleanála came into existence. They were set up in a very unique way by this House so that they would not be subject to public pressure or, more specifically, political pressure; they could not be bullied by a Minister, by Government or any political party.  In spite of one or two serious hiccups, by and large, An Bord Pleanála have served the country well.  I would be concerned if we introduced any element of politicisation again whereby the total and complete independence of the appeals system was brought into question.  We went through that period and, thankfully, came out of it when Deputy Spring established An Bord Pleanála during the 1980s.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell put forward a number of other propositions and said he will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  One of the things he wants to do is to require An Bord Pleanála to appear before an environment committee of this House to explain their decisions.  Maybe there is a merit in that proposal but, as I said, we need to strike a balance between an independent decision-making body and the operation of this House.  On occasion we find fault with the Judiciary in regard to judicial decisions but I do not think too many people would suggest that it would be right or proper to summon a judge of the High Court or Circuit Court to explain his or her actions to any committee of this House.  There is a separation of powers between both and I regard An Bord Pleanála as a quasi-judicial tribunal who are impartial and make decisions, unless, <Col N="430" /> of course, they make outrageous decisions in which case we might seek to amend the law.  I would be concerned about this suggestion of Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>I support the Deputy's suggestion that inspectors' reports on appeal cases should be published.  This comes back to the right to know as a fundamental principle.  Irish people tend to use information as a power force: we garner to ourselves whatever information we can and we are very reluctant to share it with others.  We need to break this practice.  I understand openness is to be a hallmark of the Government and I hope we will see this in the planning process also.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the fact that the Bill addresses the issue of planning.  Not enough attention has been given to a coherent planning strategy, not enough resources have been made available either at local or national level to have proper planning and, repeatedly, decisions are made which are not in the best interests of our environment.  The very best of public servants working at local authority level are stretched to their limit and often simply do not have the resources to follow through matters so that the best possible decisions can be made.  Obviously we have to live with the decisions that are made.  These decisions shape our country and impact on the attractiveness of our country in terms of tourism which is a very significant part of our jobs strategy.  I hope on Committee Stage we can strike the proper balance between the clear rights of every individual to have a say, a voice, and be listened to in regard to the built environment in which they reside and the needs of the community for proper development.  The Labour Party will not be opposing the Bill on Second Stage but we hope to amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity that the presentation of this Bill gives the House to debate the issue of planning, which is central to the general national debate on the environment.  Certainly prior to the last local elections there was considerable public debate on <Col N="431" /> issues of planning, much of which concentrated on the use or abuse of section 4 motions, material contravention procedure and the abuse of the planning system generally, particularly in the Dublin area, about which there was great concern.  There is no doubt that there is need for reform of the planning system. The main planning legislation is almost 30 years old and the legislation establishing An Bord Pleanála is over 15 years old.</P>
      <P>In many respects in the presentation of this Bill to the House an opportunity has been missed to reform the whole planning area.  The Bill before us deals exclusively with the appeals system, but it deals with it in a very narrow context. It deals with the perceived problem of delays in the appeals system and it tries to address that problem and speed up the appeals system.  I do not think anybody will dispute the desirability of speeding up decision making, but it is important that it is not done at the expense of good decision making or at the expense of one or other interest in the planning area. One of my principal concerns about this legislation is that it is tilting the balance in favour of developers and builders, who quite understandably want to get quick decisions, and away from the interests of the general public and local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that, for example, the Construction Industry Federation, in their December 1991 issue of <i>Housing News</i>, warmly welcome this Bill.  It states that the circulation of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991, brings to partial fruition a campaign mounted by Irish House Builders Association for changes in the law to speed up the planning process.  It goes on to detail the provisions, amendments and improvements in the Bill which have been sought by the Irish House Builders Association and the Construction Industry Federation for some time.  There is nothing wrong with the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish House Builders Association seeking to secure changes in the legislation in order to meet the wishes of their members, but I am <Col N="432" /> surprised that the Bill gives to that interest group what they sought at the expense of other interests in the planning area.</P>
    <P>The effect of this Bill will be to speed up decision-making and avoid a situation whereby appeals are with An Bord Pleanála for a very long period of time. However, it will also have the effect of making it more difficult for members of the public, third parties, local communities, residents' associations and individual citizens to lodge an appeal against an application with which they are unhappy.  It will make it more difficult for those interests to pursue such an appeal in the course of time.  There has been much talk in this House on various Bills about level playing pitches.  When it comes to matters dealing with development and planning, there is not a level playing pitch.  A large company who propose to carry out a very significant development or not playing on the same pitch as a small, poorly resourced residents' association who may have genuine fears about such a development.  My concern is that this Bill will make it easier for the well resourced company or perhaps a well resourced community or residents' association to pursue their interests while making that more difficult for the individual citizen or the more poorly resourced community.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the opportunity has not been in this legislation to introduce some further review of the planning system in which there is a great lack of involvement of the public.  Certainly there is provision for the involvement of the public in the making of development plans at local authority level but, as we all know, the making of development plans and their revision is a periodic matter.  Sometimes the making of a development plan lacks the precision that is brought about when a planning application is lodged.  There is need for the public to be involved to a greater extent in planning decisions and in the processing of planning applications than is the case at present.  If provision were made for that much fewer planning applications would be appealed to An Bord Pleanála, we would have a better <Col N="433" /> planning system, a better degree of harmony between local communities and developers and a better mechanism for dealing with matters relating to the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the public is effectively excluded from the detail of planning applications needs to be addressed. First, a planning application has to be advertised in a newspaper.  We all know of cases where such advertisements are placed in the Irish language, of which I am in favour and I would like to see many more notices and matters of that kind appearing in the Irish language, but I sometimes doubt the motives for which planning applications appear in the Irish language, particularly in newspapers which have low circulation in the area involved in the planning application. Planning applications are listed by local authorities and are sometimes posted outside local authority offices or circulated to residents' associations but the circulation of those lists is often quite erratic.  Sometimes residents' associations may not be very well organised and some local authorities charge for the circulation of the lists, often resulting in a controversial planning application going unnoticed by the local community.</P>
    <P>I recall one very controversial development in my locality where some years ago there was much controversy about the felling of trees in a development now known as Dorney Court.  The first time the local people adjoining that development heard about the planning application was when the JCBs moved in to knock down the trees.  Nobody had noticed the newspaper advertisement and the residents' association had not got the planning list.  In some cases planning applications are submitted, curiously enough in the month of August.  A remarkably popular date for the submission of planning applications is 24 December, and that usually relates to the degree of potential controversy an application may cause.  Recently I had dealings with controversial applications that were submitted at Christmas time. One of those involved an application for an extension to a football pavilion in <Col N="434" /> Dalkey; for the provision of a firing range for a gun club.  In fact, had the applicants not taken some local soundings it is possible local people would not have even heard of that application.  A similar and more recent instance involved Iarnród Éireann, who entered into a contract for the sale of land, the old atmospheric railway line, again in Dalkey and an application for the erection of 14 apartments as submitted a couple of days before Christmas.</P>
    <P>My point is that very often the public do not even know that a planning application is being considered by the local authority because they miss the notices, do not get the lists or for some other reason.  It is a pity that the Bill did not include a provision placing an obligation on local authorities to notify local residents' associations directly of an application having been made or whereby the applicant would be obligated not only to place an advertisement in a newspaper but also to give local people certain notices.</P>
    <P>Quite rightly, the making of a planning decision involves the professional judgment of professional planners, having received the advice and reports of other professionals, such as roads engineers and staff of local authorities. Members of the public, if they are aware of the planning application, can write to the planning authorities to state their objections to an application.  Elected members of a local authority can make their views known by way of recommendation. However, there is no formal procedure whereby the local community can be involved in the decision-making.</P>
    <P>In regard to an application that has recently become controversial in the Blackrock area I suggested it would be useful to have professional planners, the developer and the local residents' association sit around a table and try to iron out some of the difficulties.  That procedure would have been productive but, unfortunately, our planning procedure does not contain a mechanism whereby that can be done.  If there were such a mechanism many of the applications that result in appeals to An Bord Pleanála could be <Col N="435" /> resolved in a pragmatic way.  If the public had an opportunity to become involved at the decision-making stage many problems could be resolved.  It is bizzare that very often the first time all interested parties are gathered in the same room occurs when An Bord Pleanála grant an oral hearing.  It is important that the developer, the planning officials, objectors and elected public representatives be brought together earlier.  There should be provision whereby people who have an interest in a planning application are given the opportunity to sit around the same table to try to resolve the issues concerned.  Sometimes it may be a simple issue of screening or a design-related matter and that can be resolved in a pragmatic way.  The way the planning system is designed gives rise to an adversarial and confrontational procedure.  It would be better to have a procedure such as that operating in Holland, where local planning groups, the professional planners, the local community and elected representatives come together to try to iron out problems.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to speed up the appeals process.  There is nothing wrong with that in principle.  Nobody wants procedures that are unnecessarily long and take too long to deliver decisions. However, like Deputy Howlin, I am amazed that the explanatory memorandum to the Bill contains the bald statement that the Bill will not entail additional staffing or financial requirements for An Bord Pleanála.  It was certainly my understanding that the biggest difficulty resulting in delays at An Bord Pleanála related to staffing and resources.  Reference has been made to the reductions in staff that have befallen An Bord Pleanála.  Between 1988 and 1989 the staffing level was down by 20 per cent and the number of planning inspectors was down by 50 per cent.  It was as a direct result of the reduction in staffing in An Bord Pleanála that the big backlog of planning applications and appeals built up.  It was at that time that the building industry demanded, understandably, a speeding up of the appeals <Col N="436" /> process.  The appeals process cannot be speeded up simply by the enactment of legislation.  Unless the resources and the staff are provided the speeding up will not occur.  If the House legislated that the appeals process had to be speeded up and if it were ordered that decisions had to be made within four months but provision for staff and resources was not made we would end up with bad decisions.</P>
    <P>One of the problems, which is a matter of considerable public frustration, is that very often An Bord Pleanála issue bad decisions that cannot be understood by local communities and sometimes cannot be understood by the planning applicant. I think it was Deputy Mitchell who mentioned earlier that An Bord Pleanála are not accountable and do not have to explain their reasons for making any decision.  If it happens that An Bord Pleanála must make a decision within too short a time and, side by side with that, they do not have the staff and the inspectors to carry out proper exploration of applications the result will be bad decisions.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong in principle with the reduction to four months in the length of time within which An Bord Pleanála have to make their decisions. However, I am concerned that good decision-making may be sacrificed in the interest of speed.  I am also concerned that a time limit of four months may be too short for many applications.  The Bill includes provision for the board at their discretion to extend that period of time but more and more planning applications, and their appeals, are becoming very complicated.  For example, we are into the era of environmental impact assessments and also a much more professional approach being taken to both applications and appeals.  I am concerned that four months may be too short, particularly when there is a complicated or difficult issue to be decided.</P>
    <P>My main concern relates to the period of time and the procedure for lodging an appeal.  As I understand it, the new procedure under this Bill will be that an appeal must be lodged within one month <Col N="437" /> and that the entire case for the appeal must be lodged at the same time.  In other words, it will not be possible for someone to write to An Bord Pleanála objecting to a planning decision and then later submit considered reasons for the objection. That requirement will place local communities, residents' associations and individual citizens and bodies like An Taisce at a considerable disadvantage.  The detailed letter from An Taisce to the Minister which was referred to earlier provides considerable material for all of us on Committee Stage.  On this point the letter says:</P>
    <P>Local authority planning lists often in the case of a large planning authority like Dublin Corporation which issues a weekly list do not reach An Taisce until 17 days after a particular decision. Some local authorities such as Wicklow County Council only compile a monthly planning list.  For example, its January 1992 list only reached An Taisce on 7 February, 1992.  Many voluntary bodies like community councils and local associations of An Taisce only meet once a month and would not have enough time to prepare their full grounds of appeal within a month should they wish to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  Most local authority planning offices are only open during working hours and many close before 4 p.m. forcing the interested person to take a half day off work in order to see the relevant planning file.  People cannot get copies of any of the material lodged as part of the application with a local authority from the local authority which hinders their consideration of the issues and preparation of an appeal.  Most local authorities, even the larger ones, operate the hatch system of communicating with the public in their offices which makes it difficult, due to the cramped conditions, often including no seating, to take notes from planning files. </P>
    <P>That clearly states the problem.  As I understand it, the month runs from the date on which the decision is made.  The applicant will know the decision very <Col N="438" /> quickly as will the local authority and its members, but an interested third party may not know the decision.  An Taisce, a body which is on top of these things, do not get Dublin Corporation lists until more than half way into the month.  A local residents association, even the best organised residents' association may not get the information that a decision has been made until well into the month.  In some cases the month may have passed before a householder discovers that a development is to start in a field behind his house.  I know a case of a family who went on holidays and when they came back they discovered that planning permission had been granted for an enterprise which looked like a handball alley which would back on to their back garden, and they had missed the date by which they could lodge an appeal.  The month within which people have to lodge an appeal will mean that people will miss the deadline and will have to put up with unacceptable developments against which they would have liked to appeal. Worse than that, even if they find out that a decision has been made and they would like to appeal it, under this Bill they will have to state chapter and verse the grounds of their appeal and they will not be permitted to add to it at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Planning decisions and planning matters can be very complicated.  People may want to consult with professionals, to get additional information or simply to look at the planning file in the office of the local authority.  For an individual citizen or a residents' association which is not terribly well resourced that would be very difficult.  Under this Bill the only people who will be able to make effective appeals to An Bord Pleanála are either well resourced developers who have done their homework and have their architect's and engineer's reports and so on or a well resourced community who might be in a position to make their appeal very quickly.  If one happens to live in a wealthy area and have engineers, planners and architects in one's residents association they might be able to quickly <Col N="439" /> put their act together and make the substantive submission this Bill requires to An Bord Pleanála.  Ordinary citizens or ordinary residents' associations who only meet periodically, for instance when there is a crisis, who find out at the eleventh hour that someone got a planning permission which should be appealed, will not be in a position to put a submission together in a hurry.  This will make the planning appeals process the preserve of professionals.  Joe Citizen or Mary Citizen will not now be able to lodge an appeal in their own handwriting stating in layman's language the grounds of their appeal.  If one does not have money to pay a professional one will not be able to submit the kind of appeal necessary.  Under this Bill there is no second shot at it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision in section 4 (3) that one effectively does not get a second bite at the cherry.  It has been suggested that this provision may well be unconstitutional.  The subsection says:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to <i>section 9,</i> an appellant shall not be entitled to elaborate in writing upon, or to make further submissions in writing in relation to, the grounds of appeal stated in the appeal or to submit further grounds of appeal and any such elaboration, submissions or further grounds of appeal that is or are received by the board shall not be considered by it. </P>
    <P>If one does not get it all in the first time round, one does not get a second chance unless the other party to the appeal states something, when the appellant will get an opportunity to reply.  The appellant only gets one chance to reply, and that also may be insufficient.  I know of a case involving a small scheme of five houses which was never fully completed.  The developer did not finish the estate but sold a sixth site to a third party who submitted a planning application for the site.  There were objections from the other five houses.  The case went on for the best part of 12 months.  The appellants in this case repeatedly had to refute <Col N="440" /> inaccuracies and misinterpretations by the planning applicant.  These things can happen.  If there is not sufficient opportunity for people to stand back from the argument that has been made the first time round, particularly where an oral hearing has not been granted, the appellant will be at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Many things might arise after the month is up about which the appellant might want to appeal.  Some additional information, for example, might arise in relation to the ownership of the site and there will be no opportunity to submit information in relation to that.  Indeed, additional information might arise about the planning history of the site.  Very often in these dodgy planning applications, the planning history can go back for over 20 years.  I know of a case where planning permission was originally sought for a residential flat, it was converted to a shop, it then became a dry cleaners and ended up being used as a take-away restaurant through a whole series of changes of use.  Sometimes a property can have a very long planning history.  Not everybody will be in a position to find out the planning history within the four week period and there may well be a need for people to come back and have a second opportunity to outline what they have found out since they last wrote; indeed they might have found out something in relation to the archaeological or historical value which was not immediately known to the appellant. Unfortunately this Bill will prevent people from making that kind of case.</P>
    <P>The other issue which I wish to raise and which is provided for in the Bill is in relation to fees.  An Bord Pleanála can charge fees for appeals but the fees the Minister is allowing them to charge, and which are currently being charged, have got out of all proportion.  It now costs £100 to make a third party appeal.  A fee of £100 is chicken feed for a developer who wishes to appeal but it is prohibitive for the individual citizen who wishes to appeal.  When one says to the citizen he cannot appeal unless he puts up £100, you are effectively telling him that unless he has money his voice will not be heard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> In addition, the fee for making a submission on a planning application has now gone up to £30, which is a 300 per cent increase on the fee charged in 1984. I have come across cases where I have been asked as a public representative to pay the fee of £15 &mdash; which was the charge before the recent increase &mdash; when I have been asked to write on behalf of a residents' association in support of their appeal to the planning authority before it will be considered by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The cumulative effect of what is happening &mdash; the increase in fees for third party appeals, the new legislation which says that this must be done within one month and one does not get a second bite at it and that An Bord Pleanála can dismiss what it calls frivolous or vexatious appeals &mdash; is that the whole thrust is directed against the individual citizen, residents' associations, local communities and so on.  Effectively it is professionalising and making the planning appeals more expensive.  Quite frankly, I believe that is the wrong direction.  Let us by all means have legislation that has the effect of speeding up decision-making, and within reason let us have periods of time within which decisions have to be made.  Let us have the staff and resources which will enable the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to make decisions as they should make them.  However, we should not take away the rights of individual citizens and local communities because that is going against the whole principle we hear so much talk about at present, of subsidiarity, democratic deficit and so on.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Bill is intended to speed up the planning appeals process but I believe it erodes the rights of the citizen and of local communities.  On Committee Stage we will have to address this Bill to try to change some of the provisions and restore the balance so that we can facilitate decision-making but that we do so in a way that does not inhibit or run counter to the needs and wishes of local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. I will make a number of brief general <Col N="442" /> comments on the Bill.  It is important that the procedures of An Bord Pleanála should be clarified and an effort should be made to speed up the appeals procedure. Recently a man who wanted to build a house visited one of my clinics.  He had submitted a planning application but some neighbours objected to the type of house he wished to build and they appealed the decision to An Bord Pleanála.  The appeal has been going on over a period of six months.  I think it is quite ludicrous to expect somebody to wait that long for a decision on the type of house plan.  He already had outline planning permission and he was now looking for full planning permission. Although this Bill will not effect his particular case, it is not before its time.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers on a number of aspects of the Bill but I would be diametrically opposed to the opinions of the last speaker as regards the opportunities the general public have to object to planning permission.  There has to be a balance between the right of people to object and the right of people to build. To a certain extent while an effort has been made to remedy the situation at the stage when it reaches An Bord Pleanála, the Department have not gone far enough.  They would have been better served by trying to codify the entire planning legislation into one large Act and, at the same time, addressing the logjam at urban council or county council level in the planning application process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody appreciates that when one submits a planning application the planning authority have two months within which to make a decision but we all know that invariably the local authority issue a letter requesting further additional information within a week or two of the deadline, thus putting back the whole process for another couple of months.  This creates a logjam and has an effect not only on the person involved but on the overall house building in the country. Indeed, applicants for sole developments have been frustrated by this process.  The local authority official may not get around to deal with the application until the last week of the two-month period <Col N="443" /> and because all the reports have not come in or for reasons of pressure of work they issue a letter seeking further information which delays the whole process for another two months.</P>
    <P>I accept that in some cases applicants do not provide sufficient information at the initial stage.  It is my experience and that of other public representatives that the planning authorities fall into the trap of putting out letters of further information within a week or two of the lapsing of the decision period.  The Department of the Environment should address this matter very quickly.  We talk about the housing problem and Deputy Gilmore mentioned the problems of people who wish to object.  There is a housing shortage and one of the ways to help would be to allow more flexibility.  Letters requiring further information can cause a matter to drag out.  This is not right and the problem should be addressed, particularly if we want to get the building industry back on its feet.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be commended, although it does not go far enough and should address the whole area of time limits.  Nevertheless, it is a particularly good Bill.  The four month time limit, while it may cause problems in some cases, is reasonable.  The information should already be on the file prior to the matter going to An Bord Pleanála and they should be able to make their decision within that time.  There is provision to allow the Minister by regulation to vary the time period.  I would be slightly worried that these regulations might come in and in some way curtail the implementation of that time limit. Perhaps we could deal with this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The identity of objectors at local authority level is not readily made known to the applicant, whereas at an Bord Pleanála stage the identity of the objectors is always well signposted because of the flow of correspondence.  Future legislation might allow the applicant to know the identity of objectors in the initial stages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Much has been made of section 4 applications. I come from a county where some use of the section 4 procedure has been made because of difficulties which have arisen in the implementation of the development plan.  It is slightly unfair to say that the section 4 system has been abused.  I have not been a great fan of section 4 applications, although I have signed a few in my day.</P>
    <P>There should be some input by local representatives in the decision-making process.  This has not been allowed.  Legal opinion is that local representatives are not the planning authority.  Ultimately the officials and the county manager have the say.  The views of public representatives should be taken into account in planning decisions.  Any appeals in respect of the section 4 procedure are almost always unsuccessful with An Bord Pleanála because the people there have a problem with these applications.  The figures will show that very few of the section 4 applications which are appealed to An Bord Pleanála get through.  Perhaps the Minister will give some indication of the success rate of section 4 applications which have been appealed.</P>
    <P>I broadly welcome the Bill.  The point should be made that a lot more work has to be done regarding the time limit procedure for applications at local authority level.  It is not good enough that applicants can be held back for some spurious reasons involving further information; it cannot be denied that this happens.  The Minister should examine the possibility of introducing further legislation to tie down local authorities in this area.  The House should welcome this Bill because it is an effort to tie down appellants, local authorities and An Bord Pleanála and to have a final determination made on an application that comes before An Bord Pleanála.  I warmly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his recent appointment.  I also congratulate the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith.  I hope the two Ministers do not take hurling matters too seriously and <Col N="445" /> that when Cork and Tipperary meet they will take it in good spirit.  I know they will work within the Department for the betterment of the people.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State and wish them both well.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was first announced by the then Minister for the Environment, most commentators and the Minister himself described it as a measure to speed up the planning appeal process.  The newspapers reported the matter on 27 November 1991.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said that the new Bill aimed to speed up planning appeals.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> ran a headline &mdash;&ldquo;New Planning Appeals Rules to Speed up Decision Time&rdquo;.  The <i>Irish Press</i> reported that the appeal time-scale was to be limited to four months.</P>
      <P>If I were a developer, a builder, a property speculator or a company wishing to establish a not very clean industry here, I would certainly welcome this Bill. I am not out to hammer the developer, the industrialist or the builder.  Developers and builders speculate.  That is their right and I support it.  They buy land and apply for planning permission which, when they get it, is a licence to print money.  Planning permission will probably treble the value of the land and those who purchased it cheaply in the first place will make a large profit.  That is their business.  Thank God we live in a country where people are entitled to make money and profit is not a dirty word.  People should be able to make that money but within certain confines and constraints. On the other hand, if I were a concerned resident anxious to preserve the quality of the environment in my locality, perhaps a member of a residents' association, I would doubt this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cite residents' associations and other groups in my area who have successfully fought controversial planning applications such as the Encamp project proposed for the Baldoyle area.  I make no excuse for my tremendous interest in Howth and other local areas such as Baldoyle and any remarks I make on this Bill will reflect that interest.  If I were representing a residents' association which <Col N="446" /> had fought off such developments threatening my local environment, I would not welcome the provisions of this Bill. Indeed I would be very worried about them.  Again I have in mind the Encamp development in Baldoyle which proposed the erection of 2,500 houses on practically the only remaining green belt after Baldoyle.  That application was submitted to Dublin County Council who refused it.  The matter was then appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  Local residents and other groups, and environmentalists from all over Dublin joined together because they perceived this to be a unique area, zoned for agricultural use, located beside an estuary of international significance, an over-wintering preserve for birds migrating from Canada, an area well worthy of preservation.  They joined together, put up a tremendous fight, eventually defeating the Encamp developers in their efforts.  The same company had also proposed the installation of a toll sewer to cross the local estuary into Dublin Bay, probably emptying raw sewage into the bay.  They proposed leaving very little open space for the people already resident there, a most undesirable development which was defeated by the efforts of local residents and community groups on which they should be congratulated.</P>
    <P>Another example would be that of the proposed Red Rock development in Howth some years ago, a proposal on the part of another builder to erect many houses in one of our most scenic areas. Howth is a unique scenic area being located so near to the city with ideal walks and viewing positions for locals and tourists alike.  A person who came into possession of land at Red Rock decided he would like to build a certain number of houses there.  Again, the local communities grouped together and objected. The application was submitted to An Bord Pleanála who, as far as I can remember, granted permission.  At that stage Dublin County Council entered in and dealt with that developer on the basis of land swaps, offering him certain lands throughout the county in their possession in order to get him off the site which the local people <Col N="447" /> wanted to preserve.  That controversy has continued to date, as the proposed house builder is not satisfied with the land offered him.  For example, certain lands offered him by Dublin County Council were not of the required quality in that I think he was seeking land in Dublin 4 on which he could make a considerable amount of money.  The site remains intact to date.  I would stress that land swops should not be engaged in in any planning applications or permissions.</P>
    <P>There is at present another application before Dublin County Council with regard to the East Mountain at Howth, one of the most scenic areas in these islands, close to the city centre, an area of unique environmental interest forming part of the Howth hinterland.  Some time ago the person who had bought this land decided to build a Dallas-type house for himself there which proposal was appealed by local residents and interest groups who were successful in warding off the project for a while.  However, Dublin County Council had to grant partial permission in that there was a house already existing on the site on which he proposed building the new property.  This meant the whole East Mountain was threatened when local residents groups had to talk to the owner of the property. When they endeavoured to do so it transpired there were other interested people, those with grazing rights and so on.  I and another local Fianna Fáil councillor decided to talk to local landowners, endeavouring to bring about a solution. I should say that, as a public representative it is not pleasant to enter into such negotiations.  Generally we do not like dealing with developers we know are out to make money, many of whom would not have the same concern for our environment.  In addition, local communities may well be suspicious of politicians engaging in discussions with landowners with a view to having such property acquired by Dublin County Council in order to create a park or some other public amenity.  One could not blame people for being suspicious of such negotiations.  We are still endeavouring <Col N="448" /> to acquire that property for Dublin County Council.  The developers want to make money out of the project, are demanding planning permissions for the site which are outrageous and which we could not concede, in that they are seeking such permission in high amenity areas worthy of preservation.  We will not travel that road with them.  As I have said, the East Mountain in Howth is a unique area, with excellent walks, where Dublin County Council could create an ideal park, thus preserving this land for future generations of Dubliners and others.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council are examining the whole of the Howth scene which warrants much attention but in order to improve facilities there generally the relevant properties must be in their ownership which is the goal to which they are working.  That is the reason we are endeavouring to get the owners of those lands in Howth to negotiate with Dublin County Council so that a park can be created on the East Mountain along with other high amenity lands.  I make no excuse for talking to the owners of such lands, and I will continue to do so in an effort to have them acquired by Dublin County Council thus ensuring their development for future generations of Dubliners and tourists alike.  I might mention in particular the Howth/Sutton 2000 group who have worked so hard over many years to preserve their local amenity areas, a voluntary group, something of an offshoot of An Taisce who work extremely hard to preserve this and other areas in the Howth vicinity. Indeed, the recent Dublin County Council draft development plan led to that group spending much money to devise their plans for the Howth/Sutton area which were submitted to Dublin County Council for discussion within the overall draft development plan to be considered by the council in the near future. One must commend and support the work that local groups are undertaking especially in the preservation of the East Mountain and other surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>Another case that comes to mind is that of the threatened oil refinery in <Col N="449" /> Dublin Bay some years ago when local residents grouped together to ensure that no such installation would be located within the vicinity of Dublin Bay. Another undesirable planning application for the Dublin Bay area was that in relation to the installation of gas caverns proposed some years ago, when local residents associations successfully fought and defeated that application.  However, in order to do so one must remember that such local residents associations must get planners and others on their side, which costs a lot of money, necessitating the holding of local raffles and other functions in order to get sufficient funds with which to consult experts and so properly present their case to An Bord Pleanála. They were successful and were able to operate within the framework which then existed and to prevent this most undesirable development in Dublin Bay.  Groups like An Taisce, Howth 2000 and people who were anxious to preserve the environment are at a disadvantage under this Bill because they will have to raise money to employ experts.</P>
    <P>A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that when a planning authority issues a decision, appellants will have one month in which to prepare their case in full.  This includes an examination of the council file and internal documents and preparing any surveys which are needed to rebut arguments.  That will be very costly for people and for local residents' associations who wish to appeal these decisions in the future.  I would ask the Minister to consider the situation and, perhaps, make a grant available to residents' associations or to An Taisce to ensure they have sufficient resources to look after their own environment.</P>
    <P>This Bill would be acceptable if we had in place a special amenity area order or the machinery which could create special amenity area orders.  It took so long to put in place the Liffey Valley order that development did occur in that area; I am afraid the same is happening in my area. Without a special amenity area order, areas of high amenity will not be protected. Within Dublin County Council at present there are applications for special <Col N="450" /> amenity area orders for Portmarnock, Baldoyle and Howth.  While Dublin County Council officials are making every effort to have these orders put in place, this has not yet happened.</P>
    <P>This Bill is premature.  I would accept this Bill and be wholeheartedly behind it if special amenity area orders were in place to protect the areas of high amenity which need to be protected in my area. If special amenity area orders were in place there would be no problem with this Bill.  I see the problem faced by builders and developers who want to get on with a job and develop land, but they cannot walk over the community.  I believe a special amenity area order will be needed to protect the areas of special amenity to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I come now to local authorities.  As a member of Dublin County Council I know that councillors take a great interest in planning matters and each month when my area comes up for discussion councillors request the files and look at planning permissions in their area.  They take out files on local garage applications, local domestic applications and local applications for major works.  I often wonder about councillors who request these files &mdash; they debate them and sit over them in case other public representatives on the council would look at them and perhaps get an extra vote &mdash; and ask officials to make decisions on them.  They are not planning experts.  Even though local authority officials give the planning experts' view, many of the decisions can be forced through the local council by persons who would not have the necessary expertise.  This matter should be examined at local authority level.  I have seen cases where local councillors have requested files and asked the manager to reject permissions but within a month the manager makes up his own mind and makes decisions.  One wonders what useful purpose can be served by a councillor requesting files and trying to debate local planning matters.  Local authorities will have to examine that issue and provide more expertise to advise councillors on the best planning for their area.</P>
    <P>I support the Fine Gael spokesperson <Col N="451" /> on the Environment, Deputy J. Mitchell, when he asked that a Dáil committee on the environment be established.  This would be a means by which An Bord Pleanála could be brought to account for decisions they had made, and controversial decisions could be debated within that committee.  That would be a most welcome development.  Some time ago a developer was seeking a site in Baldoyle for 20 or 30 houses and An Bord Pleanála made a decision which would, in effect, rezone extra land around the site.  The developer finally got planning permission for twice the number of houses he had sought initially.  In this case An Bord Pleanála had rezoned agricultural lands in an area where local residents were anxious that this should not be done.  This was very wrong.  That matter must be addressed.  If an Bord Pleanála grant decisions they should do so on the application before them.  I have been at some oral hearings and I have seen developers offer a package to the council.  This can mean that a new plan is introduced at the oral hearing which is totally different from the original plan.  This is another issue Deputy Mitchell is seeking to address.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's suggestion that local authorities would be empowered by a two-thirds majority vote to require the board to appear before them. It would be a most welcome development when, if An Bord Pleanála make decisions, the local authority could request that they come before them and give the reasons for that decision.  Local authorities would benefit from that and it would bring democracy to the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome but the matter of preserving areas which are of high amenity value and need special amenity area orders should be addressed and taken into consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to address the House on this Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991.  As a public representative, quite an amount of my time is spent addressing planning issues <Col N="452" /> at local level.  Frequently the most contentious part of a local representative's job is dealing with the local planning authority and acting as a go-between for the applicant.  Very often, in rural areas, somebody who makes an application to their local authority for planning permission meets with a blank refusal: they must not develop certain rural areas near their own farmland or on a road which is likely to be improved within the next 20 years.  This leads to a tremendous amount of bitterness, anger and frustration, particularly for those living in rural areas.</P>
      <P>How often have we come across a farmer's son or daughter who wants to build a house on the main road?  When they apply to the local planning authority they are told to put it on a side road, a by-road or the laneway into the farm. The young couple are frustrated to think that their big investment in life, their home, will have to be built out of public view.  Therefore planning is a contentious issue in rural Ireland and it must be addressed.  We must bear in mind the need to protect our environment, the need for orderly development and the need to provide services, such as sewerage and so on.  We must strike a balance. This must not be done at the expense of our rural communities.  We must not herd them into our towns, where all these services are available, and ignore our duty to maintain people on the land.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which will amend the law relating to planning appeals, will be welcomed in many quarters because it will speed up greatly the appeals procedure. I understand that at present it takes on average six months to process an appeal through An Bord Pleanála but under this Bill this ought to be reduced to three or four months.  We are all aware that in some instances a planning application is deliberately put before An Bord Pleanála by a person to either slow up or prevent a development or in an effort to get their own back on the developer.  It is, therefore, most welcome that an attempt is being made to speed up the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way this will be done will be by requiring the appellant to state at the outset the grounds for the appeal.  This is <Col N="453" /> a good development and I welcome it. Very often appeals have been delayed or held up because the appellant did not state the grounds for the appeal for tactical reasons, until the last moment.  Any change would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a number of issues and perhaps the Minister will address them when replying.  In relation to information supplied on appeal it seems there will be no right of reply; in other words, if I submit an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, and someone objects they will be able to submit documentation while I may not be given the right to reply.  Indeed, I may not even know what information has been submitted.  Hence, incorrect information may well be submitted. Very often officials in the local authorities tell us that information received on foot of an application or an objection is inaccurate or has been submitted on spurious grounds.  I am concerned therefore that if material is lodged by objectors to any development the person involved may not be given the opportunity to see this material, to assess it or reply to it.  I would appreciate a response from the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware that under section 9 An Bord Pleanála will be able to seek extra material or require the applicant to make a further submission but what I am concerned about is that information which may be presented may be inaccurate.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty, given that all the material will not be circulated to the parties involved, is that people may well feel everything is going to be done by An Bord Pleanála behind closed doors, that the material submitted by various groups will not be open to inspection or be discussed among the groups involved.  Is this openness to be lost?  Will we come to the view that everything will be done behind closed doors and someone will not get a fair hearing?</P>
    <P>At present An Bord Pleanála are held in high esteem, look fairly on applications, give the parties involved the right to make submissions, to look at what material has been submitted and to refute <Col N="454" /> any false allegations.  I wonder, in speeding up the process and removing the right to reply and of access to information, if the public will come to the view that it is a closed shop and that decisions will be taken without adequate consultation with the parties involved.  I trust the Minister will reply to those points in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Members, thankfully, as a member of a local authority I have a major input in the planning process from the moment an application is submitted up to and including the final stages when objections are lodged with An Bord Pleanála.  Given my interest in the planning process it is appropriate that I should make a contribution on what is important and welcome legislation which will tidy up the position, from the point of view of An Bord Pleanála, the Minister and the Department, in relation to the length of time An Bord Pleanála require to make a decision.  It will also place a requirement on objectors to process their objections within a specific period of time through the courts.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way in dealing with planning applications from the time they were dealt with &mdash; I should say effectively &mdash; by the old Department of Local Government.  In 1976, the Government decided in their wisdom that planning appeals should no longer be subjected to political influence.  The then Minister for Local Government, former Deputy Tully, decided to introduce legislation to set up an autonomous body who would consider planning appeals.  While one should not be critical of this House, an amendment was included in that legislation in the Seanad to ensure that when a person threatened to take a High Court action, which is what people tended to do at the time, they would be required to go through a legal process in the High Court or otherwise if they wanted to pursue their objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency of Tipperary South, because a small number of people threatened to take action in the High Court, which they subsequently did not do and never intended to do, a major American <Col N="455" /> pharmaceutical company, who were welcomed by all and sundry and approved by the Cabinet immediately fought shy of pursuing what would have been a major enterprise involving an investment of £30 million and the provision of employment for people in my constituency.  Most of the objections were submitted by those in good employment, some in the public service.  To make matters worse people from other parts of the country also objected.  They felt that, even if they lived in Dublin, they had a God-given right as preservers of the environment to have an input to south Tipperary and its proposed industrial development which had been processed in the most meticulous way by South Tipperary County Council in a public forum in which plans and a scale model were on exhibition.</P>
    <P>In 1976 as 13 or 14 people still objected, although most other objectors were satisfied with the reassurances from the local authority, we lost the industry. The new Planning Act at the time took account of that, at my request to the then Minister, because I felt that if we had a problem it should be processed properly through the legitimate channels.  Another member of The Labour Party, the present leader, Deputy Spring, who was the Minister for the Environment at the time, revamped An Bord Pleanála to make it more open and in touch with people.  He enabled people to make representations directly to the board without influencing the decision-making process. At times those of us involved at local level worry about the length of time it can take An Bord Pleanála to arrive at decisions.  Of course it is in the interests of the planner, the developer and those involved in funding projects to know, as soon as possible, if An Bord Pleanála are satisfied with the concept of the plans before them.</P>
    <P>Some counties, not all, have planning committees; in our county all the members are notified of the applications as they come before us and we are also notified of the intention of the local authority to grant &mdash; or to most cases not to grant &mdash; an application.  This is brought <Col N="456" /> before the members of the council by way of information and recognising that local authority members have certain rights as elected members, a right for which I will not apologise to anyone.  One of those rights included &mdash; and still includes in the new legislation &mdash; the concept of using, in consultation with the planning office and management, the idea of a section 4. The formula to be used now is different as a result of the most recent legislation and it requires a certain percentage of the members in the electoral area to have an input to a section 4 before planning permission is granted.  I know that there has been widespread condemnation of the use of this instrument but I defend the right of a representative elected by the people, to express a view in consultation with them and to have the power under legislation to implement that view.  Needless to say, other members of the council can have a different view, that is democracy.</P>
    <P>In a public forum elected representatives can make their case.  The difficulty at times is that self-appointed bodies are not subject to the public franchise. They are described in the Planning Acts as having a special input; I recognise and respect their input but at times it is difficult to convince them that local authority members also have a role in the area of planning and a responsibility to ensure that their county is properly and adequately developed in accordance with the county development plan.  That is the appropriate process in a democracy.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country there are people living in isolation from the proposed area of development.  However, because they are members and part of prescribed bodies they take it upon themselves to submit objections to An Taisce and An Bord Pleanála which were raised in good faith.  It is an extremely thin line to follow in a democracy as an excellent development can be stopped in its tracks. This happened not too long ago in Cashel where there was a proposed investment of millions of pounds in a tourist-orientated theme park.  Because it was being located in a sensitive area An Taisce at local level approved of it but at national <Col N="457" /> level they disapproved of it.  After a long drawn out process An Bord Pleanála decided to refuse permission.  The developer is trying to find an alternative site to carry out his project.  We must look at the whole area of the influence of other people in the everyday lives of officials, planning officers, elected public representatives and An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>There are times when I am not satisfied with the procedure followed and when I have problems with my own local authority. Generally speaking, permission is never given to build a house on a national primary route.  However, at times there are reasons for allowing one to be built. It is usually allowed when a farmer has only one decent piece of land on which he can build a house.  If this is the case he should be &mdash; and will be &mdash; allowed to build under the county development plan.  There is also the question of a young farmer with children building a dower house to which his father and mother can retire and which will exit on to the public national primary route.</P>
    <P>In a recent case a decision had been given by the local authority to grant permission to build a house subject to the gateway being rationalised in consultation with the planning officer. Unfortunately, over a period of years, for financial reasons and others, the applicant was not able to pursue the permission. The next time he applied, showing the rationalised entrance, the local authority did not relate the two applications and rejected the later one at holiday time when the members of the council could not be informed.  There was no other procedure available except for the applicant to appeal to An Bord Pleanála. In spite of all the evidence, including a previous decision in favour of building the house and a rationalisation of an entrance on a very dangerous piece of roadway, An Bord Pleanála did not grant the application.  If the man had been in a position to go ahead when he first got permission he could have built his house.  What has changed in the meantime? The national primary road has not changed, the dangerous bend is still there and members of the local authority will <Col N="458" /> now be forced to put in a new application with a section 4 directing that permission be granted on the basis that it is good planning.  Nothing is perfect and in the area of planning it is very difficult to satisfy everybody.  There must be a balance between what local authority members do &mdash; and what they want to do &mdash; in the area of planning, having regard to their responsibilities to the public, the safety of people in public areas, traffic routes and the free movement of traffic on the national primary routes.</P>
    <P>I have a very good working relationship with our planning authority.  I am a member of two local authorities and I deal with planning applications daily. One of the Minister's predecessors said that it is in all our interests to expedite, as fairly as possible, applications for planning so that our actions are not a disincentive to people to develop and improve their holdings and buildings.  It should be our function to help people. Of course we do not want someone to build a house in the middle of a road or, normally, on a national primary route or on a dangerous bend or corner. However, we need to strike a balance.  I believe most of us would like to see a liberalisation of the strict interpretations of the planning code, Planning Acts and county development plans which at all times are subject to reassessment, reappraisal and even amendment.</P>
    <P>Recently a local authority accepted funding from a developer to hire more staff to re-examine a project in an overall context.  It is difficult to convince the people of that county that the local authority were underfunded and understaffed and could not carry out the statutory function placed on them to review their development plan.  Having accepted funding from someone who might be considered to have a vested interest in a project it is difficult for a local authority to justify why they changed their decision.  As I said last week in the debate on the Roads Bill, we need to be very careful in formulating legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister of State on his appointment.  I have <Col N="459" /> already expressed my good wishes to him privately and I wish to do so publicly. The Minister has a certain amount of expertise in this area.  As a member of a local authority he knows the euphoria the decision to either grant or refuse permission for car parking facilities, the building of motorways in built-up areas, etc., can give rise to.  As I said, we need to strike the proper balance.  I have no doubt the Minister will use his vast knowledge and expertise as a member of a local authority when dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department have a specific responsibility to ensure that local authorities are properly funded and staffed in order to enable them to carry out all their statutory functions in the area of planning.  Local authorities have to make a decision on applications within two months.  They can seek an extension of this time limit on the basis of a legitimate need for additional information.  While this let them off the hook, so to speak, it can cause delays for the developer.  If local authorities are properly funded and staffed by the Department they will not have to rely on outside influences for funding.  I am not for one minute suggesting that the developer to whom I referred influenced the decision of the local authority one way or the other. Nevertheless the public need to be assured of the independence of local authorities in carrying out their functions; local authorities should not be seen to be beholden to anyone.  The chairman of that local authority, who is a Member of this House, has explained the position both publicly and otherwise.  Nevertheless, a doubt still exists in the minds of the public.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the need for Deputies to publicly declare their interests, vested, financial or otherwise. A member of a local authority on the day of his election has to declare to the county manager his interest in any property which could at some future date be subjected to development.  He is required to absent himself from the decision-making process in regard to such <Col N="460" /> property.  A similar requirement should be placed on Members of this House when dealing with legislation which covers areas in which we might have a vested interest.  It is important that local authorities are seen to be independent. The acceptance of funding by a local authority should not be seen to lead to the readjustment of a county development plan to the benefit of the person or company who assisted them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  I have been in touch with An Bord Pleanála on a number of occassions. I have to say that I have never sought to try to influence their decisions or ask them to change them: I have merely sought to expedite decisions so that people will know as soon as possible where they stand.  It is important that people who object to an application, for example, the application made by the pharmaceutical company in Cork, can put forward their objections directly to the officers and inspectors of An Bord Pleanála.  By its very nature this is a cumbersome procedure because the case has to be heard in total in the presence of people who may hold a different view. Such public hearings have been carried out expertly by An Bord Pleanála and the officers in charge.  As a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas which lays down the regulations and rules, it is good to know that people can make decisions in this area in spite of any pressure brought to bear on them.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that an objector should have to document in full the grounds for his objection.  This would ensure that people could not object to a development just because they have an interest in it in terms of competition or the acquisition of the property for their own purposes, as happened in my constituency. People believe that if they can delay the process long enough a development might not proceed.  We need to ensure that the grounds for an appeal are set out fully and properly.  These objections should be immediately communicated to developers to enable them to respond positively.</P>
    <P>During the early stages of an appeal, <Col N="461" /> An Bord Pleanála really act as a catalyst: they ask the local authority why they granted permission or did not grant it, as the case may be, they ask the applicant why he made the application and they ask the objector why he objects to the application.  They exchange a lot of correspondence before they get down to the nitty-gritty.  I should like An Bord Pleanála to be given a more independent role than the one they have at present. Sometimes An Bord Pleanála are very slow to overturn a decision granted by a local authority.  In the example I gave about the national primary route they forgot they had given the permission, they then refused it and the refusal was upheld by An Bord Pleanála.  In spite of our efforts to get additional information from the developer and planner this seems to have been overlooked at the end.  This leaves us with the unpleasant task of having to follow through this application by way of a section 4 motion which, I have no doubt, will upset those people who appoint themselves the guardians of our environment.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill provides that An Bord Pleanála will have to make decisions on applications in a much shorter period.  This means that they will have to be given adequate funding and staff to carry out their functions.  Some people have used An Bord Pleanála and the appeals process to seek extraordinary levels of compensation from local authorities which, if the Minister had not intervened, would have bankrupt many local authorities.  Developers used the procedure in that way, thus putting at risk the good will of all legislators.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) gives power to the Minister, in exceptional circumstances only, to vary or suspend the board's time objective for determining cases.  I would prefer if the Minister had no power to intervene in the variation of the time factor.  If the law lays down a time factor to try to speed up the process of objections and of dealing with them by An Bord Pleanála there should be no interference by the Minister.  I hope the circumstances when the Minister would use this power would be most exceptional.  Will the Minister <Col N="462" /> when replying outline his ideas on what the exceptional circumstances would be? What were the intentions of the parliamentary draftsman in inserting subsection (4)?  If the Minister gives a reason for this I am sure Members will accept it. Perhaps ministerial orders will be involved and, if so, the Minister should consult with the spokespersons of other parties and give them an idea of the guidelines.  Otherwise the legislation to expedite these decisions will be undermined. I am not suggesting the Minister will take this power but Ministers in future Governments may use it.  If in future there is controversy about a particular project the Minister may say he has power under subsection (4) to direct An Bord Pleanála not to meet the requirements of the time factor.</P>
    <P>Legislation that improves the planning process, decision-making and developments, whether industrial, environmentally friendly or housing developments, is to be welcomed.  It is appropriate that we expedite the planning process.  If somebody objects to a decision made by a local authority the basis of that objection should be made known not alone to An Bord Pleanála but to the local authority and the developer. It is appropriate that we legislate to ensure that an Bord Pleanála make decisions as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are other side issues involved in the legislation and I am sure our spokeperson, Deputy Howlin, will be dealing with the intricacies of the various sections on Committee Stage.  The legislation is welcomed in that it seeks to speed up the planning process.  As a member of a local authority I am in constant touch with the planning officer and I know that at times his life would be much easier if people like me did not ask questions even before a plan is submitted. If matters are cleared up at an early stage no discrepancies arise in the formal submission of the application.  It is not always easy to make changes when the application is before the planning authority or to write in conditions which at times would be an easy way of solving <Col N="463" /> the problem.  We must try to have a balance. I sometimes resent the fact that self-appointed people from other counties or other bodies have the power to object to a process.  In regard to environmental impact studies and so on, generally speaking local authorities do a very good job.  When an application is submitted they always get an outside opinion and advice, even though at times they do not have the finance to do so.</P>
    <P>Some major controversial projects have been dealt with in south Tipperary. We did not succeed in regard to one project but in another case we publicly produced the plans and the scale models of the proposed factory for inspection and were successful in having it built. The factories in my constituency provide employment for hundreds of people who possess a high standard of education and expertise.  The task of the IDA in recent years has been made very difficult as a result of people objecting to planning applications for very little reason.  That is not the way to proceed, especially if there is a formal procedure within the local authority to listen to the arguments made.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle.  My colleague, who will be dealing with it section by section on Committee Stage, will be proposing constructive amendments. The Labour Party have had a good record in the area of planning legislation since 1976 when responsibility for the planning process was transferred from local government to an autonomous body.  Under the auspices of Deputy Spring the formula of An Bord Pleanála was changed.  In recent times the Minister has seen fit to make further changes and this legislation will be a useful contribution to that process.  I welcome the whole concept of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Ferris that it is very difficult to please everyone in relation to planning matters.  The Bill before the House provides that An Bord Pleanála make a decision within four months receipt of a planning application. Given that local authorities have to make decisions within two months of receipt of planning applications it is only fair that a time limit be laid down for An Bord Pleanála.  This will have the effect of speeding up decisions that have been in the pipeline in relation to building programmes for factories and housing, an area which gives very necessary employment. I hope that aspect of the Bill will have a beneficial effect on employment creation.</P>
      <P>At one time decisions of a local authority could be appealed by the Minister for Local Government. There was a public outcry at the fact that the Minister had that function but nevertheless there was accountability because the Minister had to face the public for re-election to the House.  We have now passed on the responsibility of appeals to An Bord Pleanála without making any provision for accountability to the public.  Oral hearings are a very important function of the board and until some time ago the Minister for the Environment had the discretion to ask the board to grant an oral hearing.</P>

    <P> (a)  prepare and publish a report, based on demographic data and projections on the prospects for employment and unemployment in Ireland over the next twenty years,</P>
    <P>(b)  receive, study and comment upon reports from the Government on the preparation and implementation of its plans to avail of the EC Structural Funds,</P>
    <P>(c)  receive, study and comment upon reports from the Government on education and training, employment legislation, systems of salary and wage determination, social insurance, the housing market, fiscal and regulatory burdens on small businesses, aspects of the social welfare code which inhibit part-time or short term working, and on all other regulations and policies which are considered by the Forum to influence the creation of new jobs,</P>
    <P>(d)  receive, study and comment upon reports from the Government on the programmed reduction of those business costs in Ireland which are greater than those obtaining in competitor nations in Europe, encompassing electricity, telecommunications, postal, transport, professional and service costs amongst others,</P>
    <P>(e)  receive, study and comment upon reports from the Government on the implementation of a programme of personal and corporate tax reform designed to make it attractive for a higher proportion of Ireland's young and talented workforce to remain at work here rather than emigrate and for employers to create job opportunities,</P>
    <P>(f)  receive, study and comment upon reports from the Government on the implementation of its programme to improve the structural efficiency of the main productive sectors of the economy, and to develop a cost-competitive transport and communications infrastructure which would reduce the <Col N="466" /> cost handicaps deriving from Ireland's geographic position,</P>
    <P>(g)  monitor progress in the work of the task force recently set up to implement the Culliton report and of the Government's other task force on employment,</P>
    <P>(h)  based on the above studies, to seek to reach agreement on a comprehensive programme of structural reform of Irish society, designed to achieve both a higher long term level of economic growth, and a higher level of employment for any given level of economic activity, and</P>

      <P>I hope to take about 20 minutes and the other Deputies may divide the remainder of the time.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has now reached such crisis levels in Ireland that its seriousness transcends the normal cut and thrust of party politics in the House.  There must be no place in politics in modern Ireland for the exploitation of the human misery, the humiliation or the long term poverty that is the result of being unemployed in Ireland in 1992.  As far as politics are concerned, the time has come to do something about the problem rather than just talk about it.  That is why Fine Gael are proposing a Jobs Forum in the very particular form of the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Jobs Forum is simple; it is to initiate a radical programme for the relief of Ireland's chronic unemployment problem.  In so doing, we also hope to change Irish political life. We want long term thinking &mdash; thinking <Col N="467" /> that goes beyond the life of one Government or, indeed, of one Dáil &mdash; to resume its proper place in Irish political life.  It is short term thinking, thinking only of the next election, dictated by the needs of electoral politics or bureaucratic gamesmanship between one Government agency and another, that has prevented us from either foreseeing the jobs crisis or tackling it.</P>
    <P>We should remember that our present jobs crisis was foreseeable 15 years ago. Fifteen years ago anybody who looked at the numbers in our schools or the number of families returning to live in this country, by a simple calculation, could have worked out that we would face an unemployment crisis of the kind we now face. The problem was foreseeable and it was foreseen yet, with 15 years' notice, we did nothing about it.  Why was there no action?  Because there was no forum in which politicians and policy makers could look beyond the next election at a problem of the kind that was building up before our eyes.  Tonight, in the motion before the House, Fine Gael propose to establish such a forum.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the terms of reference of the forum I wish to stress particularly.  Paragraph (i) requires the forum to set and monitor a critical path for the implementation of their recommendations. In the past we had plenty of recommendations about jobs from task forces of various kinds and many of them have never been implemented.  The time has come to start implementing recommendations through political action, and the requirement in the terms of reference of this forum is not just that the body should make recommendations but that it should also continue in being, regardless of which party are in Government at any given time, to oversee their implementation.  That is what distinguishes the approach in this motion from any previous approach aimed at tackling the jobs crisis.  Let there be no more reports, no more committees and no more task forces.  We want politicians of all parties to take action to deal with the jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> Fine Gael have no inflexible demands about the composition of the Jobs Forum.  Our original proposal in June 1991 was for a Dáil select committee of 12 Members including the leaders of the political parties plus eight representatives of the social partners selected from the NESC; this would include representatives of the trade union movement, farmers, industry, etc.  If the social partners are to be involved &mdash; and I believe they should be &mdash; then it is essential that in addition to those already represented on the NESC, the unemployed themselves must be directly represented, through the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and perhaps other representation also.  That is the approach I favour.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative.  We could go for the more simple approach adopted in the New Ireland Forum.  The New Ireland Forum was set up between 1983 and 1987 by the Fine Gael-Labour Government to reach a consensus on an equally intractable problem &mdash; some might say even more intractable &mdash; that is, relations between this part of the island and Northern Ireland.  That forum, which, apart from its impartial chairman, was composed exclusively of Members of this House, reached an unprecedented all-party consensus on an approach to the problem of Northern Ireland.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement was born directly out of the work of the New Ireland Forum.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement and the New Ireland Forum were a triumph of political maturity over narrow party gain.  All parties in this House at the moment are now committed to the operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, due in no small part to the experience gained by Members in teasing out the problem in the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>Now Fine Gael seek in this House a similar consensus to launch an onslaught on the crippling effects of unemployment in Irish life, the poverty, the misery and the emptiness that result from 250,000 of our people not being able to find meaningful work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Fine Gael seeks to inflict no undeserved wounds on the present Government, a Government which is now presiding over the worst jobless figures in Ireland's history.  Instead, we seek to initiate an all-party crusade against the problem which none of us, let it be admitted, can solve on our own.</P>
    <P>Ireland's recent record on employment is pitiful.  Worse still, independent economists estimate that the prospects for the decade ahead are even worse.  The NESC Report on Emigration, No. 90, predicts that in 1991 and 1992 the number reaching retirement age will be 50,000 fewer than the number reaching school leaving age, in other words, if we were to keep unemployment at 1990 levels we would have to create 50,000 extra jobs.  We have not done that and, inevitably, the unemployment figure has risen; and that trend will continue.  It is a trend that continued through the 1980s but we were able to export the problem through emigration.</P>
    <P>The emigration safety value is no longer there.  I believe that in the next two years there will be no net emigration from this country.  The recession in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom is such that there are no jobs there for Irish emigrants.  Indeed, even if the recession in those countries were to end, it is estimated by most economists that it will take at least 18 months after the end of the recession for there to be any improvement in the employment situation in those countries.  That is the way the economy works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite our huge level of unemployment, we have people coming back to Ireland.  Unemployed emigrants are returning to join those who are already unemployed here.  I predict that if present trends continue we will have between 350,000 and 500,000 people unemployed by the end of the century.  The only way to avoid that is through a resumption of emigration. That is not something that a proud nation can contemplate with equanimity.  It is <Col N="470" /> time to look at the national complacency about emigration.  Some say that emigration is caused by unemployment.  I see it as the other way round.  In a sense, emigration causes unemployment.  The people who emigrate and who will emigrate are often the brightest and most dynamic of their generation, the people who come first, second or third in schools and in university.  These are the people who we would normally reply upon to create jobs here.  If they emigrate they take their skills and job creation potential to another country.  Resumed emigration will reduce our long term job creation potential, even though it may initially relieve the unemployment symptoms by making some jobs available in the short term.  Modern theories of economic growth put much more emphasis on the importance of human capital, of skills and ideas of dedicated people then on financial capital and machinery, which was the traditional way of looking at economic growth.  At the moment Ireland is importing financial capital, at a huge cost to the taxpayer, through the IDA.  At the same time we are carelessly exporting our human capital free of charge through emigration.  If emigration resumes that will start happening again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a more fundamental problem than the recent growth in unemployment which has been brought about by the population increase and the recent pause in emigration.  Even in times of economic growth our performance on employment creation has been abysmal.  In the 1987 to 1991 period Irish GNP rose by one-quarter, a good performance, yet at the same time employment only grew by 5 per cent, an increase of one-fifth the amount of increase in income.  We are not able to convert income into jobs. There is something radically wrong with our economy in that regard.  Indeed, the forecast for the future is no better.  The recent ESRI projections for the period 1991 to 1996 forecast that there will be a 3.7 per cent growth in the economy up to 1996 but only a 1 per cent increase in employment.  The increase in national employment will only be one quarter of the increase in national income.  This <Col N="471" /> shows a fundamental structural fault in our economy so far as job creation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party reject any qualified or short term solution to our employment problems.  There are no such solutions available.  The disastrous experiments of the past, particularly in the period from 1977 to 1981, must never be repeated because those disastrous experiments are in no small measure the cause of our present crisis.  No Government can afford to attempt to solve the employment problems simply by creating more jobs in the public service, to take people off the dole queues on a temporary basis. Likewise, artificial tax havens such as those in the Custom House Docks or in Shannon offer no long term answer to the deep rooted structural problems of the rest of our economy in terms of creating jobs.  We want to put the whole economy right, not just bits of it centred around the Custom House Docks or a particular airport.  The problems of our economy exist everywhere and must be solved everywhere and not just in individual areas where some politician can claim local credit for extending a tax relief zone.</P>
    <P>Past efforts at creating new State agencies to solve the problem, such as the National Development Corporation in which I was involved, and the Youth Employment Agency in which the Government of which I was a member were involved, have had only limited success. I do not see new State agencies as a solution either.  FÁS courses and SES schemes, the approach of the Government, may give short term assistance to the unemployed but they offer no long term solution.  The practice of chipping away at the periphery of the problem in response to immediate political pressures must end tonight in this House.  I hope that through the establishment of this jobs forum we will start to move the debate on unemployment to the level of long term solutions and away from short term efforts to treat the symptoms of the uderlying malaise.  That is why we are proposing this jobs forum.  We seek a <Col N="472" /> united front of all political parties and the social partners to resolve the comprehensive bias against jobs in our economic structure.  We in Fine Gael are prepared to approach the establishment of this forum with open minds and without a preconceived agenda.  As far as we are concerned, no institution will be sacrosanct in the pursuit of extra employment.</P>
    <P>We must be prepared to consider radical changes in our tax regime, not only in personal taxation but in corporation tax.  The poor performance of the 10 per cent corporation tax regime which the Government unwisely have decided to extend to the year 2010 and multinational companies generally must also be examined. It is ironic that in a country with so few jobs the only commodity which is taxed more heavily than employment is cigarettes.  We tax job creation at 56 per cent and profits in manufacturing at only 10 per cent.  There are other things which are entirely exempt from tax.  Is it any wonder that we have so much unemployment? We have made decisions in the structure of our tax system which led to a bias against employment creation.  It is time that was changed.  No Government on their own, with only a year or two to run, would have the courage to change it.  Therefore, a forum at which politicians of all parties will be present would enable a consensus to emerge in which fundamental changes may take place, rather than the type of tinkering which has tended to characterise policy making in this area in the past.  We must examine the whole regulatory atmosphere created by employment legislation and its possible disincentive effect on some potential employers, those who do not have big industrial relations departments to advise them on how to manage the law.  We must ask why small companies are so reluctant to take on staff. Why will small employers do almost anything, borrow money, instal machinery and so on, to meet extra demand rather than take on extra staff?  We must ask what is stopping them, and change it.</P>
    <P>We must also re-examine our educational system which lays such a heavy <Col N="473" /> emphasis on written exams which promote an attitude of conformism, of working for somebody else, rather than creating something, and perhaps give more marks to work such as projects undertaken by students, where people develop the sort of skills that help them afterwards to work for somebody else or to set up their own business.  Because of the dominance of written exams our educational system is dependency creating.</P>
    <P>We must also alter the thrust of social welfare policy to reduce its present emphasis on the maintenance of people in inactivity and increase the emphasis on taking up opportunities for work, whether it be part-time or full-time work, whether it be paid or unpaid work.  The social welfare system should be biased in favour of activity rather than in favour of dependency as is the present system.  To change the system will be difficult and unpopular and that is why no one party operating in the partisan attitude of this House, particularly within 18 months of an election, will attempt all that should be attempted.  That is why a forum is a good idea.  It enables politicians whether in office or out of office to look beyond the next election and recognise that we in this House, and the system of pluralist democracy this House represents, will only survive if minimal social conditions are maintained.  We cannot afford to have 500,000 people unemployed by the end of the century.  I would question the viability of our present democratic system in unemployment reached that level.  Let nobody say that we are taking a naive stance in opposition in offering a jobs forum and offering the Government an opportunity of not being criticised as the Opposition would normally criticise a Government because of their failure in the area of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have no interest in making short term political capital at the expense of this Government over the employment issue if the result of so doing is not solving the unemployment problem.  Nobody in this House, with the possible exception of people with very extreme opinions, has anything to gain from the continuance of <Col N="474" /> this problem.  We must solve it and solve it together.</P>
    <P>We must rationalise means tests so that nobody will lose out, as some do, by taking up a job or by working harder.  We must face up to the increasing unemployment consequences of the flight from the land.  We must find new forms of agriculture, new farm-based enterprises and new uses of modern communications systems that are now available to prevent an increasing number of present farm family members from leaving the land and joining the already crowded dole queues in the towns.  A job saved in rural Ireland is just as good as a job created in urban Ireland.  Rural development has an important role to play in the solution of our unemployment problem, in the heart of Dublin and in any other urban area.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in the past and in this debate have given the lead on the jobs issues.  As the main Opposition Party we are determined as far as is possible and reasonable to play a non-partisian role to assist the nation as a whole in ridding itself of this destructive scourge. The acceptance by the Government of our proposal will enable all politicians and the social partners together to confront this issue head on.  We as a party relish the challenge.  We are confident that our ideas will more than match the ideas put forward by any other party in this House.  If there is to be competition, as there rightly should be between political parties, let it be in terms of which party can come forward with the most constructive ideas to solve this problem rather than which party is best at negative criticism.  For the past six to eight months we have had an absolute feast of negative criticism.  The histrionic and rhetorical skills of some Members were lauded to the skies because of their ability for negative criticism.  Negative criticism will not create a single job.  In my view what we want are politicians who recognise that in politics it is the ability to put forward a constructive idea and the ability to recognise the good in somebody else's idea that marks one out as a politician worthy of support.  I hope that my part in taking this unusual step of offering <Col N="475" /> the Government, whose term has only 18 months to run and who face an election in the near future, the opportunity of bringing their opponents in to help them solve the unemployment problem will be seen as the means of lifting the problem out of the traditional negative thinking in this House.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will agree &mdash; and they have indicated already that they will come back to this in two weeks time &mdash; to the creation of a jobs forum.  If they agree I am very open to discussions about the terms of reference, the resources, the duration, the chairmanship and composition of the forum, but I hope the matter will be discussed and that we do not have the situation where the Government go off and discuss it with the social partners or indeed with the other party in Government and tell the rest of us that is how it will be and ask us whether we wish to join or not.  If this forum is to be successful the basis on which it is to be established must be agreed between those who are to participate in it.  I hope that will be the case and indeed I believe it will be at this point.</P>

It is important, therefore, that there be discussions in advance and that the terms of reference be carefully drawn up so that we do not have a body that emphasises discussion and disagreement but one that emphasises discussion leading to decisions and their implementation. If we as politicians can approach the problem in this way I believe we can avoid what will otherwise be the greatest social disaster of the century facing the Irish people.</P>

      <P>We have 276,700 unemployed; what an appalling waste of human resources; what a miserable record for any Government or indeed any country, but how much greater is this problem when one realises that the <Col N="476" /> present unemployment register does not include people who have emigrated rather than join the dole queues or mark time in unsatisfactory jobs.  It does not include also women or older men who are so discouraged by the bleak employment prospects that they have decided to stay at home.  It does not include workers who are eager to work longer hours and get better wages but who are forced to work part-time or short-time.  None of these is included, yet 276,700 as the figure is, is not a true indication of the extent of the unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>In the face of such a crisis, the question we pose tonight is whether the Government, the Opposition parties and everybody else concerned can at last consider it such an urgent need that we can collectively decide that a new approach is necessary.  The reality is that if we are really serious about tackling the problem of unemployment we must work together and unite in our efforts for this national cause.  To do anything less would be not only inadequate and disgraceful but nothing short of a national tragedy.</P>
      <P>I am proud to say that it was the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, who has at last succeeded in moving the major issue of unemployment to the centre of the political stage.  While the Government, unfortunately, allowed themselves to be overshadowed by personal and party issues, Fine Gael continued nevertheless in their efforts to focus the national attention on the unemployed. Deputy John Bruton made several approaches to establish a national jobs forum but as a result of the lack of courage or perhaps of political maturity, all such approaches were, sadly, turned down.  As a result, no united structure now exists to collectively examine or explore, to plan or propose solutions to cope with this major social and economic crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before us tonight is yet again an attempt by this party to establish a jobs forum and to convince those in Government and everybody else in this House of the potential of this proposal. I would like to say at this stage that I <Col N="477" /> welcome the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the concept of a jobs forum.  I acknowledge their forthright and positive approach and I hope their example will be followed in this House.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a very serious crisis, a crisis so grave and so urgent that I believe the main policy thrust of any Irish Government for the foreseeable future must be realistic job creation.  With more than 250,000 people out of work, it is obviously ridiculous for anybody to suggest that the unemployment problem can be solved overnight, but we must always remember that it will not be solved at all unless radical changes and fresh initiatives are made in the area of employment creation.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that employers must be rewarded for creating jobs and it must pay people to work.  Employers must be recognised as the most important element in any policy for employment. At present they work in an extremely hostile environment to such an extent that they are almost penalised for creating a job.  The other side of the coin is that it must pay people to work.  The possibility that somebody can be better off by remaining unemployed than by taking a job is offensive.  It would appear to reward those who do not work and to penalise taxpayers.  The combined effects of the operation of the social welfare and taxation system and of local authority and health board regulations can mean that a person taking a job results in the standard of living of that family being reduced.</P>
    <P>The unemployed father of a family who takes a relatively low paid job may find that, with bewildering haste, his local authority rent is increased, he is liable for income tax and his medical card is withdrawn.  In these circumstances he actually cannot afford to work.  This is a real problem.  His willingness and desire to work are destroyed because of the penalties attached to taking a job.  This is ridiculous and cannot be allowed to continue.  We must take urgent steps to shift the balance to favour those who work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" /> Another important feature of our unemployment problem lies in how well our educated young people are equipped for work.  The large number of young people in our population should be our strength.  By educating them we can ensure that they will not be unemployed in the new Europe and so we can open up opportunities of personal freedom for them.  The likelihood that a university graduate will be unemployed is very low, but the likelihood of unemployment is very high among young people who leave school without an intermediate certificate or a junior certificate.  The proportion of our young people in full-time education and training still lags behind the proportions in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.  The cost of maintaining a person in second level education is well below the cost of paying unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Those on unemployment benefit will rightly say that no number of improvements in social welfare can fully compensate them for the judgment that society has passed on them, namely, that they have no contribution to make that can be valued enough to deserve remuneration.  Unemployed people want a decent job.  They want to earn an income in a way which respects their freedom and dignity.  They want to work, to be part of our economy and to provide for their families.  They want to live, not just exist.  Life without a job all too frequently is really not life at all.</P>
    <P>Why did this great problem so suddenly come upon us?  For too long our unemployment levels increased and expanded and the issue was either dealt with ineffectively or was overshadowed by other issues.  During the late seventies and early eighties the rise of the national debt shifted the focus of attention away from unemployment to the control of the national finances.  This became a passion, a total commitment, blinding people to other changes in our economy.  Substantial progress could be made in reducing unemployment by achieving higher rates of participation in second level education and in training programmes for certified qualifications.  Ireland is totally <Col N="479" /> out of step with advanced European economies in having a very high level of unemployment and a low level of overall participation in education and training for young people in their early teens. By increasing the participation level in education and training it will be possible to reduce substantially the number of people unemployed.</P>
    <P>How long can the 276,000 people who are without work remain patient?  How long can they cope with the utter despair and desperation that unemployment causes?  For how much longer will they control their anger and frustration at the lack of attention to their plight?  The nature and the scale of unemployment point to a failure in our solidarity as a people.  Far too frequently the pursuit of individual and sectional gain has taken precedence over working towards the wider goals of developing the economic resources of this island for the benefit of all our citizens.  Irish unemployment is an appalling waste of human energy and of talents in this island where resources, industry, the environment and social and community services need further development.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has singled out the weakest and most defenceless for its worst ravages.  While many people have felt the chill wind of joblessness, perhaps through tensions in the workplace and anxiety about jobs for their children in the future, only those who are really without a job know the desperation, isolation and despair of unemployment.  Those of us who are in full employment are ignorant of the realities of day-to-day life under this burden.  No one can teach us as much about the importance of a job in our society as those who have lived for a long time without one.  We must listen carefully to their experiences and act on their behalf.  We must set aside our political divisions and utilise the combined talents and resources of all sides of this House and of everybody throughout the country.  The first step in the interests of the unemployed is to support the Fine Gael motion for the setting up of an all-party forum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton on introducing this very important motion.  The dramatic increase in the numbers on the dole is depressing and worrying for any politician.  Every day in our constituencies we see the people whose lives have been wrecked because they cannot find work.  While unemployment at 40 years or 20 years is no different in terms of its impact on the individual, the statistics can never tell the true story.</P>
      <P>At the end of January 1992 there were 78,842 young people under the age of 25 out of work.  This means 28.5 per cent of the unemployed are under 25.  These figures are rising all the time.  There are now 13,700 more people under the age of 25 unemployed than this time last year. As a nation what are we doing about it?</P>
      <P>It is obviously now politically acceptable that generations of young Irish people will never have the privilege of working in their own country.  It could be said in respect of many of our young people that they have a bright future behind them.  The Government no longer have the answers that were trotted out up to this.  The emigrant boat is no longer the solution and in some circles the fact that our people are returning to their country of birth is begrudged as causing problems and costing money.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's response to the jobs crises?  Let us judge them by their actions.  The famous scheme the EC have funded appears to be doing the rounds again.  At least this time it seems it will get off the ground.  The Culliton report is gathering dust already.  No doubt it will be taken off the shelf and ceremoniously dusted down when the famous committee of civil servants prepare to examine its recommendations. All previous attempts to introduce a jobs forum have been rejected out of hand because, we were told, it would produce nothing new and would be just another talking shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do the country's young people react to this?  Where do the Government stand on the question of creating or providing jobs or opportunities for the country's youth?  The message is as bleak as <Col N="481" /> standing in line to collect a dole payment. For a start, they are to cut back on the Teamwork allocation in 1992.  Teamwork is a scheme whereby voluntary organisations such as youth groups can provide one year's training and employment for those between the ages of 17 and 24 who are unemployed and they are paid £63 per week.  In the main this scheme, while it does not provide permanent and pensionable employment, will give a young person the experience that is so vital even to be considered for a job.  The funding will be drastically reduced this year. Youth organisations, such as the National Youth Council of Ireland, reckon that a cut of £1.8 million here will deprive 440 young people of a chance of working and contributing to their localities.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the Teamwork budget is regrettable in itself and should be reversed.  Indeed, it signifies also a careless, regrettable, attitude to young people and their futures.  There appears to be a cynical attitude prevailing that once the British economy improves emigration will recommence, thus taking the heat off feeble-minded Governments. From all available evidence the Government might as well be &ldquo;waiting for Godot&rdquo; since if there is to be a 1 per cent increase in our growth rate the United Kingdom economy would need to grow by at least 4 per cent.  I predict that will not happen today, tomorrow or the day after.  In the meantime there is no strategy to improve the quality of life of our young jobless people.</P>
    <P>How many people will leave school or college this year?  How many will complete FÁS courses apart from those returning from the United States and the United Kingdom?  While there are no easy answers to these problems it is not difficult to attempt to find solutions.  The Government continue to justify their gross failure by pointing to an international economic downturn.  They are scared to admit they have run out of ideas.  Why do they not look to those who have ideas, on those who want to outline their ideas on how jobs can be created?</P>
    <P>The motion tabled by our party leader <Col N="482" /> this evening offers the Government a forum that would draw on the expertise of all Members of this House along with that of the social partners.  It is what our young people seek and is something that would remove their cynicism.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notes</P>
      <P>&mdash;that over 18,000 new jobs were created in 1991 in manufacturing and international services industry despite the severe international recession,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Government's commitment to pro-jobs tax reform in the Programme for Government, acted upon so decisively in the 1992 budget,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Government's commitment to pursuing a strong and responsible fiscal position which will reduce the debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent next year,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Government's commitment to improving the competitiveness of the Irish economy, and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Government's determination to speedily implement the recommendations of the Industrial Policy Review Group,  </P>
      <P>Recognises</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the demographic reality of Irish society means that a serious problem of unemployment is likely to persist in the short to medium term,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;that unemployment is the major <Col N="483" /> cause of social deprivation in our society, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;that there is a need to ensure that all possible measures to tackle the problems associated with unemployment are examined as a matter of urgency,  </P>
    <P>Resolves</P>
    <P>&mdash;to await the positive proposals which the Taoiseach informed the House on 19 February, 1992 he was considering for an appropriate structure which would enable new ideas and proposals to be identified and implemented with wide political support and which it is his intention to bring forward within the next two weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The objective underlying Deputy John Bruton's motion is shared by the Government. Let me say at the outset that I see the fundamental purpose of the motion in the name of the Leader of Fine Gael as the enhancement of employment growth in Ireland.  In this the Deputy mirrors the concern of the Government to ensure that no stone is left unturned in seeking out strategies which could strengthen the pace of job-creation in this country.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it.  The first priority of Government policy today, as it has been throughout the period of this Administration, is to maximise sustainable job creation here thereby, minimising unemployment and involuntary emigration.  As this Government view matters, few concerns &mdash; perhaps those only of liberty and of life itself &mdash; can or should rank higher than that of generating sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>Indeed I want to thank Deputy Bruton for making his points in a fair, non-political manner.  I take it that anything he has said has been in the best interests of achieving a lasting solution to the problem. Likewise my comments will be made in a constructive manner.  Where I may differ from Deputy Bruton on certain points that will be on the basis of endeavouring to achieve a consensus on moving <Col N="484" /> in the best possible direction.  Here we might remember the Taoiseach's remarks of 19 February.  I should say also that in this debate the Government are anxious that final conclusions be drawn from points made by the leader of the main Opposition party, the Labour Party and other Members who may contribute.  In addition we are anxious to take account of what already prevails.</P>
    <P>For example much work went into the preparation of the Industrial Policy Review Group, otherwise known as the Culliton Committee, who produced an excellent report.  There has now been established the committee under Mr. Paddy Moriarty which deals not alone with the public sector but with the private sector also.  Then there is the Cabinet employment committee chaired by the Taoiseach examining not only the recommendations of the Culliton report and/or proposals from the Moriarty Committee but other matters also.  There is the Task Force on Employment who put forward views to Government from time to time. Then there is the Central Review Committee implementing the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> examining this issue and what the task force are doing.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the Green Paper on Education which the Taoiseach said earlier today would be presented shortly and a White Paper on Manpower policy about which my colleague, the Minister for Labour, will speak.  All of these elements must be taken into account, ascertaining how they will fit into a workable structure.</P>
    <P>I might say to Deputy John Bruton that when I occupied a different position I would have to agree he was constructive and argued consistently on these issues. He has argued consistently and with merit that there are a number of structures within Government to deal with the matter, that the social partners have devised a number of structures but on the floor of this House or within the various political parties there is no such structure.</P>
    <P>What will be important in this debate and in the discussions in which the Government will engage with the Central <Col N="485" /> Review Committee later this week is how we should move to retain what is there, what is useful, while endeavouring to establish a forum of this House which is what I hope this debate and later discussions will lead to.  I think Deputy Bruton and I would agree that is the issue that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thousands of our present workforce, together with thousands more coming of age to join them, deserve the opportunity to make a future for themselves and their families here. Their future depends on our ability to create lasting jobs, the kind which derive their continuity from serving willing markets. Preparing and positioning the economy to deliver such jobs to the maximum extent possible has been the driving force determining the thrust of Government policy and it will remain so.  Indeed, it must remain so, if we, as a society, are serious about achieving the employment growth our developing population needs.</P>
      <P>The task of searching out the means to ensure maximum employment growth is one which must be shared.  It is not, and should not be seen to be, the &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; of any one group in our society. While Government have a clear leadership role, we must all honestly accept some key realities.  Government is not the sole repository of all ideas which might better harness our country's growth potential.  This is a task of such importance that no one's potential contribution must be overlooked.  All, and in particular other leadership groups in our society, whether among the trade unions, business, farming or other interest groups, have a role to play.</P>
      <P>Among diverse groups, ideas about the optimum means towards maximum employment will differ.  Yet surely the way forward must lie along a road of consensus about key ideas and strategies, to which all will subscribe, will adopt wholeheartedly, and, through unity of purpose and harmony of action, will be made to produce the added employment growth we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Government actions alone can scarcely ensure employment growth itself, let alone growth commensurate with the country's needs.  Such actions never occur in a vaccum.  They are intended to shape the course society might best take, in pursuit of their objectives.  In this instance, they are aimed at creating the conditions within which total national effort, including that of all sectors of the economy, can move forward on jobs. They are aimed at pointing out, facilitating and encouraging the sorts of actions, throughout the economy, considered most likely to underpin progress on viable employment.  But they need to be complemented, and built upon, by all sections of the economy if they are to achieve success.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the substance of the motion before us, its underlying aims being wholly laudable, hopefully leading to the establishment of a successful jobs forum to which there are many ingredients. Therefore, we must decide in the course of this debate and over the next few weeks before the Taoiseach arrives at a final conclusion, precisely the format of that forum.  In my view, at a minimum any successful forum must draw on ideas and insights representing all sectors. Indeed Deputy Bruton's proposals may seem to envisage what I might term a &ldquo;talking shop&rdquo; to &ldquo;receive, study and comment on&rdquo; a series of views, proposals, studies or plans emanating from Government sources.  There is missing a concept of innovation, of generating strategies, of calling on the many other elements in society which undoubtedly have something to offer in the search for a better employment future.  I contend any such forum must develop ideas and proposals within the framework of a broad, consistent, macroeconomic strategy appropriately structured to underpin jobs growth.  I see little evidence in the motion before the House of a view on or acceptance of such a constraint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>In fairness to Deputy Bruton I must say I assume he would <Col N="487" /> never advocate anything other than a sensible, growth-supportive evaluation of public finances, which point he made fairly this evening.</P>
      <P>Any such forum must seek also the widest possible public consensus on proposals and strategies it might be in mind to advocate.  I think the Deputy did have that in mind where his motion speaks of &ldquo;seeking to reach agreement on a comprehensive programme of structural reform&rdquo;.  But one must ask: how widely? It would not appear to me to be sufficient simply to seek agreement within any forum to proposals for change.  As I have suggested already, I believe consensus must be forthcoming on a much broader front if fundamental changes are to be implemented and advanced wholeheartedly by society rather than considered and proposed by what might be perceived, however wrongly, as a group with a narrower focus.</P>
      <P>The forum must also be positioned to bring forward proposals which, while based on a solid strategic approach, do not involve an unduly long gestation period.  The nation will not thank any of us in this House if, in its perception, another &ldquo;talking shop&rdquo; were to be established. It would be unfortunate if this House were to approve an approach which, whatever its other merits, seemed so structured as to be unlikely to provide useful results &mdash; in the form of actionable proposals &mdash; within an acceptably short time frame.  I see the Deputy's proposals, in this respect, as inadequate.  His motion appears to envisage awaiting a long series of Government reports, a process of studying those, a process of drawing out proposals based on them, and a process of seeking out group consensus, all set in the context of &ldquo;a comprehensive programme of structural reform&rdquo;.  But when might those who are unemployed hope for some alleviation of their unenviable situation as a consequence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We debated this matter here a number of months ago and different proposals were put forward.  I saw much merit in many of the points put forward by Deputy Quinn.  As this is a short debate <Col N="488" /> we cannot go back over the process of analysing a problem, which all of us know precisely what it is, not only today, not only for next year but right through this decade.  We know exactly the number of people for whom we have to create jobs, approximately 23,000 per year.  We know the demographics beyond the year 2000 and I think we know what the economy can achieve in terms of jobs.  We have seen the good years and the bad years. We have to identify the mechanism we are missing in our present links and see how we can face up to the realities of a very difficult future.  We have to look at the prospects in other countries for emigrants; it is unlikely that many of our people will be able to go abroad.  I will not argue with Deputy Bruton about the wrongs and rights of the Financial Services Centre.  It so happens, before I came here, I attended a function to launch a company in the Financial Services Centre.  There are now almost 3,000 people employed in the centre, many of whom are graduates, but I do not want to get into that argument.  When we know what we have to achieve we can create a consensus in a meaningful way, where we can sit down and try to structure that progress.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a forum &mdash; I make this point in a non-political way &mdash; to represent the Members of this House, members of the Culliton Group, the Paddy Moriarty Committee who are implementing the Culliton report, if it duplicates the work of the central review committee, does the job of the task force, and if we are to analyse all those reports, I respectfully suggest that we would get lost in paper and reports.  That is precisely what has been done incorrectly for many years.  What we need is a much smaller group &mdash; however we develop it &mdash; that can work with all the other groups and can meet them when they need to and try to develop a strategy.  If we have 50 people sitting down to try to analyse a problem which has been written about in at least 90 reports in the last 15 years we will achieve nothing.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I am not calling into question the idea of monitoring progress. <Col N="489" /> The prodding of a predetermined time-scale or calendar is a useful incentive to getting things done.  Monitoring is much more useful where, as in the case of the industrial policy review group reports and proposals to be attended to are not worked out in detail, and instead are directed to strategy without seeking to dot the i's.</P>
    <P>The key purpose which any new grouping must serve is to develop both workable and valuable proposals and the consensus in society that will see them being acted upon.  That is what the central point of this debate or any forum or committee, or whatever arises from it, must be.  I do not see it as the end-game, however, for a successful forum aimed at enhancing employment prospects, that it should produce broad statements of policy thrust only.  There are scores of those.  The real advance to be secured by establishing some new forum &mdash; whatever we may call it &mdash; is to move forward from the &ldquo;broad statement&rdquo; about &ldquo;necessary policy thrusts&rdquo; to identification of specifics to give flesh to such statements, to gain wide recognition of the merits of those strategies and policies in an employment context, and to generate support for their implementation even among those who may see themselves as &ldquo;losers&rdquo; in the shorter run from steps to be taken.</P>
    <P>Let us be frank.  We live in a society where there are multiple, and frequently conflicting, objectives.  There will be honest disagreement about what formulate are likely to best contribute to meeting employment goals, because views about the prospects of various approaches will differ.  There will, also, be disagreement based on other considerations. In particular in the area of structural reform, it seems unlikely that progress could be based on measures which will gain the ready support of all. Few structural reforms &mdash; as anyone who has ever sought to prepare a reform in taxation will know &mdash; throw up many winners.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small open economy.  It is, in fact, one of the most open economies in Europe.  This means that, ultimately, <Col N="490" /> our economic growth and associated employment performance is vitally dependent on securing growing exports while, at the same time, preserving or enhancing our share of the domestic market.  How well we do on both fronts will reflect our competitiveness in the international arena.  This is not just a matter of labour costs, although these are of crucial importance.  Success is also a function of the overall environment in which business has to operate, including the cost of services provided in the sheltered sectors of the economy; and, of course, is a function of the many other factors which differentiate the more acceptable good or service from the less acceptable.  What time remains for me?</P>

      <P>In a debate such as this it is not necessary for me to put all aspects of what I have said on the record as my colleague, the Minister for Labour, and other members of my party will be speaking in this debate.  We have an opportunity, through whatever final discussions the Government will engage in to move forward in this debate towards a committee, a forum, a group or whatever, to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding progress to date, the Government are keenly aware that a major problem of employment creation faces our country over the medium term if we are to afford the opportunity of work to our growing labour force.  That <Col N="491" /> problem demands that we bring all energies to bear on the task of securing more rapid, sustainable employment growth and, where necessary, reorder our priorities to ensure that employment has the place it deserves, at the top of national priorities.</P>
    <P>Success in achieving still more rapid employment growth demands that no stone be left unturned.  Giving a deeper political dimension to the search for strategies and measures likely to help may be one appropriate step.  Developing more specific solutions with an eye to securing, at the same time, the most widespead public support for those solutions may be another.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has already informed the House, proposals for an appropriate structure to further this aim, in which we all share, are under consideration.  The intention is to bring the Government's proposals in this respect forward within the next couple of weeks as outlined in amendment No. 1.  This is not to criticise the work done by the leader of the main Opposition party but to take into account what has been said today and in the previous debate, and to try to get a workable group with all the other excellent groups, who are trying to improve our present difficult unemployment position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusCullimore" hpid="Mr. Cullimore Mr. Cullimore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullimore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that he will bring forward an appropriate structure which will enable new ideas and proposals to be identified and implemented with wide political support.  The unemployment problem can only be addressed properly by economic development which includes much more than industry.  The solution must include the development of our tourism industry, agriculture, agri-tourism, growth in the service base and improvements in our training schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not doubt that unemployment is the single greatest social problem that this country has to contend with.  Our labour force is growing.  I commend the Government for initiating two schemes, a new employment subsidy scheme and a new in-company training scheme.  This <Col N="492" /> marks a most important and significant new development with clear long term viability.</P>
    <P>The employment subsidy scheme will cater for up to 15,000 additional employees and will be open to a wide range of employers.  Under the in-company training scheme training will be provided for up to 10,000 people.  The Government's commitment to both schemes is a further indication of the thrust of the budget, to confront the problems of rising unemployment and speed up new employment opportunities. I have evidence of the success of those initiatives.  It has come to my notice that in my own constituency of Wexford a sizeable number of small firms are positively investigating the possibility of expanding their workforces.  The initiatives will give them the encouragement they need to advance their position and create further employment in a county which finds itself with the second highest unemployment rate in the country.</P>
    <P>I note that considerable and significant improvements have taken place in the manufacturing sector in the Wexford district in regard to jobs.  Between 1987 and 1991 manufacturing employment increased to 5,333, a significant rise of 13.4 per cent.  I recognise and commend the work done by the Industrial Development authority and the positive role they are playing in enhancing the employment prospects of our county.  I have no doubt that the 143 small business companies in County Wexford, and other such firms throughout the country, found heartening and encouraging reading in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I would also like to commend the Industrial Development Authority for their commitment of £15,000 per annum for five years to the Wexford Enterprise Centre resulting in the creation of 73 jobs in 23 projects.  While I welcome and appreciate the work and money committed to such projects, the time is now right for the Industrial Development Authority to locate a factory on their Rosslare site.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the initiatives introduced <Col N="493" /> by the Minister I suggest that the Government should and could complement these measures by seeking to implement the recommendations of the task force on employment: increasing access to higher education which would have very positive side effects; reviving the imposition of stamp duty on new houses, allowing an exemption on new houses with a floor area of up to 140 square metres; greater emphasis on a higher proportion of residential development under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations of the industrial policy review group must be implemented without delay.  The review group suggested that agencies currently in charge of industrial promotion should be reformed into two wings, the first of which would concentrate solely on attracting overseas investment while the second would be responsible for developing Irish owned firms.  They also recommended greater concentration in encouraging local initiative through a regional support structure and called for a major overhaul of the FÁS structure with a clear split between training for the unemployed and those at work.  The review group identified the food industry as a growth area and recommended that more finance be spent on promoting the national green image as a way of penetrating European markets.</P>
    <P>I urge the Opposition parties to wait until the Taoiseach, as promised, appoints the appropriate structure to enable us deal with these ideas and implement the proposals which are badly needed to create jobs here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Members, I welcome the fact that we are attempting to make progress on the floor of the House in regard to the unemployment problem in a co-ordinated way.  We recognise the generous approach and attitude adopted by Deputy Bruton in suggesting a jobs forum and the positive response by the Government.  In his remarks the Minister addressed some comments at the organisations already in place to monitor the position and make recommendations.  Fresh off the press we <Col N="494" /> have the Culliton report.  The Government took a speedy decision to appoint a task force to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in that report.  I hope the task force will ensure that the recommendations are implemented quickly by Government Departments, State agencies and, where necessary, the private sector.</P>
      <P>A jobs forum would have the potential to come up with suggestions and pragmatic ideas.  More important, they would have the capacity, on an all-party basis, to provide a forum for people within the economy who feel they have a contribution to make.  There are impediments in the way of progress at present. Apart from the task force set up to monito the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Culliton report, there is a task force on unemployment which is chaired by a senior official of the Taoiseach's Department, a Cabinet subcommittee and the co-ordinating committee under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to monitor the position and make recommendations on how we can create jobs.</P>
      <P>The Government in their amendment point to the fact that 18,000 jobs have been created in a calendar year while they are also well aware that 25,000 young people come onto the jobs market annually. This is on top of the 270,000 who are unemployed.  The task facing us therefore is frightening and a source of concern.  Given the slow-down in the rate of emigration and the economic downturn in the United States and the United Kingdom we are staring at some horrendous figures.  If we are to make a major impact on job creation we will have to co-ordinate our efforts which I hope will be the outcome of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group on industrial policy, set-up following the decision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask a steering committee to draw up a report &mdash; they reported on time &mdash; have made some positive recommendations. However, it is worrying that the various State bodies referred to in the report are jumping to attention immediately.  The Industrial Development Authority in <Col N="495" /> particular stated they are implementing most of what is contained in the report but I find this difficult to understand and see no evidence of it.</P>
    <P>A major recommendation in relation to job creation, which should be acted upon decisively, is that the Industrial Development Authority be divided in two with one section focusing on the need to attract overseas industry and the other concentrating on home industries.  There is no doubt that many small indigenous industries feel they have not received the full support and attention, at top level, of the Industrial Development Authority unlike the international high flying industries. While it is necessary at attract American and Japanese companies who have excellent potential, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Telesis report strongly recommended that emphasis be placed on indigenous industry.  The Culliton report, many years later, suggests something similar which leads one to believe that, as a result of the emerging consensus from this House, at worst we will get a very able group which will allow views, ideas and suggestions to be put forward by organisations as to what can be done to cut away much of the red tape and pigeon hole management which exists among many State and other agencies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and I hope that the appropriate structures will be brought forward quickly so that everybody will play a positive and decisive role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to acknowledge the Taoiseach's commitment in principle &mdash; and indeed that of the Government &mdash; to the establishment of a forum which will focus on unemployment in a structured way and which will also have the necessary resources to carry out an urgent investigation of what must be done in a similar manner to that of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
      <P>We believe that unemployment must be politicised.  By that I do not mean that the political parties should vulgarise themselves by treating unemployment as a party political issue.  We must recognise that unemployed people have become demoralised, demotivated and increasingly desperate by the depoliticisation of their plight and the complete failure of the country to respond with constructive measures to help them to return to work.</P>
      <P>Unlike some political parties &mdash; and in particular some economic commentators from the free market school of economics &mdash; we have never accepted the principle that there is an acceptable level of unemployment. A humane, caring and vibrant society must enshrine in its value system the principle of full employment, not as an aspiration but as an objective.  Reluctantly, in looking initially at the Fine Gael motion before the House we believe that it is like the curate's egg &mdash; good in parts. Indeed the national organisation for the unemployed, in a statement issued today, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's Dáil motion, which apparently has the support of the Government, appears to offer just the same half-hearted response.  If it is passed as it stands it will waste a golden opportunity.  Worse, by using the Forum name in this way, it would become harder to establish the real institution which would offer hope.  We call on the Taoiseach to recognise the true value of the forum idea and adopt it in a full and vigorous way because, <Col N="497" /> bluntly, half a forum will be worse than none. </P>
    <P>I should, in fairness, say that Deputy Bruton in his contribution has gone some way to clarify the attitude of the Fine Gael Party in relation to including representatives of the unemployed in whatever body emerges.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, the fundamental omissions in the Fine Gael motion are the exclusion of any reference to the rights of organisations which represent or seek to defend the interests of unemployed people and those living in poverty or social deprivation to be represented, as of right, in the forum.  Secondly, and it comes as no surprise, the Fine Gael motion, in so far as I understand it, and the Government's intention, are to establish a jobs or an employment forum.  The nomenclature here is not a matter of mere semantics, it is political. Unless the forum refers specifically to unemployment, their terms of reference and focus will more than likely be on employment creation and will not primarily concentrate on analysis and strategies to reduce unemployment.  I want to emphasise this point to the two Ministers present: we have not yet properly addressed the question of managing the labour market in full and dealing with what the Minister for Finance &mdash; formerly the Minister for Labour &mdash; referred to in his own contribution, the demographic nature of the labour market between now and the end of this century.</P>
    <P>It is simply not sufficient to set up a group or another committee which will talk about employment creation.  We must look at our labour market and the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed, and bring forward new measures and methods of intervention which will deal with it.  Whatever body emerges in a fortnight's time as a result of the Taoiseach's announcement, if it does not concentrate on that and is simply another variation of a task force or a committee, the Labour Party will not be impressed and will consider it a worthless exercise.  To put it bluntly, the Labour Party will not lend their name &mdash; never <Col N="498" /> mind their goodwill &mdash; to an exercise which in any sense is one of political expediency.  I do not believe that is the intention or the motivation of the Taoiseach or indeed the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach and Fine Gael to accept our amendment to include representatives of the unemployed as of right in recognition that such organisations have a valuable contribution to make because they represent the voiceless in our society.  Indeed it is a constituency that our President, Mary Robinson, in her campaign for the presidency took upon herself to try to give a voice to during the course of that campaign.  It is right that the Oireachtas political parties should play the leading role in a forum on unemployment and employment, which the Labour Party propose.</P>
    <P>In the 1989 general election the Labour Party published a policy document which proposed emergency and radical measures to meet the unemployment crisis.  Appropriately, it was entitled <i>Jobs and Justice.</i> We spelt out the necessity of changing the way our labour market institutions operate to the detriment of employment through excessive use of voluntary redundancy in profitable enterprises and the need for the unemployed to secure, as a right, a proportion of the normal vacancies which arise in the labour market.  Specifically, we indicated that redundancies were wiping out the employment effects of new jobs being created and that vast sums were being spent by major companies on redundancy when redeployment and part-time work should have been available as an alternative to redundancy.</P>
    <P>We also put forward a programme to eliminate long term unemployment by involving the Government and the social partners directly in supporting a complete revamping of the employment incentive scheme which would have placed 20,000 unemployed persons in work each year.  We proposed that 25 per cent of vacancies arising in the public and private sector should be allocated to those who were 12 months or more out of work.  We did not &mdash; and we do not&mdash;<Col N="499" /> expect employers to carry the cost of such a far-reaching intervention on behalf of the unemployed.  We proposed that the subsidy to employers should be doubled in the first year from £60 to £120 per week which, in today's terms, would amount to £132 per week.  In the second and third years, payment would be slightly less but not less than £100 per week.</P>
    <P>In that document we also identified the structural weakness in over-dependence on overseas industry as a source of retained value added in the Irish economy. The IDA's own data demonstrated that in 1987, while overseas industry sales amounted to £7,580 million, the value added in terms of wages and materials bought in the Irish economy was just under half that, at £3,032 million.  By contrast, sales of Irish-owned industry, while lower at £6,966 million, resulted in the sum of £5,601 million in retained value added here, which explains, in a very neat form, the discrepancy between apparent economic growth and very low levels of employment creation.  The difference, in reality, amounts to approximately 50,000 jobs in direct manufacturing and another 50,000 jobs indirectly generated from the effect of expenditure in our economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Culliton report, particularly the supporting consultancy reports, have identified this value-added gap as requiring complete reorientation in our industrial policy.  It is of great satisfaction to my party that the Culliton report has vindicated the views which we put forward since the publication of the Telesis report as far back as 1981 and indeed the views expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in their own seminal document, <i>Confronting the Jobs Crisis.</i></P>
    <P>We have made some progress since the days when the howling hyenas and high priests of the new right were identifying Government intervention and expenditure as the core problem of our poor economic performance and the root cause of unemployment.  However, the Government &mdash; and to some extent the <Col N="500" /> Fine Gael Party &mdash; are still partial prisoners of policies which are increasingly being recognised, not only on the left but even by orthodox economic commentators, as a discredited ideology and a bankrupt economic programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome signs of discomfort on the Fianna Fáil benches with the tail of Thatcherism which was recently served up to us in the budget.  I also welcome the impending demise of the hypnotic trance in which the climatologists have held the Government for a number of years.  This would be an indication to the unemployed in particular and also to the Irish electorate that climatology was to be officially discarded and placed with other forms of necromancy and more exotic forms of astrology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been so preoccupied with getting the climate right that we have missed the wood for the trees.  In fact, that whole obsession with getting the climate right is simply a branch of voodoo economics which hopefully we will be able to get rid of for ever and a day.</P>
      <P>If the forum is to succeed I should like the Taoiseach and the Government to take into consideration the views expressed by the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed who are the representatives of the unemployed.  No other organisation has that role.  Too many structures have been set up to deal with unemployment without involving the unemployed in finding solutions.  A lack of representation means such initiatives soon lose the confidence of people and lack the urgency or drive to tackle the root causes of our crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The body so created should have an independent chairperson, and should not be the nominee of the Government <i>per se.</i> The forum must be chaired by an independent and respected person who will ensure full participation by all parties and ensure that bureaucratic barriers are not put in the way of progress. The <Col N="501" /> Labour Party believe that the forum's session should be held in public and they must engage the interests and concerns of all the people. Seeking solutions to our unemployment problem is not a matter of expertise only but must also involve the education and development of a national vision of better full employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Submissions should be taken from all interested bodies.  No one group or sector has all the answers to our problems.  This is painfully obvious.  All group, small or large, must be allowed to present their case and make their proposals.  Each submission and idea must be rigorously analysed in a way which can be widely understood.  Many job creation proposals have hidden impacts on certain groups or sectors.  These must be detailed so that a frank assessment can be made of the potential gains and losses.  The establishment of clear long term priorities regarding policy to address unemployment will ultimately be the test of the forum success.  We have endless analyses in our society of what is wrong; we need now to win broad agreement about what we must do and how it can be done.</P>
    <P>The forum must be adequately resourced to carry out their job.  In particular, the INOU should receive technical assistance to allow them to participate on an equal footing with other groups.  This assistance would allow them to engage the expertise necessary to play a full role in technical discussions and consult with member groups on a detailed and more regular basis.  I should like to acknowledge in particular the contribution the INOU have made over the past number of years.  No solution to the problem of unemployment as distinct from the problem of job creation, can realistically be aspired to if the INOU are not fully and properly represented.  This will require the provision of addition necessary resources to enable them to do their job.</P>
    <P>There is another angle to this, that is, the European angle.  One crucial task for the preparatory phase of the forum will be to work out the most productive role <Col N="502" /> for the EC in the forum process.  Four areas of involvement come to mind: financial support for the forum process; playing a role in questioning the Irish Government on the job impact of the allocation of Structural Fund moneys; questioning the limitations placed on the spending of Structural and Cohesion Fund moneys and how they can be changed in order to allow more employment-generating investment and the development of an EC supported, active industrial development policy throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to Northern Ireland and the forum.  The national forum on the unemployed must look in a sensitive way at approaches through which greater cohesion between the economies and policies of Northern Ireland and the Republic can lead to employment growth in both parts of the island.  In talking about these areas we have to take into account the position of minority groups and their difficulties with unemployment. Several groups, such as travellers and the disabled, suffer specific additional disadvantages in seeking employment.  It is essential that the interests of these groups are adequately recognised in the forum's deliberations.  In any case, forum membership should be made up of equal numbers of men and women.</P>
    <P>Since the 1991 budget, the Labour Party have emphasised the necessity for the Government to focus on policy instruments which meet the crisis of a growth in the registered unemployed by the end of this year.  We believe that the focus must be on radical initiatives which offer the unemployed the prospect of paid work as an alternative to permanent enforced idleness.  The direct costs of unemployment can be measured. However, the indirect but consequent costs in financial and human terms for those forced to remain removed from the world of work threaten to undermine our society and destroy its social fabric. Unemployment is not simply a story of jobs destroyed; it is one of devastation in terms of the strains placed on family life and isolation from the working population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> We have had policies designed to assist the unemployed secure training or temporary work.  All such policies were conceived without the expectation of the unprecedented level of unemployment which we have now reached.  Forecasts by the ESRI in their latest medium-term economic review project a continuing rise in the level of unemployment to 1996. The forecasts of the Henley Centre for the United Kingdom economy project rising unemployment in the years 1992-94. The position of labour markets in the US, Canada and Australia are forecast to deteriorate.  Reference was made earlier to this.  This means Ireland faces the prospect of unemployment, as registered on the live register, remaining above 300,000 until 1995 at least.  The composition of the unemployed and unemployment has begun to change with a sharp rise in the number of those aged under 25 and a continuing growth in the number of those on the live register for 12 months or more.</P>
    <P>There are many other things which perhaps should be said at the time the forum is established.  I want to say very clearly to the Government and the Ministers present that we will not be fobbed off by some kind of inadequately resourced committee, group or body who have as their primary focus employment creation and who refer repeatedly to what has already been achieved, as is contained in the Government's amendment tonight. The problem is not job creation; the problem is unemployment.  The problem is not the mismatch between growth in the economy on the one hand and growth in jobs on the other.  Because of its size and scale, projected to be 300,000 by 1995 and stabilising at that level, the problem is twofold: it is about job creation and managing the problems of those people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party do not accept the view that getting the climate right, getting more growth into the economy or removing restrictions here, there and elsewhere will be sufficient, as the Culliton report says, to deal with the problem.  There are two problems.  The Culliton report and <Col N="504" /> the economy deal with the problem of employment creation in real terms. However, there is a second residual problem, that is, people who are unemployed at present and who face the prospect indefinitely of remaining unemployed. The Labour Party hold a different view to that in the Fine Gael motion and the less adequate Government response which focus on those who are at work or likely to get work unaided by activities from the Government, with little or no focus on those who are unemployed at present and who are destined to remain unemployed for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>This is a new Administration.  The Taoiseach and the Government have indicated that they will put forward proposals within a fortnight as to how they intend dealing with this matter.  I want to say very clearly to the Ministers present that, unless there is a serious response in terms of generosity of composition, control, representation on that body and their terms of reference, and unless adequate resources are made available the response from the Government will be a totally inadequate vehicle to deal with the problem.  I make that point as constructively as possible.  A constructive debate has taken place in the House this evening.  I am putting down a very firm marker that we are not just dealing with job creation but with the structural problems of long term unemployment on a scale this society has never previously experienced, which is projected to continue for a very long time and which threatens the basic stability of society. We cannot wait for the tide to lift the boats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter for the second time in two years.  Two years ago the closure of Renard pier was a matter of great concern to the community in Cahirciveen and its environs.  Nobody at that time anticipated that two years <Col N="505" /> down the line this pier would still remain closed, with a consequent loss to the business and tourist community and growing frustration and disenchantment among all the citizens of Cahirciveen.</P>
      <P>In its last year of use, 1989, 134 ships visited and discharged at this port; 50,000 boxes of fish at an estimated value of £3 million were discharged; £270,000 was spent on transport to and from the pier, mainly by Kerry hauliers; £225,000 was paid to a Kerry supplier for oil to service the ships; approximately £35,000 was spent on foodstuffs by those coming in and approximately £30,000 was spent on ancillary services.  These activities at Renard pier in its last year of service clearly demonstrate the loss of the pier to the community over the two years and the urgent need of the Minister to make a firm decision to have the pier restored without further delay.</P>
      <P>Exactly one year ago a high-powered deputation from the business community in Cahirciveen, accompanied by officials from Kerry County Council and public representatives, discussed with the previous Minister the provision of the necessary moneys to enable Kerry County Council to proceed with the repair work. At that meeting £37,500 was contributed on behalf of the business community in Cahirciveen, which was certainly most generous.  The county council confirmed their contribution and the Minister appeared totally satisfied, promising a decision within three weeks.  To my knowledge no decision was subsequently issued by Deputy Wilson who was then Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appealing very strongly tonight to the Minister, having regard to the generous contribution of the community and the anxiety of the council and public representatives in Kerry, to have the necessary repair work carried out so that the ships may start moving into Renard pier again.  By doing so, the Minister will be acknowledging the generous contribution of the community towards the work.  A favourable decision at this time would provide the opportunity of having the repair work carried out before the peak tourist season, thus benefiting <Col N="506" /> immensely the economy of Cahirciveen. I welcome the Minister to his new portfolio, a portfolio that often takes the Ministry onto the high seas.  I am appealing to him to ensure that money is provided at an early date to repair this pier.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Deputy for affording me this opportunity to address the question of the closure of Renard pier.  The Deputy will be aware that resources for the development of fishery harbours are scarce and he will appreciate that my primary concern is to ensure that these resources are used in the most effective manner to encourage and foster the development of our fishing industry.  In this regard, I wish to draw attention to my Department's Fishery Harbours Development Programme, 1989-1993. This was drawn up following detailed consultation with the local authorities.  It is designed to meet the infrastructural needs of a modern fishing industry facing into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>I would like to turn now to the specific case of Renard pier.  The primary responsibility for the maintenance and repair of Renard pier lies with Kerry County Council.  My Department do, however, grant aid improvement works at fishery harbours and it is in this context that the question arises.  In so far as we have an interest in Renard pier, that interest is concerned solely with its contribution to the fishing industry in its widest sense.  Renard pier has played an important part in facilitating the landing of substantial quantities of fish over the years.  In particular, Renard pier has been used extensively by large steel-hulled Spanish vessels, which have contributed to the deterioration of the pier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Kerry County Council closed the pier in 1990, my Department have been the focus of many representations regarding the repair of the pier.  Local interests, including Kerry County Council, have offered to contribute to the cost of the repair work.  To date little progress has been made in advancing the case.  A fuller investigation of exactly what is required to repair the pier needs to be undertaken <Col N="507" /> and a detailed costing produced.  The limited resources available for harbour developments must be spent in the most effective manner possible.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be glad to hear that I have already received strong representations from Deputy John O'Donoghue with regard to this pier and I have accepted his invitation to inspect this personally at an early date.  I will then consider the most appropriate course of action within the resources available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to congratulate the Minister for Justice on his appointment.  Without prejudice to our right to carry out faction fights in Mayo we are sincerely delighted that a very prestigious Cabinet post has been restored to the county and we wish him well in his very onerous portfolio.</P>
      <P>Tara Jawad and her sister, Evian, were both born in Baghdad.  Their father is a former lawyer, now working for the United Arab Emirates.  Their mother is a Turkish born doctor working in Iraq. The two girls came to Ireland on 23 May 1991 on foot of visitors' visas.  On 12 July 1991 the girls went to the Aliens Registration Office of the Department of Justice to renew their visas.  Their passports and documentation were taken from them and not returned.  Tara commenced studying for her leaving certificate examination at the Institute of Education, Leeson Street, Dublin.  Evian is a qualified doctor and was accepted by the Medical Council for post-graduate study and by Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1991 both girls applied for student visas.  They were not given any definite indication as to the likely verdict on this application.  They heard nothing about their applications until, approximately, 8 p.m. on Thursday last, 20 February, when a gentleman from the Department of Justice knocked on the <Col N="508" /> girls' door, handed them back their passports and gave them one week to leave the country.</P>
    <P>I accept that there have to be rules, regulations and guidelines for the right of entry to and residence in this country, but I must also beg to make the point that there have to be occasions when a little tolerance, understanding and common sense are called for.  Both girls are studying here.  Neither is a burden on the State.  Tara pays her full fees for the leaving certificate course she is undertaking. Evian is looking for unpaid post-graduate work and is maintained, again, by her parents.</P>
    <P>For a country whose citizens are scattered to the four corners of the world, often dependent on the goodwill of other nationalities, we sometimes have an extremely intolerant approach to accommodating aliens here.  Indeed, when one considers the fact that we have an unquantified but nevertheless estimated figure of between 50,000 and 100,000 young Irish people who are illegal aliens in the United States alone, living in fear of detection and deportation, we can indulge in a fair amount of halo adjusting when it comes to any kind of flexibility towards those seeking even temporary, non-burdensome residence here.  For a Government which lobbies, using high powered official delegations, for new visa rounds and green cards for our own young people abroad, with the expectation that we are entitled to special and exceptional treatment, we can be remarkably cold, arid and bureaucratic when it comes to using a little common sense and give and take when dealing with others.  We expect total appreciation of the plight of our emigrants who find themselves in various difficulties, yet we sometimes refuse to relent one inch when it comes to displaying a like courtesy, let alone a whit of diplomatic nicety, not to mention compassion.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to spell out to the Minister the difficulties being experienced in the two girls' home country.</P>
    <P>In brief, the girls are students.  They are not a burden on the State.  They are extremely law abiding.  They are both <Col N="509" /> studying here, one for the leaving certificate examination and the other is doing post-graduate work.  Another sister, Tanya, has a student visa and is a third year medical student.  I ask the Minister to give student visas to the other two sisters to enable them to continue their studies and to live together.</P>
    <P>The family awaits the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my thanks to Deputy Higgins, my colleague from Mayo, for his kind words of congratulation on my recent appointment.  I know he makes them in a genuine spirit of support, and I accept them as such.  I thank him very much.</P>
      <P>I am glad to take this opportunity of outlining to the House how the cases raised by Deputy Higgins are known to the Aliens Registration Office.  The full circumstances surrounding the case of these two Iraqi persons will show the way they disregarded the aliens laws.  I have before me their original applications for visas to enter the State.  In their applications they each clearly stated that they were coming to visit their sister who is studying in Dublin.  The proposed visit was to be for a short duration of three weeks.  It was on this basis, and on this basis only, that their application was considered and the decision taken to grant them permission for a short visit here.</P>
      <P>The two persons concerned arrived in the State on 23 May last and the immigration officer in Dublin Airport granted them permission to stay in the State for one month.  They subsequently applied for an extension to remain in the State for a further period.  This was considered and refused in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I would like to inform the House that it is common practice the world over not to permit persons who arrive in a country for a short stay &mdash; that is, for touristic reasons or to visit a family friend &mdash; to overstay beyond the period for which permission is initially granted. This is one of the basic rules of immigration control.  You have to treat every application for a tourist visa as a genuine bona fide application.  Otherwise you <Col N="510" /> would have to engage in long and costly bureaucratic controls to ensure, in effect, that each tourist coming here from a country in respect of which a visa is required was a genuine tourist and not somebody using the pretext of a holiday to come here and remain here illegally.</P>
    <P>The other side of that coin, the obverse of the somewhat relaxed approach to considering visa applications for holiday purposes, is the absolute insistence that people who come here on short-stay visas must leave after the term for which permission was granted has expired.  As I said, this is a rule which has almost unanimous international acceptance and it is one which we rigorously enforce.  There can be no departure from it except in emergency cases such as illness.</P>
    <P>If people who come to visit here decide that they would like to live here for a while, for study or for some other acceptable purpose, they must return to their country of origin and apply for an entry visa, saying why they want to come here. This has always been the case and, again, this practice is on a par with the attitudes adopted in other European countries. This aspect of our aliens controls has been explained to the two persons whose case was raised by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the persons in question has been studying while here, and the other person has been in unpaid employment.  Their actions in so doing are in breach of the aliens laws and regulations. The persons concerned have been well aware of the conditions under which they were allowed enter the State as these are clearly stamped on their passports. They made no attempt to leave the State and have now been here illegally for over eight months.  Evidently, they were not contemplating leaving the State as they had taken up a course of studies and unpaid employment.</P>
    <P>They were advised by the Aliens Regulations Office on Thursday last, 20 February 1992, that they had seven days to leave the State and to make arrangements accordingly.  I understand that they are currently making such arrangements and have accepted the decision conveyed <Col N="511" /> to them.  I regret that I cannot be of further assistance in this matter.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Teachers for Dublin Schools.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>My cause is very simple and straightforward and I hope it will receive an equally simple and straightforward response from the Minister of State.  For some years now, going back to the early eighties, both the Burrow national school, Dublin 13, and the Springdale national school, Dublin 5, have attempted to convince the Department of Education that they should be each assigned a remedial teacher for their urgent needs.  They have had little or no success.  Recently the two schools have taken the very innovative approach of making a joint appeal to the Department in the hope that their case, thereby strengthened, would receive an immediate, if not favourable, response.  Their cause should be dealt with compassionately by the Department and a remedial teacher should be assigned to both schools.  They are in the same constituency of Dublin North East but they are quite a distance from each other. Nonetheless, the schools have discussed this matter and the boards of management have agreed that they can work out a rota scheme of co-operation between them.  Their innovative approach should be rewarded by a favourable response.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Burrow national school in Sutton has on the roll 200 students and of those it is estimated that 41 require remedial teaching.  In Springdale school in Raheny there are 182 on the roll and 30 of the students require remedial help.  On average 18 per cent of the pupils in the two schools require this service.  At the moment they can rely only on part-time remedial help paid for through the contributions from the parents of the pupils in the schools.  This is clearly not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate adjoining areas of Howth, Baldoyle and Raheny have been surveyed and it seems they are the only <Col N="512" /> two schools in the entire district without any remedial service from the Department of Education.  It is coincidential, but they are the only two Church of Ireland schools in the same area.  I do not suggest that there is any sinister conclusion to be drawn from this but it is an unfortunate coincidence that the two schools without remedial support from the Department are Church of Ireland schools servicing the constituency.  The parents of pupils in both schools make substantial voluntary contributions towards maintaining the service.  Both schools are handicapped in that their principals are working principals within the school.  In larger schools there is flexibility in that principals working in an administrative capacity can on occasion release other teachers for specialist remedial teaching practices. For those reasons the Minister should respond favourably to these schools.</P>
    <P>In response to recent correspondence I received a reply from the Minister indicating that of the 80 positions allocated for the current year all posts had been filled and this news has been conveyed to the schools.  They accept and appreciate that but they hope that having put on the record of the House the special needs and the case of the two schools now combined in their cause, the Minister will give some indication that in the next allocation of posts, they will receive consideration in view of the reasons I have advanced on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward) Liam Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>Remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resources for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.  It was with this in mind that 80 posts were allocated for remedial purposes out of the quota of posts made available under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> These appointments were made following the collection of data and information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts were then allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
    <P>The 1991 allocation of 80 remedial posts brings the total of such posts in primary schools to 945.  These 80 posts enabled a remedial service to be provided to an additional 242 primary schools.  The overall position now is that, of the 3,235 ordinary national schools in the country, approximately 1,400 have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or shared basis.  At this stage, all primary schools which sought a remedial service with enrolments above 420 have at least one remedial teacher and many more smaller schools have the service on a shared basis.</P>
    <P>Unlike ordinary class teaching posts, which must be filled where the prescribed numbers of pupils have been enrolled there is not an automatic allocation of remedial teaching posts each year.  The availability of such posts depends on the overall level of resources available to my Department.</P>
    <P>The appointment of further remedial teachers will be kept under review, and, in that connection, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools referred to by him will be borne in mind when the next set of allocations are being made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his long overdue elevation to Cabinet rank.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable fear amongst small dairy farmers in the west that the new milk hygiene regulations may put them out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows one half of all the milk offered for surrender under the present EC buy-up scheme came from <Col N="514" /> Connaght/Ulster.  This is a grossly disproportionate amount, and bad for the industry in the west.  Very many farmers are selling out their quotas because of the fear of having to spend thousands of pounds &mdash; which they do not have &mdash; to bring their milk facilities to the required standards of refrigeration and quality.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that we must have good quality milk.  There is no argument there.  The farmers are not too excessively worried either about the EC directive. What they are worried about is the interpretation of this directive by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>There are also serious infrastructural problems in some places, like Tireragh in County Sligo where there is no piped water in large areas.  There is an excellent source supply from Lough Easkey in the pipes.  The group schemes are ready, but the Government will not provide the money to get the water into the taps.</P>
    <P>The water available in the Castleconnor area is so bad that it actually introduces new bacteria in the cleaning operations, but Castleconnor people cannot get the funding for their group water scheme, even though they are seeking it for ten years.  What will happen to those dairy farmers under the new regulations?  Will we see them wiped out? They have even formed a new farmers grouping to fight against this possibility.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to contact his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to work out ways and means, maybe with European money, to help out farmers caught in this difficulty such as those in Castleconnor, Skreen, Dromard, Kilglass and in Culleens all in the Tireragh area of Sligo, and in other similar areas that do not have piped water.</P>
    <P>I also ask him to ensure that in the general application of the EC Directive common sense prevails.  Good housekeeping is demanded not an elaborate set-up costing thousands of pounds.  I am confident the new Minister for Agriculture and Food coming from south-west Cork, will adopt a realistic approach.  I hope he will be able tonight to allay the fears of the farmers in my constituency.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for his good wishes.  I hope that generosity will last for a long time.</P>
      <P>The matter Deputy Nealon raised is causing a degree of concern not alone in the west but also in the south-west.  The draft text of the proposed directive on the rules for the hygenic production of milk is at present under discussion in Brussels.  I should emphasise that these are only proposals at this stage and are very likely to be amended in a number of areas before final decisions are made by the EC Council of Ministers.  As it stands, I accept that the requirements of the directive would not be satisfied by a considerable number of those smaller farmers who rely on inadequate water supplies &mdash; and since the group water schemes are a matter for the Department of the Environment, I will not go into that.</P>
      <P>To overcome these fears I have established a working group representative of the various sides of the agricultural industry to prepare a submission for Community aid to help finance the necessary investment in water treatment equipment as well as other work on the upgrading of farms, dairies, and milking premises. I can tell the House that considerable progress has been made on this and that the submission will be sent to Brussels shortly.  I can assure Deputy Nealon and the House that I will be doing my utmost in the Council negotiations to ensure that the proposed directive will not present any insurmountable obstacles for the small dairy farmer.  I agree with the Deputy that what we want is a functional system on the farm that will produce quality milk and not the Rolls Royce system envisaged in some parts of the directive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that many farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country are experiencing problems <Col N="516" /> with the premium and headage payments to which they are entitled.  The general opinion in the farming community is that the Government are holding back the money to boost the Exchequer end of the year returns.  I have no doubt about that having looked at the way people are being dealt with and the reply I received no later than today which stated that the 1991 premiums which people applied for as far back as last June are being dealt with only now in February 1992.  That is not acceptable.  Is that the way we are going to continue?  Will people have to wait well into 1992 for the 1991 premium payments?</P>
    <P>People who have not paid their Land Commission annuity find that their premium payments are being withheld to meet the debt owing to the Land Commission. Many farmers who have come to me in the past two months do not have enough money to buy food or clothing for their families.  Indeed, if there is no immediate improvement in this serious situation, we will see many farmers in deeper trouble than they were in previous years.  I am not only talking about small farmers and beef farmers but many farmers find that because they made a single mistake in the application form they are being ruled out for the beef premium.  Have the Commission been in contact with the Department in view of the fact that the former Minister requested that 85 per cent or 90 per cent of the payment be made this year?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the position because the situation is very serious in the farming community.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister for Agriculture and Food aware of the serious situation in which a large number of farmers find themselves, particularly in his own constituency of south-west Cork, because they made minor technical errors completing their application forms for the EC premium schemes during 1991?  I would also like to mention the problem that special payments, such as the beef premium, suckler cow and cattle headage grant payments, have not yet been paid to all farmers even though the money was due at the end of June last.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the Minister that the beef premium was granted to offset the sharp drop in prices over the past decade, it is a form of compensation for the farmers concerned, yet payment is being withheld by the Government thus making life difficult for many.  Farmers are being penalised too heavily for having made minor clerical errors.  In some cases the penalty for such minor technical errors is that the farmer is debarred from the scheme for a further two years in addition to the loss of payment for the current year.  In my opinion this is like taking a sledgehammer to crack a hazelnut.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to make his Department understand that many farmers who have to fill out these application forms may not be able to complete them properly and they are not trying to cheat the system.  Genuine mistakes were made.  Indeed, in some cases the sex of the animal was incorrect on the card before it was ever delivered to the farmer.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to reverse the decisions in such cases and to approve payment to all farmers who were refused due to technical mistakes completing the application form.  I ask the Minister to rectify this anomaly immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me thank Deputies Farrelly and Sheehan for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  I am aware <Col N="518" /> of the problem.  While in many cases relatively minor errors were made, some of which were not created by the herd owner as the Deputy said, I am, and have been, looking at the matter to get an early and urgent resolution of it.</P>
      <P>In some cases, of course, applicants for both the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes are being refused payment because they failed to comply with the EC regulations governing schemes or because they made false claims either deliberately or through negligence and not because they made minor errors.  The penalties imposed are those set out by the EC Commission and I do not have the discretion to alter or reduce them. Nevertheless, I have already been in contact with the Commission with a view to having the penalties for irregular claims reduced because I feel they are quite severe.</P>
      <P>I have had a reply from the Commission which indicates that changes in the arrangements are not being considered at present but that they will be considered in the context of the negotiations on the new premium system proposed as part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I have arranged for early discussions on this point with the Commission to be continued. I will be in Brussels next week and intend to take up the matter again because I believe in genuine cases people have been wrongly deprived of their payments. Additionally I recognise that a great many herdowners and farmers are not very familiar with paper work and I would like to have the application form simplified.  To that end a departmental task force are investigating as a matter of urgency the problems with the administration of the 1991 cattle and sheep schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force were also asked to make recommendations on the application forms to be used for the 1992 schemes and on any changes which they considered might make it easier for farmers to understand the schemes and abide by their terms and conditions.  I will wait for the recommendations of the task force, which are expected next week, I hope, <Col N="519" /> before announcing any changes in the schemes.</P>
    <P>Any farmers who have genuine explanations for errors in their applications are free to give those explanations to the local offices of my Department.  Where mistakes are made without fraudulent intent and where there is some reasonable explanation for the mistake, the Department make every effort to treat the case with flexibility and understanding. I cannot give an undertaking, however, that such explanations will resolve their difficulties since EC Regulations oblige farmers to take reasonable steps to ensure that their claims are accurate.</P>
    <P>As many applications are still to be processed and many more are awaiting replies to queries, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the number of applications with minor or major irregularities.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will recall that in 1990 I put down a parliamentary question to him in respect of the urgent need to review the operation of the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  I was duly informed that he was aware of this urgency in the knowledge that all local authorities were under great pressure to deal with the convoy of vans, jeeps and luxurious trailers descending on them without warning and parking indiscriminately on the approach roads of some of our most important and beautiful tourist locations.  I can only conclude that in the meantime the Minister himself has been casual in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over one year later, and with the same Minister in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the citizens of Kilkenny must continue to be patient until the law is amended to ensure that the approach roads, and particularly the ring road, are safe and clear of any indiscriminate parking. This happens all too often in the <Col N="520" /> shadow of one of our finest hotels, the Hotel Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council have had to spend thousands of pounds in court and otherwise to prevent these vehicles from parking and trading illegally, in spite of the fact that the council have provided ten halting bays in the environs of the city.  These traders have no licence to trade casually as required under section 3 of the Act.  Kilkenny city has a designated trading area under section 7.  Under section 11, the powers of the Garda Síochána are obviously insufficient to move people to the designated area or other halting areas.</P>
    <P>The general public deserve a more disciplined and ordered society than what is now experienced on a daily basis due to the inoperable nature of the Casual Trading Act, 1980.  I look forward to action rather than words from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hogan for his good wishes.  The Casual Trading Act, 1980 provides for the control and regulation of casual trading.  Under the Act &ldquo;casual trading&rdquo; means selling goods by retail at a place &mdash; including a public road &mdash; to which the public have access as of right or at any other place that is a casual trading area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980 was deliberately framed to give local authorities the power to regulate and control casual trading in their own functional areas.  Local authorities are empowered under the Act to designate casual trading areas and where such areas are designated it is an offence for a casual trader to trade elsewhere in the functional area of that local authority.  By designating areas, local authorities can exercise control over casual trading in the location of the trading, in the number of permits they issue and through conditions attaching to the casual trading permits.  The Casual Trading Act requires casual traders to have a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and, if a local authority have designated casual trading areas, a permit to trade in the designated <Col N="521" /> area.  It is the Garda Síochána who, in the main, enforce the Act.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Casual Trading Act, 1980 has been in operation since 12 February 1981 and because difficulties have arisen in its enforcement, the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated in the Dáil on 5 December 1989 that a review of the Act should be undertaken and that the removal of the exemptions under section 2 of the Act, which defines the types of selling activities which are not covered by the Act, would be considered as part of this review.  In this connection all county councils, local authorities and relevant Government Departments have been consulted and, with the exception of a small number of local authorities, submissions have been received from all of these sources. Among the submissions which have been received are those from Carlow Urban District Council, Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny Corporation.  In addition, submissions have also been received from the Irish Hardware Association, the Casual Traders Association and the Dublin City Centre Business Association.  In the submissions received attention has been drawn to a number of difficulties in enforcing the Act and various constructive proposals have been made for amending it to resolve these difficulties.</P>
    <P>While there are a number of common features in the experience and comments offered by the local authorities, there are also some significant differences.  In drawing up proposals for reform to submit to Government we want, as far as possible, to accommodate these divergences as well as the common features.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and wish him well.  I want to impress on the Minister the fact that energetic, enthusiastic young entrepreneurs are being refused financial assistance for projects that could provide extra employment in job-starved rural areas.  There is a necessity for the Minister's Department and the Government to keep in touch with ordinary people. Many living in rural areas have very good ideas on ways and means of setting up <Col N="522" /> small industries in which countless numbers of people could be employed.  Each small industry created would have a job creation potential of between five or ten jobs, or perhaps up to 20 in some cases. Neither the Government nor the IDA are as yet prepared to give the necessary capital to get these projects off the ground, while countless millions can be given to foreigners to set up here.  They are also given tax incentives as sweeteners. Those who have unlimited finance will always get more.</P>
      <P>The target for the Government and the IDA must be to channel money towards those who have proven ideas in rural Ireland.  The emphasis must be directed to local people who come to the IDA seeking aid of £5,000 to £250,000 to finance worthwhile projects.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to this very important matter.  He knows the situation in County Cork.  I represent the three peninsular areas of the county which are job-starved and crying out for industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Sheehan for his good wishes.  This Government's primary goal is to bring about increased employment, greater wealth and higher living standards for all our citizens.  To do this we must have a strong internationally competitive industrial sector, allied to a positive business environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economy has come through a difficult period over the past 12 months.  The external environment continued to be hostile mainly due to the Gulf War and the recessions in the UK and US economies. In spite of these difficulties, real output of about 2 per cent was achieved in 1991.  While this level of growth will not generate significant employment nor resolve the other economic difficulties facing Ireland, it compares quite favourably with growth in most other European countries and especially in the United Kingdom.  Our strong export performance which, at £15 billion represents an increase in value of 4 per cent over 1990, demonstrates the continuing competitiveness of Irish industry which has <Col N="523" /> managed to increase its market share despite the difficult trading conditions.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to be able to say that, in the face of this demanding economic environment, the State industrial promotion agencies turned in a creditable performance by creating over 18,000 jobs last year, which substantially met the job creation target for manufacturing and internationally traded services industry which had been set under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The south-west region of the country continued its growth in manufacturing employment during 1991 with 1,868 first-time jobs being created in new and expanding IDA-backed companies, while a further 577 jobs were recovered in companies which in previous years had cut back their employment.  These new jobs more than offset total job losses, giving a modest increase of 150 in total manufacturing employment in the region.  The region benefited from a strong number of projects grant-approved during 1990.  Many of these companies started recruiting in 1991, including QC Data and Motorola in Cork city and Mitsumi in Mallow.  The year 1991 also saw a continued emphasis by the IDA south-west office on improving linkage between Irish-owned companies and the established original equipment manufacturers &mdash; companies like Walsh Western, Hoermann Electronics, Chip Electronics and BG Turnkey.  This continued to give valuable local employment by exploiting the many linkage opportunities with the larger companies in the region.</P>
    <P>The IDA are confident that 1992 will see a continued modest growth in manufacturing employment in the region. They have assured me that they will be making a concentrated effort, in co-operation with local communities, to help create employment opportunities in the more rural locations throughout the region.  The IDA have been to the forefront in decentralising functions and devolving powers to regional level in the <Col N="524" /> regionalisation of their small industry programme.  In fact, the regionalisation process commenced in 1983 with the setting up on a pilot basis of a regional small industry board in Cork.  Encouraged by the Cork regional board experience and as required by the 1984 White Paper on Industrial Policy, the IDA small industry programme was formally regionalised in 1985.  All the operational elements of the programme for promotion, through project negotiation and evaluation to grant payment and after-care was then decentralised to regional level.  This ensures that the IDA, together with other local bodies and community groups, can maximise the talents and strengths of individual regions.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that we have not enjoyed the same success with the development of Irish-owned firms as we have with foreign companies.  Most recently, the Industrial Policy Review Group, chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton, concluded that future employment growth and living standards will be severely constrained unless we succeed in developing a strong indigenous sector of industry. There is little doubt that our industries will face the most serious challenge they have ever known as the Single Market takes effect.  Therefore, one of the principal concerns in the years ahead must be to tackle the urgent need for Irish companies to grow and achieve the scale necessary to be successful in the new Europe.  If we are to generate jobs and wealth in Ireland we must build indigenous companies of sufficient quality, scale and strength to win and sustain profitable positions in international markets.  With a view to achieving this goal, the IDA will be concentrating their efforts both in the Cork region and throughout the country on supporting Irish companies, both big and small, who demonstrate a willingness and capability to inter-nationalise their businesses.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 1992.</P>

      <P>There is no EC Directive of 27 May 1988 governing free competition in telecommunications. I presume that the Deputies' questions refer to Directive No. 88/301/EEC of 16 May 1988, on competition in the markets for telecommunications terminal equipment.</P>

    <P>Liberalisation of this market was introduced with effect from 1 July 1990, whereupon Ireland became fully compliant with the Directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 37 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of the background to Ireland's application <Col N="270" /> for EC funding for mobile assets as explained by my predecessor in response to a similar question on 24 October 1991.</P>
    <P>Arising out of negotiations following submission of the National Development Plan 1989-1993 to the EC Commission on 22 March 1989, the Commission agreed that subject to the results of a feasibility study, investments in sea and air freight services might be considered.</P>
    <P>The Access Transport Study, completed in July 1990 by KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley on behalf of the Irish Government and the EC Commission, found that while investment in internal transport facilities was necessary, it was not sufficient to cater for Ireland's unique peripherality problems.  Substantial additional investment in access transport services was needed.</P>
    <P>In the Operational Programme on Peripherality published in November 1990, the Irish Government and EC Commission undertook to examine the conclusions of the study and possibilities for co-financing by the Community of the access transport investment measures identified by the consultants.</P>
    <P>Following detailed consideration of the consultants' findings by a high-level interdepartmental group, my predecessor made a formal application on behalf of the Government on 27 May 1991, for EC grant aid for mobile assets.  Both my predecessor and the previous Minister for the Marine held formal meetings with the relevant Commissioners to advance our application and to seek a favourable decision.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, a formal reply from the EC Commissioner for Regional Affairs received on 18 December last indicated that the Commission had rejected Ireland's application.  My predecessor replied to the Commissioner on 13 January 1992 expressing profound disappointment at the Commission's negative reaction.  He requested further discussion with the Commission in order to critically examine the basis of the Commission's decision and to seek to reverse it.  These discussions will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>More generally, major investments of <Col N="271" /> close on £150 million are taking place over the period 1989 to 1993 on projects coming within my responsibility under the Operational Programme on Peripherality. These include investments in the State and regional airports, regional public rail transport, rail freight and the further development of Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>These investments, together with the development of our roads and other commercial seaports under the peripherality programme, are designed to reduce the impact on the economy of Ireland's peripheral location and, in particular, to reduce the cost of internal and access transport.  The overall question of road infrastructure development within the peripherality programme is, of course, the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the House of my determination to ensure that the impetus created by these investments will continue and will be enhanced under the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>The frequency assigned to RTE in respect of Atlantic 252 is licensed under the terms of the general broadcasting licence issued under section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. Under the terms of the licence RTE are required to ensure that their broadcasting transmitters do not cause interference to Telecom Éireann plant or equipment or other apparatus licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts.  To the extent that interference is caused, RTE must bear the costs of eliminating it.  I have been informed by RTE that when the station commenced transmission in 1989 there were a large number of complaints of interference to telephone subscribers but that close co-operation between RTE and Telecom Éireann eliminated to a considerable degree any interference problems that arose.</P>
      <P>I understand that the number of interference complaints have dropped considerably and would not warrant consideration of revocation of the licence.</P>
      <P>The action to be taken in individual cases to resolve problems is a matter for RTE and Telecom Éireann.  I have no statutory responsibility in relation to the Electricity Supply Board or their work.</P>

      <P>A new digital cellular mobile radio telephone system known as GSM is just now emerging on world markets.</P>
      <P>This system, which was originally called group special mobile but was renamed global standard for mobile communications, in recognition of its potential in worldwide markets, will permit subscribers to use their mobile phones across Europe without technical difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the system was stimulated by EC initiatives in the form of a Council Recommendation of 25 June 1987 on the co-ordinated introduction of public pan-European cellular digital land-based mobile communications in the Community (87/371/EEC); a Council Directive of 25 June 1987 on the frequency <Col N="274" /> bands to be reserved for the new pan-European service (87/372/EEC); and a Council Resolution of 14 December 1990 on the final stage of the co-ordinated introduction of GSM (90/C 329/09).</P>
    <P>In addition a Memorandum of Understanding was signed in September 1987 by telecommunications organisations in 22 European countries, including all Community member states, which commits the signatories to a detailed timetable for the procurement of new networks and the opening of GSM services based on harmonised standards.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann signed this Memorandum of Understanding and are planning to launch a GSM service in 1993 with a phased roll out of national coverage.</P>

      <P>The late night services provided by Dublin Bus were monitored by the company by way of radio communications between control headquarters and the bus drivers and inspectors at the departure terminals.  In relation to both the Dublin Bus and PAMBO services in the Dublin area, officials of my Department observed and monitored their operation on a number of occasions.  In addition, PAMBO have indicated that a special management team which they established allocated two nightly dispatchers in Dublin and a key person in the provinces to oversee and report on the operation of the services by their members.</P>

      <P>This issue was not referred to in the revised Programme for Government, and her remarks have no relevance to or implications for any of the Government's continued commitments in the revised programme, which are in no way affected by the recent changes in the composition of the Government.</P>

      <P>I have not taken any steps to limit the importation of secondhand Japanese cars.  As all cars used in Ireland are imported, the question of limiting imports from any particular source does not arise.  In any event, Ireland's international trading obligations under GATT and EC preclude the unilateral introduction of restrictions on imports from any source.</P>
      <P>I am advised that imports of used Japanese cars account for about 2.5 per cent of the secondhand car market in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Part X of the Companies Act, 1990, which deals with accounts and audit, contains 24 sections.  Seventeen of the sections were commenced by the Companies Act, 1990 (Commencement) (No. 2) Order, S.I. No. 117 of 1991, with effect from 1 July 1991.  The seven sections that have yet to be commenced <Col N="286" /> deal primarily with qualifications of auditors and recognition of bodies of accountants.</P>
      <P>Section 191 dealing with the re-recognition of accountancy bodies for auditing purposes contains a three month time limit from its commencement within which decisions must be given.  Because of this time limit, and in advance of commencing the provisions, my Department have sought information from the five recognised bodies showing how they would see themselves meeting the specified requirements regarding entry and supervision.  Evaluation of the material submitted by the five bodies is now at an advanced stage and, provided it proves to be satisfactory, I envisage being able to commence the provisions in the near future.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report in the <i>Financial Times</i> referred to by the Deputy.  I am also aware that the UK Minister for Corporate Affairs, Mr. John Redwood, subsequently clarified the UK position on the Investment Services Directive in a letter to that newspaper.  He stated that the UK have always welcomed and encouraged proposals that promote more cross-border trade and open up Community markets to companies and individuals from other member states.  The UK, he said, consistently supported a market-opening investment services <Col N="290" /> directive and would support a compromise to secure such a directive.</P>
      <P>The draft directive aims to extend into the investment services area the approach already contained in the Second Banking Directive, enabling a firm to operate in any member state of the Community on the basis of authorisation by its home authority.  Such a directive is desirable in the interest of the general regulation of investment services, of providing market opportunities, and also in relation to safeguarding the interest of the smaller or non-institutional investor.  The draft is still under discussion.  Modifications are being sought to take account of market structures in smaller member states such as Ireland.</P>

      <P>The convergence programme for Ireland agreed at a meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 10 February 1992 is the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which has already been published.</P>
      <P>It was submitted in October 1991 in response to a decision at ECOFIN in July 1991 that member states should submit medium term adjustment programmes addressing the main convergence problems &mdash; prices and costs, public finances and external positions.</P>
      <P>At the February meeting, I updated Ministers on developments since the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was agreed, including the outturn on the 1991 budget and the targets and measures set out in the 1992 budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1988 the Government introduced the tax clearance system in respect of grants, subsidies and similar type payments from State and public authorities.  The basic aim of this system is to ensure that individuals who benefit from public grants or subsidies have their tax affairs in order.</P>
      <P>As from 1 September 1991, the tax clearance system was extended to include all grants and subsidies over £500, other than payments under the guarantee section of FEOGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of grants between £500 and £5,000 the applicant must indicate on his grant application the tax district dealing with his affairs, furnish his tax reference number and indicate that, to the best of his knowledge, his tax affairs are in order. <Col N="295" /> The requirement for an applicant for a grant to produce a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners applies only in the case of grants of £5,000 or more.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is more likely that taxpayers in the three categories referred to by the Deputy would be applicants for the smaller grants and, accordingly, would only have to comply with the simpler requirement.</P>
    <P>Any person who has ever made a tax return should be in possession of the relevant information.  If they have neither an outstanding tax debt nor a current tax liability they should have no difficulty with confirming that their tax affairs are in order.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Deputy is aware of any individual cases involving the categories of taxpayers referred to where difficulties have occurred, he should communicate with me so that I can have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>The employee (PAYE) allowance was introduced to provide special relief for the ordinary PAYE worker.  It was not extended to spouses or children working in the family firm, because they cannot be regarded as on a par with ordinary employees as regards such factors as securing the employment in the first instance, the conditions of employment, the likelihood of advancement and security of tenure.  In addition, exclusion from the allowance was considered necessary in order to prevent the setting up of artificial employments solely in order to benefit from the allowance.  I have no plans <Col N="296" /> to change the present arrangements regarding the PAYE allowance for the category of person mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Aherne)</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners the work of staff members who are on maternity leave or other leave is dealt with by a redistribution of the work or a reassignment of staff within the area in question.</P>
      <P>However, in the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes, where staff members have individual allocations of cases some unions have operated a course of action, the effect of which is as follows.  When a staff member leaves an area for any reason and is not replaced the remaining staff will not cover for or accept a reallocation of the work of that officer except when they have no personal arrears of post or if overtime is sanctioned to carry out that work.</P>
      <P>The effect of this varies for area to area and from time to time &mdash; at present there are not material arrears arising from this action.  When this action is ongoing the inspector prioritises the unhandled items to alleviate hardship.  Overall the effect of this action is not widespread because it is not rigidly enforced by the unions in all areas.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners are currently engaged in intensive negotiations with the unions concerned to introduce a major restructuring in the Office of the Chief Inspector of Taxes which, <i>inter alia</i>, will resolve this issue.</P>

      <P>Through the Operational Programme on Peripherality the Government, in conjunction with the EC Commission, are helping to fund port developments including a ro-ro terminal project at Dublin Port.</P>
      <P>That development, in conjunction with the reorganisation of Dublin Port's dock labour arrangements, will help bring back a proportion of the ro-ro traffic using Northern Ireland ports which would be better served by a cheaper and more efficient central corridor operation.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the above developments I hope shortly to be considering the report of the review group set up to examine and make recommendations on commercial harbours and pilotage policy and legislation.</P>

      <P>Specialist investigation and treatment services for persons who have been sexually assaulted or raped are available at the Sexual Assault Unit, Rotunda Hospital, Dublin.  The unit provides facilities for the effective collection and processing of forensic evidence and a structured environment for the examination and treatment of victims of sexual assault and rape.  This service is designed primarily to meet the needs of the population within the functional area of the Eastern Health Board but is available, where necessary, to persons resident in other health board areas.  Victims of sexual assault and rape outside the Eastern Health Board would, of course, have access to local general hospital services for medical examination and treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of child and adolescent victims of sexual assault and rape, investigation and treatment facilities are in operation at specialist units located in the <Col N="326" /> Children's Hospital, Temple Street and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, Dublin.  Outside the Eastern Health Board area a special allocation was made during 1988 to each of the other seven health boards for the purpose of establishing appropriate services in their respective areas.  Services are now in place in each health board.</P>
    <P>Following medical assessment and treatment in the immediate aftermath of sexual assault and rape, victims, including those who become pregnant as a result of rape, are referred to support services, both statutory and voluntary, for on-going counselling and support to deal with the trauma of the assault.  Multi-disciplinary teams of health professionals in each health board area provide the necessary psychological support services for victims.</P>
    <P>In the area of services provided by voluntary bodies, I recognise, in particular, the valuable contribution of rape crisis centres throughout the country in the support and counselling of victims of rape and sexual abuse.  State funding of £152,000 for the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and £25,000 for each of the five rape crisis centres located in Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Clonmel has been allocated for 1992 to ensure that the valuable work being carried out by the centres is continued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my Department's comprehensive AIDS education strategy the Health Promotion Unit has already distributed almost 400,000 copies of this information leaflet on AIDS.  The leaflet has been distributed to pharmacies, health centres, voluntary agencies working in the AIDS area and directly to <Col N="328" /> members of the public.  It is generally regarded as an accessible, credible and readable document which gives down-to-earth basic information in a straightforward manner.</P>
    <P>In relation to information on contraception the Deputy will be aware that the Health (Family Planning Amendment) Bill, 1991 is due to be considered by the House during the current session.

      <P>The Irish Sudden Infant Death Association (ISIDA) publishes, with the assistance of the Health Promotion Unit of my Department, a handbook of information on cot death and bereavement.  This booklet called &ldquo;A precious past &mdash; A hopeful future&rdquo; was compiled with the help of experts in the field of coping with bereavement following a child's death.</P>
      <P>The ISIDA also offers a support service which is strictly confidential and is provided by parents who have themselves experienced the feelings of grief, loss and isolation following the death of their child.  This service is available on an individual or couple to couple basis in addition to a 24 hour a day telephone help line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 a grant of £24,500 was made from the national lottery funds to the ISIDA, and further grants of £23,000 are committed in both 1992 and 1993 towards the cost of establishing a national register of cot deaths.  This register will form a valuable data base for research into the <Col N="329" /> problem.  Counselling and support for bereaved parents is provided in maternity units through the medical, nursing and social work service and this is supplemented by the local public health nurse service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary responsibility for obtaining relevant background medical information on children being placed for <Col N="330" /> adoption rests with the adoption agencies, which operate under the aegis of the Adoption Board.</P>
    <P>The detailed guidelines on adoption procedures issued by the board to the agencies make it clear that the prospective adoptive parents must be made aware prior to the placement of the child with them of any factors in the child's background which might have medical implications.  The board consider it essential that this be done in order to ensure that the couple's decision to adopt the child is an informed decision.  In cases where there is a health problem the board require written confirmation from the agency that the prospective adopters have been made aware of this and are accepting of the position.  It is not uncommon in such cases for the agency to arrange for the couple to consult expert medical personnel for the purpose of ensuring that they fully understand the condition and the possible long term implications for both themselves and the child.</P>
    <P>Where an adopted person requires information from the adoption records relating to him or her for medical reasons, it is the practice of the adoption agency concerned to arrange for its medical adviser to transmit such information as is available to the adopted person's doctor.</P>

      <P>For the past few years my Department have made a special additional allocation available to the South-Eastern Health Board specifically for the development of adult dental services for medical card holders.  The special additional allocation provided in 1991 for this purpose was £285,000 and the board's allocation for 1992 includes a repeat of this special provision for the continuing development of the adult dental services.</P>
      <P>These special allocations have enabled the board to provide an additional 478 adult treatments in 1990 and an additional 938 adult treatments in 1991 in Wexford.  The total number of adults treated in County Wexford in 1991 was 4,510.</P>
      <P>The issue of authorisations for adult treatments in the Wexford area was scaled down by the board during mid-1991 because of overrun in the specific provisions made by the board for adult treatments and treatment for pain, sepsis and emergency cases only was provided.</P>
      <P>My Department are however engaged with the board in a review of the services and discussions are currently being held on the board's proposals for the development of the adult dental services in 1992.</P>

      <P>It is an offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1987, to use or take possession of a mechanically propelled vehicle without the consent of the owner or other lawful authority.  A person found guilty of such an offence is liable, (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment; or (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £2,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I am advised that at present a penalty of £1,000 is considered to be the maximum which can reasonably be applied on summary conviction in relation to the trial of offences in the District Court.  I have no immediate proposals to provide for increased penalties where there is a conviction on indictment in the Circuit Court but I will keep the position in this regard under review.</P>
      <P>I understand that the law on larceny also applies to car theft and that legislation in this area was significantly updated and improved by the Larceny Act, 1990.  This introduced a new, standard penalty of up to ten years imprisonment for larceny, created a new offence of handling stolen goods and updated the law on the possession of implements intended for use in larceny. The courts were also given power to impose fines on persons found guilty of these offences, in addition to or in substitution for any term of imprisonment.</P>

      <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, provide that a person shall not cause or permit polluting matter to enter ground waters; these Acts also make the discharge of trade effluent or sewage effluent to ground waters subject to licensing by the relevant local authority.  Small volumes of domestic sewage discharged from septic tanks or other disposal units by means of percolation areas or soakage pits are exempt from this licensing requirement.</P>
      <P>All water used for human consumption, from whatever source, must be monitored regularly in accordance with the requirements of the Drinking Water Regulations, 1988.  Water quality monitoring generally, and the instigation of enforcement and appropriate remedial action in the event of pollution, is a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern being expressed in Border areas such as north Louth, regarding the infra-red high technology beams being used by the British army authorities in their observation posts north of the Border; if he will confirm that he will take this matter up with the British authorities in order to have these fears allayed, particularly the concern over the danger to health and animals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the concern which has been expressed about possible health hazards arising from equipment used at these installations.  The matter has been raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.  They deny that the equipment used in these installations emits harmful radiation.</P>
      <P>Our own experts in these matters, who have knowledge of the type of equipment used in the observation posts, have examined this issue.  I understand that the Nuclear Energy Board have stated that no harmful radiation is emitted by this equipment.  Moreover, I understand that the Department of Health are not aware of any epidemiological evidence (i.e., evidence of a pattern of health problems) which would show that this equipment gives rise to health hazards.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated that the search for political progress in relation to Northern Ireland is a major priority of this Government.  He will be exploring with the British Prime Minister at their meeting tomorrow ways in which both Governments might advance this objective.</P>
      <P>For my part, as Joint Chairman of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, I hope to use to the full the procedures established under the Anglo-Irish agreement to ensure recognition and respect for the rights and identities of the two communities in Northern Ireland and the right of each to pursue its aspirations by peaceful means, as well as to develop practical measures of co-operation which will be to the benefit of both communities and both parts of Ireland.  I look forward to a first meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland tomorrow and to a meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference in the near future.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government has been to support the process of round-table talks in three strands based on the three key relationships involved.  We will avail of every opportunity open to us to encourage political dialogue on this basis.</P>
      <P>In our efforts to promote political agreement we also attach great importance to the fullest possible contact with leaders of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and I had a wide-ranging discussion with the SDLP on 24 February, covering all aspects of the current situation in Northern Ireland, including the prospect for political dialogue.  We have also indicated publicly our readiness to meet representatives of the Unionist parties of Northern Ireland at any time and in any venue of their choosing.</P>

      <P>The necessary finance has been provided in the 1992 Estimates and arrangements have now been made, subject to the approval of the Government Contracts Committee, to instal enhanced computer systems and equipment this year as part of the Department's information technology plan relating to headage/premium payments and animal movement control.</P>
      <P>The current backlog of payments is not, however, a question of technology alone.  Present arrears of headage payments, for example, arise mainly from the need to verify and process applications from farmers newly admitted to the disadvantaged areas scheme as a result of the large extension granted by the EC last year.  Overtime is being worked in the local offices affected and these arrears are expected to be cleared in the next month.</P>
      <P>As regard EC premium payments, considerable inroads into the arrears of payment under the special beef premium scheme have been made in the past week and further progress is expected when the report of the departmental task force comes to hand next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> Deputies will recall that the Task Force was set up in January to address the particular problems under the 1991 special beef premium scheme, to make all headage and premium application forms more user-friendly in future and to recommend further ways of speeding up payments under the disadvantaged areas and EC premium schemes.</P>

The results of an agricultural census carried <Col N="373" /> out in 1991 which will provide considerable data on the farming sector are expected to be available in the autumn of this year.  The best indication of the number of young people who take up farming on a full-time or part-time basis is to be obtained from a survey of young farm entrants carried out by Teagasc in 1990.  This found that of 2,100 people who that year took up farming other than as employees, 63 per cent were school leavers engaging in farming on a full-time basis, 25 per cent were school leavers taking up farming on a part-time basis only and 12 per cent were adults who had been employed outside the farming sector and were at that point entering farming in either a full-time or a part-time capacity.</P>

      <P>The amnesty from prosecution to which the Deputy refers operated in the context of special control of abuse measures which were introduced by my Department last year.  The purpose of the amnesty was to give an opportunity to employers who had not met their PRSI obligations, and to others who were wrongfully in receipt of social welfare payments, to come forward and put their affairs in order.</P>
      <P>The collection of PRSI arrears is primarily a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not possible to separately identify from other PRSI receipts the amounts collected by or remitted to the Revenue Commissioners directly as a result of the amnesty provision.</P>
      <P>However, I am satisfied that the amnesty did contribute in a substantial way to the success of the special control measures operated by my Department last year.</P>

      <P>Nationally is not a condition for entitlement to unemployment assistance under Irish legislation.  Any person resident in Ireland who satisfies the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance is entitled to payment.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to social assistance in other countries is determined under the legislation of the country concerned. European Community Regulations on social security for persons moving within the Community do not cover social assistance schemes.  Proposals to bring such schemes within the scope of the regulations have been agreed by the Council of Ministers and will come into effect later this year.  Under the regulation nationality conditions for schemes of unemployment assistance will no longer apply where the person concerned is a national of an EC member state.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on unemployment benefit and assistance amounted to £830.2 million in 1991.  This consisted of £227.95 million on unemployment benefit and £605.25 million on unemployment assistance.  Unemployment payments now account for 27 per cent of total expenditure on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total expenditure on unemployment payments is determined by the numbers claiming and the rates of payment which they receive.  During 1991, the numbers on the live register averaged 254,000 an increase of 29,300 over 1990.  At the same time, the payment rates were increased by up to 11 per cent, which is well in <Col N="396" /> excess of the rate of inflation.  For example, in July 1991, a couple with four children dependent on short term unemployment assistance received an increase of 9.2 per cent in the rate applicable to them.  The Government are committed to achieving by 1993 the priority rates of payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, and this is contributing to substantial increases in expenditure on unemployment payments.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension of £19.00 per week.  Following annual increases since 1987 in his means, derived from a British retirement pension, his current means have been assessed as being between £56 and £58 a week.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, he is now only entitled to an Irish old age (non-contributory) pension at the rate of £3 per week.  In view of the pensioner's age, it has been decided that the reduction should only take place from a current date.  He will be entitled to an additional allowance of £4.20 a week with effect from 24 April 1992 when he reaches 80 years of age.</P>
      <P>The rules relating to the assessment of means are set out in social welfare legislation and the deciding officer has no effective discretion in cases of this nature. However, if the person is dissatisfied, he should apply to the independent social welfare appeals officer for a review.</P>

      <P>The assessment of any benefit or privilege such as board and lodging in the family home has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between those claimants who have this benefit and those who have not.</P>
      <P>The value of board and lodging to an applicant living at home is assessed by reference to the parent's net income while taking account of the number of non-earning members of the household.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Deputy has in mind the case of a single person whose means, on review, were increased from £17.80 to £22.70 per week arising from the increased rate of retirement pension received by his parents.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the special circumstances of this case I arranged for the level of means assessed to be examined again by a deciding officer who, having reviewed the overall situation has determined that the assessment should be reduced to £3.50 per week.</P>
