      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy John Bruton and Deputy De Rossa.  I observe that the notices relate to the same subject matter and I propose to call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I now call on Deputy John Bruton to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the nature of the contact between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the High Court appointed inspectors into the Greencore Company in view of the fact that any contact by a Minister with appointees of the courts, other than through the court, was inherently improper because there should be no interference by the Executive in the courts; (b) the disclaimer issued last night by one inspector of any interference was subsequently stated by the other inspector not to have been issued on his behalf. These matters require urgent clarification of a kind that can only be forthcoming in an extended debate under Standing <Col N="1658" /> Order 30 and which cannot be fully dealt with either by brief statements without notice or by Dáil questions.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I request leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the conflicting statements issued by the two High Court appointed inspectors into the Greencore affair regarding allegations of political interference by a Government Minister with their work, the potential damage to public confidence in the inspector system by this controversy and the need for steps to be taken urgently to clarify the matter including, if necessary, requesting the High Court to investigate the allegations. These are urgent matters and the Dáil needs to deal with them today.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be one contemplated by Standing Order 30.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motions.  However, I can tell the House that I received notice that statements would be made on this matter after the Order of Business and, accordingly, the Dáil will discuss the matter today.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave now.</P>

      <P>There are a number of points I wish to make in relation to the orders which are being sought to be made this morning.  It seems extraordinary that only after two Deputies in this House sought the adjournment of the House under Standing Order 30 that the Government decided to provide time for ten-minute statements and ten minutes for the Minister to reply.  I believe it would be a mistake for this House to assume that the public will be satisfied with this House dealing with a major issue in such a shorthanded fashion.  The fact that the Government proposed time for the making of statements this morning without consultation with any of the parties in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can possibly be in the circumstances.  I have received two Orders of Business, one which I received at approximately 10.15 a.m. which contained no reference at all to statements being made in the House and the other which I received as <Col N="1661" /> I sat in the House before the Government came into the House.  The point I am making is that we are being asked to agree to the making of statements on an important issue without any consultation on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed that item No. 4 shall be decided without debate.  It may be that that item, an amendment to the Merchant Shipping Bill, was well and truly debated in the Seanad, but I have no idea at this stage whether this amendment is going to be agreed to by the Government or whether it is going to be defeated, nor have I any idea what the Government's views are on it.  It has not been debated in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say something to the House in regard to this matter.  I had indicated to the Chair early this morning before I was aware of any other motion in this regard, my intention to make a statement in the House.  I am anxious to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>Some confusion arose last night as a result of a statement which, I understand, was issued very late last night by a solicitor on behalf of one of the inspectors, Mr. Foley, in which he states that he did not speak to any journalists and disputes various references that were made to him in that connection.  He states that the statement issued by his joint inspector was not issued by or on behalf of Ciaran Foley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> The first point I want to make in regard to Mr. Foley is that I have never met Mr. Foley.  I have never spoken to Mr. Foley. Any dealings or conversations that I have had with the inspectorate were with Mr. Barry and Mr. Barry only, as Mr. Foley apparently did not wish to have any conversation with me in regard to the question of cost.  He dealt with another member of the Government in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice. Therefore, any relevant discussions with the inspectorate were with Mr. Barry only; they were the only discussions I had with the inspectorate.  The fact speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>During yesterday's supplementary questions Deputy Spring suggested that I might contact the inspectorate.  As the House will recall, I demurred from doing that personally but said that I would invite the secretary of my Department to do so.  The secretary did that and, for the information of the House, I shall read out the secretary's note of the conversation he had when phoning the inspectorate yesterday:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister informed the Dáil at about 4.00 p.m. on 4 March 1992 that he would arrange for the Secretary to contact the Inspectors to inquire whether any documentation existed in bank vaults or elsewhere in relation <Col N="1665" /> to the alleged interference with the Inspectors' investigation.</P>
    <P>The Secretary immediately rang Mr. Aidan Barry, one of the Inspectors, informed him of the Minister's statement and asked him if any such documentation existed.  Mr. Barry immediately responded that there was no such documentation because there was no interference.  He wished however to speak to his fellow Inspector before formally responding to the question.  Mr. Barry also said that he was greatly concerned at the allegations which had been made and he had drafted a Press Release for issue categorically denying any interference with the conduct, direction or findings of the investigation.  Mr. Barry said that he would contact his fellow Inspector immediately and revert to the Secretary.</P>
    <P>Mr. Barry rang back about 4.30 p.m. and said he was awaiting the arrival of Mr. Foley from the Law Library. While the position he had stated earlier was clear cut, he wanted his colleague to formally agree it before responding to the question put to them.  He added that he himself would issue the statement he had prepared on behalf of the Inspectorate if, for any reason, Mr. Foley did not want to sign it.</P>
    <P>The Secretary spoke to Mr. Barry again at 5.15 p.m. to enquire about the position.  Mr. Barry said he was finalising his statement for issue; Mr. Foley had informed him that he did not wish to sign any statement for legal reasons; the statement would however, be on behalf of the Inspectorate said Mr. Barry.  Although he was unable to formally agree the matter with Mr. Foley, Mr. Barry said he was able to confirm on behalf of the Inspectorate that no documents existed in bank vaults in relation to the alleged interference with the conduct of the investigation.  The only documents which had been placed in bank vaults had been copies of the Interim and Final Reports and related discs. <Col N="1666" /> The only documents which existed in relation to any contact which the Minister had with the Inspectors were short notes which Mr. Barry himself had prepared setting out the substance of contacts with the Minister when the Minister had expressed his concern about the duration and cost of the investigation.  Mr. Barry said that although the Minister was hard on the Inspectors in relation to these matters, the Minister was within his rights in raising the issues and Mr. Barry did not consider the Minister's comments in any way improper or in any way an interference with the conduct of the investigation, its direction, or its findings. Mr. Barry was, therefore, fully satisfied to say that no doucmentation existed in relation to interference by the Minister or any other Minister or member of the Oireachtas because no such interference of the type alleged in relation to the direction or findings of the investigation had occurred.  Mr. Barry said that he believed that Mr. Foley would also take this view although he was not prepared to agree to a formal statement.</P>
    <P>During yesterday's Question Time I replied to a supplementary question asked by Deputy Gay Mitchell in the following way and I quote from the unrevised script of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>There was no interference other than proper inquiries relating to cost, the structure and the duration of the investigation.</P>
    <P>My use of the word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; yesterday had been taken by a journalist who feels that he has a mission in this regard to mean that in some respect I tried to influence the result or findings of the report of the investigation.  Of course, that is not so.  The word &ldquo;structure&rdquo; was intended to convey the physical arrangements that were made &mdash; the office arrangements and the number of staff engaged.  That is clear from the context because the words &ldquo;the structure&rdquo; appear after the word &ldquo;cost&rdquo; and before the words &ldquo;the duration of the investigation&rdquo;. <Col N="1667" /> The structure of the investigation is what I referred to.  I made no reference to the structure of the report, as has since been alleged.</P>
    <P>A number of allegations were repeated by the journalist concerned last night on an RTE programme, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;. At least formally, I want to repudiate them again, lest it be said that on the repetition I did not repudiate them.  I repudiate them in the same terms as I did yesterday.</P>
    <P>So far as the costs and duration of this matter are concerned, the fees issue was not a matter of concern to me alone, as Minister for Industry and Commerce. The fees payable were first discussed by the Government on 1 October 1991 when the Minister for Justice briefed the Government on the matter.  The Government were greatly concerned at the cost and asked me to pursue the matter.  I was not present at that meeting and I did not bring up the question of cost.  I was in the United States on IDA business at that time.  On my return the Government's expression of concern was conveyed to me.  The issue was again discussed by the Government on 22 October and 12 December, before the statement was made on my behalf in the High Court on 13 December, when I informed the Government of the difficulties that were arising.  Therefore, the Government considered the matter on several occasions. In fact, when one of the inspectors declined to discuss the matter with me, the Government made a formal decision to delegate the powers of the Minister for Justice under section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990, to me.  The Minister for Justice wrote me a letter to that effect, which letter I passed on to the inspectors. The two inspectors were not prepared to discuss the matter with me, one of them was.</P>
    <P>As I told the House yesterday, and as I have said publicly, I have had several &mdash; in fact, numerous &mdash; discussions with that inspector.  Those discussions were solely related to the question of the cost and the duration of the inquiry and to my concerns and the Government's concerns <Col N="1668" /> collectively, the Government having considered the matter on several occasions.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I should now go to the High Court and get an order from the High Court to either allow or force one of the inspectors to make a statement.  I am advised legally that I have no power to do that, that it is entirely a matter for the inspector concerned to go and make such application himself if he wants the protection of the High Court in that regard.  He is free to do so.  I now invite him to do so if he so wishes.  His fellow inspector did not consider that necessary and was able to make a statement yesterday.  I might add in regard to that statement that I did not ask him to do so, nor did the Secretary of my Department ask him to do so; he did it freely of his own will.</P>
    <P>In regard to the implications sought to be put on this matter, I think that from what I said yesterday, from what I am saying this morning, from the fact that I have never at any time to the best of my knowledge, met Mr. Ciaran Foley have never had any conversation with him, either personally, on the telephone or otherwise.  My communications with the other inspector on the question of cost are self evidently perfectly proper.  There was no attempt or interference whatever with the conduct of the inquiry or with any findings they might come to.  I want to make that abundantly clear.  I spoke yesterday of my record in this respect.  I stand over that.  I invite the House to support me in that because all the public and private evidence does support me in that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>It was entirely improper of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have any contact whatsoever with either of the inspectors.  The fact that he did so, and has now admitted that he did so frequently, to my mind shows that this Minister has no understanding of the proper relationship between the courts of this country and the Executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to quote from the relevant legislation which establishes inspection of companies, that is section 8 (1) of the Companies Act, 1990, which the Minister <Col N="1669" /> for Industry and Commerce brought through the House in its Final Stages.  It states:</P>
    <P>... the court may on the application of the Minister appoint one or more competent inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such manner as the court shall direct, if the court is satisfied ...</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from that subsection that anything concerning the manner of the report is a matter for the court to direct. For a Minister, a member of the Executive, to get on directly to any inspector, given that that is clearly established by this House as a function of the court, not of the Minister, is entirely wrong.  In my view it shows that a Minister who could make such a serious misjudgment has not the proper undertaking required of somebody to hold the high office that he holds.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, the Minister has expressed some concern about the expenses.  It is absolutely clear also from section 13 of the Companies Act, 1990, that the matter of the expenses shall be defrayed in the first instance by the Minister for Justice.  Therefore, if there was to be any approach about expenses it should be a matter for the Minister for Justice to make that approach to the court, not to the inspectors. Any interference with the inspectors, if it was to be proper, had to be made by the Executive, in open court, to the court, where all parties affected by the inspection would have the right to object to whatever constraint or otherwise the Minister was seeking to place on the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Minister's inquiries concerning a reduction in the cost of this matter could well have prejudiced the interests of some of the people being investigated by preventing the inspectors <Col N="1670" /> from taking the time and the expense to investigate and interview the former Taoiseach, who was not interviewed in this matter.  Perhaps they felt that that would be too costly for them to undertake and they did not do so.  Perhaps they felt that the Minister's pressure on them suggested that they should limit their inquiry unduly.  If that was the case, clearly any such pressure should have been exercised in open court where everybody affected would have had an opportunity to question the correctness of the Minister's inquiries.  But the spectacle of a Minister telephoning an inspector whom he happened to know personally quite well previously and talking to him about work that he is doing, clearly for the court, is entirely improper. I am shocked that the Minister should have done this.  He has admitted in this House that he did it.  However, he has not told us how frequently he did it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question: is it the case that in fact the Minister telephoned the inspectors when they were actually in the middle of interviewing one of the people whom they were charged to interview and that they had to come away from the interview to answer the Minister's telephone call?  I should like to ask the Minister: what did the inspector mean when he said that the Minister was &ldquo;hard on him&rdquo; in regard to the matter?  What business had a member of the Government being hard on anybody appointed by and responsible to the court?  If this practice is allowed to continue we could have circumstances prevail soon in which Ministers would telephone judges to ask them to make a particular decision in regard to a particular case.  To my mind that is an inappropriate crossing of the line clearly set out in the Constitution of 1937 which delimits the responsibilities of the Executive as against those of the courts.  The whole basis of our Constitution is that there is an absolute separation of powers between the courts and the Executive.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that a Minister who was responsible for putting this legislation on the Statute Book, who is himself a lawyer and understands the Constitution, should <Col N="1671" /> ever contemplate telephoning an inspector in these circumstances, particularly when it was an inspector whom he knew personally previously in other capacities. Clearly, it was placing that inspector in an entirely invidious and false position. We now have a public admission from that inspector that, in the inspector's words, the Minister was &ldquo;hard on him&rdquo;. What business had the Minister being hard on an inspector who was responsible to the courts?</P>
    <P>I note that the other inspector said that for &ldquo;legal reasons&rdquo; he would not join in that statement.  What were those legal reasons?  Is it perhaps the case that the other inspector, Mr. Foley, had a proper understanding of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, and knew that any telephone call or request from a member of the Executive to somebody responsible to the courts was inherently improper and therefore he would not respond to it?</P>
    <P>I would like to know who authorised Mr. Barry to issue the statement he issued last evening?  Did he obtain the permission of the High Court to issue that statement, because it seems to me that Mr. Barry also acted in an entirely improper way in issuing a statement at the behest of the Executive without the permission of the court, because it is clear from section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, that the conduct of the inspectors is a matter for the court, not for friends ringing up one another, one of whom happens to be an inspector of the court and another who happens to be a Minister of the Executive.</P>
    <P>I just do not understand it.  I just do not understand how this could happen.  I have been involved, as has the Minister, more than other Members of this House in the drafting of this legislation.  We decided deliberately &mdash; and there were several Ministers involved in this &mdash; that in future inspectors to companies would no longer be appointed by Ministers but by the court.  The House made that decision for good reason &mdash; to establish a proper distance between the Executive, the court and the inspector.  Here we have <Col N="1672" /> a situation in which the Minister who was intimately involved in drafting this legislation blatantly breaches it in the course of the first such inspection.  We need a much more detailed investigation of this matter than anything that has been forthcoming so far.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know if the Taoiseach in his capacity as Minister for Finance had any contact with any of the inspectors.  Did they approach him when he was Minister for Finance about phone calls they had been receiving from the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Did he receive any representations to the effect that those phone calls represented pressure of a kind that they did not welcome? I would like a statement on that matter from the Taoiseach.  I have no doubt that it will be forthcoming if such calls were made.  If they were not made, I will accept the Taoiseach's denial.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know how many times, in what circumstances and at what times did the Minister talk to the inspector who was prepared, improperly, to take his calls?  How long did those calls last?  Did the inspector report to the court the fact that he had received those calls? How much did the inspector who took those calls receive in fees?  Does this inspector understand the meaning of section 8 of the Companies Act, which clearly states that the direction and costs of this inquiry are a matter for the court and not for the Minister?  I wonder how an inspector who has apparently so little understanding &mdash; as little indeed as the Minister has &mdash; of section 8 of the Companies Act could be accepted as somebody who has a proper understanding of the Companies Acts with regard to other matters he is investigating.</P>

      <P>We would not want to lose sight of what we are trying to achieve this morning due to the confusion that has arisen in the last 48 hours in relation to statements made inside and outside this House.  The last 12 hours have compounded the confusion that existed prior to the Special Notice Questions yesterday. The procedure by the Government this morning in changing the Order <Col N="1673" /> of Business after the time when we should have had the Order of Business in this House leaves me equally confused. Obviously, the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, has a number of ways of addressing this House in relation to personal statements and otherwise.</P>
      <P>The facts, despite being confusing, are quite simple.  In the course of the replies yesterday, the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, was very adamant that he did not in any sense interfere with the conduct of the inquiry; but, as he repeated this morning, he discussed on a number of occasions the whole question of the cost, the structure and duration of the inquiry.  We need to focus on this, and perhaps the Minister would address his mind to what he was actually talking about at that time.  An attempt was made to clean up the confusion in relation the Minister's bona fides in relation to this and what happened after the discussion in the House yesterday, because I thought it was a worthwhile suggestion that we attempt to clear up the confusion.  But it was extraordinary that we had a statement from one inspector.  Obviously we are not privy to what went on between the inspectors in the preparation of that statement and the confusion which arose later when it was said that the statement was on behalf of both inspectors.  The statement last night that was carried from Mr. Foley's solicitor, that the statement had not been issued by him or on behalf of Mr. Foley, has certainly added to the confusion that we were discussing yesterday afternoon.  It gave rise to questioning the Minister's credibility in relation to what had been happening in the course of yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the Minister has stated certain things, we need a lot more detail in relation to the Ministers conduct with the inspectors, or, as it appears, with one inspector.  Obviously there had to be some contact at the start of the inquiry, but perhaps the Minister could give us more detail in relation to the original contact.  Who on behalf of the Government made the contact?  Was it the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Industry and Commerce who made the contact in <Col N="1674" /> relation to the setting up of an inspectorate? Who made the appointments?  Did discussions take place prior to the appointments in relation to the costs, or was this something that was a matter of negotiations for a long period of time afterwards? Did other Ministers meet with Mr. Foley when he was not meeting with Minister O'Malley?  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, would give us an outline, if not all the details available, in relation to the amount of contact with Inspector Barry in the course of the inquiry.  Was the Minister not aware of the dangers inherent in contact, if, as it appears, contacts were made on the telephone on numerous occasions with Mr. Aidan Barry, whom the Minister will have known in another capacity?  Mr. Barry is quoted by the Minister, as saying that the Minister was hard on him, but it was not interference.  What does that mean?  In relation to the Companies Act, the Minister was acting beyond his brief after the initial matters had been settled.  I see no reason why there should have been numerous conversations with Mr. Barry, as there appears to have been, when the inspectors were being appointed by the court and were inspectors responsible to the court going about their duty.</P>
    <P>It emerged this morning that the Government considered these matters on 1 October, 22 October and 12 December. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, would enlighten the House as to the purpose of those discussions at Cabinet and were the Cabinet <i>in toto</i> not aware of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1990, that the inspectors were acting for the court and had no responsibility to the Minister or to the Cabinet at large?  Was the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, acting at all times with the knowledge and consent of his ministerial colleagues in relation to the contacts made?  Did the Minister's ministerial colleagues in both parties in Government know the number of phone calls and the amount of contact which the Minister was having with one of the inspectors charged with reporting to the High Court?  There is need for greater clarification of these matters.</P>
    <P>On the question of structure, perhaps <Col N="1675" /> the Minister could give us some indication of what he was talking about.  I find it extremely unusual for a Minister to give directions to one of two inspectors appointed as to how the structure of a report should be formulated.  That should be clarified.  The Minister gave a clear indication to Mr. Foley that he should make a statement.  The Minister said that he has no legal basis for going to the High Court.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on what legal advice was available to him that made him come to that conclusion this morning?  The Minister had a legal basis for applying to the court when he had concerns in relation to these matters.  The Minister still has the authority to go back to the court, because this confusion must be cleared up once and for all.  We are dealing with a matter for which there are no precedents.  I cannot see any prohibition on the Minister from seeking clarification in relation to any aspect of the report.  A serious cloud still persists in relation to the conduct of the inquiry and that is in nobody's interests. I thought it could have been cleared up last night.  It has not been.  If the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, is not in a position to clarify to this House the number of contacts and the methods by which they were made with one of the inspectors, that cloud will remain.  The Minister has an opportunity to remove that cloud and he should take it right now.</P>

      <P>My view on this issue is that the integrity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is beyond reproach.  However, it may be that as a result of a Cabinet decision the Minister took actions which in retrospect he may not have taken had he given it greater consideration.  The question as to whether the Cabinet have the right to transfer the powers of the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to the structuring of costs for this report is doubtful.  I do not think they have that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that this issue has arisen primarily because it draws attention completely away from the Greencore <Col N="1676" /> report and the findings and scope of the report which this House should be debating rather than what is essentially an unsupported allegation by one journalist.  The fact that this allegation has given rise to this controversy is not unexpected, given the nature of the Greencore controversy and the way in which this affair has taken another bizarre twist.  It has been an extraordinary episode in the political life of this State from the viewpoint of either political parties or commercial life.</P>
    <P>We all had hoped that the publication of the Greencore report would finally bring to a satisfactory conclusion a series of events which have left a whole range of questions unanswered.  The allegation that the Minister had sought to exert pressure was first made by a journalist in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 4 February 1992 and it was again repeated by the same journalist on RTE.  It seems that the allegations are very tenuous given that neither of the inspectors involved referred to any such pressure in their report.  If they were brought under undue pressure of an improper nature by this Minister, or indeed any other Minister I think it would have been appropriate to refer to that in the body of their report on Greencore and have the matter brought to the attention of the courts. The journalist who wrote the original story vigorously repeated the allegations on the television programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on Tuesday last and suggested the inspectors had lodged written statements outlining their allegations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, answered Private Notice Questions from myself and others yesterday and I noted his denial and said then there was no reason to disbelieve him and I still see no reason to disbelieve the Minister.  When I heard the statement issued by Mr. Barry last night claiming to speak on behalf of both inspectors in which he stated categorically that no member of the Oireachtas or Government sought to influence the inspectors as to the scope of the inquiry or the nature of its findings, I felt this was a categorical denial and <Col N="1677" /> that it would bring the matter to an end. However, the later statement by Mr. Foley in which he said that the first statement was not issued on his behalf and, by implication, and only by implication, he did not agree with it, has opened the matter up again and consequently it must be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The media have given credence to the view that Mr. Foley's denial of the statement issued by Mr. Barry lends credence to the allegation of interference.  This is an implication that Mr. Foley has neither confirmed nor denied and it is incumbent on him to clarify what precisely his position is.  Indeed, I support the Minister in appealing to both inspectors to go back to the court and have the matter resolved at that level.  I appeal to the Minister to again examine whether he has the power to go to the court to have this matter resolved.  What we are seeing primarily is the undermining of a fairly new procedure under the Companies Act and this is regrettable.  The new system is important for the protection of companies, shareholders and, indeed, the general public.</P>
    <P>We are again being dragged into a controversy where politicians once more are being seen to be more concerned about peripheral issues to a large extent than to the very serious economic and social issues which this House should be dealing with.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all concerned to get to the root of the problem; go to the courts and have the matter cleared up so that we can get on with the business of this House.</P>

      <P>For the record, after the inspectors were appointed I expected they would come to see me, as had been indicated to me before their appointment, to discuss the question of costs and so on which did not seem to concern them greatly before their appointment.  The first contact we had was two or three days after their appointment and after they had started, when one of the inspectors telephoned the Secretary of my Department. He asked who was the secretary of the Department of Justice, as he wanted to talk to him about the costs because they had discovered that under section 13 it was he who was responsible to pay their costs and not the Minister for Industry and Commerce as they had thought &mdash; I must confess as I had thought also. The Secretary gave the inspector the name of the Secretary of the Department of Justice and made an appointment for them.  They went to see him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton said that what I should have done in regard to costs was <Col N="1679" /> to refer to the matter in open court and not to have had private telephone conversations with inspectors.  I have to remind the Deputy that I, of course, did that in open court.  It was a very unusual thing to happen and I doubt if it ever happened before, but it did on 13 December 1991.  It caused quite a stir at the time that I should, through counsel, question the costs and question the duration of the inquiry and express my concern at the application being made by the inspectors for a further eight weeks to carry out the task because I had already been assured that the matter would be concluded in November &mdash; the time had already been extended a number of times.</P>
    <P>I did that on each subsequent occasion that the matter came up in open court. What can be more open than that?  I was asked by Deputies John Bruton and Spring how many times I spoke to Mr. Barry, who was, of course, the only inspector to whom I spoke.  I cannot say precisely because I did not keep a record but my guess, which I believe would be reasonably accurate, is about seven or eight times in the course of an inquiry which lasted a week short of six months. Not all these telephone calls were instigated by me.  Obviously Mr. Barry would have rung me in connection with the cost problems.  I conveyed to him not just my concern but the concern of the Government as a whole.  On at least three occasions the Government as a whole discussed the matter and agreed fully with my point of view.  On the first occasion they expressed concern it was not connected with my point of view because I did not know then what the costs would be.  The Minister for Justice, during my absence in the United States, informed the Government and he thought these figures were appallingly high.  He brought up the matter and I was asked on my return to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The best estimate of the cost, on the basis of what has been paid and what the Department of Justice estimate is likely to be claimed, is as follows: Mr. C. Foley, personally, £250,000 plus; Mr. A. Barry, personally, £240,000 plus; other staff <Col N="1680" /> costs £300,000; other expenses &mdash; legal expenses, stenographers, security, etc., £300,000 plus.  The total projected cost is £1,100,000 plus.  How much the &ldquo;plus&rdquo; will be I do not know.  In the light of this, surely the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce who applied for the appointment of these inspectors, are entitled to have a concern about this matter and to seek to have an effective and economically conducted inquiry.  I do not make any apology to anybody for that, none whatever.  I do not make an apology for being concerned that an inquiry which I was originally led to believe might last a month or six weeks ended up lasting a week short of six months, with running costs of that order. Not to have been concerned about that and not to have spoken to one of the inspectors on seven or eight occasions about that aspect would have been remiss of my duty.</P>
    <P>It should be put on record that no complaint has been made to the court by either inspector and I have invited either or both of them to make a statement to the court, or with the permission of the court, if there is the slightest reason for either of them to suggest that I interfered in any way in the conduct or findings of the inquiry, other than to express my continuing concern about costs.  I have given the House the figures and I am entitled to be concerned.  I would challenge any Member not to be concerned about that.  There were two Ministers for Finance during the course of this inquiry, both of whom expressed great disquiet and their Department have given both the Department of Justice and my Department guidelines as to how these matters might be handled in the future in order that there might never be a repetition. I fully concur with the Department of Finance in this regard.  I can assure the House that there will not be a repetition and that these matters will be agreed in advance.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy De Rossa for what he has said.  I have explained to Deputy Spring the basis for my not going to court.  There is no provision in the Companies Act to allow me to do it.  In <Col N="1681" /> any event, I cannot go to the court and ask the court to compel somebody to make a statement.  The court would not hear me on it.  Of course, the inspectors are themselves free to go.  The matter has been adjourned.  The question of costs &mdash; by that I understand ultimate liability which I hope fervently will pass from the State to some other place &mdash; will be decided on 31 March.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton asked who authorised Mr. Barry to issue his statement.  I presume nobody authorised him and that he issued it himself.  The Deputy asked me how many contacts I had and I have given my best estimate.  He thought it was improper that the Government should, as it were, delegate the powers of the Minister for Justice to me.  I do not think it is.  The Government were surprised to find that the Minister for Justice was involved at all.  None of us was terribly clear why that was so but it was provided for under a section of the Act.  To the best of my knowledge and ability I have dealt with the matters raised today.</P>

The number of staff hired was at one stage very high indeed, in my opinion.  I am out of the mainstream of professional activities in the city of Dublin and perhaps I do not realise how much they have moved on in terms of cost and expense since I was on the hazard of the marketplace in the distant past.  They certainly have moved on and when I see what is happening around me I often wonder whether I am wise to have been in this House for the past 24 years, slaving on behalf of the Irish nation, and sometimes, as on this occasion perhaps, not getting great thanks for it.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the discussions this morning and from all sorts of events which have occurred in the past seven or eight months that our criminal law must be good law, sustainable, <Col N="1684" /> supportable and effective. Recent statistics on the recorded indictable crime rate for 1991 show a very dramatic increase over previous years. The increase is the second highest since 1982, at 7.8 per cent.  Obviously, we have grave cause for concern.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is in the interest of this House, and particularly in the interest of the Government, to indicate to the Irish people as soon as possible that they have the ability and the policies to bring this crime under control.  I hope the new Minister for Justice will take the opportunity to give that indication as soon as possible because people are naturally very concerned that all sorts of crime at all levels in society are showing signs of being totally out of control.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it attempts to address certain difficulties which were obvious to all of us for some time in relation to court proceedings involving cases of child sexual abuse and white collar crime.  I agree with the Minister that these problems need to be resolved as soon as possible.  My party will be assisting the passage of this Bill through the House.  However, we have certain serious concerns which we hope will be addressed by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Shatter's call for a special committee of the House to deal with Committee Stage, as our experience in dealing with the Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill, 1991, has been encouraging.  This Bill is before us because there is general agreement that we have serious problems with the gathering of evidence and the conduct of proceedings involving child sexual abuse and serious fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Part III, which seeks to make more effective criminal proceedings involving child sexual abuse, despite having some difficulties with its provisions.  Child sexual abuse is a major social problem today and is recognised as being a time bomb which is waiting to explode.  Experts say it will explode causing widespread crime and anarchy unless we take corrective action.  This Bill <Col N="1685" /> attempts to do something in that direction.</P>
    <P>Children of all ages are wandering the streets of this city every day out of the control of their parents.  They are at risk from all sorts of human predators as well as being at risk of abuse.  They are learning to be criminals.  Children who are sexually abused can suffer the most awful emotional disturbance which, unless appropriate treatment is provided, leaves them as emotionally crippled adults unable to enjoy a normal existence.</P>
    <P>Reports of allegations of child sexual abuse were a rarity until 1984.  In that year 88 allegations were made to the health boards, and by 1991 the number had grown to 1,241, a huge increase by any standard.  Is it the case that child sexual abuse is a new phenomenon?  In fact, it is proved that that is not the case.  Reporting of allegations is a new phenomenon because society has become more open and liberal.  Experts agree that this form of abuse has always existed. Victims of abuse can make a full recovery if appropriate therapy and counselling is provided.  The sad fact is that health boards are proving allegations but the victims are not getting therapy and counselling. How much of today's crime is committed by people who were sexually abused as children and who did not receive treatment?  From time to time we read reports of cases when ten year old boys are rapists.  We have had a recent experience of child rape which created unbelievable repercussions for our courts and our Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the absence of empirical research we can only conjecture how many crimes are committed by people under such circumstances. Experts suggest it is fairly certain that a high percentage of crime committed today falls into that category and we have no option but to believe them.  Thousands of children all over the country need but will not get treatment. Thousands of adults are suffering the shattering consequences of child abuse. Victims suffer grave identity problems, get involved in substance abuse and prostitution, cannot form satisfying adult relationships and tend to drift into lives <Col N="1686" /> of crime.  Experts are agreed that child sexual abuse is self-sustaining, that yesterday's victim turns out to be today's abuser.  Since the offspring of a victim can suffer a similar fate it has a multiplier effect.  Much more needs to be done than putting legislation on the Statute Book. In that respect, the Minister should urge the Government to commission proper research to establish certain facts with regard to child sexual abuse.  For example, we need to establish the causes of child sexual abuse in so far as what can be done and we need to establish also the historical and current incidence of the crime.  That could be done by asking a social science faculty at one of the universities to undertake that kind of research or the ESRI could be asked to get involved in such research.  It is essential that we do so becuse we must find out the dimensions of this problem. Only then can we begin to deal adequately with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also urge the Government to set up, as a matter of urgency, validation and treatment centres in each health board area.  Those facilities do not exist today and, indeed, Part III of this Bill needs that kind of support.  The urgency of this action is twofold: to provide therapy and counselling for victims, which is most essential, and to provide the necessary basis for invoking Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that child psychiatrists are a rarity on this part of the island &mdash; six operated in the area of child care in 1990.  The Minister will also be aware that the health boards do not have multi-disciplinary child care teams and, therefore, the proper investigation of allegations of child sexual abuse cannot be carried out at present satisfactorily and efficiently.  It is important that the House be aware that Part III of this Bill is inoperable under present circumstances.  The Minister should urge the Government to adopt the Child Care Act immediately, especially that Part of it which deals with giving the health boards various powers in relation to the welfare of children.  If that Part of the Act were invoked the health board would have <Col N="1687" /> statutory duties in the area of child care which would assist greatly with the application of Part III of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 15 are vague and are likely to create great difficulty during the course of criminal proceedings.  Section 13 provides that the court may in the interests of justice, allow cross-examination to be conducted through an intermediary. The Minister did not indicate who the intermediary would be or what qualifications are necessary.  All we do know is that the court will appoint the intermediary who, in its opinion, is competent to act as such.  Will the person appointed by the court be a teacher, a doctor, a child psychiatrist, a psychologist, or will it be a member of the legal profession who has been exposed to training in child psychology.  We need that information because the operation of this Part of the Bill is crucial if it is to achieve what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>If section 13 is to have the desired effect which, I take it, is to elicit information from young children or persons who are mentally retarded in a setting which is amenable to the children concerned, the intermediary should have an incisive understanding of young children and mentally retarded persons and be experienced in dealing with them.  He should also have a full understanding of court procedures and requirements in relation to the giving of evidence.  I put it to the Minister that the courts will have great difficulty in finding people who have that set of skills.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister propose, for example, to give legal training to specialists who work with children in order that they will be able to carry out that intermediary function or does he propose to give members of the legal profession training and practice in child psychology? It is difficult to see how section 13 will be effective and achieve its purpose unless we know what the Minister has in mind. He did not give us the benefit of his thinking on it during the course of his speech.  He made no reference to how we will ensure that the intermediary <Col N="1688" /> appointed is competent to act as such. Will the Minister, for example, require the court to set up a panel of people with the appropriate mix of training and experience and further assist the court by providing training where required?  We do not know the answer to this because the Minister did not say anything about it.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 13 is a very important and necessary nuance in criminal law.  Obviously, it is crucial that it works satisfactorily.  The use of an intermediary is complicated by the fact that the child witness may well be traumatised and emotionally unstable.  Therefore, we can appreciate the absolute necessity to have a person who has the best possible qualifications in child care and is conversant with legal procedures.  At this point no one in this House knows how we are going to achieve this mix.  Furthermore, counsel for the defence will find this procedure entirely frustrating.</P>
    <P>Section 15 presents us with the same problems.  It refers to video recording of a statement made by a person under 14 years of age during an interview with persons who in the opinion of the court were appropriately qualified for the purpose. Again, what type of person will be appropriately qualified and, more fundamentally, what will happen in a case where the person whose statement has been video recorded is not available for cross examination?  Will this not be challenged by the defence as running contrary to the rights conferred on the accused person under the Constitution?  This is a very serious matter and the Minister and his officials must examine it carefully. They should seek expert opinion to establish whether it is consistent with the Constitution. Deputy Shatter in his examination of the Bill played hard on this point also.  It has to be cleared up. The same question mark hangs over section 13.</P>
    <P>Cross examining a witness is a very precise practice which is governed by strict rules and regulations.  Whereas we appreciate and support what the Bill is trying to achieve it would be sad if section 15 (b), for example, was found to be <Col N="1689" /> unconstitutional in its present form or inoperable during the course of criminal proceedings.  I await the Minister's response to these important queries when he comes to sum up at the end of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, the then Minister stated that arrangements were being made for the provision of facilities for DNA fingerprinting.  That statement was made quite some time ago.  Yet, that Act is still lying dormant presumably because these facilities are not yet available. The question which arises is whether the same will happen in the case of Part III of this Bill.  We are already faced with this problem in the case of the Child Care Act and the section to which I referred during the course of my speech is essential so that the health boards will have proper powers to deal with child abuse.  Yet, it is lying dormant.</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised that technical facilities will be installed in the Four Courts this year for the purposes of Part III of this Bill.  I wonder if we can look forward with any confidence to this eventuality given that our experiences in the past have not been good.  There is no point in producing legislation which has been demanded by Members of this House and the community at large and then not invoking that legislation.  While it will assuage public opinion at the time it is not an effective way of governing the country and is self-defeating.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill seeks to improve the effectiveness of the courts in prosecutions involving serious fraud.  While it is unfair to generalise it seems that the number of people who are highly educated and ruthless and willing to use their considerable skills together with modern technology and methods to defraud others is increasing.  That is self-evident at this time.  With the development of banking and financial services there are ample opportunities for sophisticated crime of this kind.  Our new financial services centre is an obvious example of where this type of crime can find a way of expressing itself.  By its nature, it is <Col N="1690" /> very difficult to investigate and in the circumstances we are experiencing great difficulty in trying to protect personal and corporate rights.</P>
    <P>The Government can be accused of being soft on what is called white collar crime.  To date, for example, they have failed to take decisive action to deal with it.  They have treated the fraud squad in a most inadequate fashion.  They should not provide a panel of consultants comprised of members of the accounting and legal professions who can occasionally, when requested to do so, consult with the fraud squad.  That is not the right way to go about dealing with this type of crime. The Garda Commissioner should have the authority and the resources necessary to employ experts of this nature on a full-time basis.  Unless we do this we will not show the public at large and criminals that we are serious about tackling this type of crime.  The fact that the Garda Commissioner cannot do this seems to suggest that the Government are halfhearted in their approach to serious fraud.  My party have been urging the Government for a long time to set up a serious fraud squad under the control of the Garda Commissioner rather than under the control of the Attorney General or some other person and to give them all the necessary resources to tackle and defeat serious fraud.  The Government have refused to do this but we expect and are confident that, given their present commitment, they will not be in a position to defeat serious fraud.  It is my thesis therefore that the Government can be rightly accused of being soft on white collar crime.  I hope, however, that this changes very quickly.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote what the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Barnes, said in a speech to the Irish Centre for Commercial Law Studies in February 1991 on this issue.  He was speaking about the adequacy of the Irish criminal justice system in coping with fraud, particularly in regard to large and complicated cases. He said:</P>
    <P>I have developed certain clear views based on my office's experience over <Col N="1691" /> the past 16 years as to the sufficiency of our present system in this area.  That experience and those views lead me to contemplate the last decade of the century with considerable pessimism. Unless we adopt new and radical ideas and concepts, both in our laws and procedures, I fear that the new electronically controlled worlds of national and international banking, financial services, trade, commerce, customs, tariffs, subsidies and interventions, may rapidly become happy hunting grounds in which any reasonably sophisticated white collar criminal can roam at will, untroubled by any perturbation that his activities will be effectively checked or inhibited by the Irish criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I support that statement made in February 1991 and I am sure that if Mr. Barnes was speaking on the topic today he would say something similar because things have not really changed much in the meantime in regard to the provision of new legislation and a whole new approach to the concept of dealing with this kind of crime.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions pointed out that the two most difficult crimes to deal with are those involving fraud and sex.  It is interesting to note that this Bill tries to deal with both those very difficult areas.  In his opinion the Garda need far more extensive powers to assist them in dealing with complicated and sophisticated cases involving serious fraud.  In this respect he believes that the rule against self-incrimination &mdash; or as it is called, the right to silence &mdash; should be scrutinised.  It is unusual that, under the Road Traffic Act, a person is obliged to provide what may prove to be an incriminating sample whereas a person suspected of defrauding millions of pounds has the right to remain silent lest he incriminates himself.  That has been diluted somewhat in some circumstances over the past ten years but the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the opinion that the Garda do not have the power and authority to deal with this matter in an effective and efficient way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> Have the Minister and his officials examined the possibility of diminishing or abolishing the right to silence in the case of persons suspected of serious fraud?  I know there is a body of opinion which would strongly object if the House decided to remove the right to silence but there would be general agreement among members of the public that it should be examined.  In cases of serious fraud &mdash; God knows we have seen enough suggestions of it over the last eight months &mdash; the public would agree that the right to silence should at least be looked at.  Have the Minister, the former Minister and officials of the Department of Justice looked at this matter and, if so, what have they decided?  I hope the Minister will address this problem when he responds to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is welcome as it allows for the use of modern documentary evidence during criminal proceedings. However, it is certainly not earth shattering and is unlikely to frighten prospective serious fraudsters.  I am not clear about all the powers the Garda have in trying to deal with these very serious matters.  The public are dismayed at times, when it is clear there has been serious fraud, that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not bring a case before the courts.  We can think of a large number of cases of that nature over the past few years and it does not instill public confidence in the Government.  The whole business of dealing with serious fraud must be looked at because if members of the public do not have confidence in the system of justice, particularly in so far as it deals with people in important positions defrauding others of huge sums of money, how can they be expected to obey the law in their day-to-day living?  You cannot, and maybe the increases in the incidence of indictable crimes in 1991 could be as a result of a total lack of confidence in the public mind in regard to the ability of Members of this House to control crime at the highest level.  Certainly that is the feeling I get from members of the public, they ask why they should obey the law when the <Col N="1693" /> big guns can break it at will and get away with it.</P>
    <P>As the Director of Public Prosecutions said, we must take a brand new look at the whole business of our investigations and prosecutions in relation to serious fraud, which would mean looking at the powers of the Garda.  Do the Garda have power, for example, to require a person to provide documentation?  Part II of the Bill refers to documentation being required as evidence, but can the Garda require a person to present certain documentation to them which may assist in proving whether a person is guilty?  Have they the power to require a suspect to answer certain questions about the documentation? The 1985 Act is very weak in that area.  The Garda are of the opinion that they do not have adequate powers in that regard.  It has been proved that they do not have adequate powers and it is up to Members of this House to move quickly to try to provide them with such powers to deal adequately with this very difficult problem.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is not here this morning; he was not present on Tuesday last when I spoke.  I would have liked him to be here because other things need to be done apart from introducing legislation in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement that there is a relationship between the incidence of crime and poverty and poor circumstances in households.  I have done research in that area and I am convinced that there is a very strong relationship between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not decided to date to adopt a pro-active approach to dealing with crime.  While such a pro-active approach may entail a duplication of expenditure now it will lead to a decrease in crime in the years to come. The Government should consider setting up a system of family support in what I would describe as vulnerable areas, for <Col N="1694" /> example, housing estates where there is a large population.  The centre piece of such a system of support should be preschool play groups in which there should be an involvement by the health board and the local community.  This would be of tremendous benefit in that children would get a much better chance and any difficulties which may arise would be identified at an earlier age.  I believe that many of the children who are roaming our streets at present, with no parental control, would not be doing this if such a system of support were in place.  Parents would benefit enormously from support groups which could be formed around pre-school play groups.</P>
    <P>I have been referring to the need for such a support system for a long period and some experts have said that it would be the right thing to do.  Barnardos, the ISPCC and others are making valiant efforts in this area but they do not have adequate resources.  Therefore, their efforts are not widespread enough.  I hope the Minister will consider my suggestion.  As I said, such a system would entail a duplication of expenditure at the outset.  We are spending quite an amount of money at present on the provision of extra places for juvenile offenders and unless the Government decide to adopt a pro-active approach to this issue more and more expenditure will have to be spent in the future in dealing with this problem.  The statistics on indictable crime, which show an increase of 7.8 per cent this year, could get out of control over a period of time as a result of the structures which exist in our society today.  For example, there are approximately 300,000 people unemployed. Such factors militate towards a breakdown in society.  While it is necessary to put legislation on the Statute Book it will only be effective if it is backed up by sensible, well thought out and well researched policies which will improve the position for people who live in poverty and are in poor circumstances for all sorts of reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Second Reading of the Bill.  I congratulate the <Col N="1695" /> Minister on bringing this important Bill before the House at this time.  This Bill is important in that it addresses a very real problem affecting the lives of many people.  Sadly, this problem also affects the lives of many children.  Because of my interest in this area, I will confine my remarks to Part III which deals with evidence in court in certain proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rules of our courts and, in particular, jury courts developed over the centuries with many objects in mind.  One of the main objects of our courts has been to protect the accused from conviction on the basis of tenuous or malicious evidence. It is right and proper that this should be the case.  This protection has grown to be the basic safeguard upon which every citizen relies for a fair hearing when charged with wrongdoing. However, this being said, we must recognise that in some cases these rules, as they currently stand, can serve to frustrate justice rather than promote it and can cause very real harm to victims who have already suffered greatly in that due to some technicality their case is not dealt with in court in the way it should have been dealt with.  I wish to refer to the circumstances under which children and those with a mental handicap give evidence in cases involving physical and sexual abuse.  The rules of the court in such cases need to be changed.  I believe most people recognise that.  It is not acceptable that the full force of a traditional adversarial trial should be inflicted on people who run a high risk of suffering grave psychological trauma as a result. This is particularly evident in the case of children and people with a mental handicap who have to give evidence.  I do not see how bringing a child before a court and forcing the child to endure an onslaught of detailed, intimate and nakedly hostile questioning can serve the cause of justice, particularly when, as is the case at present, the questioning is done by highly trained adults who wear 18th century clothing.  It is most unfortunate that children and people with a mental handicap have to give evidence in <Col N="1696" /> such circumstances.  I am pleased that the Bill deals with this aspect.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of children using the services of Childline have indicated to us all, if we needed any further proof, the extent to which child abuse is a problem in Ireland.  I very much welcome the recent trend towards actively encouraging children to speak up about abuse.  The number of children who have contacted Childline since they were established four years ago is astounding.  It is good that these children are reaching out for help.  However, we must remember that when a child who has been abused reaches out for help it is critically important to ensure that that child is protected under the present system.  Every time a child is subject to the present system we are violating the trust they have placed in us, that is, the promise of protection offered to them when they stepped forward in the first instance.  The Bill deals with the protection of the child in such cases.</P>
    <P>As it stands, the system used in prosecuting these cases could be described at best as unjust and at worst as barbaric. I have no doubt that the low level of prosecution and conviction in child abuse cases, or cases involving people with a mental handicap is directly attributable to the manner in which the prosecution is carried out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which will remove the taking of child evidence away from court by the use of video links.  This is a very positive step forward.  In future, evidence can be taken from a child by a video link in a proper setting away from the courtroom, which can be frightening for a child.  I also welcome the abolition of the requirement of face to face identification of the accused which for many children and mentally handicapped people must have been a very traumatic experience.  I welcome the abolition of the wearing of wigs and gowns in such cases.  I also welcome the use of competent persons to question witnesses in such cases.</P>
    <P>Taken together, I believe these measures will go a long way towards removing the current psychological <Col N="1697" /> intimidation of children in such cases.  I also welcome the proposals that contemporaneous accounts should be admitted in evidence.  It is unreasonable to expect children and people with a mental handicap to retain a full and lucid account of upsetting events during the many months in which it takes to bring a case to court.  The proposed admissibility of unsworn evidence from children under 14 years is also a positive step forward in that it recognises that children are capable of giving evidence which is every bit as reliable as evidence given by adults, even if it is not given with the same assurance or worldly wisdom.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 27 which will remove the requirement that a child's unsworn evidence be corroborated. I also welcome the removal of the requirement that the jury be warned about convicting on a child's sworn but uncorroborated evidence.  In our system of justice we rely heavily on the dedication of both the judge and jury in their assessment of the facts in each individual case.  Therefore, we should not unduly prejudice them against the evidence of children in cases such as this.</P>
    <P>I support the provisions in Part IV which deal with the competence and compellability of spouses and former spouses of accused persons to give evidence in certain cases.  In the cases concerned, specifically those of violence against a spouse or violence or a sexual offence against any child, even a child of either spouse, it is frequently the spouse who is more likely to know about the crime.  In many cases in the past a spouse may have been frightened of going to court.  It is only right that these people be allowed and, if necessary, compelled to go to court to give evidence in such cases.</P>
    <P>Part II dealing with the admissibility of certain documentary evidence is a technical yet necessary measure which one hopes will prevent ingenious barristers finding loopholes in this area.  The public becomes rightly indignant when people escape justice on the basis of flimsy technicalities. I hope these measures will help to avoid the type of fiasco which arose <Col N="1698" /> recently in Britain concerning poll tax summonses.</P>
    <P>I very much support the provisions in the Bill.  I congratulate the Law Reform Commission on whose work this Bill is based.  I would however ask the Minister to try to speed up the process by which reports and recommendations of the Commission are dealt with.  We should not have to wait 18 months for the presentation of a Bill dealing with the evidence of children and mentally handicapped in assault and abuse cases. It is almost seven years since the commission reported on the issue of compellability of spouses to appear as witnesses.  I ask the Minister to consider speeding up the process of reform especially concerning the abuse of children. I thank him for bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement of last Sunday that he is considering the commission's recommendation that a crime of child sexual assault be created. I encourage him to bring forward the measure as soon as possible rather than waiting for the preparation of a full criminal justice Bill.  In addition, it is vital that the Child Care Act, 1991, be brought into operation immediately.  The last speaker referred to the more practical things that need to be done.  In that context I welcome the Minister's statement in the House on Tuesday in which he said that work is under way to install in the courts the video equipment provided for in the Bill.  This is a very necessary Bill which should receive a speedy passage through the House.  I thank the Minister and those involved for bringing the Bill before us.</P>

      <P>It is with some pleasure that I contribute to this debate because it refers to an area in which I have a specific interest.  It is a good, simple and straightforward Bill which should make dramatic changes in the law of evidence. It takes account of modern communications technology in making computer printouts admissible in evidence.  It enables the use of video recorded interviews and effects improvements in a number of other areas.  As with other <Col N="1699" /> speakers, I would lay down a proviso. When debating Committee Stage of the Control of Dogs Bill yesterday we heard much about enabling provisions and passing laws.  In this instance the provisions are very far-reaching and advanced and I make a plea that they be brought into operation immediately.  The fact that the Bill is getting priority is one good development from the recent public debates on the 14-year old pregnant rape victim and the incest case which was dismissed in a south-eastern court last week.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the special and important role of the Law Reform Commission in making proposals and coming to conclusions in their work.  They examined the whole area thoroughly and professionally. Their consultation paper on child sexual abuse of August 1989 and their report, No. 32, of 1990, were the basis for this legislation.  Like the previous speaker, I regret the delay between the time of publication of the consultative document and the report and the bringing forward of the legislation.  I question why we had to wait so long, particularly in an area of such critical need.</P>
      <P>The documents I mentioned helped inform public opinion and the formation of policy and proposals for legislation.  In their examination and consultation on this issue the Law Reform Commission continued the practice they started when examining proposals for rape legislation in that they held a one day seminar to which they invited interested groups.  I attended both seminars.  The seminar on child sexual abuse, held on 25 November 1989, was very useful and informative and the views expressed were taken into account by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other public representatives I have been involved over the years with constituents seeking help when such a crisis arose in the family.  In 1983, before society had accepted the reality of child sexual abuse and began making provision for dealing with it, I received a report of such a case from a doctor and social workers in a midland town.  It appears that in a family of five, two of the daughters had a low IQ, and the professionals <Col N="1700" /> involved suspected that incest was taking place.  One daughter aged 17 years had had a baby and another was pregnant. These professionals were desperate but nothing could be done at local level because there was no machinery for investigation or intervention.  I passed to the Department of Health the information with an appeal that the case be investigated but it took 18 months for the Department to reply, confirming that they could do nothing about it.</P>
    <P>Thankfully things have changed since. No one can deny the incidence of child sexual abuse, but there are procedures to intervene and bring the abusers to court. As the number of incidents grow the horror of the crime grows.  Every day we read in the papers accounts of fathers, uncles and friends grossly abusing small children.  Such reports evoke great anger in decent people and frustration at the knowledge that only a small fraction of validated cases come before courts.  The tragedy of those childrens' lost innocence and the legacy of often life-long trauma makes child sexual abuse the most heinous of crimes.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the details of the Bill I wish to ponder on the reasons some men commit these crimes&mdash;I accept that some women have committed the crime of child sexual abuse but in most cases it is committed by men.  These men come from all walks of life and all income groups and are in positions of trust and power.  They use small girls and boys as a sexual convenience.  I believe that they are as low criminals as are men who wear balaclavas and wield guns.  I want to know what decent men collectively have to say about this pattern of abuse by their sex. Can they understand the offenders' minds?  Can they understand the offenders well enough even to help to find measures to prevent the abuse?  Much as I have read and much as I have tried to understand the motivation of those who commit such crimes, there is obviously a gender barrier there and I cannot understand them.  I ask that decent men, who must feel dreadful about this, would perhaps think about it a little more.</P>
    <P>Recently a couple in my constituency <Col N="1701" /> contacted me about their ten year old daughter who had been abused by a neighbour.  The man was a close friend and had gone on holidays with the family. Both families had regular access to the other's home and the children came and went with each family.  The child disclosed the abuse to her parents whereupon the mother, in a very natural way, confronted the neighbour.  Not only did the neighbour deny the charge, he promptly slapped a slander charge against her.  In the meantime the parents went to the Garda.  The child underwent tests for a week, after which two doctors confirmed that sexual abuse had taken place.  However, the DPP could take no further action, the parents were told, because there was no evidence and there were no witnesses.  The Garda already had reports that the man in question had exposed himself to other little girls.</P>
    <P>The parents felt desperately frustrated and betrayed.  They could not get confirmation that sexual abuse had taken place.  Believe it or not, the information came to them only via the Dáil, by way of an answer to a parliamentary question that I tabled to the Minister for Health. The Minister told me that the health board had confirmed from their inquiries that sexual abuse had occurred.  The parents found out from a reply to a parliamentary question that their child had been sexually abused.  The case could not go to court under existing law, even though the child had disclosed who the abuser was.  There were two reasons for that: first, the psychiatrist's evidence would not be accepted and, second, there were no witnesses.  I am not sure whether their case will be improved with this Bill. I think that it will be.</P>
    <P>Section 13 makes provision for interviewes to act as interpreters to get information from a child, so perhaps that is the measure that will help the child I have just mentioned.  The Bill states that the interviews should be carried out by a competent person.  I hope that the Minister will ensure that there are people trained and skilled in child psychology to perform that very important task.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Bill did not deal with <Col N="1702" /> the Law Reform Commission proposal to introduce a new offence of child sexual abuse or sexual exploitation.  That measure would have enabled, for instance, a second charge to be laid in cases such as the Waterford incest case. A second charge would most likely have succeeded, given that the case brought as incest and under present law unable to be proven, fell.  On Sunday the Minister said on radio that he was open to proposals to improve the Bill or to improve other legislation with regard to prosecution for child sexual abuse, so I ask him to reconsider this offence and indicate what he can do to quickly bring forward the required definition.</P>
    <P>Another issue that is not covered in the Bill is mandatory reporting.  I accept that it would probably be difficult to include mandatory reporting in this Bill. In the final report of the Law Reform Commission great prominence and much discussion was given to mandatory reporting.  The House has to take away discretion and make it obligatory on professionals who are aware that there is a sexual abuse problem in connection with their charges to report that.  Many teachers, doctors, and social workers are saying that over the years they have been able to pick out of a class the children who have been abused at home because those children display clear behavioural features but that they did not know what to do and were, I suppose, afraid that they would get themselves into trouble or might make a mistake in filing a report. If we are serious about detecting and doing something about the crime of child abuse then we have to take action and have every suspected case followed up. There would have to be a proper structure for investigation and follow-up procedures if we were to bring in mandatory reporting.  All professionals would have to have assurances of protection.  They would have to know that in the event of wrongful reporting they would be protected. As I said, perhaps the Bill is not the instrument for this measure, but mandatory reporting must be a part of realistic efforts to detect all of the child sexual abuse in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> I welcome section 21, which deals with one spouse being compelled to give evidence against the other, particularly in instances of child sexual abuse or domestic violence.  In the future wives will be compellable witnesses.  This provision is absolutely essential in the case of child sexual abuse.  It is painful and distressing for a wife to have to go to the witness box in a charge against her husband and there might be many reasons for her not wanting to give evidence; but, in the interests of getting a conviction and presenting a whole case, this measure has to be provided.</P>
    <P>It should also prove effective in obtaining more convictions for wife battering. However, I would like to know what will happen if a woman who is a victim of violence is threatened or intimidated by her husband before the case comes to trial.  Will she get the necessary protection in advance of the court case?  It has always been the case with many women who have been beaten that they go to the Garda, press charges and then when they go home their husband, if he is still at home, threatens her that he will take all kinds of actions if she goes forward to act as a witness.  That has been a pattern over the years and I hope we will be able to do something about it if a wife is to be a compellable witness.  Too many violent men have manipulated their wives to withdraw charges in the past for me to feel comfortable that the same will not happen after this change.  I should like to know what security protection there will be for wives.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the term in the Bill which refers to a former spouse, those words not being put in quotation marks. I do not know how one can be a former spouse in Ireland, because if a couple are married then they stay being husband and wife; that status cannot be changed. Perhaps a definition different from &ldquo;former spouse&rdquo; might be appropriate.  I notice that in the Minister's speech that term is put in inverted commas.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 25, I ask for a clear definition of right to privacy.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the difficulties <Col N="1704" /> of parents in one case, but I wish to make the point that next to the child the parents are those who are most vulnerable. They are distressed, confused and hurt by the assault on their child, if that is by an outsider.  Their needs must be considered all along the way.  Their feelings must be taken into account.  They need to support and help their child, mostly for the rest of her life or until she is into adulthood, and their role is crucial in the proceedings.  I raise the case in question because I have been told that the first a couple knew of a court hearing involving their child was on reading an account of it in the paper the following day.  They had not been informed in advance and felt very angry about that. Obviously the abuser had pleaded guilty. I am sure the intention of all concerned was to spare the parents the heartbreak and distress, but that is not what happened. They felt very cross and had wanted to be present at that court hearing.</P>
    <P>Most parents want the facts of their child's case to be recorded.  Of the cases that go to court the vast majority involve a plea of guilty.  Therefore, the full story does not emerge, the child does not have to give evidence and all cases may receive the same treatment.  Many parents feel there is a symbolic aspect to acknowledging the child's suffering.  Indeed, in deciding on the sentence one would expect that the judge should have the full facts before him, including a professional diagnosis of the effects on the child.</P>
    <P>That takes me to treatment facilities, in respect of which it is important to make the point that the very real need of abused children's parents to contribute to the rehabilitation of the children is rendered extremely difficult by the inadequacy of our therapy and counselling services.  In Dublin this service ranges from patchy to poor.  In some rural areas it is non-existent, with long waiting lists. That is not good enough.  Let us be sure about this.  When a family experience this dreadful trauma it is not something they can discuss over a cup of tea with their nextdoor neighbours.  In fact, they will want to discuss it with very few people. <Col N="1705" /> It is not something that families want to spread far and wide; it is not in any way similar to a child having another type of accident.  Parents do need professional help, counselling, in order to cope with the immediate after effects of this awful crisis in their family.  Therefore, to place children, in particular, but also parents on a waiting list with very little hope of help is totally uncaring.  I appeal that money and resources be invested in providing therapy facilities for parents and children.</P>
    <P>Getting prosecutions and having sentences meted out are vital in these child abuse cases.  So also are counselling and ongoing therapy to ensue that the long term effects, which can deeply scar a young person, are properly dealt with. We are not talking about a voluntary service, if we ever were, in circumstances in which people did not have to pay but took pot luck.  We should not be talking about that any longer.  We are talking about very skilled, highly sensitive work on the part of competent professionals. I know that costs money, but in these circumstances that money should be invested into the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>I might comment on one part of the Bill where it is said that, when evidence is being taken on video, wigs and gowns should not be worn by the legal practitioners. There is very good reason for that suggestion.  I would advocate that they be totally eliminated.  I cannot see the point in some of the legal people who work in our courts getting dressed up in these ridiculous outfits more suitable to pantomime than the hearing of such cases.  I would suggest that such apparel be eliminated for everybody's sake.</P>
    <P>My principal concern and interest is with the child who is abused, in helping the parents and child to be rehabilitated. But of course I have concern for the offender as well, the men who by their acts place themselves so low on the level of criminality.  What is being done for them?  What can be done for them?  Can they be rehabilitated and by what process? The Minister did not refer to them in the course of his remarks.  I was disappointed that he did not give the House <Col N="1706" /> statistics of the current number of people in prison for sex abuses.  I should like to have such statistics on our prison population as it stands at present in that respect.</P>
    <P>I know that most people sentenced for child sexual abuse are located in Arbour Hill Prison.  I know that if abusers do not receive appropriate treatment they are very likely to abuse again.  They must be forced to confront the basic issue, the deep problem, which motivated their behaviour.  Again that warrants a specialist, consistent programme of professional therapy.  I know there was a counselling programme in operation in Arbour Hill Prison for these men which proved very successful and in which there was a great deal of interest, but that has ended.  The probation officers involved in that programme have been transferred to other duties and have not been replaced.  It is criminally irresponsible of the Minister to wash his hands of these men.  For the sake of the men themselves they should have therapy; but, equally important, we should ensure that, when they are freed having served their sentences, they will not repeat their awful crimes.  The only way we can go guarantee is to ensure that they receive professional therapy and are subjected to a proper programme of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I might make some comment about another omission from the provisions of this Bill in that it affords me an opportunity to signal what still needs to be done.  I refer to the need for barring and protection order provisions for this particular crime.  We attempted to have that provision inserted in the Child Care Bill on Committee Stage without success. This is something on which the Law Reform Commission come down very heavily.  I might quote from their Report on Child Sexual Abuse, at page 89, under the heading of &ldquo;Barring Orders&rdquo;, paragraph 28, which reads:</P>
    <P>A barring order should be available in respect of any person who is or has been a member of the abused child's household or who, while not a member of the child's household, comes into <Col N="1707" /> regular contact with the child.  Where a barring order is made in relation to a person who is not a parent or a sibling of the child, it should, save in exceptional circumstances, be made only in respect of the child's family home.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the overall question of barring and protection orders for the child's sake.  Indeed it should be possible that power be given to health boards to seek a barring order when they are aware that abuse is taking place.  It is very difficult to understand how the authorities, in a very hard-faced way, can remove the child where there is a suspicion, an allegation or where child abuse is proven. The official approach is to remove the small child from its home, bedroom, familiar place, placing him or her somewhere for care, compounding the child's shock and stress.  I have no doubt that there will be additional legislation introduced in this area.  I appeal to the Government to seriously examine whether we could not introduce barring or protection order proceedings, so often recommended by the Law Reform Commission, in the interests of the child.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a minimal, if important, measure in combating child abuse.  Hopefully, it will lead to more convictions which, in turn, may act as a deterrent to those inclined to child sexual abuse.  But a lot more needs to be done.  For instance, there is need for greater public education about protecting children, which should include teachers, parents, child care workers and so on.  We must remember that small children are the most vulnerable people in society worldwide. They cannot be their own advocates, they cannot help themselves and often do not know to whom they should turn for help. From what we have seen of the development of child sexual abuse as a crime in our society, it appears children no longer know whom they can trust.  That is probably one of the most awful aspects of this crime, that adults who would have occupied or enjoyed a position of trust and dependency have betrayed that trust and dependency.  They deserve our best <Col N="1708" /> efforts to help them.  Small children deserve to have their lives made safe, comfortable and happy.  We cannot always guarantee happiness but we should be able to guarantee their safety inside and outside of the family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to wish the new Minister of State every success in his new position.  Deputy O'Dea's elevation is long overdue.  I have no doubt that he will grace with his presence the second level of Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which proposes to improve and reform the law in four important areas.  I propose to use my time to comment on two areas, crime against tourists and physical or sexual abuse of children or mentally handicapped persons.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision which will contribute to the protection of tourists.  A recent phenomenon called tourist-bashing is growing. Preying on visitors will simply have to be stamped out.  Our fastest growing industry is tourism.  Over the past few years great efforts have gone into the promotion and expansion of tourism which is growing at three times the average world growth rate.  It has huge implications for job creation and the economic well-being of our country. Nothing should be allowed interfere with its progress, certainly not criminal types who see tourists as easy targets and who see themselves getting away scot-free with this sneaky, cowardly criminal activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlawful interference with tourists has been prevalent in our cities, particularly Dublin.  More recently it has spread to other parts where tourists congregate. Wicklow is a typical example.  Huge efforts are being made in Wicklow to promote and market this beautiful county and to provide a tourism product of the highest quality.  The high amenity areas of Wicklow are being viewed by criminals as areas for easy pickings, areas such as Glendalough, the second most visited tourist attraction in Ireland, Brittas Bay, the Vale of Avoca, the town of Arklow and its hinterland, the beautiful Blessington <Col N="1709" /> Lakes in west Wicklow and Bray in the northern part of the county.  Those visiting these places are vunerable.  The Garda are making trojan efforts and have been successful in apprehending many offenders.  However, the scale of the problem and the growing nature of it makes policing and apprehension extremely difficult, in some cases virtually impossible.  We need a major deterrent.  What the Minister has included in this Bill constitutes a major improvement and I compliment him on his efforts.</P>
    <P>In addressing the subject of child sexual abuse I should like to focus on the way the law is applied.  I am not a lawyer, but as a politician and public representative it is incumbent on me to look at its more human aspects.  It is always a good idea to start with a little history. Child sexual abuse is very ancient and very recent.  Although it always has been with us, it is only a few years ago that the issue of child sexual abuse as a social problem was raised in Ireland.  The first formal examination of the subject came at a conference on incest organised by the Irish Association of Social Workers in 1983.  In this respect, we were not so different from many other parts of the world who started to explore it just a few years earlier.  The rediscovery of child sexual abuse was one of the hallmarks of the eighties.  If one opens any Irish daily newspaper while the courts are in session one will find at lest one report of a case of child sexual abuse.  The average reader could be forgiven for thinking that there has been a major explosion of the problem in recent years.  While no evidence exists to back up the view that it is occurring more frequently than in the past, we know that more cases are being reported to the health boards and the Garda.</P>
    <P>The first time the Department of Health took separate figures for child sexual abuse was in 1984 when only 33 cases were recorded.  After that, there was a dramatic increase in the figures.  In 1987, three years later, 456 cases were confirmed and in 1990 approximately 650 cases were confirmed.  It is reckoned that <Col N="1710" /> another 40 per cent of reported cases remain unconfirmed.  These facts in themselves do not mean that all is as it should be in either our criminal or civil courts.  At regular intervals verdicts and/or sentences give cause for justified anger.  Questions are raised as to whether victims should report such crimes at all when one sees the mess the system can on occasion make of these cases.  The list of things that can go wrong is long.  The case may not come to court at all leaving the victim feeling disbelieved.  Informal estimates among child care professionals put the prosecution rate at perhaps as low as 10 per cent of all confirmed cases despite the hard work of the Garda and the fact that the identity of the alleged perpetrator is usually known.  The Director of Public Prosecutions disputes that assertion.</P>
    <P>The figures submitted to the Law Reform Commission suggest that the prosecution rate is much higher.  One of the difficulties about preparing Department of Health and Garda figures is that they do not necessarily work from the same list of cases.  If a case gets as far as a criminal court many calamities can ensue &mdash; everything from a severe cross-examination of a victim or witness to what is perceived as a very soft sentence for the culprit.  The scope for being left with a sense of injustice is very great. Consequently, it is not uncommon for people to take the law into their own hands.  Beatings, stabbings and arson are just some of the means relatives or associates of victims here have resorted to in recent years.  That is fact.  In one case from May of this year a court was told that a favourite uncle was stabbed 30 times by people seeking revenge for his abuse of the children.  In a more recent case from October of this year a trial judge took into account the fact that an accused charged with the rape of a teenage girl had been administered some &ldquo;summary justice&rdquo; and suspended his six-year prison sentence.  Reprehensible as such vigilante activities may be, at least they signal the depth of emotion involved and the reality that there are some things that cannot be restored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The effects of child sexual abuse are not always apparent without close examination. The most worrying long term effect of this abuse may be what is called the &ldquo;damaged goods&rdquo; syndrome which impacts on a person's self-image and self-esteem, and may last for the lifetime of the unfortunate victim.  This attacks a young person's psyche and spiritual side and its impact runs very deep.  Here lies the source of the most intense confusion, rage and sadness.  Anguish of this kind may not be extinguished even by a successful court case where the accused gets a severe sentence.  One can therefore imagine the pain endured when it is perceived that the trial has been mishandled.</P>
    <P>A young man who admitted to sexually abusing some of his much younger nieces came to trial just a few months ago but the parents of the abused children did not know the case was being heard.  They and their children were mere witnesses as far as the court was concerned and were not required to attend because the accused had pleaded guilty.  Before passing sentence the judge asked the prosecuting garda how the children were. The garda replied that they were receiving counselling and were &ldquo;doing well&rdquo;. The accused, who had been described as being of previously good character was given a suspended sentence.  Reading the outcome of the case in the newspaper next day, the children's parents became very angry and distressed because they felt they had been needlessly excluded from a very important event concerning their children.  If they had been there, the outcome might not have been any different but they at least would have felt that their voices had been heard.  The most important voices of all, those of the abused children, were not heard either. Neither were the therapists providing the counselling for the children asked for up-to-date reports on their progress.  It is very interesting to contrast this situation with that of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Industry where there were almost daily wrangles over whose voice was heard and whose was not.  That is why this is such an important Bill.  Up to <Col N="1712" /> the introduction of this Bill our laws and legal procedures have made it perfectly acceptable to summarily exclude and silence children.</P>
    <P>It is also revealing to note the different ways in which such cases are dealt with under the European inquisitorial system. There, the adversarial nature of court proceedings is greatly modified and professional witnesses are called in to assess the credibility of the child witness in a much less hostile environment.  The objective is to get as much pertinent information as possible about the case into the proceedings, whereas our adversarial system is for the most part about keeping information out.  I am well aware that the inquisitorial system is a anathema to many legal practitioners in this country, some believing that it finds the defendant guilty until proven innocent. This is untrue but the system is not perfect.  On the other hand, one could look at what our own sacred adversarial system has to offer.</P>
    <P>When it comes to admitting evidence the adversarial system is fundamentally prejudicial to children.  As recently as 1984 an English legal academic called Heydon wrote a well respected book on the law of evidence where he states that children are intrinsically unrealiable witnesses for a number of reasons: their memories are unreliable; they are egocentric; they are highly suggestible; they have difficulty distinguishing fact from fantasy; they make false allegations particularly of sexual assault; and they do not fully understand the duty to tell the truth in court.  Each of these assumptions can be detected in the way our courts operate in relation to children's evidence.  In many cases children are no less reliable than adults and in some cases they are perhaps more reliable.  If adults were all that trustworthy perhaps we would not need perjury laws.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not surprising in this context therfore that various extra legal steps are being taken to get even symbolic if not legal redress.  The vigilante phenomenon that I mentioned earlier is one aspect of this.  A more productive factor is the influence, especially in the United <Col N="1713" /> States, of phycho-drama in therapy where an abuser undergoing a course of treatment will be expected, for example after due preparation to literally go on his knees to beg his victim's forgiveness.</P>
    <P>Since sexual abuse has very little to do with sex and a great deal to do with power &mdash; this is what the experts tell us &mdash; the challenge to a trial judge is to conduct the case in a way that can symbolise for the aggrieved parties that the power imbalance between abuser and victim has been rectified and that their hurt has been acknowledged.  This is by no means an easy task within our present system but relatively simple changes would improve the position.  For example, it would help victims if at some stage during the trial the accused had to account for himself in the witness box.  This never happens where a guilty plea is entered which unfortunately is the case in the majority of Irish trials of sexual offences. While the accused has a right to confront the accuser, no right exists for the victim to confront the accused.  This is supposed to be done by the State on behalf of all of society, who have been hurt and perhaps affronted by the crime.</P>
    <P>Victims and their loved ones do not need to see the return of hanging and flogging to get emotional release from the legal process.  However they need to see cases dealt with sensitively and they need to see atonement in some form. Apart from hearing the accused give an account of himself in the witness box it would help enormously to hear the outlining of a treatment plan for the abuser, particularly when one considers that most prosecutions are against offenders who plead guilty.  An accused hoping to stay out of jail should be able to call to court a therapist who could explain his assessment of him and exactly what work was currently being done and would be done if he was given a non-custodial sentence.  Not all therapy is alike and in this area some traditional, non-directive models can even be counter-productive as they fail to confront the key issues of abuse and victimisation.  It is all too easy for an abuser to claim a miraculous cure and stop attending <Col N="1714" /> therapy sessions as soon as he gets his suspended sentence.  What is more likely here however is not the outlining of a treatment plan but a mercy plea from defending counsel, often consisting of little more than a series of excuses for his client's behaviour, heavily laced with references to his tragic background or the fact that he had taken an excess of drink. He may even offer that his client ought to live or would choose to live in a different neighbourhood where he is not known. We hear this type of thing emanating from court cases every day of the week. Perhaps in reality such offenders would pose a lesser threat to children in an area where they are known rather than in some new environment where they could repeat the crime.  Survivors of sexual abuse tend to be unimpressed by these heartrending pleas.  They do not necessarily need to see a prison sentence handed down but they need to see the abuser atone in some way.</P>
    <P>In the civil courts the position with regard to evidence is not as bad.  The Bill before us is essentially about what happens in the criminal courts.  The priority should be to endeavour to prevent abuse in the first place so that we do not have to deal with the criminal aspects later.  The sooner we implement the Child Care Act the better.  The focus in that Act is on promoting the welfare of children rather than providing a crisis service.  I was privileged to be a member of the all-party committee which processed that legislation through Committee Stage.  There were some excellent and committed people on that committee. I learned a lot about the whole area of child care from my colleagues and from studies which we made.  I should like to see the Act in operation so that the benefits can percolate through the system.  An example of what can be done is the child abuse prevention programme in the Eastern Health Board region.  This programme should be extended to the rest of the country.  It would save money in the long run by preventing damage to children.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on bringing this Bill before the House so <Col N="1715" /> expeditiously.  It is a sign of the commitment by the Taoiseach and the Government to making ours a more caring society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on bringing forward this legislation in such a short time after their appointment.  I wish them both well in the Department of Justice. There will be many testing moments for both the Ministers and the Ministers of State in that Department in coming months.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on a general basis. It is also important to acknowledge the work done by the Law Reform Commission in preparing and researching over many years the reports which have been published setting out the basis for this Bill.  It is important that we as legislators ensure that the reports from the Law Reform Commission are not left gathering dust on shelves and are brought before this House at the earliest opportunity for discussion and comment, leading to the introduction of new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In commending the Bill I have a general reservation, not in relation to its provisions but in relation to its enforcement and effectiveness.  I say that in the knowledge that many sections of the Children Act, which went through this House after many years of debate and constructive work in Committee, have not been brought into effect.  It is an Act of major importance in updating the law in relation to children.  There is little point in discussing and debating legislation if following its enactment nothing happens on the ground.  The Opposition parties assist by means of constructive comment and argument in improving legislation and signals are given to the public that the Legislature is doing certain things in areas of difficulty.  I detect great worry among many professional people in the health boards and other areas regarding the implementation of provisions of the Child Care Act.  Many people reasonably assumed that the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, were in effect and <Col N="1716" /> that we had updated the machinery necessary for various aspects of forensic testing.  They will have been informed in recent days that we are still in the preparation mode.  The bona fides of the Minister and the Minister of State will be judged in relation to this Bill when it actually takes effect.</P>
    <P>There are many mechanical aspects of this Bill in terms of the infrastructure of court houses etc.  I should like to feel that while the Bill is under discussion all aspects in relation to the improvement of court houses, video recordings and so on are effectively being organised.  There is little point in the discussion ending, having created a level of expectation outside the House, if nothing happens in the immediate aftermath of the Bill's passage, which I believe will be speedy.  The Bill is both timely and necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses four major aspects of the law.  We welcome anything that helps to bring to justice people who commit crimes against tourists, who are vulnerable and seen as soft targets, because those perpetrating crimes against them believe there is no possibility of being brought to justice.  A very strong message must go out from this Chamber that such crimes will not be tolerated and will be brought to an abrupt end.  The weight of justice will be brought to bear on those who commit crimes against tourists.</P>
    <P>The admissability of business records is long overdue and very necessary, but some clarification may be needed on Committee Stage.  I hope we will not create another industry where documents are prepared with the intention that they will be used in court some years hence. We will discuss that matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the compellability of spouses.  The Minister has taken into account the most recent law in this respect and that is to be welcomed.  The Law Reform Commission reported prior to the most recent case in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the People <i>v.</i> JT. Cognisance has been taken of that decision and of the unconstitutionality of <Col N="1717" /> certain aspects.  That is an area of law which is in need of reform.</P>
    <P>The aspect of this Bill which will receive most attention from the point of view of the public will be the area dealing with the giving of evidence by children and persons with a mental handicap in cases of physical or sexual abuse.  While I welcome the direction the Minister has taken, I had hoped he would have taken a broader view in relation to the whole area of child sexual abuse.  It is heartening that we are beginning to recognise the extent of the problems in this country. They touch on an area which we have been slow to recognise and acknowledge, as we have been in other areas in relation to morality, child sexual abuse or sexual abuse generally.  I welcome the fact that we are setting out to address many aspects of very difficult problems in that area.  I had hoped that the Minister and the Department would have gone for the generality of the subject where we could have looked at all aspects of the problems. Perhaps this has to be done in co-operation with other Departments, because it is not solely confined to the Department of Justice.  I would have thought we should have looked at all aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent necessity for us to analyse and appreciate the causes of the alarming increase in the whole area of child sexual abuse.  These have been documented in the recent debates which have taken place and in the figures published last week by Childline.  Most normal healthy people must have been absolutely appalled by the scale of the problem which exists.</P>
    <P>We need to look also at the question of prevention, the question of protection for those who are most vulnerable, deterrents and punishment all of which are interrelated.  While we are about to address the question of evidence and the difficulties that have emerged in the laws of evidence as they have developed in our courts system, we may be focusing too narrowly on one aspect of a very difficult area.  In that respect the Department of Justice may well have to look at the application of the law in its widest <Col N="1718" /> sense in relation to sexual offences and physical and sexual abuse of children or persons with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>I can understand the desirability of reducing and trying to remove the courtroom drama from this area of law.  The trappings of the legal profession &mdash; the wigs and gowns &mdash; which are normally considered to be the courtroom drama are being removed, and that is welcome. There are those who would argue that as we are heading into the 21st century we should remove ourselves from the Victorian wigs and gowns at any rate in relation to all our law.  As one who wore a wig and gown for a period I have no objection because in this day and age they are quite bizarre.</P>
    <P>In relation to enhancing the atmosphere in which children can give evidence, much remains to be done.  We must keep in mind and give much consideration to the taking of evidence.  This is an area in which the Minister and the Department will have to achieve a balance. I have no doubt that in due course the criminal lawyers in the Four Courts, or in the other buildings which will be used for the implementation of this legislation, will give this legislation fine combing because we are dealing with very fundamental aspects of law.  In setting out to enhance and protect the rights of those who have suffered from very serious criminal, physical and sexual attack we will be touching on fundamental aspects of law in relation to the accused.  In some respects there is a fine line about which the Minister will have to be extremely careful in crossing. Obviously the presumption of innocence is well enshrined in our criminal law system and any infringement of that will not be viewed lightly by our judges.  On Committee Stage I hope we will have an opportunity for an exchange of views in this area.  Obviously much research has taken place and many reports have been done in relation to this whole area and it impinges on this area of the legislation.  I had hoped the Department would have taken the wider perspective, but this is a first stab at bringing our laws up to date in this whole area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> We have made major progress in facing up to the difficulties.  Most Members of this House are now aware of the extent of the problems.  I am sure there is no Member of this House who would not be wholeheartedly of the view that all of us &mdash; politicians, lawyers, professionals, social workers, the medical and other professions &mdash; must do our utmost to create the environment in which we can tackle this very serious problem.  Perhaps the Minister would address this matter in his closing remarks on Second Stage or during the course of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>When examining the whole area of prevention, protection, deterrents and punishment we may need to broaden our approach at that stage because of the whole conduct of cases in relation to sexual abuse of children and the dissatisfaction that has been expressed on many occasions.  We have heard case after case cited here where the Probation Act has been applied and where people give themselves to therapy or otherwise. We all know the litany of defences which are put forward and, whether we like it or not, many of these defences are legitimate in relation to the problems which people have which eventually manifest themselves in this most horrific of crimes.</P>
    <P>If we are setting out to eliminate the incidence of physical and sexual abuse of children and persons with mental handicap, we must view it as a broader problem. I am worried that in the Bill we are only attempting to get to grips with it at the stage where we are in the courtroom. In that respect I would ask the Minister to go back a stage further to the whole environment in which these crimes manifest themselves.  We may well need a whole new <i>corpus</i> of State infrastructure to deal with sexual offenders.  As a consequence of this Bill the weight of justice may be brought to bear more easily and more readily on sexual offenders, and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>We have to go back and look at the environment in which these crimes are committed.  If the Bill succeeds, as I think it will 90 per cent of the time &mdash; we will <Col N="1720" /> offer some suggestions on Committee Stage to improve it &mdash; it will make justice more readily available and, in many respects, remove the trauma out of the court room.  We have all read about the horrific trauma which the court room itself brings upon the victims of these crimes.  The efforts being made in this legislation to avoid this are commendable and the Bill may well achieve what it sets out to do in this regard.</P>
    <P>As other Deputies mentioned, suggestions have been made in regard to what should happen when the convicted criminal returns to society.  It has been suggested that the person should be removed from the environment or move out of the locality but it has also been argued strongly that this may have worse consequences than if the accused remains in the environment where the difficulties are known.  We should also address the question of whether provision should be made in this legislation for barring orders given that they are an effective method of prevention.</P>
    <P>There is a need for education, understanding and openness in discussing these problems.  There has been a reticence about discussing these problems in institutions such as this and among the community at large.  There is a need for educators, teachers, social workers and the professionals involved in this area to be more forthcoming and assist legislators in getting to grips with what is perhaps one of the most serious and difficult areas of law.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as anyone who reads the newspapers, even as late as today, would know, the trauma does not go away after the criminal has been punished. Research shows that the trauma and the effects of child sexual abuse last for many years, if not for a lifetime.  That is another reason we have to address the generality rather than the narrow aspect of the trial.  In many cases the severe traumatic effects and the physical and mental difficulties which occur for the offended persons may not manifest themselves for many years.  In this respect it is extremely important that the services of the State are available <i>ab initio</i> for victims <Col N="1721" /> and that the individuals, and families affected &mdash; obviously in most cases it will be the families who will make decisions &mdash; have absolute confidence in the sensitivity, compassion and willingness of the machinery of the State to co-operate and assist, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The question of what should be done with persons who have been accused, indicated or convicted of crimes in this area should be addressed.  I am not sure if an adequate amount of work has been done on what should happen after the court case.  Obviously, they are two separate scenarios.  While we must ensure that the machinery of the State caters for the person who has been abused and grievously offended and who is going to have problems we also must ensure that there are adequate deterrents within the criminal law system.  The question of whether punishment is an effective deterrent or otherwise ought to be the subject of a wider debate.  It is extremely important that we apply ourselves to the task of deciding what should happen the accused and convicted person after the court case. Will the Minister inform us if research work is being undertaken by either the Law Reform Commission or the Department of Justice on this issue because we will only be stabbing at this problem if we do not address that aspect also.  I accept, however, that there might not be as many kudos for addressing that side of the problem as there will be for addressing the needs of children or persons who have been abused or physically assaulted in the first instance who should be our first priority.</P>
    <P>The debate inside and outside this House on this issue will focus in the main on the giving of evidence by children and persons with a mental handicap in cases involving physical and sexual assault.  I suggest that it will also be the subject of widespread debate among the professionals dealing with these problems at health board level and among the forces of law and order.  Obviously, the rules of evidence will come into play once this Bill is passed but we have to be extremely careful.  While the intentions are commendable, with the utmost integrity <Col N="1722" /> attached, ultimately, control in regard to the taking of evidence will lie in the hands of the man or woman on the bench.</P>
    <P>The laws of evidence have evolved quite slowly during the years and in some respects we are attempting to speed up their evolution in this Bill.  As we are all aware, in relation to the discussion on many aspects of evidence, the presumption of innocence, the question of proof and the cross-examination process, they are not going to change overnight. I am not sure if we can, as legislators, attempt to control the taking of evidence. Much criticism has emanated from the legal profession in regard to the objectivity of specialists in this area and this will present the Minister with a difficulty. Section 13 refers to the power to appoint intermediaries.  We will have to tease out the powers we are going to give them. Are we talking here about trained specialists or lawyers who will become quasi lawyers for the purposes of a particular type of trial?  This matter merits much discussion and teasing out on Committee Stage where I will ask the Minister and the Minister of State to clarify and elaborate on this aspect.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states that the intermediary must be a person whom the court considers competent to perform this function. Are we going to set down guidelines in relation to whom we consider to be a competent person in relation to these cases?  It is extremely important that we address the issue of the objectivity of specialists and the necessity to keep a balance.</P>
    <P>Another area which will cause problems in implementation is the attempt to make the taking of evidence compatible with the stage of development of the child.  It may be all very well to assume that we can change the method of examination and cross-examination of witnesses but these have developed over a period.  Some people think that we should try to remove the confrontational aspect from these type of cases but that will not be easy in relation to the rights of the accused enshrined in our legal system.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the freedom of expression of the witness. <Col N="1723" /> Obviously, much can be said for taking evidence in the aftermath of the crime, which must be commended, because instantaneous recall should be more reliable than trying to recall events many months later when the case comes to trial.</P>
    <P>The area of the preparation of video-recording certainly needs to be examined in greater detail.  The object and the intention are, unquestionably, correct but the taking of evidence by video recording and how we set up the structure in this regard are important.  Do we want to have a certain level of clarity and performance in video recording?  Will we make it clear that it is a new system of taking evidence and that it is taken as it comes, so to speak?  These matters will have to be examined in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I welcome this long overdue Bill but we are still dealing with technical areas of evidence which need clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with identification procedure and it will have to be teased out in greater detail because we are all aware of the unreliability of identity parades and the whole question of identification. I am worried about the presumption attributable in this section; obviously there are built-in safety mechanisms but the making of rebuttable presumptions in relation to the person so identified having to be the accused, could possibly infringe on the basic tenets of our laws of evidence.</P>
    <P>I have little to add in relation to the other aspects of the Bill.  Some clarification is obviously necessary and it would be worthwhile to consider the question of compelling spouses to give evidence.  It is an area of law which has been in need of reform for some time. The first and prime area identified by the Minister in relation to physical and sexual abuse is obviously one which will warrant most attention on Committee Stage.  I hope that the Minister will then at least spell out the parameters of the area of crimes of a sexual nature and crimes of physical abuse of children and persons with mental handicap.  Unless we do that we are missing a particularly good and <Col N="1724" /> timely opportunity of addressing this problem at long last.  I commend the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, for introducing this Bill and taking on this matter.  I do not doubt the abilities of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in this area as I know he has a very good understanding of law and the legal system.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a more general approach on this question.  While I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction, the panoply of problems in this area must be addressed as it may be some time before we get another opportunity of improving the law.  I appeal to the Minister to take an early opportunity of improving the law.  I appeal to the Minister to take an early opportunity to outline to the House the more general response from the Department of Justice to a very difficult problem which I am glad we are addressing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues on all sides of the House in welcoming this Bill, which involves fundamental changes to criminal law and is based on a tremendous sense of natural justice.  It takes into consideration the fact that our present built-in procedures, which have been practised for so long, do not facilitate natural justice and indeed at times do not allow natural justice to emerge.</P>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Minister said that Article 40.2º of the Constitution obliges the State by its laws &ldquo;to protect as best it may from unjust attack and in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.&rdquo;  In this Bill we are doing that, not just for the citizens of this State but for the citizens of other States who visit this country and who may be victims of crime.  We have all collectively suffered embarrassment and shame when tourists have not met with the traditional hospitality of which we are very proud but indeed have been attacked and, in some cases, have died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate to extend the provisions of this Bill to citizens outside this State, not just in regard to being proud of the way we treat visitors but as an extension in principle of our laws <Col N="1725" /> within the European dimension because we are reminded daily of the fact that we are not just an island isolated from what happens in the rest of Europe.  What stood the test of time in regard to our traditional law based on precedents and procedures won through the courts and Constitution need to embrace the realities of today's life.  This could be a positive element in relation to television linkage and communication and its use, but we must also consider the tragic aspect, that there is a level of violence within our society, particularly affecting vulnerable people.  I regard sexual abuse of young people, people with a physical or mental disability, and vulnerable women, as the most heinous and unacceptable crime in our society.  I welcome the provision which will enable a spouse to give evidence in certain cases.  As we all know from certain cases, spouses who feel in conscience that they should give evidence, particularly in cases involving physical or sexual abuse of a family member, have been threatened and intimidated by their spouses.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest protections we as legislators have is the availability of advice from legal practitioners both inside and outside this House who always rightly warn us, because of the implications of new law, of the dangers of drafting legislation which may be brought in with the best intentions but which, when tested, could work against the very principle for which it was introduced. Like Deputy Spring, I believe that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Flynn, must be particularly pleased to have introduced such a positive Bill.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on his appointment.  He is part of that legally esteemed group who always warn us of the dangers and implications of introducing legislation without taking all aspects into consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation as it will fundamentally change the thinking and practice which has existed in the area of law for many years.  It is aimed at protecting the more vulnerable people in our <Col N="1726" /> society, people who may have been traumatised and damaged both physically and psychologically as a result of abuse.  We need to give these people all the support necessary to enable them to make their case.  We also need to ensure that all the support systems which will facilitate handicapped people in making their cases are put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to mention that arrangements are being made to have the necessary technical facilities installed in the Four Courts this year to enable evidence to be given there by live television link.  The system will then be extended to a courthouse in the south and in the west of the country and will be further extended later in the light of experience.  In the meantime provision is being made in section 16 to enable courts in areas without these facilities to transfer cases of this kind to areas which have them.</P>
    <P>This is an example of the practical measures which are necessary to ensure that the legislation can be enforced after it is enacted.  Like other Members of the House, I welcome the updating and refurbishing of courthouses, which will give greater comfort and space to victims and the people who accompany them. Like most of us, these people can be very intimidated by the formal procedures in courts.  Proper facilities for victims should be provided in all courthouses as quickly as possible so as to ensure that people from rural areas are not dragged up to Dublin unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the provision of proper facilities for victims in courthouses, I would put down a marker to the Minister that these facilities should be provided in as many courthouses as possible so that they will be available to people in their own regions.  I wish to add my voice to the call &mdash; I know that practitioners in the area of law would be the first to support us in this &mdash; for rationalisation and refurbishment of our courts to be carried out as quickly as possible to provide space, privacy and comfort which victims of such cases are <Col N="1727" /> not merely entitled to but need.  I should like to think that the Minister is committed to this.</P>
    <P>If our courts are to be seen to treat people equally, all courthouses should have the same facilities and be modernised. This will ensure that people will not be frightened of attending them.  I will not refer to this point any further as everyone in the House knows about the terrible conditions in some courthouses, where legal people have to carry out their briefings with clients in hallways, corridors, toilets and even on the footpaths outside the courthouse.  In welcoming the Bill, I would point out that we need to take these aspects of the law into account as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill would make admissible as evidence a video recording of an interview with qualified people, which very often takes place shortly after the alleged offence, provided that the alleged victim is available for cross-examination by the accused. This provision is vitally important, particularly in cases of child sexual abuse, as it will strengthen cases.  Without such evidence a case might be weakened or put at risk.  I very much welcome this provision. On Committee Stage I will discuss in more detail the need to ensure that the people who conduct interviews and the intermediary are properly qualified and that their roles are clearly defined.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the abolition of the requirement that a child's unsworn evidence be corroborated and also the requirement that the jury be warned about conviction on a child's sworn but uncorroborated evidence.  Many of us have struggled with a similar issue in another area.  We welcomed very much the abolition of a similar provision from rape legislation.  In the area of justice every support must be given to the victims, but also to the juries who must be objective in deciding a case based on the evidence presented to them and the parameters under which evidence is allowed to be given under this Bill.  It is very important that evidence is not undermined by a <Col N="1728" /> judge being required to remind the jury that such evidence is uncorroborated.</P>
    <P>In the areas of rape and sexual abuse the chances are that evidence will be uncorroborated is so far as most of those crimes are carried out in private and there is much guilt, secrecy and intimidation involved particularly in the case of child abuse.  Up to now the victims of rape and child abuse were put in an unsustainable position in that the law provided that the judge had to warn the jury that the evidence was uncorroborated and therefore they had to be very careful.  In these cases it is almost impossible for the evidence to be other than uncorroborated. That provision did a tremendous amount of psychological damage to the victims who were under great strain and reexperiencing much of the suffering they had already undergone.  It was helpful to nobody and I welcome its abolition in this case, as I did the abolition of the similar provision in rape legislation.</P>
    <P>Another important measure in this Bill is that which provides that a wife be obliged to give evidence for the purpose of prosecution if her husband is accused of violence or a sexual offence against a child.  This is a fundamental change in the law in that it recognises the circumstances of wives of spouses who commit violent acts and ensure that justice prevails.  If a crime of physical or sexual violence is committed within a family the wife as well as the children may be intimidated or physically threatened, and this measure provides that such a wife must give evidence against her husband.</P>
    <P>Even more disturbing is the circumstance where, for whatever reason, a wife pretends that violence is not taking place.  She may feel that loyalty to her husband and to the family unit precludes her from the responsibility of giving evidence against her husband.  This measure safeguards the wife where acts of violence are committed against her.  It is an extension of the provision in rape legislation, which has been universally welcomed by all fair minded men as well as by women; whereby rape can be established within marriage and a wife can take a case of marital rape against her husband.  That <Col N="1729" /> was a tremendous breakthrough and provides great support for wives in circumstances where they are threatened by their husbands.  This provision is a further example of that kind of support.  It is absolutely essential that a wife should be obliged by law to give evidence in cases of violence, be it of a physical or psychological nature.  The Minister pointed out that this provision will in no way interfere with the traditional right of a wife not to give evidence against her husband in other cases.  I welcome this very fundamental change in the law which will ensure justice for spouses and children.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will remember the Child Care Bill under which we made provision to protect sexually abused children. Great emphasis was placed on the fact that it should be mandatory for teachers, social workers and other people working with young children who may be in a position to identify abuse to report these cases.  As I have said, I welcome the similar provision in this Bill which obliges wives to give evidence against their husbands in cases of violence.  In a small country such as Ireland, where many people know one another, an incredible burden is placed on teachers, social workers or friends of a family who report cases of abuse, considering that they have no legal responsibility to do so. This provision will allow people, particularly within small communities, to report such cases without the family taking offence or believing that it should not have been reported.  Society must come to terms with the fact that every support must be given with regard to the reporting of physical and particularly sexual abuse against children.  Very often children have to rely on the maturity, responsibility and attentiveness of adults to protect their rights as well as protecting them physically and emotionally.  The more ways that we can build in support and protection for the people who do that, the better, and the better protection we offer our children.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Bill seeks to provide reasonable balance in relation to compelling a spouse to give evidence in certain cases, that it seeks to <Col N="1730" /> strike a reasonable balance between the interests of protecting the institution of marriage and protecting and vindicating the rights of spouses and children who are the victims of offences.  It is very important that we do not allow a lack of balance in this regard.  I have been concerned often by reports of some child sexual abuse cases, particularly within the family, usually the offender being the husband.  Often a case has been made and, indeed, sometimes accepted, that because the husband and father is a good provider, because he does not also beat his wife and because it is felt that he is the breadwinner and will look after the rest of the unit, those qualities should ameliorate or reduce the enormity of the offence he has carried out against his child or children.  As a society we could not possibly allow such a balance to be made in a judgment, that in some way such consideration would diminish the offence within a family.  When we talk about a reasonable balance we must remember that retention of the family unit or the input of the breadwinner to the family unit in terms of income should not upset that balance in terms of the sentencing and treatment of the offending parent to the extent that it in any way diminishes the breadth and depth of the offence carried out.</P>
    <P>I make a fervent plea that in this particularly difficult and sensitive area especially where children and people who do not have the competence to make a case for themselves are concerned we ensure not only the provision of the court facilities to give the support and comfort necessary but also that judges have first-class training in this area and have the level of sensitivity necessary to deal with such cases.  In this regard, I am very aware, as we all are, that we are now introducing new legislation and judges are being confronted by cases of a kind they did not have to come to terms with until some time ago.  We do need some kind of training to keep judges who are on the Bench at present up to date, something like the in-service training provided for teachers.  In future there should be a requirement for adequate training in the <Col N="1731" /> area in question before people are appointed to the Bench.  That is a good practice that is in existence in many other countries.  Because of reaction to some of the horrific crimes with which judges are now confronted, because of new legislation being enacted and because of the emergence of crimes and offences that judges have not had to deal with until recently, there should be a form of briefing, seminars or in-service training that would inform and sensitise our judges.  In no way do I wish to denigrate the Judiciary but all of us, in whatever position we find ourselves, whether as legislators, social workers or as part of a family within the community, find it very traumatic when we have to come to terms with crimes such as child sexual abuse. We all have such a natural reaction against those offences that skill is required to deal with them and overcome a feeling of revulsion.  It is in that context that I argue for the provision of training for judges to enable them to cope adequately with such offences.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (2) provides that in cases for which it is deemed essential or supportive an intermediary be appointed by the court and that such intermediary shall be a person who, in the opinion of the court, is competent to act in that role.  I recognise the thrust of the Bill but perhaps the Minister would expand on that provision in response to the Second Stage debate.  Certainly I hope that it will be teased out much more on Committee Stage.  A very clear definition would be required to protect the rights of everyone concerned, particularly the intermediary. For instance, an intermediary who could operate at a highly skilled level in relation to the psychological aspect might be unprepared for the kind of cross-examination or other procedures that he or she had to undergo in court.  The House will have to ensure that intermediaries would not be put into an invidious position when it came to the procedures and the hard practices of the courts.</P>
    <P>Part II concerns an area in which the lack of protection for victims of certain crimes has scandalised people in the same <Col N="1732" /> way as many of us were scandalised by the realisation, arising from the outcome of a recent court case, that our legislation did not seen to be able to compel one spouse to give evidence against the other. That case went against the victim for that reason.  People have also asked urgent questions of us, have asked that we explain why people in the business world who have been the victims of fraud and deliberate rip off have not been protected. They want to know why our legislation does not seem to provide for the kind of response from the courts that people should be able to expect.</P>
    <P>In broadly welcoming this Part of the Bill, I appreciate that not only have we gone down the road of building in extra protections but it is recognised that there is a tremendous amount of business now conducted by way of computer and computer printouts.  Indeed, it is a pleasure for us to note not alone their introduction but the acceptance of such modern facilities as television, video recordings and computer printouts as an essential component of evidence in court.</P>

    <P>I would emphasise that, ultimately, it is in the hands of consumers themselves to ensure that they reap the benefits of a competitive market by being aware of price developments and prices charged by different outlets and by purchasing accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While the main thrust of the Minister's reply is not unacceptable, there is another factor here he should take into account, that is the hiring of what are termed &ldquo;brown goods&rdquo; in the electrical trade, commodities such as television sets and the like, as we observed in the recent controversy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ESB, which are frequently bought on hire purchase, rental agreements and or deferred payment agreements.  Sometimes within the period of any such agreement, when there is a reduction or a change in taxes &mdash; as happened last year in the reduction of the higher VAT rate &mdash; such reductions are not passed on to the hirer of the equipment.  Would the Minister ensure that any such reduction would be passed on to the consumer, or at least that he would issue instructions to the traders concerned to so do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it did happen this year.  There was not a VAT reduction this year on these goods but there were substantial reductions in excise duties in the budget effective from 29 January last. My information is that the trade did pass such reductions on, in that they advertised &ldquo;duty free televisions and videos&rdquo; in the immediate post-budget period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is not the same thing.  That would refer to a television set hired or rented for the first time, whereas I am talking about sets, say, hired under agreement two years ago <Col N="1734" /> and on which excise duty would have been paid at that time.  The VAT on the rental would still be carried through.  If there was a reduction in VAT that should be passed on as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a reduction in VAT but, as I told the Deputy, there was not a reduction in VAT is this budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there was last year when the Director of Consumer Affairs was asked to ensure that reduction was passed on last year.  But in respect of television sets, for example, the hire of which commenced prior to the budget, the removal of excise duty on them would not affect their capital cost and therefore would not affect their rental.  Of course, there would be an effect on the rental of sets hired after budget day this year.  I believe that lower rentals do reflect the repeal of all excise duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no complaint with what the Minister is saying except in the example I have given of sets hired prior to the 1991 Budget and which incorporated the cost of the VAT at the then rate.  The VAT has been reduced, therefore the rental of these sets should be reduced.  Is the Minister aware that, during the recent controversy in regard to the ESB and retail traders ESB workers contended that many independent traders were not passing on those VAT reductions, which is the reason for my tabling this question?</P>
      <P>Another factor that arose in the course of that controversy as well, from the other side of the fence, was the contention that the ESB were not providing an after-sales service.  Therefore I will be requesting the Minister next month, when questions arise again, to ensure that all suppliers of goods will provide requisite after-sales service as well.</P>

      <Quest>if he will elaborate on statements recently attributed to him to the effect that long term unemployment will be a permanent feature of the Irish economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to my intervention in the debate in this House on a motion for a jobs forum on 26 February 1992.  On that occasion I spoke of the challenge of providing jobs for the unprecedented number of people who are seeking work in this country.  It is an enormous challenge.  I commented that the enormity of the problem means that there are no instant or short term solutions.  It is important that we are not beguiled by suggestions that there are.  However, it would be wrong, to attribute to me the view that long term unemployment is a &ldquo;permanent feature of the Irish economy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That policy must have regard to the demographic pressures over the remainder of this decade when some 60,000 people per annum, representing about 25,000 net extra people each year, will be seeking to enter the labour force here.  Various groups, such as the ESRI and the Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; also called the Culliton group &mdash; have noted this and also the implication that our serious unemployment problems are likely to be a feature of life in Ireland for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>It is in this light that I advocated that a new forum on unemployment should address the needs of the unemployed, particularly those of the long term unemployed. I recommended a number of issues that such a forum could, I feel, usefully address.  I have also indicated my belief in the importance of ensuring that the unemployed themselves have the opportunity to present their views and proposals through unemployment action groups and similar initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Determined action is needed to address their understandable frustration <Col N="1736" /> and sense of alienation and to accord them a more meaningful role in our society than that which they have now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the Minister when he says that the increasing levels of unemployment present an enormous challenge, leaving aside variations in policy between those of his party and mine, would he not agree that, on the facts alone, that is a challenge he, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and this Government have palpably failed to meet; that the regular, inexorable increase in the numbers of our unemployed cast a blight and shame on this country; that the Minister, by his statement, holds out no prospect for even holding the unemployment levels obtaining, let alone reducing them: that it is a policy of despair, in effect, is no policy at all; that the Minister and this Government are playing no active interventionist role to provide those jobs we need so badly and have needed so badly for a long time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>After that ideological speech, Sir, may I say that the Deputy might turn his attention towards the regular, inexorable increase in employment here over the past five or six years, details of which I will be giving in reply to a later question.  The fact of the matter is that, unlike most other European countries, we have a regular, consistent increase in employment.  The fact that we have very high unemployment now is due to demographic factors, of which I am sure the Deputy is as well aware as I am.  Indeed this Government have faced that very unusual problem in a very constructive manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a major component of the problem is the reliance of himself, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and of this Government on the private sector to create the levels of employment we need; their failure to intervene in the economy, in the public and semi-State sector, to actively go in there and provide those jobs?  Would he agree that the <Col N="1737" /> problem is that this Government do not recognise that as an essential factor in the equation in tackling our unemployment problem and that until that is done the fugures will continue to spiral merrily on their way?  Will the Minister agree there is little point in saying that the levels of employment have increased while our emigration and unemployment figures go up?</P>

      <P>Whatever about anything else, certainly our emigration figures are not going up.  The Deputy wants me to ask the Government to concentrate primarily on the public sector.  I am not prepared to do that and, so far as job creation is concerned, it would not be wise.  The primary engine for growth here now and in the future will be the private sector.  The public sector have an important part to play but it is not a predominant one and it will not become a predominant one.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends asking the IDA and An Bord Tráchtála to open offices in South Africa; and his views on whether the opening of such offices would be beneficial to both countries.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Representatives from the IDA, ABT and other State agencies and private companies accompanied me on a business mission to South Africa last November.  I gave a detailed report of my visit to the House on 18 December last when I indicated that the realisible potential of the market for Irish goods and services would be best served, in the short term, by the appointment of a trade consultant there rather than by the opening of a trade office.  That is still the position and An Bord Tráchtála are currently engaged in appointing such a consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ABT are also further researching South Africa as a market for Irish <Col N="1738" /> exporters.  The outcome of this work will be reviewed with potential exporters prior to possible sectoral missions in late 1992 and in 1993.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the IDA that at present they are not considering the opening of an office in South Africa.  The IDA are working on developing the contacts established during the mission and should business develop significantly, they would consider the possiblity of establishing an office in South Africa. The decision will depend on the likely business to be generated by such an office and the costs of operating it.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in December last, our interests in time would be served by having a trade office in Johannesburg. An Bord Tráchtála do not feel it would be appropriate to open such an office within the next six to nine months but will keep the matter under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that it is in the interests of both countries to open an official Government office from this country in South Africa and that it will encourage the Government there to continue along the path of dismantling apartheid?  Will the Minister agree that it would be of benefit to our exports to that country and would give us the possibility of using South Africa as a base for influence throughout southern Africa and for obtaining contracts for construction, training and other areas in which An Bord Tráchtála are now interested?  Will the Minister push to ensure that there is an official Irish Government presence in South Africa as soon as possible for trade and political reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That question relates to a separate matter which is really a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  So far as trade is concerned my attitude is <Col N="1739" /> that as soon as the trade levels or the potential investment levels warrant it, there will be an office.  I hope that will be very quickly.  At the moment, as the Deputy will be aware, the South African economy is protected by very heavy tariffs with the result that trade which might otherwise develop will not.  I understand it is the policy of the South African Government to try to reduce or remove those tariffs as soon as possible. They cannot do it overnight because of the unusual circumstances in South Africa and the South African economy but, as soon as trade can develop to a more meaningful level, we will open such an office.  We have an honorary consulate there but we do not have an official presence. I look forward to our having such a presence at an early date.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs would share my anxiety in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would help, but it is hard to justify the office in economic terms until we have an opportunity for trade.  However, the South African Government are well aware that the Irish Government support them in their efforts to dismantle apartheid.  I take the opportunity to wish them well in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. Malley Mr. Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 16, 28, 39, 45, 48, 67 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the concept that Community industrial policy should promote permanent adaptation to industrial change in an open and competitive market; that this policy be implemented through the creation of a favourable environment for firms' initiative, and that industrial problems at a regional or sectoral level should increasingly be resolved by horizontal measures, for example, internal market, standardisation, competition policy.</P>
      <P>We believe that the objective of a Community industrial policy should be to create a favourable economic climate for firms through low inflation, low interest rates and measures to promote economic convergence and cohesion. Open competitive markets should be the aim rather than measures to protect or promote specific industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>In relation to State aids, as recommended by the Industrial Policy Review Group, Ireland will continue to actively promote the case for more effective EC restrictions on State aids for industry in the more developed regions with a view to promoting regional cohesion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland supports the Commission view that structural adjustment mainly involves three stages and that the Community's <Col N="1744" /> industrial policy must strike a balance between the three.</P>
    <P>The first of these stages is the achievement of the necessary prerequisites for structural adjustment.  This involves securing a stable economic environment in order, in particular, to strengthen firms' ability to invest; maintaining a competitive environment by keeping a careful watch on large mergers and acquisitions and controlling State aid rigorously; guaranteeing a high level of educational attainment as the basis for generating and assimilating new technologies and organisational methods; promoting economic and social cohesion between Community regions, with emphasis being placed on the role of the Structural Fund for areas with lagging economies; and achieving a high level of environmental protection in order to safeguard human health and the natural environment and create new markets as a source of competition for &ldquo;clean&rdquo; growth.</P>
    <P>The Commission has defined the second stage as the pursuit of measures for underpinning structural adjustment, including: completion of the internal market, to be achieved in particular by improving European standards and product quality, liberalising public procurement, abolishing national import quotas and establishing a coherent legal framework and trans-European networks; and an open trade policy as a necessary complement to the opening of the internal market, with strict respect for the internationally agreed rules by all world trade partners; this includes refraining from unfair trading practices and the Community being willing to take effective action to defend itself.</P>
    <P>The third stage involves means of speeding up structural adjustment such as: development of firms' technological capabilities by providing more favourable conditions for the planning, development, diffusion and use of advanced technologies; a dynamic policy towards small and medium-sized enterprises, designed to limit red-tape, increase co-operation and improve access to Community and world markets; and better use of human resources and easier <Col N="1745" /> introduction of new technologies and working methods as a result of worker training and retraining.</P>
    <P>This approach at Community level is consistent with the broader way of dealing with industrial development which we ourselves are now implementing in line with the recommendations of the Culliton report.</P>

      <P>One wonders why we have any employment problems with that kind of a scenario?  Does the Minister not think it is manifestly not the case that to rely on competition policy alone and to rely on the creation of low inflation competitively priced labour market that he talks about will make an impact on our unemployment problems; that in the normal course of events power, wealth and jobs will accrete to the centre of the Community, and that there should be some instrument in industrial policy to bring jobs to the people rather than bring people to the jobs?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied, having regard to what he has just said, that equal opportunities exist for the people of this country <i>vis-á-vis</i> other EC countries, given the directives and adjustments that my question refers to?  For example, does an Irish unemployed person, have a reasonably equal chance <Col N="1746" /> of getting a job with a person living in Germany, Holland or France, given the investment policy and proposed policies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I reply first to Deputy Rabbitte's supplementary question? He is wrong in judging my fairly lengthy reply as one that concentrated solely on competition policy and allied matters, as that is clearly not the case.</P>
      <P>In reply to both Deputy Durkan and Deputy Rabbitte, I would say that neither a citizen living in Ireland nor in some other peripheral State such as Portugal and Greece, in particular, has an equal chance of employment.  They do not, and certainly not of the same value or type of employment.  The whole point of the Maastricht Treaty with its emphasis on cohesion is that, whereas they did not have it in the past they will increasingly have it in the future.  It will not change overnight, because if we were to have something like the European Monetary Union on its own without anything else, all the pressure would be back towards the centre.  The Community recognises that very fully and that is why it seeks so hard in Maastricht to develop its regional and cohesion policies.  In particular, we will be discussing a different aspect of this, but one which I think is equally relevant, in a later question on State aids because the Community's policies on State aids is of enormous importance in achieving the kind of objectives that Deputy Durkan speaks of.  The primary criterion for the Community in respect of State aids policies in the future will be cohesion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with what is deemed to be the spirit of Maastricht, there are a couple of disturbing factors that have arisen since then which are relevant to the Minister's answer to my question.  First, as regards the reneging by the British Government on the Social Charter and their claim that for domestic reasons this would put them in a much more competitive position than other member states, I have been endeavouring to find out from the Minister or indeed the Minister for Labour for the <Col N="1747" /> past few months if they agree with that assessment, and, if so, how the competition policy will work if the British say they will be more competitive than the other member states.  Second, the British Foreign Secretary said this week that no moneys have been agreed for Regional Funds and I think he used words like &ldquo;not one penny extra will be available&rdquo;. If a sum of money was agreed at Maastricht for the laudable intention of making the peripheral States more competitive and that the Regional Fund would be applied to help create jobs in the regions, it is somewhat disturbing to find one of the major countries saying that there is no money as no moneys have been voted for this.</P>

      <P>We shall have to proceed by way of supplementary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making the mistake of thinking that because Britain's representatives say something that it is fact.  In my view, the British have put themselves at a great disadvantage. It may not be that they will be outside the Social Charter aspects of the Maastricht Treaty for long because the Labour Party in Britain have declared recently that if they win the forthcoming general election they will immediately sign the Social Charter aspects of the Maastricht Union Treaty.  I am glad to know that.  In the meantime if the British Government were to persist in their view that they did not want to go along with Maastricht in full, I think they are putting themselves particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> investment from third countries at a major disadvantage because they choose for their own reasons not to be fully in accord with the Community and not to be in the fullest sense a full member of the Community. Whatever short term benefits they believe they will gain from that policy will I believe be short lived and of little use to Britain in the longer term.  It is not for me to tell them what their policy should be but it seems to me this is a <Col N="1748" /> consequence of their policy if they choose to continue along that line.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry is concerned that the British Foreign Secretary has said that no money has been voted in respect of Regional or Cohesion Funds.  We are well aware that it has not been voted and the British do not want to vote for it but the Deputy will be familiar, I am sure, with the general nature of the Delors package Mark II.  I have every confidence that the Delors package Mark II will become a Community instrument in the fullness of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that at the end of the day the success of the various measures outlined depends on the major industrial powers in central Europe playing the game, complying with the new regulations on competition, state aids and so on and that our experience with many of them, particularly the Italians and the French, has not been of as high a standard as one would have liked?  Would he agree that great caution will be needed in the future to ensure that they play the game to a greater extent?</P>

      <Quest>if it is intended to introduce an amendment to the Companies Act, 1990, in view of the decision of the High Court on 25 February 1992, that part of the Act was unconstitutional; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that, while the High Court in its judgment delivered on 25 February 1992 found that the power purportedly given to the High Court under the provisions of section 10 (5) of the Companies Act, 1990, to punish an alleged offender in <Col N="1749" /> like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of court is unconstitutional, the court found that the remaining provisions of this subsection, if left intact and operated in conjunction with the provisions of section 10 (6) which follows, provide a convenient and constitutional machinery for dealing with a situation which may arise when persons who should do so fail to co-operate in the investigation being conducted by the inspector.</P>
      <P>I have sought the Attorney General's advice on the High Court judgment as a matter of urgency.  For my part, I will move to amend the Companies Act, 1990, if this is considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the relevant section of the Act, section 10 (5), would be neutered if an officer or agent of a company refused to produce relevant documents, refused to be present for questioning or was otherwise unco-operative?  Would the Minister agree that there must be some deterrent to cause or encourage that person to co-operate, otherwise the value of the section could be put at risk?  I understand the court is offering as an alternative that one could go to the High Court to have them arbitrate on it.  This could add to the expense of the process.  Some penalty or deterrent is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that a deterrent is essential.  The result of the decision is not quite what I thought it was at first sight.  They declared about one-and-a-half lines at the end of subsection (5) unconstitutional.  The judge went on to point out that if you read subsections (5) and (6) together, without the one-and-a-half lines at the end of subsection (5), the two subsections taken together form a coherent and constitutional whole and that the enforceability provision is quite adequate.  The difficulty arose from the fact that section 14 inspectors were brought in to the benefit of section 8 at the last minute on the Report Stage and the consequential thinking was perhaps not done as fully as it might have been. I think it was in response to a proposed Opposition amendment.  I am not saying <Col N="1750" /> that all the consequences should not have been foreseen; they should have been.  It was a change made at the last minute and on reflection it appears that what the court decided was right.  I do not think the situation is unduly weakened.  If it is weakened, we will amend the Bill.  It is not as clear as it seemed at first sight that an amendment is needed.  The court points out that the two subsections can be used together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he will amend the Bill if necessary.  In the event of the necessity arising, does he envisage, having regard to the operation of the Act to date, that any further amendments may be necessary?  Regarding the inspectorate process and the inordinate fees incurred in the one case that has yet come before the courts, is the Minister sufficiently concerned to believe that the Act may need amending?  Could the inspectorate process be put at risk by the prospect of enormous fees to be paid by the company or by the Minister, where they cannot be recouped?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. This relates to subsection (5) of section 10.  The Deputy is asking about section 8.  As I indicated this morning, I have learned some lessons about section 8.  Matters such as cost will be borne in mind in the future.  In order to rectify certain problems which have arisen we do not necessarily need to amend the Act or the section.  We can rectify them by better administrative practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is possible that an amendment will not be necessary. I am sure work is going on in his Department and in the Attorney-General's office in that regard.  Is there any danger that in a second test case the courts may find in favour of somebody because the Act is deemed to be defective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The one-and-a-half lines at the end of subsection (5) of section 10 have been declared unconstitutional, but the courts will now read <Col N="1751" /> the remainder of subsection (5) as a kind of composite with subsection (6) and by finding of the High Court that is constitutional. There is a different penalty and a different way of enforcing the provisions. The one-and-a-half lines that have to be taken out were held to infringe principles laid down in re Haughey in the 1971 Irish Reports which arose out of a subsection in the Public Accounts Committee Act, 1971.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10, 32, 49, 58, 69, 86, 87, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Data is not readily available to my Department which would enable the detail of the information which the Deputies seek in relation to young drivers to be provided.  However, on the basis of available date the overall average price of motor insurance in 1990 prices (i.e. earned premium income, as shown in the annual returns by motor insurers, divided by the number of vehicles registered for road tax) was £398 in 1986, £397 in 1987, £392 in 1988, £373 in 1989 and £389 in 1990.</P>
      <P>Statistical evidence has shown that young drivers are much more likely to be involved in accidents and therefore to cause more claims.</P>
      <P>I understand from the insurance industry that while young policyholders account for only 15 per cent of the total number of policies issued by insurers, young drivers account for 36 per cent of all claims and that the average cost of claims caused by young drivers is over 40 per cent higher than that of more mature drivers.  The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if an appropriate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.  I would point out that the recently reconstituted Motor Insurance Advisory Board (MIAB) are in the process of compiling their annual report, which I understand will concentrate on as assessment of the loadings applied by motor insurers to young drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> In any market the price of insurance, including motor-cycle insurance, is substantially determined by the cost of claims.  I am aware that one insurance company has the predominant share of the motor-cycle insurance market. However, this position has developed over the years not because the company sought a monopoly position but rather because it is the only company which is prepared to do a large volume of motor-cycle insurance business.</P>
    <P>The company has informed me that customers who currently have a rider scheme policy will be offered renewal for their rider policy.  However, this scheme is being withdrawn for new business and for those who choose not to renew their current rider policy.  In future, the motor insurance certificate will bear the registration number of the vehicle, as with private car insurance.  By specifying the vehicle on the insurance certificate, the gardaí can more readily identify those who are not insured and are therefore driving at the expense of those who are. Third party motor insurance is the only form of insurance which is compulsory under the Road Traffic Acts and and queries in this regard should be addressed to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the Coopers and Lybrand Review of Motor Insurance Costs in Ireland and the United Kingdom confirms what I have been saying for the past number of years regarding the level of motor insurance costs in Ireland.  In particular, I am glad to see that the review reiterates the need to examine the level of awards for pain and suffering in this country and also the present mechanisms for resolving personal injury claims.  It also draws attention to the level of professional (including legal) fees in Ireland and the late settlement of some claims.  The report concludes that personal injury claims costs in Ireland are over four times higher than in the United Kingdom and that the proportion of motor insurance claims which include personal injury compensation in this country is five times higher than that in the neighbouring jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The important question is &mdash; why is this <Col N="1755" /> so?  Are Irish people more susceptible to injury in motor accidents and when injured do Irish people suffer more serious injuries than their counterparts in the neighbouring jurisdiction?  Are our compensation levels too high and are our mechanisms for the resolution of personal injury claims too complex and too costly in terms of the level of awards for pain and suffering and the legal and other expenses associated with the settlement of such claims?</P>
    <P>We need as a society to seriously examine these fundamental questions. We cannot continue to claim more often for personal injury as a result of accidents, to accept compensation levels far higher than in other countries and at the same time hold a view that our motor insurance premiums should be on a par with those of other countries.  Unless and until the claims experience, including the claims frequency and levels of compensation paid to victims of road accidents, in Ireland matches that obtaining in other European countries there will be divergences between motor insurance premia in Ireland and those applying in other countries.</P>
    <P>I would add that in the context of the inter ministerial group on motor insurance (IMG), which I chaired, the Minister for Justice agreed that his Department would carry out a review of the levels of compensation awarded by the courts in the State in personal injury cases; and in particular the amounts awarded as general damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life in the light of: (1) A 1991 survey by Davies Arnold Cooper which suggests that personal injury compensation levels in Ireland are substantially higher than in other EC Member States, and, (2) the report, now published by Coopers and Lybrand on personal injury compensation levels in Ireland compared with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>There are at present 30 companies authorised to transact life assurance business and 60 companies authorised to transact non-life insurance business in this country of which 33 non-life <Col N="1756" /> insurance companies are authorised to transact motor insurance, including motor cycle insurance and insurance for young drivers.  The practice whereby insurers refuse to offer a quotation for certain types of risks is a matter for each insurer to decide.  It is not my function to tell insurers how to run their business or to interfere in their rights to accept or reject risks, or to dictate the terms applicable to any insurance policy, or to interfere in their rights to charge realistic premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.  In any event cover is available through the Declined Cases Agreement.</P>
    <P>The Declined Cases Committee, who were established under the Declined Cases Agreement, deal with cases of difficulty in obtaining motor insurance, including motor cycle insurance and insurance for young drivers.  This committee is composed of representatives of the authorised motor insurance companies and examine cases which have been declined by five or more insurance companies and nominates one of the companies to quote for the risk involved. Similar agreements dealing with unavailability of cover for certain motor risks exists in the other member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>At the moment Irish insurance undertakings must be authorised by me to carry on insurance business in Ireland and whether branch or head office are subject to Irish supervision and regulatory control.</P>
    <P>Under current EC legislation, no non-life insurer authorised in Ireland can transact motor insurance into another member state without setting up a branch or head office there.  Similarly, foreign insurers cannot transact motor insurance business in Ireland, unless they are already established here.  I am presently preparing legislation to give effect to the EC Motor Insurance (Services) Directive, which is due to be implemented into law by the end of May 1992, and comes into force at the end of November 1992. This directive will allow EC insurance companies to offer motor insurance cover, on a services basis without being <Col N="1757" /> established, in a uniform manner throughout the EC subject to certain criteria, depending on the size of the risk undertaken.</P>
    <P>While the opening-up of the Community market may intensify competitiion on price, cover and quality of service, it should be noted that there is already a substantial foreign presence in the Irish motor insurance market.  Over 70 per cent of non-life insurance undertakings operating in Ireland are foreign owned.  Increased competition may not necessarily lead to a reduction in insurance costs in Ireland.  Prudent insurers, indigenous, EC established or Community services must set their premium rates to match the compensation payout.  The compensation levels existing in each member state should determine the premium rates charged by both established and services insurers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the inter-ministerial group on motor insurance, whose activities have been well documented in this House, I would refer the Deputy to the contributions which both the Minister for the Environment and I made to a debate here on 2 and 3 July 1991.  The recommendations of that group are in the course of being implemented, and are aimed at assisting in the improvement of the environment for insurance for drivers as a whole, including motor cyclists and young drivers.  Deputies will appreciate that questions about road traffic legislation and legislation in relation to the courts are properly addressed to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I would add that Government action of itself will not reduce or stabilise insurance costs before the end of 1992 or thereafter unless the general public, including motorists of all kinds, play their part by increased awareness of the need for road safety.</P>
    <P>I must once again point out that as the insurance supervisory authority I have a responsibility to ensure that insurance companies meet their statutory solvency and reserving requirements.  The setting of insurance rates by insurance companies are underwriting matters which <Col N="1758" /> are the preserve of insurers to decide in the light of their particular circumstances and assessment of the market and in which I have no function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked many questions and I have almost forgotten the first; do young people need cars and, therefore, insurance to go to work.  Of course they do.  I am well aware of that fact and perhaps they need them even more in this country than in most other countries because of our very poor public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I am so concerned about the matter because so <Col N="1759" /> many people have no option.  I am well aware of the Coopers and Lybrand report which was published about two weeks ago, and I have referred to it at length. As I have said in my reply the information which is set out in that report confirms what I have been saying for some years. I appreciate and welcome the publication of this report because it gives us precise statistics which cannot be quarrelled with.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in the course of a very long reply, in which I tried to cover every aspect of this matter, the nub of the question for us in this country is whether we want to continue to have personal injury awards that are four times higher than in the neighbouring jurisdiction or in the other part of this island and whether we want to continue to have a rate of personal injury claim five times greater than the frequency of claims per a given number of accidents than in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  If so we will continue to pay much higher premiums which the Deputy instanced.  Up to now, so far as I can judge, Irish society wants it this way.  When Irish society wants it otherwise, Irish society will come to grips with the difficulties we have in this abnormal award system.  It will then begin to normalise itself.  The Deputy is correct in saying that professional fees play a major role.  I think I am correct in saying that in 1989 the total pay-out on motor claims in respect of injuries and damage to vehicles and property was approximately £400 million, of which £100 million went in legal and associated costs, such as fees paid to medical witnesses, engineers and so on.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding what the Minister said, will he accept that if he had implemented some of the proposals we submitted in this House last July they would probably have made an impact on insurance premiums to the benefit of the consumer by this stage?  Will he agree that the delay in implementing the proposals put forward by this side of the House and indeed, some put forward by him has meant that the consumer has not <Col N="1760" /> benefited?  Does he admit that the lack of competition is a major contributory factor?  For example, it would be totally unacceptable if we only had one firm of solicitors or one firm of architects offering services here.  It is obvious that if any practice has a monopoly there will be a serious problem.  Will the Minister say what he intends to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The same applies to any young driver of any motor vehicle.  Only one company are prepared to quote for either motor-cyclists or young drivers of motor cars at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the survey conducted by the insurance federation favoured the insurance companies to ensure the continuation of the cartel which is operating at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no evidence of a cartel in this area.  If there was only one firm of solicitors or one firm of architects in Ireland, people would have no choice.  If law or architecture was unprofitable we would not just have one firm of solicitors or architects, we would have no firms.  In regard to the company who are insuring motor-cyclists at present, it is my great fear that they will decide to depart.  What would we do then?  I do not think the Deputy should complain so strongly about them. <Col N="1761" /> I asked my officials to go to see them in the last week or two because they are seeking a further increase and they said, &ldquo;if the Minister does not like our figures, we will solve his problem by packing our bags and going back to Norwich&rdquo;.  Irish motor-cyclists would be worse off in those circumstances.  Therefore, I am not encouraging the company to pack their bags and go back to Norwich.</P>
      <P>We have already witnessed during the past few months the loss of an insurance company from the market.  They had been trading here for 110 years.  That is an ominous development.  I did not rejoice at the departure of that company. Happily, they had only a very small share of the motor market which, apparently, is the one that is most sensitive.  If that company were to be followed by others we would have even less competition than the small amount that Deputy Durkan complains about at present.  The fact of the matter is that the Deputy is not looking at the right end of this equation.  It is a totally loss-making operation. While we pay ourselves five times more than other countries for accidents and claim with far greater frequency we are going to have higher premiums than other countries.  No matter what Deputy Durkan or anyone else says we cannot change that unless we come to grips with it.  I have sought to do this but I only get limited support.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree it would be prudent to exercise a degree of caution in regard to the Coopers and Lybrand report having regard to the fact that it was commissioned by and paid for by the insurance federation who represent the interests of the insurance companies? Will he agree that there is one noticeable omission from the widespread criticisms it levels at lawyers and the Government, namely, self-criticism, and that it makes no comment on the efficient treatment of claims dealt with by the insurance companies?  Will the Minister agree that many of the accusations it levels are directed at the Minister and the Government for failing to improve our road system and simplify legal procedures? <Col N="1762" /> Finally, is the Minister suggesting that the Judiciary, who are independent under the Constitution, are distributing largesse in making awards rather than fair and reasonable compensation?</P>

      <P>I am glad the Coopers and Lybrand report has been prepared because it is factual.  I am not suggesting it is comprehensive in the sense that it covers all aspects of this matter but at least it gives us the comparative statistics between this country and Britain which I have been looking for for sometime.  I am glad to say, as a result of the activities of the inter-ministerial group that the Department of Justice are now preparing our own statistics based on court awards here.  I believe we will have these fairly soon.  I would have liked to have had them before now.  This will be a useful addition to the debate on this question. I hope the debate will move around towards a sense of reality and, therefore, concentrate on the appallingly high level of awards here by comparison with those in other countries.</P>

They were to be implemented last July.  Will he agree that his Department are out of touch in suggesting that the average cost of insurance for young drivers is less than £400 per annum?  If a person can get a quotation <Col N="1763" /> from a company it is usually for more than £1,4000.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to establish a tribunal, in place of the existing legal framework, to decide on compensation awards and force companies to accept a fixed level of the general motor insurance market so that a proportion can be allocated to companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say in my reply that the average cost of insurance for young drivers was less than £400.  I said that was the average cost of motor insurance per policy in the years mentioned. Obviously, the cost of insurance for young drivers is higher and, in many cases, very much higher, unfortunately. I gave the reasons for this.  So far as the question of a tribunal is concerned, I advocated this on a number of occasions but I have been advised that it is unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two brief questions.  Will he confirm if his Department sanctioned a rise in the cost of motor insurance within the last 12 months?  He may have answered that already and, if so, I regret I did not hear the reply.  Can the Minister do anything to make insurance companies give credit to named young drivers who have been on policies for a number of years, albeit still under 25 years of age and who are asked to pay huge premiums when they want to insure their own vehicles?  They do not get any credit for being a named drivers on a policy in respect of which claims have not been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first part of the Deputy's question, my Department did not give permission for the increase in premiums over the last 12 months.  There is no price control in relation to insurance as I explained at length in reply to various questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for telling me that, because insurance companies are misrepresenting the position in blaming me.  However, it is not the first time that has happened to me and I am sure it will not be the last. In so far as the question of named young drivers moving from, say, a parent's policy to their own policy is concerned, we have taken that point up with the Irish Insurance Federation because it is rather unfair, particularly if they were claim-free during the period they were on the parent's policy, that they would not get credit for it.  We asked the federation to draw the inequity of that situation to the attention of companies and I hope there will be a beneficial result.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that, in spite of valiant efforts made by the Government &mdash; and a number of preceding Governments &mdash; there has been no progress on the question of <Col N="1765" /> insurance?  There is no light at the end of the tunnel.  Will he further agree that the only answer is to give serious consideration to some system of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; insurance which they have in New Zealand? I have raised this on a number of occasions and I should like a response from the Minister.  We have tried everything, why not give this a try?</P>

      <P>It is incorrect to say that no progress has been made as it has been widely acknowledged that substantial progress has been made.  Further progress will be made this year in legislation which will be introduced by the Ministers for Justice and the Environment.  We have considered the question of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; insurance.  The Government are opposed to it and will not introduce it because it is not suitable for conditions in this country.  We are already overly claim conscious and if the &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; aspect were to come in as well it would drive the whole system crazy.  Even with the &ldquo;fault&rdquo; element there is an extraordinarily high level of claims and they would be endless and bottomless if there was a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; element.</P>

I do not expect that opening up the market in November will make that much difference; I would be misleading the House if I said I thought it would.  It will be very beneficial in other areas like fire insurance, burglary and so on because they are not processed through the courts system and, accordingly, they are fair and predictable.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 19, 21, 25, 26, 27, 36, 37, 40, 43, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 64, 70, 79 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Industrial Policy Review Group was published on 10 January last.  The Government welcomed the report and supported the broad thrust of <Col N="1770" /> its recommendations.  To ensure that its recommendations are followed up with all speed the Government established, as recommended by the review group, a task force on the implementation of the recommendations.  The task force have commenced their work and have already held two meetings.  The task force will be working closely with the relevant Government Departments on the implementation of the report's recommendations and any further measures which the task force consider will enhance the scope for development and employment in the industrial sector.  The task force will report to the Government on the progress made in the implementation of the measures and recommendations.</P>
    <P>As regards the recommendations of the group which relate to my Department and their agencies, I can say that, in general, I have a very positive approach to them.  There are some 29 such recommendations in all and there may be others arising out of the work of the task force.  I am considering, therefore, those matters raised by Deputies in the questions that I have mentioned, as well as the other recommendations addressed to me.  I wish to consider all those recommendations as a single, coherent policy or approach and, for that reason, I do not intend to comment for the present on any particular recommendation taken singly or apart from the others.  Nonetheless Deputies can be assured of the positive spirit with which I am approaching them.</P>
    <P>In common with views expressed on all sides of the House and outside it, I consider the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group to be the most important document for the appropriate change and reform of industrial policy for many years.  I spoke in those terms here on 26 February last.  I spoke then, also, on the need to address the wide range of obstacles to growth in our economy which were identified in the report. I said that I am determined, therefore, that this report should be acted upon.  I assure the Deputies that I will do all that I can to ensure that this is the case.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the Culliton report identified that 25,000 people will be coming on the labour market between now and the year 2000 and that recent performance suggests that we are getting about 5,000 net new jobs, will the Minister state whether he has made any calculation, &mdash; or if any calculation is available to him, on the basis of what Deputy Barry said about a comprehensive approach being taken to the Culliton recommendations, of the impact in the immediate two to three years ahead in terms of amelioration of our unemployment problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Culliton report made it very clear that there is no quick, easy solution.  It makes it clear, almost in the first page, that the implementation of their recommendations will not solve the problem.  I accept that and there is no point in deluding ourselves into thinking that it will.  However, it is the best approach and will lay the most solid foundation for the future.  In reply to the next question I will be giving detailed figures in relation to job creation, manufacturing, services and other jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give an accurate figure for the gross creation.  We can project that reasonably well.  However, the net figures are a different matter.  I would quibble somewhat with the Deputy's bottom line <Col N="1772" /> net figure of approximately 5,000.  I think it is rather higher than that.  Of course, it is made to appear much worse than the reality by the constant loss of agricultural jobs at a much higher rate over the past few years.</P>

I know Deputy O'Rourke, a former Minister for Education, understands what I am talking about.  This type of decision will deny many young people the opportunity to pursue more practical careers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the difficulty.  I have a difficulty with a number of the recommendations but two in particular come to mind.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the report was being dealt with comprehensively. This implies that all the recommendations will be acted upon.  If all the recommendations are acted upon, then the Whitegate Oil Refinery will have to think about its future.  Hopefully, it will not have to close but it will have to think of its future.  Consideration will also have to be given to the social effects on the midlands of the recommendation not to compel the ESB to take peat from Bord na Móna in the future to generate electricity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> the target is to create 20,000 gross jobs each year of the programme in manufacturing and international services.  It was pointed out in the programme that the achievement of this target would require continuing stability in the economic environment and cost competitiveness throughout the industrial and services sectors, a positive external environment for our exports and a co-operative response from firms, employees and the various State agencies involved in supporting developments.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy has come through a difficult period over the past 12 months. The external environment continued to be hostile mainly due to the recessions in the UK, the US and elsewhere.  In spite of these difficulties real output growth of about 2 per cent was achieved in 1991, over twice the OECD average.  Our strong export performance, which at £15 billion represents an increase in value of 5 per cent over 1990, demonstrates the continuing competitiveness of Irish industry which has managed to increase its market share despite the difficult trading conditions.  In the face of the demanding economic environment, the target in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> of 20,000 jobs each year in manufacturing and international services was substantially met in 1991 with the creation of over 18,500 jobs.  I expect that job creation in 1992 will continue towards the ultimate target of 60,000 gross jobs over the period of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it has, of course, a very important role to play in employment and wealth creation, it must be remembered that the manufacturing sector represents less than one-fifth of total employment. <Col N="1775" /> It is also very important to understand how the Irish manufacturing sector is performing compared to our EC partners. Recent OECD data clearly shows that the manufacturing sector in Ireland is performing substantially stronger than many other European economies when it comes to employment.  Manufacturing employment declined by only 2.2 per cent in Ireland between 1970 and 1990 compared with much greater declines in Germany, 15.2 per cent, the UK, 38.2 per cent, Denmark, 17.4 per cent; France, 16.9 per cent and Italy, 11.3 per cent. The contribution which the manufacturing sector is making by maintaining employment at a time of international recession testifies to the competitiveness of the Irish industrial base.</P>
    <P>In so far as our overall employment figures are concerned, there have been strong gains in non-agricultural employment, especially in services employment, since 1987.  This was a notable achievement for Ireland.  In previous international recessions, job shedding was a significant problem here.  The more competitive edge of recent years has enabled us to hold steady this time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> However, we cannot be content with our record as regards increasing the numbers at work, not only to meet the demands of new entrants to the work-force each year, but to make serious inroads into the live register now standing at 276,000, and in particular the needs of the long term unemployed.  It was because of my concerns with the effectiveness of industrial and job creation policy that I set up, last June, the Industrial Policy Review Group, whose report has met with strong endorsement on all sides in this House and outside.  The group's report addressed a wide range of deep-seated obstacles to growth in our economy and underlines the need for change, not only in our industrial support systems, but also in our job training, education, transport and other fields.  We have already set up a task force to get speedy action on the wide range of recommendations coming from the review group.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Higgin's question, I am circulating a table containing details of the numbers employed in manufacturing and services between 1987 and 1991, the source of which is the Central Statistics Office, 1991 Labour Force Preliminary Estimates.</P>

      <P>While it may be true that manufacturing accounts for one-fifth of total employment, I am sure the Minister agrees that it has been the significant area of growth, having regard to the decline in agriculture and the arresting of progress in the area of services.  Having regard to the fact that we are planning for 20,000 gross new jobs in the face of anticipated redundancies and 25,000 young people coming onto the labour market, we are rapidly heading for a figure of 300,000 people unemployed. Will the Minister comment on the fact that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was already agreed before we knew the Culliton recommendations? Will implementation of any or some of the Culliton recommendations make any improvement in that 20,000 gross target?  May I ask the Minister if he remembers the comment by his mentor, a former Taoiseach, that any Taoiseach and Government should resign if the unemployment figure went over 100,000?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not correct in saying that the job creation target is 20,000 under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as if that was an overall figure.  Of course, that is not the case.  That only relates to manufacturing and international services.  It does not relate to services generally which, of course, is very much larger than manufacturing and where in recent years there has been a substantial growth in the number of jobs in existence.  I agree with the Deputy that whereas manufacturing represents only 20 per cent of employment it is by far the most important sector of all employment here for the simple reason that there is a major spin-off from manufacturing which, in turn, creates other jobs which one does not get in other types of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason manufacturing, and its encouragement, must always be at the centre of the Government's efforts in this regard.  I have no doubt that the implementation over the next year or two of the broad thrust of the Culliton recommendations will contribute to a further increase in employment.  I do not think we will see the benefit of them for at least two years but I am satisfied that if we were not to implement the Culliton <Col N="1778" /> recommendations there would be a regression in this regard.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before adjourning for Question Time I dealt with most of the points I wish to raise on this Bill.  There are two important areas that have to be taken into consideration either in this Bill or in another.  I welcome the legal protection in this Bill for a wife who will be compelled to give evidence against her physically or sexually violent husband. Part IV of the Bill provides that a spouse or a former spouse will come within this law.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" />&ldquo;decree of judicial separation&rdquo; includes a decree of divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or any decree made by a court outside the State and recognised in the State ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to emphasis the words &ldquo;and recognised in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a large number of people living together outside the defined relationship of marriage as recognised by the State.  These people are called common law husbands and common law wives.  There is a difficulty in relation to this legislation and the Home Protection Act, 1976, which is also very protective legislation, in that barring orders are not extended to spouses whose marriages are not recognised within the State.  I have been advised by people working with these families that a large number of women and children believe they can get a barring order &mdash; many gardaí also believe this to be the case.  However, when these people apply to the court for a barring order they are told they are not entitled to it.  The only recourse for them is to seek an injunction against their husbands, and I do not have to remind the Minister of the delays and the cost involved in that procedure not to mention the psychological factor.  There are hundreds of women and children at risk of violence because of their inability to get a barring order, which is the most successful way of dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether the provisions in Part IV of the Bill could be extended to include these people or whether provision could be made for them under the Home Protection Act, 1976.  I will not labour the issue because I am sure the Minister understands the point I am making.  It is a very urgent matter and I would like the Minister to ensure that these people are protected either under this legislation or other legislation.  In providing for this we would need to extend the definition of spouse and former spouse.  As the matter arises under Part IV of this Bill it is timely that <Col N="1827" /> we consider it now.  On Committee Stage we should concentrate on that aspect and introduce an amendment.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to an issue raised by other Members, court procedures and the sentencing of sex offenders.  Research abroad has shown that the only way a sex offender can be justly, humanely and positively helped to make a return to society and not reoffend is through a level of theraphy and treatment that should begin within the prison system and continue outside in the community, if needed.  Much work has been done in that regard in Britain.  Ray Wyer, a pioneer in this work, now has a specialised knowledge of the subject.  He has been tremendously helpful and supportive of welfare and prison officers here who have attempted to provide similar rehabilitative treatment for sex offenders.  That treatment should be established on a statutory basis.  It must be made mandatory that as part of a sex offender's sentence he be required to accept treatment.  It must also be accepted that, even if the statutory sentence has been served within the prison system, as part of the sentence such an offender should have to continue such treatment in the community until the psychological and psychiatric specialists consider he has been rehabilitated.  The treatment required is difficult and is long term, and that is why I say the term of the prison sentence might not be sufficient. Research has shown a high level of denial of acceptance of responsibility for such offences and that in itself takes time to work out.</P>
    <P>We are examining and trying to cope with half of the problem if we consider only identification, validation and the sentencing process.  I welcome the measures in the Bill.  However, if we are serious in our attempt to deal with sex offences, and to learn often painfully, from what is happening, we must provide rehabilitative treatment as part of a sentence. <Col N="1828" /> I hope we will concentrate on that aspect on Committee Stage.  The Minister should consider the position of common law spouses, who do not seem to come within the definitions of the Bill.  They are not recognised by the State and, are certainly suffering now as a consequence. Their position should be taken into consideration before Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be too long because I am sure Deputy McCartan will have a very useful and learned contribution to make.  The contribution I am anxious to make will not be as learned as the speeches of those who preceded me but I am keen to record my welcome for the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in debates that have touched on many of the issues dealt with in the Bill.  Some of the elements of the Bill were raised in the discussion on the Criminal Justice Bill, which was before the House for many months; in the debate on Second Stage of the Child Care Bill and during discussion on the Rape Bill Members sought changes for different reasons and many of them are included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Speaking on a day when remarkable events are unfolding outside the House, events that will bring about historic changes &mdash; depending upon the way we respond to them &mdash; I am glad to see evidence in the House of a more modern approach to dealing with sensitive issues. Parts II and III in particular represent significant reforms, and I believe they will be only the beginning of many.</P>
      <P>The Bill is evidence of the value of the process gone through by the Law Reform Commission and the nature and extent of the consultation they undertook in that process.  The result has been humane, detailed and responsive, a comment one rarely has the pleasure of making when speaking to a Bill on Second Stage.  One can often agree with a Bill in principle, but it is evident from listening to the debate that there is a general welcome for the detail and substantial changes in the Bill.  The welcome may not be quite exceptional but it is very evident.</P>
      <P>Part II introduces a reform that will be built on and expanded into other applications as we learn from experience about the way in which its provisions works in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Like many other speakers, I should like to direct most of my remarks to Part III which I welcome.  The consultation process undergone by the Law Reform Commission in reaching their recommendations has been largely taken on board.  In relation to evidence and procedure, the consultation process showed that in cases of physical and sexual abuse of children the vital witness in every case was the child.  The commission stated that giving evidence in such cases may be as traumatic an episode for a child as the abuse itself.  A terrifying feature for any child was confrontation in court with the person he or she was accusing, which person would frequently be a parent or other adult authority figure.</P>
    <P>There was also the problem in the case of very young children of whether they could give evidence.  The commission outlined various options, several of which have been taken up in the Bill.  I welcome those provisions wholeheartedly.  They will bring a humane and progressive face to the legislation and will, I hope, facilitate more actions in cases of abuse.  It must be a cause for concern that so few cases are taken to court.  It is acknowledged that people recuperate more easily from such cases when they go through the experience of pursuing the offender in law.  It is important to create an environment that will encourage greater pursuit of those cases.</P>
    <P>I support the case made by Deputy Barnes.  I heard Deputy Fennell make the same point earlier.  In the context of any approach to sexual abuse, this may be the fourth time we have requested these types of changes as we discuss various Bills.  These are things that seem, the first time we mention them, to be a long way off; but those of us who intend to have a long life in politics may see some such changes come to pass.  It is not the first time I have made this point.</P>
    <P>What is striking about the debate in relation to this Bill is that most contributors have made the point that, unless we deal with the problems of the abuser <Col N="1831" /> and the services for those prone to abuse, who themselves clearly have a very great problem &mdash; probably one that was never dealt with earlier when they may have suffered in various ways in their own lives &mdash; we will not have adequately tackled the problem overall.  It is extremely important that we take on this issue seriously, developing programmes for the treatment of offenders who abuse young children whether physically or, more particularly, sexually.</P>
    <P>I remember being absolutely horrified when the statistical evidence here became more publicly known &mdash; that we were roughly on a par with the rest of the &ldquo;civilised&rdquo; world in that perhaps as many as one in four of our children were liable to some form of abuse within their childhood. What horrified me was its logical consequence, that there were one in four adults, usually male, abusing, a small number of perpetrators inflicting damage on a very large number of children over a lifetime of abuse.  If we identify offenders, simply punishing them and allow them to leave prison without adequately rehabilitating them, then ongoing damage or harm to other innocent young people will continue.  Indeed, it might even be said the sacrificing of the offender to what must be personally a desperate way of life continues unabated. Given the recidivist nature of sexual offence, such rehabilitation is more important than in other areas of our penal code.  Therefore I, too, would support the case for working with prisoners in a very intense way.  Despite the legislative reforms included in this Bill, until we implement such rehabilitative programmes we will not have tackled the problem sufficiently seriously.  I have in mind, in particular, mandatory reporting. This is an extremely sensitive, difficult issue, as Deputy Barnes said, in that people will be very concerned at disrupting a whole family even if they have suspicions.  Professionals are very loathe to speak out lest they be proven <Col N="1832" /> wrong.  A mandatory obligation to report would ensure that the problems landed in the hands of professionals as quickly as possible, which is obviously highly desirable.  It is my belief that this provision should come sooner rather than later.  If the new Minister of State's term of office is as long as that we would all wish for ourselves, it would be my hope that these would be two issues on which he would act in the near future.</P>
    <P>The other changes to be welcomed are those included in Part II of the Bill, to which I have referred already, and those included in Part IV, to which Deputy Barnes referred earlier.  One cannot overstress the importance of these legislative changes in the bringing into the open the dark secrets of the family affected by abuse and bringing the perpetrator to justice.  Indeed the overall health of that family and of all those involved would be more likely to be improved as a result of the application of the provisions of these Parts of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the greater modernisation of our courts system &mdash; the tiny chink in the legal practitioners willingness to lay off their regalia on this very limited occasion, auguring well for a more extensive change overall in the future.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to put on record my welcome of the changes proposed in this Bill which are, by and large, substantial and should prove to be enormously helpful. While we may press for additions on Committee Stage, as one of my colleagues said, it is a clear, simple, effective Bill which will be of great assistance in improving the manner in which we deal with children, in particular, and their families.  Plenty remains to be done but clearly this constitutes a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am not one noted for my patience.  Nonetheless the courtesy, <Col N="1833" /> if nothing more, extended to me by yourself and others in the Chair is much appreciated.  I hope my earlier interjection did not compel Deputy Flaherty to in any way shorten the remarks she wanted to make.  After so many hours of remaining about the Chamber I felt it was time to put on record some of the frustrations I felt, particularly since the Whips of the other parties had agreed to the introduction of a guillotine on this Second Stage debate.  Frankly, I was extremely worried whether I would ever get the opportunity, on behalf of my group, New Agenda, to address the Chamber on what has been correctly described in the issue of <i>Garda Review</i> published today as a watershed, a milestone, in the development of the Irish criminal law.  I do not think that in any way overstates the importance of this Bill.  As is described in the explanatory memorandum, it is legislation that has arisen from four separate reports of the Law Reform Commission dating back to 1985, dealing with major areas of the criminal law, its evidence and presentation in criminal prosecutions in a fundamental, radical way.  For those reasons I was very concerned that the opportunity might not even have arisen for me to comment.  However, through the good sense of someone, the guillotine has been moved back to 2 p.m. tomorrow rather than 5 p.m. this afternoon as had originally been agreed.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a proportionality issue at stake, and that I have a lowly presence of one, but that is a temporary arrangement.  I might say to the Government Chief Whip and to anybody else out there interested in the good working and co-operation in this House that they should think again if the proportionality factor is to be insisted on on all occasions. If it is, then all other <i>minutiae</i> of Standing Orders will be insisted upon, I have no doubt, to discommode many Government and Opposition Members.  I will say no more than that; these things always cut both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" /> It is important in any debate such as this &mdash; particularly in that the provisions of this Bill deal with the issue of child sexual abuse and how it is to be addressed using the criminal process &mdash; to pay the highest tribute to those agencies and organisations who forced the Irish male-dominated society to wake up to itself in this regard within the last decade.  I recall efforts on the part of agencies such as the Rape Crisis Centres to endeavour to bring home to us within the last decade the fact that there was a major social problem of gigantic proportions within our community.  These people were derided, laughed at and totally ignored by legislators and community leaders alike on the basis that we did not have the kind of problem being dealt with on an almost daily basis in the headlines of what is sometimes described as the gutter press in our neighbouring island. We are slowly beginning to realise, thanks to the efforts of many individuals and organisations in this area, that the physical and sexual abuse of young children is a major social crime phenomenon in our community.  This legislation is a belated attempt by a male dominated community to address the problem.  I and my group appreciate people who have worked long, voluntary hours in the sexual assault unit at the Rotunda Hospital and who had to fight long and hard to have that unit recognised by the EHB and established on a proper and permanent basis.  I also have due regard for the rape crisis centres who every day are attempting to help, often on a voluntary basis to deal with the problem.  It is regrettable that in the past year in particular these centres, rather than concentrating on the good work they have undertaken over the years, are fighting for their financial survival.  That helps us to appreciate how much further we have to go in terms of real support for the problems that this whole phenomenon presents.  The Dublin Rape Crisis Centres and others have been facing imminent closure for the last number of years <Col N="1835" /> with little sympathetic response from Government.</P>
    <P>If anything, the decision in the Waterford incest case, which was highlighted in a rare performance by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the Chamber, and the facts that led to that decision, more than anything help to illustrate that, despite our best efforts and those of the people who work in the field, there is much more to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>This is monumental legislation which requires careful consideration.  Deputies from Fine Gael have suggested that the Bill should move from Second Stage to a special committee of the House.  A couple of months ago I would have wholeheartedly supported that idea but because of my present status I am not so sure that I can any longer support that proposal because, if the heavy hand of the other parties is brought to bear, as it has been on the New Agenda over the past number of weeks, we will be excluded with a certain amount of glee and satisfaction by the larger parties.  However, it is important to take time over this legislation.  For that reason I am not happy that we have sought to shorten the debate on Second Stage.  It may well be that the debate will conclude naturally before 2 p.m. tomorrow, but that is not the impression I am getting from the reaction of Deputies with regard to the scale of the changes being suggested in the legislation.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, I hope the Bill will move rapidly into law and will not simply be passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has been suggested that the passage of legislation through this House is not enough any more because often built into the legislation are clauses which call for the coming into play of the legislation at a later date to be decided by the Minister based upon the exigencies of the situation.  The most important provisions of this legislation in terms of dealing with child sexual abuse and related issues are not to be brought into play until <Col N="1836" /> such time as resources have been made available and a major job done in introducing new technology into areas of the law which have never seen any to date.  It is remarkable that when we talk about introducing telecommunication video networks into our courts, the vast majority of them do not even have a microphone or a microphone system that works properly if at all.  My worry is that while this legislation may pass carefully and speedily through our hands it may well prove to be a long time before we see the legislation in place.  I would ask the Minister to take my views into account and do away with these guillotines so that we can take time to look at these important Bills.  The law took a long time in gestation in terms of the Law Reform Commission and the drafting of the Bill, drawing together the ideas, so why is it that when it gets to the floor of the democratic Chamber, the accelerator is depressed and speed is applied.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Minister on Second Stage and by other Government contributors to the debate that there are two major factors that require this legislation to be moved along hastily.  It is said that we require the legislation to deal with DNA fingerprinting and to deal with recent cases that have arisen, that, irrespective of the case of the 14 year old, if DNA testing is carried out and proves to be useful in any subsequent prosecution, unless the legislation is passed, we will not be able to deal with the results and evidence will not be available to any trial.  I accept that as a problem but it was fully outlined to the Minister for Justice in this Chamber in 1989 and 1990, when we were debating the various stages of the genetic fingerprinting legislation.  The record will show that I and a number of others specifically told the Minister that his legislation would be unworkable until such time as the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions against Myers handed down by the appeal courts in Britain as long ago as 1965 was addressed by legislation in this country.  Now, when <Col N="1837" /> we eventually come to address that situation almost 30 years after the decision was handed down in Britain, I find it difficult to accept that time in this House must be set aside and the matter dealt with without proper care and attention. It is an area of the law that must be looked at much more carefully.  I have very real concern about some of the provisions in the legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the context of the case of the 14 year old, the issue of DNA fingerprinting and the results that come from it, I am taking this opportunity, the first available to me in the House, to say that I fully support the views of Deputy Charles McCreevy, the Minister for Social Welfare. The comments the Minister made about the inconsistencies that exist in any debate on this issue with regard to pregnancy termination were most welcome, if for no other reason than that they came from a Minister of the Government, although he was speaking in a personal capacity.</P>

      <P>And some others as well, but I am addressing my remarks particularly to him as he is a Government Minister.  I want to lend my support to the position he has taken because I do not want him or indeed anybody else to be left out to dry on their own, to be pilloried or to have to bear the vindictive attacks of criticism that may arise.  I believe the issue is so important as to require cross-party support.  I welcome his remarks and the remarks of others who contributed in like mind and most particularly I welcome &mdash; as I have already said publicly outside this Chamber &mdash; the majority decision of the Supreme Court delivered earlier this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of genetic fingerprinting raises full square the question of how long we will have to wait for the Forensic Evidence Act, 1990, which was passed by this House in December 1990 to be up <Col N="1838" /> and running according to our rules of evidence so as to facilitate the presentation of the results of these tests in criminal prosecutions.</P>
    <P>In this regard, like Deputy Shatter, I was totally bemused by the recent television report which seemed to suggest that DNA fingerprinting was something that had been recently discovered in this country and was a remarkable breakthrough. Given the level of media interest in the debate on this watershed Criminal Evidence Bill, 1992, as it is described in the <i>Garda Review</i> issued today, since it started &mdash; I have noticed one journalist entering the Chamber to listen to the debate since it began on Tuesday &mdash; I have no doubt that in a couple of months or indeed years they will wake up and discover the Criminal Evidence Bill and then write it up as a remarkable new discovery and development in our criminal law, even though this House will have spent long hours debating, discussing and parsing the legislation.  I find it regrettable that little or no attention is being given by the media to this very important Bill.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent upon the Minister for Justice or his Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to give clear assurances that the forensic evidence legislation will be in place and working without further delay and that the provisions of this Bill in totality will be working without further delay.  I see that difficulties may arise in giving effect to Part III of the Bill which deals with the presentation of evidence by way of television or video transmission. The difficulties are, first, putting in place basic new technology and at the same time finding the physical accommodation in the existing court buildings throughout the country.  Let me say at this point that arguments about this will not and should not be accepted by anyone in this House, if for no other reason than that we can appreciate how easily and how readily new technology, such as microphone systems and the televising of the business of this House and its transmission <Col N="1839" /> to every room in this House on varying channels, was so readily achieved in so short a period.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that it took a lot of years of talking, but once the decision was made it was a matter of months and over the long recess all of the cameras were put in place, the transmitting studio was established in Setanta House and the system was up and running. If this can be done in the hallowed Chambers of Leinster House there can be no argument presented that any of our courthouses are so antiquated, old or wrongly stuctured that they are incapable of being adapted to receive televised or video recorded evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told that the legislation has an urgent relevance at present because of the judgment in the recent incest case heard in Waterford, which shocked us all.  The legislation does not seem to offer any great prospect whatsoever in this regard.  The difficulty with regard to the Waterford case, as I understand it, was the proof of parentage.  The central question to be asked is why the indictment was drawn so narrowly.  There was clearly a case of alleged incest, but equally the prosecution could have raised the issue of statutory rape, indecent assault or gross indecent assault as provided for under the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.  There was a whole range of alternative counts that could and should have been included in the indictment and prosecuted in that case rather than the narrow count upon which the prosecution failed because of the absence of technical proof.  Even in the narrow technical case of incest &mdash; I will return to this point later &mdash; I am not absolutely sure that the Bill, as circulated, will overcome the difficulties that have been talked about.  In this regard there was a suggestion floating around that the Minister would be proposing <Col N="1840" /> an amendment in this area to accommodate that issue.  Will the Minister clarify this point in his reply?  The Minister did not state in his Second Stage speech that he would be putting an amendment forward but I believe such an amendment would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been described quite correctly in many quarters as radical, representing a new departure in criminal evidence law and in the way criminal cases will be presented and prosecuted in this jurisdiction.  I fully accept those views.  However the issues thrown up by this new departure are wider than how we deal with child sexual abuse, sexual assault generally or violence towards spouses and go to the very nature of how the criminal justice system is structured in the first place.  Questions on these issues have already been raised by the Director of Public Prosecution in a number of his public statements and speeches in this regard.  He asked whether we as a community are happy with a criminal justice system that is based on taking up adversarial positions where the issue is not one of truth seeking but is, and only ever is, the question of providing guilt beyond doubt and nothing else.  I believe that the Bill attempts to go further.  I am curious about some of the language used by two of the previous speakers, Deputy Flaherty and Deputy Barnes, who said that we should make a greater effort to get more convictions; but I believe that their intent was that our criminal process should be better designed to establish truth in facts and situations than it is currently capable of doing.  That is a very fundamental issue &mdash; that the current adversarial system is not a process for establishing truth and indeed was never designed to be.  That begs a solution to the problem of how you deal with the testimony of the mentally incapacitated, of young people or those who are simply totally discommoded by the ambience of the courtroom and the presures created by those strange people who run around with horses hair on their <Col N="1841" /> heads during the proceedings.  We must begin to ask: should our questions not be directed fundamentally at changing the whole criminal process itself?  We should work towards an investigative process designed to establish truth and, by definition, more caring in its intent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the work of Ray Wyer in Britain regarding what should be done with people convicted of sexual offences.  A system which does not take on board the findings of someone as profound as that man is missing an opportunity to be progressive and caring in its approach.  As long as we use a criminal appeals system which is punitive in its entire intent and has little or no rehabilitative content, we will always opt for the adversarial system of criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>The question begged by the DPP and presented to us by this legislation is whether we should make a more fundamental reappraisal of the way our criminal justice system is structured and whether it is time to do away with the adversarial process of trying to fight against the State case for a conviction, looking instead to the wider social implications of the type of cases brought before the courts on a daily basis involving the community, the victim and the defendant in the maintenance of some order within our community.  We are recognising in this legislation that some of the conditions typical of the adversarial system are so intimidating of the witness that often the evidence can never be prosecuted. In the strict way in which the battle lines are drawn, the person arguing from the point of view of the defendant would say this is all part of the adversarial tussle and that it is important that a witness be brought into the public arena, put on the witness stand elevated above the level of everyone else and be confronted by people dressed in outmoded gear which makes them look peculiar and funny rather than human and responsive. All of this is designed to ensure that in a tense and intimidating atmosphere that <Col N="1842" /> person will testify truthfully.  That would be the defendant's approach and attitude to the adversarial system.  Is it not time to reappraise whether that system is fair and effective and whether it serves the community in the way it should or could?</P>
    <P>We talk in this legislation of trying to redress some of the imbalances with regard to young children, spouses and people with incapacities.  Why should not those considerations be extended to every witness in every case?  Is it not time that we built court rooms and court houses to reflect modern requirements? Is it necessary to put people in elevated positions where they feel totally isolated and where they are intimidated by the furniture and the people who occupy it? Should we not work towards a system that is modern and accommodates people in a humane way?</P>
    <P>The DPP has attempted on occasion to open up this debate and I regret that he has not had the kind of response here today that he deserves.  I hope that the few moments that I have spent on this topic will give him hope in pursuing these issues.  Perhaps the Government should consider the establishment of a sub-division or a new chamber of the Law Reform Commission to deal specifically with criminal law reform and the rules of evidence generally.  That might be one way to advance this debate further.</P>
    <P>The section of the Bill dealing with documentary evidence is welcome.  It deals with a situation which should have been apparent to any Government from 1965 onwards.  In that year the Court of Appeal in Britain handed down the hallmark decision in the case of the DPP against Myers.  At that time our law was similar to that in Britain with regard to hearsay evidence.  The court decided that in order to prove the documentary process of manufacture it was necessary to produce all the people along the assembly line &mdash; this case involved motor cars &mdash; who did certain things in the assembly process and entered certain information <Col N="1843" /> in the schedule of works in the assembly plant.  The court ruled that all the individual witnesses would have to be presented for the purpose of proving the record rather than one person designate. In that case the accused had been prosecuted for offences related to the theft and handling of motor cars and in order to prove the ownership of the cars it was necessary to go back to the manufacturing records.  The prosecution failed because of the hearsay evidence.  A Law Reform Commission report published in 1987 dealt with this problem but it has taken us until now to deal with it by way of legislation.  I can say as someone who has practised criminal law for some time in our courts that a very significant number of cases failed under the hearsay restrictions because we had not introduced amending legislation.  Receiving cases, cases of handling stolen goods and other related cases failed entirely for this reason.  In their 1987 report the Law Reform Commission gave us a formula that could be employed.  I attempted on two separate occasions to introduce the amendments presented by the Law Reform Commission but on each occasion the Government rejected them. When the Government, in response to the report, introduced legislation dealing with receiving stolen property they left out this proposition and said that it could be included in a Criminal Evidence Bill. It is here now and, late as it is, it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The structure of the legislation suggests that the prosecution would give notice to the defendant of whatever evidence they intended to introduce in the criminal process that heretofore would not have been admissible because of the hearsay rule and that they would be relying on those documents as proof.  There are certain time-scales laid down wherein the court must give notice to the defendant. In the event that notice is given, is there then a right on the part of the accused or defendant to object to that <Col N="1844" /> evidence being adduced in that form? Are we to take it that the legislation represents an emphatic amendment of the hearsay rule?  If that is the situation and if the only steps the prosecution have to take, as a result of this Part of the legislation, is to serve notice &mdash; once notice is served within the requisite time and the court rules that the interests of justice are not being obstructed in any way &mdash; will the evidence stand on its merit in the documentary form to be produced?  My concern is for the rights of the defendant as he or she might seek to enforce them by way of the Constitution or of legal precedent.</P>
    <P>In any analogous provision contained in previous criminal law or evidence legislation, where notice was required to be given by the prosecution of an intention to move in a particular abbreviated way in the presentation of evidence &mdash; and notice had to be served &mdash; any equal objection served within a specified time by the defendant, by and large gave the defendant the absolute right of objection and veto on the evidence being produced and cast on the prosecution the obligation to present the evidence in full at the trial. I am concerned as to whether all of that is gone having regard to the provisions of this Part of the Bill.  Has the Minister explored this area and, if so, is he satisfied there is constitutional firmness attaching to this part of the legislation where in the context of an adverserial system the defendant is given notice and the prosecution is obliged to do no more?</P>
    <P>The second issue that arises in the context of Part II is the definition of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; as contained in section 4 and which has implications throughout the remainder of this Part.  I am concerned as to what will be the ultimate definition of a &ldquo;document produced in the course of business&rdquo;.  I accept that in section 4 the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; includes any trade, profession or other occupation carried on.  I am specifically interested to know whether the Minister is satisfied that such a situation as arose in the road <Col N="1845" /> traffic case, the Director of Public Prosecutions v.  Haughey will be covered in this instance.  I raised questions about the ruling in that case in the Dáil previously and the former Taoiseach indicated that the implications of that judgment would be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that it was a case where in a standard road traffic drunk driving prosecution the doctor who had taken the sample, in the course of the investigation, had become ill by the time the case came for hearing.  The production of documentation from the Medical Registrations Council confirming that the person concerned was a registered medical practitioner was not sufficient and the judge ruled that the doctor should have been present in court to confirm what was written in the document. But the doctor was unable to attend for medical reasons and the prosecution failed.  That was manifestly unfair.  I want to know whether the legislation, as currently drafted, emphatically covers such a situation and, indeed, much more in regard to road traffic prosecutions.  When replying to the debate I hope the Minister will indicate, by way of practical example, to what extent a road traffic prosecution for drunk driving would be made more simple by reason of the workings of Part II of this legislation.  I would like to have this matter teased out.</P>
    <P>I know I speak for many people in the community who are dismayed time and again with the way in which legal niceties can be found in all nooks and crannies of the road traffic legislation to avoid conviction in patently drunk driving cases and the difficulties that can arise. Equally, in the Waterford case, and we were told that this legislation would have a major effect in such a case, are State or semi-State organisations but more particularly State organisations &mdash; in the instance in question, the Registrar of births, deaths and marriages &mdash; covered in the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; in Part II of this legislation?  Section 4 (a) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> any person or body remunerated or financed wholly or partly out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I want to be satisfied that they are to be considered a business in a very specific concept of what is a business, that is somebody who is involved in the marketplace and pursuing entrepreneurial interests.  Is the person who is keeping the records of births, deaths and marriages included in that concept?  Will the production of documentary evidence <i>per se</i> from this area be sufficient to prove parentage, particularly in criminal proceedings, in the future?  Perhaps the Minister would comment generally on the definitions employed in Part II of the way in which the legislation is envisaged to work.</P>
    <P>Section 8 relates to the function a court will have to play in deciding what is or is not in the interests of justice in regard to the admissibility of evidence ultimately and in the weight to be attached to it in any direction the judge may give to a jury in summation of a case.  I would urge the Minister to have more regard for the requirements we are trying to achieve here, that is, to introduce some element of commonsense and administrative workability in the manner in which evidence is produced, compiled and presented in court.</P>
    <P>I do not want to advocate that we take out of the hands of our judges the function of conducting any criminal trial according to law and in the interests of justice generally.  Nonetheless a real prospect is looming here that, because of the way in which section 8 is drafted, much of the work we are doing here, much of what we are trying to achieve in this legislation, will be set at naught.  In respect of this part of this legislation what is the position of the accused or the party given notice in writing on the issue of admissibility?  Is a court bound to rule, is the party who seeks to establish a cause of unfairness &mdash; for all practical purposes the defendant &mdash; obliged to give a ruling <Col N="1847" /> or is the matter one to be dealt with on evidence where a person objecting has to produce a cause, substantiate their complaint by way of evidence and have issues such as this debated at length in a trial by trial stage of a prosecution?  As I said, under previous legislation, if an objection was raised and notified in time to the party on the opposing side, effectively there was an automatic obligation to produce the evidence.  That arose from the 1967 Criminal Procedure Act and, subsequently, the 1984 Criminal Justice Act.  I am seeking the Minister's guidance and assistance in discovering how it is envisaged that this legislation will affect the way in which the trial is conducted.</P>

      <P>It gives me no joy to say that it is necessary to raise this issue in the Dáil this evening.  Unfortunately, circumstances are such that we in Clonmel and in the surrounding area have no option but to bring this very important issue to the attention of the Minister.  The failure of the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce to find a replacement industry for the Digital plant in Clonmel is the source of extreme alarm and concern among the 80 remaining employees in the company and for everyone in the area who is concerned about the commercial and social life of the town and surrounding area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister this evening to give Clonmel top priority.  This matter must be addressed urgently and with determination. Those of us who live in the locality &mdash; I want the Minister to know this &mdash; feel that sufficient priority has not been attached to the need to attract a replacement industry to Clonmel.  I regret that it is necessary for me to intervene at this stage, but it is both necessary <Col N="1848" /> and vital that the urgent need to find a replacement industry be highlighted now.</P>
    <P>The announcement of 22 February 1991 that the Digital plant in Clonmel was facing closure, resulting in the loss of 350 jobs, was a massive blow to the town.  The shock was, however, eased somewhat when the company gave a commitment to defer total closure until July 1992 to allow all concerned to find a replacement industry for the plant.  A year has now almost passed and the remaining 80 workers face unemployment on 1 July.</P>
    <P>The recession forced upon the town of Clonmel by the closure of Digital, on its commercial and social life, has been devastating and with no positive news as yet of a replacement industry we are very apprehensive and the future is looking very bleak.  The plant was visited by representatives of Cabletron which eventually was located in Limerick, and by Wyeths which was eventually located in Newbridge.  Surely this begs the question of what priority has been attached to Clonmel and how vital to the Minister is the fate of its employees and future employment in the town.</P>
    <P>Clonmel has lost over 700 industrial jobs during the past three years &mdash; 200 jobs at Barlo Heating, 116 at Burke's Bacon and 350 at Digital, while almost 100 jobs have been lost in firms which service those companies.  The myth that Clonmel, is doing well commercially and industrially is blatantly disproved by the facts I put before the House this evening. I wish to impress upon the Minister that we are facing a serious deadline and that at this stage a replacement industry is a chronic necessity.  With unemployment in the town running at 28 per cent we can wait no longer.  Because of this we have got to be aggressive with our demands.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to use all the means at his disposal immediately, to secure a replacement industry for Clonmel before the dreaded date of 1 July.  I take hope in the fact that the Minister <Col N="1849" /> here this evening is my namesake.  I hope that he will make the town of Clonmel his first priority and find a replacement industry for Digital.</P>

      <P>During the past two years most of the major players in the mini computer industry worldwide have found it necessary to consolidate and increase their manufacturing efficiency.  Digital have been particularly affected by the downturn in the mini computer industry and have implemented cost cutting measures around the world.  The decision to close their plant in Clonmel was taken as part of the company's review of their overall manufacturing capacity which has resulted in reductions in both the USA and elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>Digital Equipment Corporation first established a manufacturing facility in Ireland in 1971.  During the years the company have shown a high degree of commitment to Ireland through expansion and the addition of high skill design and development functions.  The work-force in Digital have traditionally proved themselves to be a significant contributor to the success of the corporation and are to be commended in this regard.</P>
      <P>As regards a replacement industry for Digital, I can inform the House that the Industrial Development Authority have been actively promoting the Digital factory in Clonmel.  Indeed, the Industrial Development Authority are continuing to promote Clonmel, County Tipperary, as a location for industry.  This has been evidenced by the fact that there have been 21 site visits to Clonmel during the past year of which seven have visited the Digital site.  Two of these companies have made return visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, any discussions the Industrial Development Authority have or continue to have with any of these companies are of a highly confidential nature and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such discussions for fear of <Col N="1850" /> jeopardising a possible project.  As is often the case, companies also consider other European locations and are in discussions with competing agencies.  Therefore the priority must be to secure any possible project for Ireland and premature speculation or publicity can frustrate this.  However, I am happy in the knowledge that the Industrial Development Authority are doing everything in their power to secure a project for the town of Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Industrial Development Authority project divisions and overseas offices are fully briefed on the needs of Clonmel for a replacement industry when marketing the town to mobile investments.  The promotion of the town is also aided by a promotional brochure on South Tipperary. Clonmel is the administrative capital of the region with the majority of its population under 25.  It is also within easy reach of Ireland's main ports and airports.</P>
    <P>Clonmel has a number of existing major companies such as Medite Europe Limited, Showerings Limited and Schiesser Limited.  Plans for a £15 million extension programme for Medite were announced by the company last year with the creation of 30 additional jobs.  All the factors I have mentioned have helped the Industrial Development Authority to attract site visits to the town.  Furthermore, the Industrial Development Authority are working closely with the Clonmel community to attract new investment, especially in high technology.</P>
    <P>However, most significantly the Industrial Development Authority are working very closely with Digital to find a replacement industry for the factory.  An aggressive marketing campaign was embarked upon by Digital and the Industrial Development Authority with Digital funding a promotional video and brochure produced to sell the Digital plant and town of Clonmel.  These are being marketed worldwide by the Industrial Development Authority.  I am pleased to <Col N="1851" /> be able to say that the Industrial Development Authority and Digital have very close involvement in relation to promoting the factory.  Digital have been more than willing to discuss at length with industrialists the merits of Clonmel as well as facilitating site visits to their facility.</P>

Both the parents and neighbours have been on to me separately expressing their upset and anxiety about this case.</P>

The court case was scheduled for 10 a.m. last Monday but because of the volume of cases the child was forced to wait for two hours before the two minute hearing.</P>
      <P>An order was made by the district justice and the child was taken by squad car to the Bridewell Garda Station, Cork, accompanied by neighbours.  They were kept at the Bridewell until approximately 5 p.m. that afternoon.  During that time the child was kept in a small room accompanied by the neighbours.  At one stage they were told that the child might have to be put in a cell because of pressure of space.  Eventually the child was taken to Dublin by hackney accompanied by an unidentified man in plain clothes; I presume it was a detective but I am not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents requested that they or a <Col N="1852" /> member of the family would accompany the child to Dublin to minimise the child's anxiety but the request was refused on the grounds that insurance cover would not be available for them.  I do not have any complaints against the Garda or the Minister because it is the shame of all Members of the House that such a situation could exist.  The system must be changed to allow a more sensitive and humane attitude to cases like this.</P>
    <P>The child suffered terrible trauma.  The whole situation was insensitive and inhuman.  It is one of the most cold-hearted, callous cases I have encountered in many years.  Would the situation have been different if the family had been well off with access to expert legal opinion? They are a poor family.  I do not want to identify them but the Minister knows who they are.  It was a case of rough justice all round and I ask the Minister &mdash; not in a political way &mdash; to turn his attention to cases like that so that the system can be changed and that young people who through no fault of their own come before the courts can be dealt with a more sensitive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 2 March the District Court ordered, with the consent of the parents, that the young boy referred to by the Deputy be remanded to St. Michael's House, Dublin, for assessment.  He was, in accordance with the warrant issued by the court, delivered into the custody of the superintendent in charge of the Bridewell Garda Station, Cork, at 12 noon that day for escort to Dublin.  The Deputy has his facts right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities informed me that it was not possible to arrange for an immediate escort because of the many other urgent calls on Garda time that day.  However, every effort was made to arrange for the earliest possible escort. While these arrangements were being made the boy and two neighbours accompanying him were made as <Col N="1853" /> comfortable as possible in the doctor's room in the station.  They were given refreshments and the child was provided with a full meal.  I am informed that, as can happen on a busy day in a Garda station, Garda resources were heavily taxed on that day and it took longer than would be desirable for the escort to be arranged on this occasion.  I readily admit that.  The boy did not, therefore, leave the station until just after 5 p.m. when he travelled to Dublin by taxi accompanied by two plain clothes gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is not normal Garda practice to allow relatives or friends to accompany a person being escorted under warrant as the Garda must comply strictly with the terms of the warrant.  I also understand from the Garda authorities that the gardaí in the Bridewell were unaware of any request from the parents in this respect.  The Garda authorities informed me that during the time involved in arranging the journey every effort was made to ensure that the child was treated with dignity and care.  The parents of the child did not make a complaint about the matter and the Garda were unaware of any misgivings which they might have felt.  I have been assured by the gardaí concerned that they acted at all times within the law, in accordance with the court warrant and with due concern for the boy.  I think that is admitted by Deputy Allen and I appreciate that he said it in the House.</P>
    <P>Of course I do not regard this situation as satisfactory.  It is not satisfactory that the child should have been obliged to wait so long for an escort to Dublin.  I know that the Garda authorities are deeply conscious of the need to avoid such situations and they have expressed that opinion.  Unfortunately, this was one of those occasions when it was not possible to arrange matters as everyone would have wished.  However, in support of what the Deputy said, I will try to make arrangements which will ensure that there will not be a recurrence in this regard.  We hope there will not be.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Inner City Drug Problem.</Title>
    <Col N="1854" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Areas of Dublin city have had a serous drug problem since the early eighties when heroin abuse was at epidemic proportions in part of my constituency in the north inner city.  The drug problem in the inner city now ranks alongside the area's other major social problems and is, no doubt, related directly to them.  These include endemic unemployment, substandard housing, lack of educational opportunity and an inadequate health service.  Those problems, as well as other factors, combine to create an environment where some young people despairingly turn to hard drugs and become dependent on the pushers who exploit them.</P>
      <P>Many young people have died, many more have had their lives destroyed, while an increasing number are now infected with the HIV virus.  Local people in the past organised to fight the drug pushers and drive them out.  The local Garda drug unit has been to the forefront in pursuing the pushers and bringing many of them before the courts. Despite all this there is yet again an alarming and spiralling availability of heroin in the area.  This is the message I have been getting in recent weeks from community workers and local tenants leaders. Their alarm seems to have been echoed by recent press reports of comments attributed to the chairman of the Coolmine therapeutic centre, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This alarming increase has also been highlighted by the seizure a week ago of over £100,000 worth of heroin, the largest single seizure here in recent years.  The problems has been compounded by the arrival here of the drug &ldquo;ecstasy&rdquo;. Despite efforts from various quarters to promote this new drug as a safe sophisticated trip, young people in my constituency have ended up in psychiatric hospitals as a result of this new, so called &ldquo;safe&rdquo; drug.  In spite of all the media attention and the promises made by successive <Col N="1855" /> Governments and Minister for Justice, a great deal more needs to be done to get to grips with what is now a spiralling drugs problem.</P>
    <P>The social conditions of the inner city and other urban areas need comprehensive renewal, yet the opposite is happening.  The local authority house building programme, for example, has been all but scrapped and the refurbishment of flats complexes in the inner city is inadequately funded.  If the social conditions are not tackled then all the Garda action the Minister can muster will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the most frustrating factors from those concerned with putting the drug pushers off the streets and behind bars is the fact that the main suppliers are individuals who have already been caught red-handed, brought before the courts, charged and remanded on bail.  I will not refer to specific cases before the courts, but drug suppliers remanded on bail tend to accelerate and increase their drug pushing activities while awaiting their next court appearance.  There are even cases at present where drug suppliers are caught in possession of drugs while on bail, charged in court with a second offence &mdash; in some instances with a third offence &mdash; and then released on bail to continue their deadly business. This is a disgraceful dereliction of duty on the part of the Judiciary concerned. This problem must be resolved if the amount of drugs on our streets is to be significantly reduced.  Some members of our Judiciary are totally out of touch and far too complacent about the heroin problem in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to take the following proposals on board.  Garda efforts to defeat the pushers depend to a large extent on time consuming surveillance and local knowledge, local contacts, etc. If we accept that much, then it follows that each Garda district with a serious drug problem should have a special Garda drug unit specifically targeting <Col N="1856" /> suppliers in their areas.  This is an absolute priority.  The recent success of the local Garda drug unit in the north inner city &mdash; I congratulate them on this &mdash; in the seizure of £100,000 of heroin in the flats complex is an example of how a local unit can successfully operate and achieve results.  Yet there are areas of Dublin city which do not have any such local drug unit.  The unit to which I have referred are seriously overstretched with responsibility for several areas, each of which has a major drugs problem.</P>
    <P>I rarely refer to specific areas in case they are stigmatised, but I have been specifically asked to draw attention to the almost endemic drug problem in the Sheriff Street area and in St. Mary's Mansions in Seán McDermott Street.  The vast majority of the people who live in these areas are appalled by the drug pushers who use their areas and they want them out.  I believe the Garda and Dublin Corporation should tackle this problem jointly.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House I referred to the case of a major drugs seizure during the early eighties when almost £400,000 of heroin was seized, perhaps the largest single seizure of heroin in this country.  A member of a leading criminal family associated with the heroin trade was charged but the matter was never finalised.  The person concerned left the jurisdiction.  That person is now back in this jurisdiction but has not been brought back before the courts.  I ask the Minister to pursue this very serious problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn) Pádraig Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while the latest indications are that there has been an increase in drug offending in the country, cannabis resin is still the main drug misused in Ireland and accounts for over 70 per cent of all drug charges and drug seizures.  Having said that, the Garda authorities are keenly aware that there are some heroin dealing <Col N="1857" /> activities associated with certain areas of Dublin.  Very special attention is being given to these areas.  Specific measures have been taken by the Garda to counteract such activities and these measures have resulted in a considerable number of detections of drug related offences, some of which the House will be aware as a result of the media attention they recently received.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that the drug known as ecstasy arrived on the Irish scene in 1991 and is, of course, a matter of some concern.  This drug is associated with the acid house party-rave disco scene which attracts a teenage following.  It has also appeared in certain areas of Dublin which has a history of misuse of other drugs. These areas and the acid house party-rave disco scene are the subject of ongoing Garda attention which has resulted in a number of prosecutions for possession of various drugs, including ecstasy.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that there is no complacency in the attitude of the Government or the Garda towards the drugs problem.  Dealing with this problem remains a very high priority and is continuing to receive every attention from a law enforcement point of view. All members of the Garda Síochána deal with the law enforcement aspects of drug misuse within their operational area.  In addition, specific Garda drug squads operate in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. At present small specialist units are operating in Dublin's north inner city, Ballymun, Ballyfermot and Tallaght. Similar specialist units are set up on a temporary basis in other areas as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategies employed by the Garda include intelligence gathering and analysis, surveillance, targeting and monitoring the activities of suspects as well as routine investigation and international liaison.  The allocation of manpower and other resources to specialised units such as the drug squad is a matter for the Garda authorities in the light of their <Col N="1858" /> assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and other demands on services.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the available resources for dealing with the drugs problem are sufficient.</P>
    <P>Many important initiatives are being taken to counteract drug abuse and trafficking, but in the short time available I cannot go into detail on these.  Indeed it would not be in the interests of effective law enforcement to disclose some of the measures in place to deal with the problem. However, it may be helpful if I were to mention two significant developments which are of relevance in tackling drug offending.  The first is the decision by the European Council that a EUROPOL drugs unit should be established as soon as possible to act as a centralised exchange and co-ordination unit for, in particular, drug-related information between member states.  This unit will be of great practical benefit in combating the international trafficking of drugs.  The second is my proposed legislation to deprive traffickers of the profits of their illegal activity.  I am to have a Bill in this regard circulated to the House during this session.</P>
    <P>The point has been made on many occasions that the problem of drug offending cannot be solved by law enforcement on its own.  Drug abuse causes major problems in society, and the role of parents, teachers and other agencies caring for young people is as important as the Garda response.  In regard to warning young people at school of the dangers of substance abuse, I should stress that this issue is being dealt with through the Garda schools programme. The need for a national drugs strategy to tackle the drugs problem on every front has been recognised by the Government and last year my colleague, the Minister for Health, launched the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  This strategy sets realistic and achievable objectives for a reduction both in the supply of and demand for <Col N="1859" /> drugs.  The Deputy can be assured that the Government are determined to tackle the problem of drug abuse and that the Garda will have all the resources they need to continue their resolute and effective handling of this problem.</P>

      <P>The House will now hear two minute statements on matters appropriate to the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the Minister for the Marine.  I call Deputy Seán Ryan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the ongoing campaign by various groups and organisations, including the Labour Party &mdash; initially as a busway &mdash; to reopen the Harcourt Street line, which was closed 30 years ago.  This would be of huge benefit both environmentally and economically for the people of the South County Dublin area, particularly as traffic congestion on the way into the city has reached frightening proportions.</P>
      <P>As a result of a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 5 February last, which stated that Cabinet approval for the opening of this line had been secured, approximately 60,000 people in the South County Dublin catchment area are under the impression that this line will be reopened in the very near future.  In view of this, I ask the Minister to outline the Government's position on this important matter to confirm whether the Cabinet have approved this project and whether finance is available for it.  Has this project been taken into account in the allocation of EC Structural Funds or will it have to await inclusion in the next phase of the Cohesion Fund?  When can people expect buses to use this route, which is very important to the people of this area? I look forward to having the Minister clarify the position in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>Tá mise buíoch freisin gur ardaigh an Teachta an cheist agus go bhfuil deis agam freagra a thabhairt dó. As the House will be aware, an expert group were established to assess and report on the most suitable transport options for the Harcourt Street line.  The remit of this group has been extended to include examination of the possibility of developing a light rail system for Dublin. The detailed work of the expert group in relation to the Harcourt Street line is now nearing completion.  In that context it has already been accepted by the Government in principle that the Harcourt Street line should be reopened as a public transport facility.  However, a number of important issues in relation to the project remain to the finalised.  These include the different public transport options, engineering and operational considerations, capital and operational costs and the availability of the necessary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the mode of public transport which will ultimately be provided on the Harcourt Street line, I believe that in the event of sufficient resources being available on a city-wide basis for Dublin, light rail may have been the desired public transport option.  However, that option would be dependent on the availability of substantial levels of EC assistance. Depending on the level of funding available bus-based options could also have an important role to play.  However, until the full level and extent of EC support which may be available for funding major public transport developments in Dublin is known it is important that all options in relation to the development of the Harcourt Street line be preserved.  In this regard an examination is under way of the the possibility of commencing work in relation to the reopening of the alignment which would be common to both a busway option and a light rail development.  This work could include expenditure on site surveying, preparation of the necessary engineering <Col N="1861" /> and technical specifications, investigation of traffic management implications as well as investigation in relation to the possible need to relocate existing underground services.  Discussions are being held with the EC authorities in relation to possible funding for this work under the current Operational Programme on Peripherality.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that Sealink Stena Line, Dún Laoghaire Harbour's main user, have expressed a strong wish to remain in Dún Laoghaire I ask the Minister for the Marine to indicate his support for the retention of the ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire.  Without the ferry service there would be no Dún Laoghaoire Harbour.  The ferry is by far the major source of income and its retention is of vital importance to the livelihood of many people in the Dún Laoghaire area and beyond.  There are compelling reasons for the retention of the ferry service.  Dún Laoghaire is Ireland's premier passenger port.  Twice as many passengers use it &mdash; 1.2 million last year &mdash; as Dublin Port and, more important, the harbour pays its way.  The harbour is 45 minutes nearer to Holyhead per round trip than is Dublin Port, with consequential savings.  Dún Laoghaire provides alternative competition to Dublin Port and has an excellent record of industrial relations. While Dún Laoghaire will never be a freight port only, nonetheless almost 5 per cent of our national exports go through the harbour.  It seems that we need the capacity for some freight handling in a port near Dublin.  Strategically, dependence on one port only in the Dublin Bay area would not be sound policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board put their draft development plan for the harbour, now nearing finality, on display over 500 written responses were received from individuals and groups.  The harbour board are fully committed to the retention of the ferry <Col N="1862" /> terminal.  In their view its continued existence is compatible with the amenity role of the harbour.  As I indicated at the outset, Sealink Stena Line have expressed a strong wish to remain in Dún Laoghaire.  The company's proposed investment in Holyhead, for example, and their commitment to increasing off-season traffic is an essential complement to the development of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>The ferry is by far the major source of revenue for the harbour.  No amount of leisure-type development would generate sufficient income to maintain the harbour.  Without the ferry there would be no Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to transfer the ferry service from Dún Laoghaire.  I am aware of the overwhelming support of the people of Dún Laoghaire for the retention of this service and fully appreciate the importance they attach to its continuation.  The recommendations of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Development Plan will be of considerable assistance to me in considering the alternatives available in Dublin Bay for the development of berthage and terminal facilities in the future.</P>
      <P>I met this afternoon with Professor Dermot McAleese, Chairman of the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, who presented me with an advance copy of the development plan for Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  It is my intention to make the report available soon.  I know it is eagerly awaited by many interested parties and I intend to have it published without delay.  In the course of my meeting with Professor McAleese we discussed the future development of the harbour and the board's role in assisting me in achieving and overseeing that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board were appointed in January 1990 to advise on the management and development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.  The board will report to the Minister for the <Col N="1863" /> Marine until such time as a harbour authority is established on a legislative basis.</P>
    <P>The board prepared a Draft Development Plan for Dún Laoghaire Harbour in April 1991.  A public exhibition of the details of the draft development plan was mounted which included a scale model of the harbour.  This display took place over a series of special public exhibitions in Dún Laoghaire.  Almost 7,000 people visited the exhibition and 500 submissions were received by the board in response to the draft plan.</P>
    <P>Since then the board have spent the <Col N="1864" /> intervening months engaged in a careful examination of the submissions received. The development plan now prepared represents the outcome of the board's deliberations and the decisions taken following a through examination of the comments and valuable suggestions received on the initial draft.  This plan should serve as a blueprint for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour for the remainder of this decade and well into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 6 March 1992.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Oral <Col N="1781" /> Questions Nos. 17, 20, 22, 30, 32, 62, 76 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's primary objective in so far as State aids is concerned is to see a reduction in the level and availability of State aids in the richer member states both to make our aids more attractive by comparison and to allow us to minimise the cost of our aids to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The State aids policy being pursued by the EC Commission is in line with this objective on an EC-wide basis.  A stricter application of State aid policy has been initiated by the Commission having regard to the potential State aids hold for distorting competition in the context of EC market integration and economic and social cohesion.  I believe that, used to the full, the instruments available to the Commission in the Treaty provisions governing State aids are sufficient to enable it to discharge this task effectively.</P>
      <P>It has to be recognised, however, that there has been an insufficient application of these instruments in the past, as evidenced by the fact that the richer member states account for the bulk of total aids to manufacturing in the Community.  As recognised in the recent Culliton report, we must maintain pressure for more effective EC restrictions on State aids in other Member States.</P>
      <P>In the post-Maastricht situation Ireland and, I imagine, the other weaker member states will be pressing strongly to ensure that the effect of State aid on economic and social cohesion becomes the predominant criterion in examining State aid cases.  In this regard, the cohesion provisions, which were improved on significantly at Maastricht, will require that the formulation and implementation of the Communities policies and actions should take account of the cohesion objective and contribute to its achievement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, under the designation system, industrial projects in designated areas qualify for a maximum fixed asset grant rate of 60 per cent.  This contrasts with projects in non-designated areas which qualify for a maximum grant rate of 45 per cent.  In addition, industries in designated areas may get a two thirds remission of rates for ten years at the discretion of the local authority.  However, the fact of designation does not automatically guarantee support at the maximum rate, nor does it guarantee rates remission.</P>
      <P>In 1988, following approval of the EC Commission, the Government agreed to the temporary designation of, <i>inter alia,</i> County Wexford for the higher rate of industrial grant for a three year period from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1991.</P>
      <P>The aim of the temporary designation was to provide a greater degree of flexibility to the IDA to promote suitable industrial projects for those counties worst affected by unemployment. However, the actual grants provided to individual projects depended on the employment and other economic benefits resulting from the projects in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance and impact of designation in industrial policy has lessened in recent years and maximum rates of fixed asset grants are seldom given.  The grant level proposed for any project increasingly depends upon the economic benefits in individual projects.  There is also a major shift away from fixed asset grants <Col N="1783" /> to supporting other areas are of perceived business weakness e.g. marketing, R &amp; D, and management development.  Support and grant in these areas are not differentiated on the basis of designation.</P>
    <P>The recent industrial policy review group report proposed amongst other matters that there should be a decisive shift from grants toward equity for indigenous industry and that the grant-aid budget for internationally mobile industry should be squeezed further.</P>
    <P>Implementation of these recommendations would diminish the relevance of designation as an industrial policy instrument even further and I do not propose to consider the renewal of designation for any area in advance of completion of consideration of the various other matters in the Industrial Policy Review Group's Report.</P>
    <P>The IDA has consistently promoted County Wexford as a location for industry and the Authority will continue to do so with the full array of support available.</P>

      <P>The Government decided last year to restructure the export credit insurance and finance schemes with a view to reducing State involvement and encouraging greater participation by the private sector in the provision of export credit cover.  The effect of the Government's decision, which was taken on foot of an in-depth review of the schemes carried out by independent consultants, is that the State is no longer providing export credit insurance cover for short term commercial risk business but is continuing, on a very selective basis, to provide cover for political risk and medium-term project risk business. The latter cover can be sought through <Col N="1784" /> the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which administered the export credit schemes since 1971 as agent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Short-term commercial risk insurance cover is available on the company's own account.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 46, 53, 68 and 85 together and to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement laying out the principal features of Irish trade in 1958 and in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking it that the Deputies are referring to a comparison between exports now and in 1958 to the European Community as it is currently constituted, <Col N="1785" /> that is, exports to the other eleven member states.</P>
    <P>The smaller proportion of Irish exports now to the European Community states as compared with 1958, is due, primarily, to the major and welcome changes which have occurred since then both in the structure of the Irish economy, with particular reference to Irish agriculture and Irish industry, and in the profile of our external trade.</P>
    <P>The following are the salient features of our exports in 1958 and in 1991 as shown by the table:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Our dependence on exports to the UK has decreased from 76 per cent in 1958 to 32 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The percentage of exports taken by EC markets excluding the UK has increased from 6 per cent in 1958 to 42 per cent in 1991.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The percentage of exports to North America, Japan and other distant markets has increased from 6 per cent to 20 per cent in the same period.</P>
    <P>All in all, these details demonstrate our national success in pursuing a deliberate policy of export diversification over the years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, our enhanced export performance contributed greatly to our growing economic maturity.  For example, in 1958 Irish exports amounted to £131 million, equivalent to 23 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product.  By 1991, however, Irish exports had increased to £15,031 million, equivalent to 56 per cent of our Gross Domestic Product.  Because the measurement of exports as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product is a measure of the openness of an economy, it will be seen that Ireland has, therefore, shifted in the period since 1958 from being a relatively closed economy, relying on domestic consumption, to a very open economy with a high proportion of goods produced being sold abroad.</P>
    <P>Additionally, there has been a significant shift in the mix of exports.  Seventy per cent of goods exported in 1958 were accounted for by agricultural and <Col N="1786" /> food products of which live animals accounted for 35 per cent and food products for the remaining 35 per cent.  In 1991, in contrast, manufactured products dominated our exports, accounting for 71 per cent of all exports while processed and unprocessed food and beverages accounted for about 23 per cent of all exports.</P>

    <P>On the question of resources, the Finance Council proposed in July 1991 to cut the EC Consumer Budget for 1992 from <Col N="1787" /> 10.8m to 4.3m ECU.  This would have had serious implications for the implementation of the three year plan.  I, together with the Minister for Finance, sought to have this cut rescinded and in November 1991 the amounts were more than fully restored to 19.2m ECU.  This amendment will provide adequately for further progress in implementation of the objectives of the plan.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the GATT negotiations are ongoing and agreement has not been reached in any of the 15 negotiating groups.  It is, therefore, not possible to anticipate the final outcome in any of the subjects covered at this juncture.</P>
      <P>The question of patentability of biotechnological inventions has been addressed in the negotiations.  The current draft text on intellectual property, which will form the basis of any agreement, provides for the possible exclusion from patentability of plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. Provision is nevertheless made for the protection of plant varieties.</P>
      <P>This draft contains more restrictive criteria than the patentability criteria in the current legislation of European countries generally.  The provisions in the new Patents Bill just signed by the President are modelled on the comparable provisions of the European Patent Convention and bring Ireland into line with the position in other European countries.</P>

      <P>In the case of Icarom I understand that AIB, the parent company of ICI prior to the appointment of an administrator in March 1985, wrote off a total investment of £86 million.  In addition, AIB continues to provide interest subsidies of £5.5 million per annum in connection with the £100 million funding provided by the banking sector for the Icarom administration.</P>

      <P>The business expansion scheme was extended in the 1991 Finance Act until 5 April 1993.  The 1991 Finance Act also excluded asset-backed sectors, addressed the problem of multiple companies and the problem of companies raising BES funds for on-lending to qualifying subsidiaries. It reduced the company limit to £500,000 and introduced a £75,000 lifetime cap on investors to refocus the BES on generating capital for smaller, riskier companies and to reduce the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.  The indications are that these changes have been successful.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to expand the scheme as this would dilute its focus on the sectors which currently qualify for it and would be difficult to justify given its very costly nature.</P>
      <P>The BES must also be viewed in the context of the Government's policy of tax reform which involves reducing tax rates and extending the standard band financed by an extension of the tax base through abolition/curtailment of special reliefs.  This policy has been recommended by such diverse bodies as the Industrial Policy Review Group, the Commission on Taxation, the EC, the OECD and the National Economic and Social Council.  The Government is totally committed to this policy which will create and sustain the best environment for job creation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of indictable crimes recorded for the subdistricts of County Meath for the years 1989 to 1990 are set out in the tabular statement below. Figures for 1991 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have taken a number of measures to deal with the problems being experienced in County Meath and surrounding areas.  These include the use of foot and mobile patrols, the frequent use of check points at various locations at unpredictable intervals and close liaison between gardaí in districts both within and bordering the Louth/Meath division to ensure a co-ordinated anti-crime response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Garda authorities continue to enlist the help of the community in the area in the fight against crime.  To this end they avail of all opportunities to advise the public on sensible crime prevention measures which they can take.  They are continuing to promote the community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes in the area which encourage the community to be vigilant to the danger of crime, to work closely with the Garda and to take appropriate measures to project their homes and their property. <Col N="1797" /> There are now 67 neighbourhood watch schemes and three community alert schemes actively operating in the Louth/Meath division.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that they are satisfied that these measures are being effective in dealing with crime in the area.  However, I am assured that the situation in Meath and surrounding areas is being kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>The following action is being taken or has already been taken to improve the situation in the Meath area:</P>
      <P>All waiting lists are currently being validated and placed on a new computerised system, which was funded by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>All internal management and clinical management procedures have been tightened up in line with the best management and clinical practice.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the local authority housing allocations in respect of 1991 and 1992 are set out in the following tabular statements.</P>
      <P>I refer to the replies to Questions No. 34 of 4 May 1989, No. 252 of 25 April 1990, No. 69 of 14 March 1991 and No. 129 of 19 November 1991 for information relating to the period 1986 to 1990.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to predict, on an authority by authority basis, house completions in 1992.  It is anticipated, however, that some 1,500 completions will be achieved nationally this year.  The tabular statement for 1992 indicates the number of new starts-acquisitions authorised for each authority for the year.</P>
