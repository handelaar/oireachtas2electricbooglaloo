      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your indulgence, Sir, to say through you to the Taoiseach that we on this side of the House are very encouraged and hopeful that the talks initiated between the parties in regard to <Col N="2" /> the tragic matter of which the House will be aware will be successful.  To that end may I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that in such discussions in future it will be well established that he speaks for the entire Government and all the Ministers belonging to the Government so that those on this side of the House will fully understand that they are dealing with the Government and not with just one part or party of that Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is permitting some discreation in the matter although it is not strictly relevant to the Order of Business.  I assumed that the Leaders of the various parties in the House were seized of this matter.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will take cognisance of the points we all raised about the urgency of the matter referred to and will report back to us as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>May I put two questions to the Taoiseach, one which I raised yesterday and about which there appeared to be some confusion, that is, the promise given in the Programme for Government to introduce an amendment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill to bring our law into line with the judgment of the European Court on Human Rights concerning the 1861 Offences Against the Persons Act which relates specifically to homosexuality.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy may I say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, it is included in the Programme for Government.  Work is commencing on its preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of clarification, arising from the confusion that arose on the Order of Business yesterday, would the Taoiseach say whether the programme for Government agreed between the two Government parties constitutes a promise of a legislative programme for this House so that we can address the <Col N="4" /> specific commitments given in that programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to repeat the question I put to the Taoiseach a moment ago, that was that in the discussions he has initiated with the other parties in this House, which I welcome, can we take it he is speaking as Taoiseach for all the Government and the Government parties, or is he speaking merely as Leader of one of the Government parties?  It is important to know that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I think you are not being fair to the Taoiseach.  He should be allowed to reply to that question I posed in his interests and in the interests of what is a very serious matter, because we want these talks to proceed but we must understand the basis on which they take place.  The <Col N="5" /> Taoiseach certainly indicated a willingness to clarify that matter when I met him yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has clarified yet again that the Programme for Government is the legislative programme, would he say what stage the Court and Court Officers Bill has reached and when we may expect the long promised Civil Legal Aid Bill to give a statutory basis to our legal aid services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="The Taoiseach Albert Reynolds">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Taoiseach has met party leaders would he say whether he will issue an invitation to the Council for the Status of Women to meet him?  Furthermore, would he consider it necessary now for party leaders on this side of the House to meet with the other party leader, the leader of the junior party in Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Garland that it is not my intention to prolong this debate but it is easy to understand the reason it has taken up so much time.  Any Deputy on this side of the House who represents a rural constituency could talk for hours about the problems in regard to roads in their constituency. It is a major issue.  Unfortunately, public transport is not as readily available in rural areas as it is in urban areas.  Therefore I can understand the reason a Deputy representing a city constituency might become impatient with his rural colleagues.</P>
      <P>Last night I was referring in a general way to section 67, to which I will return on Committee Stage.  I queried whether lighting and lights were included in the definition of dangerous structures, trees and so on.  It has been the practice for many years now when roads are being realigned and ditches removed to replace them with concrete posts and palings. Sadly, in my constituency those concrete structures have caused tragedies.  In frosty or wet weather, accidents will happen and even a minor accidents where one skids into a concrete post or paling, can and unfortunately, usually does have tragic consequences.  On each occasion a road has been realigned in the past 20 years or so soft ditches and hedges which at least held vehicles and lessened the impact, have been replaced with awful dangerous structures.  I note this section calls on owners and occupiers to do something about them but there should also be a section which calls on the new National Roads Authority to ensure that no structures put the lives of people in danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another shortcoming of the Bill, which I pointed out last night, is that it does <Col N="15" /> not cover all aspects of road safety.  For example, moving objects which pose a danger, such as dangerous vehicles, are not covered.  Because of this division of responsibility, whatever good intentions there may be to make our roads safe will be weakened.  Hand in hand with the building and provision of roads must be the safety of those who use those roads.</P>
    <P>When travelling to the House yesterday on a busy road I suddenly came across a granite boulder, almost the size of the Ceann Comhairle's dais, which had obviously fallen off the back of a lorry. Luckily, there was no vehicle behind the lorry when the boulder fell off.  If there had been the consequences would have been tragic.  That is an example of the danger moving traffic can pose apart from the danger posed by fixed items as mentioned in the Bill.  Little attention is paid to the need to ensure that loads on substandard vehicles are tied down and secure.  More attention has to be paid to that and it is a pity the new National Roads Authority will not have the power to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill will uniform and effective measures be provided to deal with roads made dangerous by snow or frost?  It is not unusual to find roads in one county in a satisfactory state and on reaching the next county to find that the conditions are different.  While the roads in one county might be clear of snow, through the use of snow clearing equipment, they may not be clear in another. That causes many problems.  I assume responsibility for ensuring that our national primary roads are attended to will pass on, following the passage of this Bill, to the new National Roads Authority. Will the Minister confirm this? Nothing serious happened this year but in previous years consequences were serious.  Due to a lack of uniformity problems have been caused.  Transport companies do not know whether they should permit their vehicles to travel because of a lack of information about road conditions in a neighbouring county.</P>
    <P>The House will forgive me referring. <Col N="16" /> once again, to my constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny, which has been referred to in this debate by a colleague.  I would like to refer in particular to the magnificent new Euro-route which passes through Kilkenny between the county boundary at New Ross and the county boundary at Ferrybank in Waterford.  This new route, which was long overdue and badly needed, has caused immense problems for the community in Glenmore. Kilkenny County Council have been doing their best and it appears that an obligation has been placed on owners and occupiers of land and structures along the route to ensure that they do not pose a danger.  When I mentioned boundary fences I should also have said that they prevented animals from straying. However, there does not appear to be an obligation on the new roads authority to ensure the safety of people in small rural villages and that their livelihoods are not affected.  In rural communities the livelihood of the farming community is being seriously disrupted and adversely affected; even the lives of school children are being put in danger and there is no effort to deal with the sense of unease which people feel.</P>
    <P>I am aware that negotiations and meetings were held with previous holders of the office of the Minister for the Environment. Officials of Kilkenny County Council will have discussions with the new Minister to find a reasonable solution to the problem, because it is totally unreasonable to expect the local authority &mdash; Kilkenny County Council &mdash; from their own very limited and inadequate resources to fund the measures which will alleviate the anxieties of the local community in this area.  The road has been described as the road from Moscow to Skibbereen.  It is a major Euro-route designed to carry people to the west, south-west and north-west, which is very commendable, and a lot of Structural Funds were provided for this road.  Nevertheless, why should a poverty stricken local authority be asked to remedy the dangers which have been thrown up?  There is an obligation on the <Col N="17" /> Department to provide additional funding to build the necessary bridges which will alleviate the worries of the local community.</P>
    <P>I hope that the new Minister, Deputy Smith, will take a fresh look at this matter, because each case must be judged on its merits.  I do not go along with the idea that precedents might be created. When this case is fully examined I believe that there will be a strong case for additional funding to the local authority to enable them to meet what is needed in this case.  I hope the Minister will find time in his very busy schedule to meet a deputation in the near future, to examine the matter and to come to a reasonable solution.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the proposal regarding tolls because it involves additional taxation.  Many speakers referred to the already overburdened motorist in relation to tax.  In the recent budget an increase in motor taxation was announced.  Not only does a motorist pay a lot of money to drive a car, he also has to pay just to park his car.  If the proceeds go to local authorities there should be relief of taxation in other ways, because our motorists are among the most highly taxed in the world.  Extra tax affects commercial vehicles and cars which people need to drive to work.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take into consideration the ideas put forward, not just by me but by Deputies representing rural areas.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage when many of the matters raised here can be dealt with in more detail.  Perhaps the Minister will then have a better chance to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in welcoming this opportunity to speak about national roads development as proposed by the Minister in this new Bill. When the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy O'Hanlon, spoke in this House on 3 December 1991 he went over what he had said on a previous occasion about the objectives of the Roads Bill. He said it was to establish a roads authority on a statutory basis and to update, <Col N="18" /> strengthen and modernise the law relating to public roads.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his new post. Since he comes from the mid-west region, as I do, I know he will take a keen interest in what is going on in the area.  However, he has very difficult hurdles to cross because this is the fourth attempt by the Department of the Environment to bring our national primary roads into the modern world.  In 1978 a national road development plan was published by the former Deputy Sylvester Barrett in which he set out the objectives strategy for a complete development plan.  Many targets were set; but, 13 years later, as far as the mid-west region is concerned, fewer than one quarter of the objectives have been met.</P>
      <P>It is not as if the people who drew up the plan were unaware of the difficulties. They set out clearly the problems in regard to financing.  They said that there would be difficulties in implementing the plan, that it would have to have the goodwill of the people and that it would have to be pushed.  In spite of this, people in the mid-west have a poorly serviced national primary route which limits access to the markets.  It also limits access to the west by tourists.  This is a major problem in view of the number of tourists from the United States who disembark at Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his efforts &mdash; I know he is a determined person. However, before the Bill is enacted the Minister has to set targets for his Department and the roads authority as to what is required for the people of the west and mid-west.  As I said here last Tuesday week, the construction of a road from Dublin to the Shannon Estuary, which would cut the country in two, is urgently required before the completion of the Single Market.  The Minister is in a position to ensure that this work is undertaken; he can give the instructions to his Department.  The construction of such a road would have an invigorating impact on the country.  It would provide plenty of employment for small builders along the route and for local authorities which have the capacity to take on the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> In spite of all the objectives, strategies, plans and programmes on peripherality, transport and infrastructure which have been laid before Ministers, the only development envisaged is the extension of the national primary route to Portlaoise. The medium term objective set for the National Roads Authority is the completion of the motorway from Dublin to Portlaoise.  The rest of the country is being ignored.  As he knows, the Minister has to make a major gesture to the people of the west and mid-west.  The development of a motorway which would enable people to travel from the extreme end of the Minister's constituency in Tipperary to Dublin in less than an hour would be a major advance.  It does not matter what the speed limit is because people can travel at 100 miles per hour on roadways if they are properly constructed.  Because of the way they have been constructed dual carriageways endanger lives every day.  For example, outside Dublin there is not proper means by which big trucks can cross the dual carriageway.  I often wonder how there are not more serious accidents on this road.  When motorways are constructed to international standards there is no easy access to them.  If the motorway goes through Tipperary the North Tipperary County Council will be able to construct proper access roads. This will lead to better planning.</P>
    <P>This is my bugbear.  This is why I came into the House to contribute to the debate.  Like Deputy Garland, I believe there has been to much talk about the National Roads Authority, particularly as the Government have made up their mind on the Bill and will not change it. If any amendments are made to the Bill they will relate to minor issues which have been overlooked by the Department in the drafting of it.  As Deputy Yates argued in his contribution, there may be a problem over the interpretation of the words &ldquo;may&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or some other small word.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the action the Minister is going to take on foot of the powers he now has.  He has an opportunity as Minister for the Environment to give a <Col N="20" /> lift to the west and mid-west.  He will not have the power to do this for too long and he should grasp the nettle now.  He has an opportunity to do this if he takes into consideration the proposals in the Road Development Plan for the 1980s, the Operational Programme on Peripherality published in 1989 and the Ireland-Road Development Plan 1989 to 1993, which was introduced by Deputy Flynn when he was Minister for the Environment.  The Minister represents a constituency in the mid-west and I am sure he can recall the great cry the then Minister made about this programme. However, the west got nothing from this programme, despite the fact that the then Minister came from the west.  In view of the Minister's interest in the west and the mid west, I ask him to grasp the opportunity to do something for these areas.</P>
    <P>The development plan introduced by the then Minister for the Environment contained much flowery language.  I want to give the Minister a sample of this. Chapter 3 of the plan outlines the objectives and strategies and refers to the fundamental aim of road development policy.  It then goes on to outline the economic and social objectives.  These include: reduced transport costs, facilitate and promote industrial development, facilitate and promote the development of agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry, facilitate and promote development of the tourism industry, promote regional development, promote the development of the Border areas, indirectly promote employment creation, promote economic and social cohesion, etc.</P>
    <P>I believe these objectives applied to the east cost only; they applied to the line which runs from Belfast to Rosslare. As Deputy Pattison said, the Euro-route to Rosslare is great, but the people in the west are being left to their own devices. The people on the east coast are the wealthy ones and they are able to carry out their own developments.  If toll roads are to be constructed they should be on the east coast where there is plenty of employment.  The west has suffered <Col N="21" /> greatly from emigration.  We do not have adequate main roads to facilitate and promote industrial development.  In addition, transport costs are very high. We do not have the resources to develop agriculture and fisheries.  None of the social and economic objectives set out in the plan introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, has been applied to the west.  It would be ironic if the Minister made a major impact in this Department, if people were employed on the land, industries developed and tourism developed along Lough Derg, but because the roads have not been improved there is no access to these areas.  The Minister should concentrate on improving roads.</P>
    <P>One of the problems for short term development is that local authorities do not seem to have the expertise to put in place the necessary plans for road development.  When the programme was submitted to Brussels on 30 March 1989 by the then Minister, Deputy Flynn, the necessary technical information required was not available from the mid-west &mdash; it certainly was not available from my constituency because cutbacks had been made and the Department would not agree to the employment of the necessary engineering staff.  In order to overcome the problem of the non-availability of specialised engineering staff I suggest that the Minister consider a sharing of staff between, say, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council, or between north Tipperary County Council, Clare County Council, Limerick County Council and all the other county councils with responsibility for the Dublin-Shannon route.  Perhaps the Department could consider that suggestion and ask the county engineers in the various county councils if they would be agreeable to it.  I am quite certain that the county engineer in my constituency would agree to any proposal that would help to update the necessary documents for submission to Europe.  I do not understand why the Department of the Environment will not agree to the employment of these people.</P>
    <P>On the national primary route running <Col N="22" /> from Limerick to Gort in County Galway one may encounter four major bottlenecks at Newmarket-on-Fergus, Clarecastle, Ennis and Crusheen.  Plans were submitted by Clare County Council for a by-pass at Ennis but these plans have not been updated because the staff is not available in Clare County Council to do so.  I understand that the National Roads Authority will liaise with local authorities on these matters.  Will that Authority have the necessary staff to update these plans and to provide the necessary information that will enable development to be carried out?  It is unacceptable to bring in legislation setting up a National Roads Authority without indicating how they will be financed.  As we have the benefit of Structural Funds a target should be set for the carrying out of one major project.</P>
    <P>Much research and development has been carried out by the Department of the Environment in the preparation of programmes, and that is commendable. They have overlooked nothing in this regard.  They know what programmes should be put in place, but some initiative must be taken.  If tolls are to be considered they should be proposed for areas where they will not be resisted.  For instance, I do not understand why Kildare County Council, which was then dominated by Fianna Fáil, voted against the implementation of a toll on the Naas by-pass.  It was the then Minister for the Environment, Sylvester Barrett, who in the road development plan for the eighties instituted the idea of toll roads.  While there was an agreement between Kildare County Council and the developer in the case of the Naas by-pass it was an opportunity to set a headline.  However, for some spurious political motives Kildare County Council voted against the implementation of tolls.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is taking a different approach to the implementation of tolls.  From speeches I have read, Deputies have reservations about the introduction of tolls because they believe the Minister has gone too far in the other direction.  As a western Deputy I am not against a more rigid application of tolls provided they are introduced in areas <Col N="23" /> where people can afford them and provided they will not be a total inhibition to people travelling to the west.  In any event, it is unlikely that they would be utilised there.  As far as the roads plan is concerned, this is a great opportunity for the Minister to take action.</P>
    <P>Plans have been laid for a long number of years.  In the roads plan of 1979 it was stated that the main objectives of the plan were to achieve, by 1990, a situation wherein the country's national roads network and our principal urban roads systems would have significantly improved. It stated that given full implementation of the plan the national primary roads and important sections of the national secondary roads would be brought up to two lane standards.  I know that people will expect the National Roads Authority to adopt similar objectives.  There will be competing demands and there will be a drip-feed application of funds from the Department of the Environment.  I would ask the Minister to lay down the minimum requirement in this area.  We realise that all the objectives cannot be achieved but achievable objectives should be set for the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that one of the objectives in the 1979 plan was to bring national secondary routes up to two lane standards, national secondary routes in County Clare and, indeed, in County Tipperary, still have not been brought up to these standards.  The other day our county engineer proposed that Clare County Council set by-passes along the scenic route of the national primary road at the northern end of County Clare because tourist buses and motor cars cannot pass in safety.  I do not know why the Department of the Environment and the Minister were persuaded to say that such a plan was realisable.  In 1978 the Minister wanted roads brought up to full two-lane standard.  He planned that most intermediate towns on the national primary routes would have by-passes, that the principal access routes to Dublin and the other major urban centres, including air and sea ports, would be upgraded and <Col N="24" /> that significant sections of the ring roads of Dublin, Cork and Limerick would be completed.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the ring roads in Dublin are fairly complete.  There are fairly extensive road developments on the route coming into Dublin.  The people of Dublin are fairly wise.  We do not have anything of that nature on our side of the Shannon.  There is a small by-pass at Bunratty in County Clare, that is what we have in the way of development of national primary roads.  I was grateful to the Minister for the Environment when he decided to put in the double bridge down there, and the plans were carried out well.  However, whenever there is a financial crisis in the Department of the Environment the projects to be cut back or put to one side are ones planned for the remote west or the mid-west.  The Clare County Council will proceed with the by-pass plan when the money is available.</P>
    <P>The people of Chapelizod were not going to put up with their problems for too long.  I recall the time that the former Taoiseach was berated about the Chapelizod bypass during the Dublin West by-election. It was not the width of the road that the people from that area were concerned about, it was the effects of noise and all of the other ancillary problems that arise from the development of a motorway.  Did the people of Chapelizod get their way?  They certainly did.  And has the road been developed?  It most certainly has.  Down in County Clare we still have not opened the by-pass at Bunratty.</P>
    <P>During the same period of time mountains have been moved between Ballyfermot and Lucan and all of that area. There is another ring road serving the western end of the city.  The Euro-route referred to by Deputy Pattison has developed from Belfast down towards Rosslare.  I am not sure how far the development has moved because I do not travel through the Wicklow mountains too often but I presume that satisfactory progress is being achieved.  Perhaps the people of Dublin have large resources of <Col N="25" /> expertise to implement their development plans.  If we had engineers bringing up documents then I am sure the Minister would consider the Shannon development when the new operational programme is submitted to the Commission in the quest for additional Structural Funds and I know that proper acknowledgment of the needs of the people would be given in what was finally implemented.</P>
    <P>Industrialists face difficulties as well. We in the west and the south really have no access to ports to enable quick delivery of manufactured goods to the Continent. There are always long queues and many complaints from those involved, especially from transport companies, about the long delays and the severe difficulties encountered in having goods transported.  All of that is taking place at the time of the Single European Act.  The Department of the Environment, successive Ministers and everyone else are well aware of what is happening in the Community.  We all realise that the Germans and the Dutch have improved their roads to such a high standard that they will be able to compete with the British when the underground tunnel is completed. The only efforts made on this island, with the availability of massive funds, have concentrated on developments around the city of Dublin, which is already overcrowded.  The Government keep on massaging this city.  It seems to me that all of the money is spent in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Many developments have taken place on the Continent.  Euro trains, for example, have come into operation.  One is now able to catch a fast train that will take one from the North Sea down to Rome in a faster time than that spent on an overflight.  If one is on an overflight and wants to get off at Shannon but the Aer Lingus pilot decides that he wants an early breakfast in Dublin and will overfly Shannon, then it takes about nine and a half hours to get one's case and then go home.  One faces traffic jams and bottlenecks on the road between Dublin and Shannon.  One could travel from Berlin to Rome in the time that is spent on the <Col N="26" /> famous overflight.  I wonder whether the National Roads Authority will tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is making appointments to the National Roads Authority he should ensure that the personnel have a bias towards the west.  I do not mind from which political party those appointees come &mdash; I know that they will not be from my party, anyway.  The Minister should ensure that he appoints people from the west who will see to it that the chief executive and those members establishing policy at least give people the opportunity to catch a breath of fresh air soon after leaving Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Road Development Plan for the 1980s of Sylvester Barrett at item 10.2 states:</P>
    <P>While the pattern of traffic growth and demand for movement and the removal of known deficiencies in the road system can be taken as generally satisfactory bases for the preparation of a ten-year plan such as this, unforeseen factors may require changes to be made at national, regional or local level. </P>
    <P>There are unforeseen factors working against us.  There are the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, there are the Aer Lingus pilots, and we have the Dublin lobby, all of whom want everything for Dublin and do not concern themselves much about national roads or whether we in the west have difficulties.  If that is so, how can the west site major industrial undertaking?  If there were a discovery of natural resources, how would there be access to the west?  We have to make sure that there is major development in the west.  The Minister should set a task for his officials so as to make sure that when the Minister goes to the electorate in the mid-west before the next General Election he will be able to tell them that a national motorway is being undertaken by the Department and the National Roads Authority to provide access from Shannon to Dublin, that people will be able to go from Shannon to Dublin in a little over one hour, that our industries will have full opportunity to develop, that <Col N="27" /> the people of the west will be equal to the people of Dublin and that everyone will be treated properly with good facilities. I know that is a major task but I know also that the Minister has the determination to see it achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I have no doubt that he will do as good a job here as he did in other Ministries if he gets the financial support from the Government. I look forward to working with the Minister over the next while.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will have immense implications for the development of our road network and this in turn will have major consequences for our economic future.  As a peripheral EC country we need a good roads system in order to have cheap, efficient transportation so that we can compete in business and in exports and survive in the Single Europe which will come onstream at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>It is stated Fine Gael policy to develop a national road and rail authority.  We have experienced difficulty with various branches of transport working in competition rather than in tandem.  We need a cohesive transport system.  Rail and road networks should not be in competition. Deputy McGrath yesterday said that more should have been spent on the rail network.  The Sligo/Dublin rail line has been underfunded.  We should not allow the rail line to deteriorate.  We should fund the rail network so that it can complement the road network.  That is a viable proposition the Minister should take up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to develop tourism we need a good roads network.  We also need good signposting.  Unfortunately, signposting here leaves a lot to be desired, although things have improved in the last year or so.  I hope the National Roads Authority will take that job on board.  There is nothing worse than being confronted in unfamiliar country with inadequate road signs.  During a Seanad campaign some years ago I intended to travel from Castletownbere to Killarney, but because <Col N="28" /> of inadequate signposting I ended up back in Cork.  Fortunately, it did not affect the Seanad results.  Another problem is the fact that the older signposts can be easily turned around to point in the wrong direction and some people think it is great fun to turn them round. Local authorities should prosecute people caught doing that.</P>
    <P>Numerous requests have been made to the Department of the Environment to upgrade the R202 which is a direct link between Northern Ireland and the midlands. It runs from Enniskillen to County Cavan and up through Leitrim, Ballinamore and Mohill to Longford and into the midlands.  Will the Department of the Environment still have a say in upgrading these roads or will that be done by the National Roads Authority?  There have also been requests to upgrade the road which goes from Carrick-on-Shannon right down to north Leitrim through Manorhamilton and as far as the Fermanagh border.  These requests have been on the table for the last number of years but we have not been successful. The volume of traffic, particularly business traffic, on both of those roads has increased substantially over the last number of years.  That should be taken into consideration.  I hope these roads will be upgraded sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have carried out a lot of the design work on national primary routes and nine times out of ten they have done an excellent job.  Will the design work stay with the local authorities or will it be taken over by the National Roads Authority?  There is concern, certainly in the counties I represent, that design teams will be moved out.  I spoke to some concerned members of the staff of local authorities who, I suppose, are trying to look after their own interests. In County Leitrim, where there is a small population, a number of people have worked in the county doing excellent work on the design of national primary routes.  It would be unfortunate if we were to lose these people to the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>The planning authority within each county has the power to allow or disallow <Col N="29" /> planning permission for developments along national primary routes.  Following the establishment of the National Roads Authority, if somebody wants to build a house and the county council refuse permission, will an appeal against that decision be made to Bord Pleanála or to the National Roads Authority?  Will the National Roads Authority have any say in the matter of planning appeals?</P>
    <P>All county councils have drawn up their estimates and are still awaiting allocations from the Department of the Environment for roadworks.  This matter must be given serious consideration.  It is farcical that local authorities complete their estimates in November and may have to wait until the middle of March for their road grants.  That was the experience last year of Leitrim County Council. The delay in payment prevents necessary works from being carried out.  The local authorities cannot plan any works in the months of January, February or March because they will not have received their allocations.  The Minister might try to make those payments at the beginning of each year.</P>
    <P>I refer to section 12 and the abandonment of public roads.  This will be a task taken on by the National Roads Authority and I hope the process will be speeded up.  Because of the shortfall in cash for county roads, local improvement schemes are being brought in and people are asking that roads which have been declared public should be abandoned so that they will be able to reapply.  It is the only chance that these roads will be surfaced in 20 years.  Perhaps that section would be taken on board and the whole process speeded up dramatically.  For many people in rural areas it is the only chance to get a decent road to their house and it is the only service of which they avail.  The speeding up of the process would be advantageous for rural development.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the National Roads Authority is a good idea, but only if it is provided with adequate finance.  I hope the Government will indicate their willingness to make sufficient funds available for the construction of national primary <Col N="30" /> routes.  This work has far reaching consequences for the economy.  If the transport system and road network were improved, thereby enabling export business to convey their goods quickly and efficiently to the ports, it would be of great advantage to the country generally. Road transport costs have increased under the budget and it is essential that special incentives be given to the National Roads Authority to carry out work on national primary routes.  The Minister might consider a single authority to deal with road and rail transport in a co-ordinated rather than competitive way.  This could dramatically increase business and thereby generate employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on his appointment. I hope he will have a more enlightened approach to the need for an integrated transport policy.  The proposal before us is too narrow and should be widened to deal with many problems in the transport area.  A national road and public transport authority should be formed.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Garland who this morning gave the impression that he wished to stifle discussion by public representatives on this issue.  He got in on two occasions and made a valuable contribution. Given the problems with regard to roads and public transport, I regret that he tried to deprive other public representatives from all parties of an opportunity to put forward their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will have overall responsibility for planning and supervising the construction, improvement and maintenance of the network of national roads, including access roads to the airports.  This represents about 6 per cent of all roads.  What about the other 94 per cent of roads throughout the country which are in such a deplorable condition?  The secondary and county roads are falling into disrepair through lack of finance from this Government and previous Governments.  As a consequence of this neglect we have seen <Col N="31" /> single issue groups being formed and, in the case of County Cavan, councillors elected to do something about the lack of finance for roads.</P>
    <P>I hope that the 94 per cent of roads not referred to in this Bill will not be put on the back burner.  In my constituency in recent years residents took to the streets, for the first time in my experience, because of the condition of the roads. The new Minister will have to tackle this problem.  The Government must also acknowledge this problem and endeavour to make our roads generally safe.</P>
    <P>We are told that the National Roads Authority will be an independent body, with which the provisions of section 28 deal.  But one might well pose the question: in practice how independent will they be?  We note that between ten and 14 members of the Authority will be nominated by the Minister.  Although there may be an opportunity for various interest groups to advance nominations, at the end of the day, their membership will be appointed by the Minister.  It is my firm belief that vested interests in our roads sector will comprise the majority of their membership, which would not be in the overall interest of proper planning or indeed a proper transport policy.  The implementation of the provisions of this Bill will lead to a certain lack of democracy and accountability.  I hope I will be proved wrong in that prediction but, at the end of the day, it is my firm belief that the roads lobby will have a majority representation on the Authority.</P>
    <P>The policy adopted to date, of pumping ever increasing amounts of EC Structural Funds &mdash; and hopefully in the future, Cohesion Funds &mdash; into our roads has been at the expense of a proper public transport system and is a disaster.  When one examines the funding of our transport system it is not unreasonable to expect or demand a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that there is not a common policy of funding and investment in transport infrastructures.  To take the example of investment in railway <Col N="32" /> infrastructure, maintenance and other costs there are borne directly by Irish Rail.  That investment is treated in a commercial fashion while investment in our roads infrastructure is grant-assisted by the State 100 per cent, with maintenance costs being provided by the State also, without there being any accountability in respect of individual schemes.</P>
    <P>The proposed rapid rail transport system is enormously attractive.  Indeed it should be noted that the EC recently advocated that the State should assume responsibility for railway infrastructures. That is not an unreasonable proposal when one bears in mind the number of passengers and volume of freight at present transported by our rail sector and in particular the lack of adequate infrastructures occasioning major problems. The implementation of that proposal would go some way to improving the overall position.  I hope that aspect can be dealt with in the overall review of general transport policy.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the Dublin transport scene where traffic congestion has reached crisis proportions not alone in the city centre but into the suburbs. Over many decades the Government appear to have been preoccupied almost exclusively with making provision for private cars and trucks, which, combined with a failure to develop public transport alternatives, has led to serious economic, social and environmental consequences in the general Dublin area. This is very evident, particularly with the prevailing unemployment figures in the greater Dublin area.  It is my party's belief that all of these problems are interlinked because, if there is not proper access, with a proper transport system, investment will not be attracted into suburban areas.  The Labour Party believe there is urgent need to develop our public transport infrastructure, with urgent action being taken to rectify the capital's many transport problems.</P>
    <P>We strongly support also investment in and the urgent development of a light rail transport system for Dublin with its obvious advantages, in that it would be user/environmentally friendly, the proposed vehicles being quieter and more <Col N="33" /> comfortable.  Indeed it has been demonstrated in the past that, where alternative transport systems have been provided, people have tended to leave their cars at home and use such public transport facilities.  This has been graphically demonstrated in the use of the DART.  It is generally acknowledged that cars, vans and buses are much noisier.</P>
    <P>This takes one to the question of how that position can be improved.  In our view, and that of Labour Party councillors, the proposals for the Eastern by-pass motorway should be deleted from the agenda in that they would be environmentally disastrous for the areas through which that proposed motorway would be routed.  I blame the planners/engineers of Dublin Corporation who have devoted their attention solely to that solution while other options should be urgently considered, particularly the need to improve access to Dublin port, so vital to the economic development of the area. This is all the more important, particularly when one observes hauliers being attracted to ports in Northern Ireland, such as Larne, leading to even greater unemployment in the Dublin port area.</P>
    <P>There is need also to drastically improve overall industrial relations in the Dublin port area.  I hope employers and trade unions seriously examine this aspect, which examination is long overdue. I hope that sanity will prevail, leading to a better climate there in industrial relations along with a commitment on the part of the relevant authorities to improve the position generally thereby generating new life in the inner city of long term benefit to its citizens.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the imbalance between investment in our roads as compared with our rail system we must acknowledge that the development of our roads forms a vital part of our overall integrated transport system.  I hope that imbalance can be redressed in future applications for EC Structural Funds. The completion of the Western Parkway, progressing to the northern and southern cross routes, will provide Dublin with an effective ring road, something I have and will continue to support.  If this is linked <Col N="34" /> into an efficient public transport system it should begin to resolve our problems.</P>
    <P>The side note to section 48 reads: &ldquo;Environmental impact statement&rdquo;.  The section ensures that environmental impact statements will be prepared.  Who are the independent group who will carry out the environmental impact assessment? Will it be the Authority themselves or will the task be designated to the local authority?  I am aware that the Minister's predecessors were well versed in this major problem &mdash; Ballymun Road to the Northern Cross motorway, with particular reference to the Ballymun interchange.  My understanding is that the local residents and the local public representatives were not consulted about the linkage to Ballymun Road and its implications for the area.  The effect of the proposed interchange at Ballymun Road will be to substantially increase traffic using this road which already constitutes a major hazard in a highly populated area.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are well aware of that area.  The residents have said that the proposed roundabout at Santry Avenue-Ballymun Road will take over a significant area of open space adjacent to the towers in Ballymun.  There is a major problem affecting some 80,000 people who are voting and residing in the corporation area, but responsibility was given to Dublin County Council to advertise and carry out the environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me and other public representatives by Glasnevin North Community Association, An Taisce and Ballymun Environmental Task Force.  Representations have also been made by all the schools in the area, where there are 8,000 school-going children, the boys' comprehensive in Ballymun, the senior comprehensive in Ballymun, St. Aidan's and so on, as well as the various school principals and boards of management, who are deeply concerned at the effects of this proposal to provide this interchange at Ballymun. Every effort is being made by all public representatives.  It is not as if it is a single group or a single politician or a political <Col N="35" /> party who is making the case.  I would like to put on the record this brief statement:</P>
    <P>We the undersigned public representatives are gravely concerned about Dublin County Council's plans to link Ballymun Road to the Northern Cross Motorway.  This link would lead to seriously increased levels of traffic and would have a devastating effect on the communities of Ballymun...and also of Santry and Glasnevin.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council conducted an Environmental Impact Study on this scheme but failed to consider the impact of this Motorway on residents in the area.  Local people were not consulted and local councillors were unaware of the proposal.</P>
    <P>We support the many residents' groups, school principals and environmentalists in their opposition to this proposal.  We call on the Minister for the Environment and Dublin County Council to act on the expressed wishes of Dublin City Council by deleting this link road and to come forward with more acceptable proposals... </P>
    <P>The above statement was signed by Councillor Roisín Shortall, Labour; Councillor Eamonn O'Brien, The Workers' Party; Councillor Brendan Brady, Fine Gael; Deputy Mary Flaherty, Fine Gael; Alderman Noel Ahern, Fianna Fáil; Deputy Michael Barrett, Fianna Fáil; Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, The Workers' Party; Barry Desmond, MEP and Mary Banotti, MEP.</P>
    <P>That outlines the extent of the problem in that area.  Given the concern expressed, while I support the concept of a ring road, which is an urgent requirement for north County Dublin, I would ask the Minister to re-examine the situation to see whether there is a mechanism that could improve the situation and by which these people would have a say in their future and where they will live.  I am not suggesting in this proposal that we would delay the provision of the interlink road and the interchange.</P>
    <P>The problem of heavy vehicle parking, referred to in the Bill, is an ongoing one <Col N="36" /> and needs to be addressed seriously.  I hope the Authority will give it the priority it needs.  All of us, as public representatives, will be aware of the concerns of parents and the dangers caused by the parking of trucks and heavy vehicles in our villages and towns and within housing estates.  It is evident from discussions held with interested groups that two types of heavy vehicles parks are required urgently.  The first type would be used by long distance or overseas hauliers. In conjunction with this, facilities such as rest rooms, cafeterias, washing facilities, etc. would be desirable.  The most suitable and desirable location for this type of facility would be on the main routes to and from our major cities. The cost of providing such facilities is very high and, accordingly, there is no obvious desire from hauliers, notwithstanding their perceived need, to invest the necessary finance.  Would it be possible to incorporate such a scheme into our national roads programme? These facilities could, in turn, be leased to hauliers and thus improve the position and hopefully also the financial position of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The second type of facility would be used by local hauliers who at present park near their homes overnight and in many cases within housing estates.  This creates a major problem for residents.  These large vehicles are very attractive for young children and regrettably a number of accidents have taken place adjacent to them.  The demand is to have them removed from the estates and towns.  This matter could be addressed by providing secure facilities in industrial estates in the ownership of the various county councils throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda that they are considering making regulations barring the parking of heavy vehicles within housing estates.  However, apart from the willingness of the Garda to recommend such action, it would require the consent of the Minister for the Environment and I would like to hear his views on this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to address also the position of petrol stations on our motorways and <Col N="37" /> what will be the attitude of the Authority to them.  Given the length of the roads concerned and the size of the population, I do not believe there is a need to provide these facilities on our motorways.</P>
    <P>The Balbriggan bypass, which will run from the five roads to Gormanstown, County Meath, will be about 11.5 kilometres in length and is long overdue. While I acknowledge it has been included in the Government's operational programme on peripherality, 1989-93, given the proposed timescale, the problem is that it will not be completed before 1996 at the earliest.  I understand that it will cost approximately £30 million.  The delay in the provision of this by-pass has had a detrimental effect on the town of Balbriggan and its hinterland.  This town was once the industrial capital of north County Dublin, Fingal, but it has now the highest rate of unemployment in 1991. area.  Indeed, there was a 16 per cent increase in unemployment in 1992.</P>
    <P>Each of the public representatives for the area has made its case with the Industrial Development Authority but they have informed us that traffic snarls and the lack of an adequate road infrastructure has in the past and is working against the town as an attractive industrial base.  The people of the town, on whose behalf I am speaking this afternoon, both employed and unemployed, demand to know the reason this by-pass has not been given the priority it deserves.  Dublin County Council have allocated a small amount of money for this development this year and their officials are working on it but I suggest that a letter or telephone call from the Minister's office would put further pressure on the officials concerned to process it much more quickly.  While they were only given the go-ahead in recent times, if the Minister indicated that he would like to see the completion date brought forward the position might improve.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, this by-pass will cost £30 million.  When completed, it will provide a great boost for the town. However, if the town is to develop to its full potential &mdash; I hope the new National <Col N="38" /> Roads Authority will deal with this problem &mdash; we need to provide an inner by-pass. This should go hand in hand with the construction of the main by-pass.  The cost of such an inner by-pass would be £1.2 million.  My view, that this should go hand in hand with the construction of the main by-pass, is shared by the local chamber of commerce.  The Minister should take this opportunity to sanction the additional funding to meet the needs of the town and thus enable both proposals to proceed at the same time.</P>
    <P>We may not have this opportunity again.  At the end of the day the funding required for this by-pass would have to come from the Minister's Department, given the inadequate allocation provided for roads to Dublin County Council.  It is imperative that it be constructed to offer a lifeline to that town.  By constructing the two at the one time the State would ultimately make a saving.  I ask the Minister to consider this request favourably. I have no doubt that the public representatives of his own party have also made this case.  I hope therefore he will consider this request more favourably than his predecessors.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to public lighting on our national roads.  The lack of adequate lighting is the source of grave concern for many communities throughout the length and breadth of the country, in particular for those communities in towns and villages which have been cut in half by new roads and motorways.  I have attended a number of funerals in my constituency of people killed in accidents on the N1. Indeed, there have been six night time fatalities during the past year on the stretch of road between Blake's Cross and the Meath border.  While I acknowledge that speed is a factor in many accidents it has been acknowledged by the Garda and other groups that the lack of public lighting is another factor.  I appeal to the Minister, in setting up the new National Roads Authority, to provide for the inclusion of public lighting, where required, in the overall cost of motorway schemes at the time of construction.  This is imperative.  We should learn from the <Col N="39" /> mistakes made in the past.  In the long term, the Exchequer will make a saving.</P>
    <P>In relation to motorways, I ask the Minister and his officials to note the need to provide proper boundaries on our motorways.  I am talking here in particular about the necessity to provide proper walls at the point where estates come in contact with motorways.  These are not always provided.  As a result, local public representatives have to take up the case with the local council and the Department.  Ultimately, the walls will have to be constructed.  I ask the Minister to ensure that these are provided in all cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to over-bridges, when officials are considering plans they should seriously ask themselves if there is a demand for such a bridge at a particular location so that residents do not have to take to the streets or make a strong case to their public representative and the Department for an over-bridge.  In many cases these new roads cut estates in half. There is need there to provide over-bridges and they should be provided from the outset.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention once again the need for a proper public transport system, something which is not properly addressed in the Bill.  People want and will use public transport; they want to travel in comfort, safety and quickly by train.  Above all else, they want a reliable service.  If we can provide this pressure will be taken off the roads.  As I said, we need look no further than the DART which is now carrying twice the number of passengers it carried when it first went into operation.</P>
    <P>The railways have an enormous social and environmental benefit by way of reduced usage of roads.  They cause less pollution and make less noise.  In view of their social importance to urban and rural communities would the Minister state the reason the railways received only £30 million as compared with an allocation of £600 million for road infrastructure from the current EC Structural Fund?  The case has been made time and again that there is a need for investment in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Our national roads network mirrors our railway system.  Yet, as I say, EC Structural Funds for our roads vastly outweigh those which have been made available for our railways.  The fact that one-quarter of all passengers travel by rail and that one-fifth of freight tonnage is carried by rail should merit a balanced share of EC Structural Funds.  The imbalance can be seen in £30 million against £600 million.  Major decisions are required in this area and I ask the Government to follow the line taken by other European countries in giving equality to public transport and roads.</P>
    <P>Having listened attentively to contributions by members of all political parties I hope the Minister realises the deep concern of the people for an improvement in our roads and public transport. On the basis of the contributions, I hope some ideas will come forward which will ensure that the people whom we represent can look forward to a system which will bring improvements.  I hope that, in the long term, we will have an integrated transport system which will incorporate roads and rail, one Authority to deal with them and no duplication.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new Minister for the Environment, Deputy Smith. It has been quite a while since he and I played on the same team; one of the first attempts to foster good relations between ourselves and parliamentarians on the other side of the water involved playing a tennis match against the British team. I remember the late Robert Bradford saying to me about Deputy Smith, &ldquo;Blimey, he's a big lad, isn't he?&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure the Minister woke up this morning saying: &ldquo;My God, have I to go through all this today: county roads, potholes, ditches, drains, walls, cars, traffic lights, signposts and all the rest of it?&rdquo;.  I wish to refer to a few important matters.  There seems to be a perception that County Mayo, which I represent, was given untold millions by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, from my constituency.  I do not make any apologies for the allocations made by Deputy Flynn in regard to road <Col N="41" /> improvements in the county and, indeed, if he responded to my consistent and constructive claims in this matter, I thank him for it.  I should like to point out that the major works leading into County Mayo at present in terms of a new, national N5 route are part of a programme which was originally designed quite a number of years ago and approved by his predecessor, Deputy Kavanagh, when he turned down the existing primary route because of the number of new accesses being created in relation to it, particularly through the use of section 4 notices of motion for the creation of extra access.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister, Deputy Smith, the best of luck in what obviously is a complex issue and one in which I fear he will not find great joy in 1992 because, when the warning bells rang last week, the files were brought in to the former Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, who obviously signed whatever he could.  I am sure he was not slow in taking to Cavan-Monaghan, or anywhere else in that region, as many funds as he could from this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Smith, shares the opinions of his colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who said that all proposals of the previous Government had fallen with that Government.  However, the Minister, Deputy Smith, may take a different view in this regard and perhaps he will continue with plans his predecessor had in place.</P>
    <P>Many speakers on all sides of the House referred to the imbalance between the national primary motorway system and the funding of rail authorities.  It is a question which should be examined because, from any common sense point of view, it is easier to move more people per hour by rail than by any other system. As a frequent user of the rail system from the west it is obvious that when Iarnród Éireann offer their special fares for one or three day excursions the number of people who use the service in preference to buses or coaches is phenomenal.  The <Col N="42" /> Minister should certainly look at the concept of a road and rail authority, funded by the Authority, so that the company involved would at least be in a position to deal with the proper provision and maintenance of a rail system and provide sufficient coaches, or rolling stock as they are now called.  Obviously, this will not happen as a result of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably reply by referring to the independence of the National Roads Authority.  If they are to be as independent as the Bill states, what will be the future role of local authorities, because it appears to be in direct contradition of what the junior partners in Government feel should be in operation? The progressive Democrats apparently want district councils to be put into operation, in other words, a further dissemination of local authority rule and at the same time they are in partnership with the Government in implementing a National Roads Authority which takes from those same local authorities the powers to deal with a national roads network. Is this an indication that existing local authorities do not have the ability &mdash; or are unable &mdash; to deal with the national roads system as it stands?  Is the Bill saying that every county council and local authority who have, to date, dealt with the design and proposals for national primary routes and secondary systems are inadequate, or that the staff working in local authorities do not have a sufficient level of competency to deal with the standard required here?  If this Authority is to be withdrawn from the county council and given back to them only in certain circumstances by the national Authority, is that not an indication of a lack of confidence and faith in the ability of the existing staff of county councils to deal with the problems facing them?</P>
    <P>Deputies on all sides, particularly those from rural areas, referred to the county road system.  When the Minister looks at the figures for the various county councils throughout the country he will be well aware of the serious problem in regard to the discretionary grants system because local authorities have to labour under the yoke of being told that the <Col N="43" /> discretionary grants system will cater for the county roads system.  It is not happening because the discretionary grants, under the hand of the Minister, were to be topped up by the supplementary funds from the rates collected in each county. The Minister will have at his disposal the figures which indicate that countries with a weaker economic base are not in a position to provide from the rates the necessary funding which, together with the discretionary grant which the Minister gives them would enable them to provide a proper county roads system.</P>
    <P>We are storing up trouble for ourselves in this area because many county councils now have a 25-year return cycle before they can black top a county road for a second time.  This means that many existing county roads have deteriorated to the extent that they are returning to ash and sand roads.  This has been caused by the lack of funding through the discretionary grant from the Minister and the non-availability of rates money in counties with a poor economic base.  The Minister will have to face up to this problem. All the Minister's predecessors have tried to rectify the problem but have failed.  The Minister now has a tremendous opportunity to make a name for himself well into the next century. However, I do not know how he will deal with the problem, as 96 per cent of passengers and 90 per cent of freight use the national primary system, which accounts for only 3 per cent of the national roads network but which has 62 per cent of the funding spent on it. Obviously this is a problem which has to be met head on.  Local authorities and county councils will have to examine the powers given to them by the Minister and their ability to raise money to provide the services in their counties.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that the inadequacy of the general county roads system in many counties has been highlighted by the continuing decline in the quality of rural life, as outlined at several conferences hosted by the bishops of the west recently.  One of the threads running through all of those conferences was the <Col N="44" /> continuing decline and inadequacy of the county roads system.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, I served on the British-Irish Inteparliamentary Body together with the chairman, Deputy Stafford and other Members. One of the most interesting reports produced by parliamentarians from Britain, Ireland and the Six Counties relates to transport and freight costs.  It is perfectly obvious that if the will is there nationally, and the Government of the day so decide, a certain proportion of Euro funding can be made available for purposes other than motorways or national primary routes at the discretion of the Government. Without attempting to raise expectations in any way in this regard, this is an issue the Minister might look at. Elected MPs to the House of Commons have consistently stressed that their Commissioner Millan and others have repeated that apparently there is a method within the existing European regulations whereby, if the Government of the day so decide, moneys can be filtered down to supplement the efforts being made to maintain the county roads system.  Obviously this is a matter for ministerial perusal and Government decision, and I trust the Minister will look at it.</P>
    <P>I remember hearing the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the former Deputy O'Donoghue, in his contribution on employment creation say that if it was necessary to dig holes in the roads to create employment the Government would see to it that that was done.  This has happened without, I might add, any assistance from the Minister. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Smith, who represents a rural constituency which probably has a better soil base than my county, is only too well aware of the community and voluntary efforts now being made by villagers to keep the roads intact.  A consistent and strong thread at community council and political meetings attended by representatives from all sides of the House has been the question of our roads &mdash; all Deputies and councillors are asked what they are doing about the roads.  It is fair <Col N="45" /> to say that communities have now banded together and are paying money on an increasing scale to have hedges cut, bushes trimmed back and water tables opened on county roads because of a lack of funding for local authorities. Obviously the Minister will have to look at these matters.  There is also the question of public liability for accidents which might occur from this kind of work.  Communities which spend their money on hiring private contractors, who may also be on county council tendering lists, to carry out this work should be commended and assisted in whatever way possible in respect of the very good work they do.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a purely technical point. Bush cutting appears to be a very confusing legal concept at a local authority level.  This issue needs to be cleared up and a clear statement made as to who is responsible for cutting back trees, bushes, shrubs and grasses which grow on roadsides.  Children who walk or cycle to school on narrow country roads which have a heavy growth are forced to walk or cycle further out on the road than they normally would.  This can lead to the danger that somebody speeding on a narrow road will cause an accident with very serious consequences. As I understand it, local authorities will state that under the law farmers are responsible for the cutting back of hedges. However, there appears to be a grey area in regard to the height of such growth and whether it is inside or outside the fence. After looking at this matter the Minister might issue clear directions to local authorities so that people will know whose responsibility it is to cut back hedges, etc.</P>
    <P>A subcommittee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body met with Minister Needham in London on Tuesday to discuss tourism development, access routes etc.  He concurred with the findings in the report of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in regard to transport: that Ireland should be treated as a single entity for the purposes of major Euro funding.  I suppose that applies to the Euro route, etc.  Deputies from Border constituencies have spoken <Col N="46" /> about Border crossings and roads and the need for proper access.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some sections of the Bill.  The Lucan bypass can save motorists 15 or 20 minutes on a journey, depending on the time they leave Dublin.  However, logic then dictates that, if you move more traffic over a longer section of road at a faster speed than normal, that traffic tends to pile up to an even greater extent at the far end.  People who drive from Dublin to areas in the west in the evening will encounter a back-up of traffic in Leixlip for almost two miles.  While traffic is able to move faster on the bypass it tends to pile up to an even greater extent at the far end.  That is a mathematical problem as much as an engineering one.  I know that the Leixlip bypass is about to be approved so this problem will probably be sorted out in time.</P>
    <P>Section 19 refers to the powers of the Authority.  I would like to know what is intended with regard to the design staff of existing local authorities.  In many county councils there are 50 or 60 engineers employed at present in various areas of responsibility.  The road design teams appear to do a very good job.  Will these people be seconded to the National Roads Authority or will the chief executive and his staff designate the work to them?  Will the design team of the National Roads Authority carry out work in Tipperary, Mayo or Galway with no regard for local knowledge or information? While it is extremely difficult to have major roadworks carried out in any part of the country at present at least local authorities have at their disposal the experience and understanding of local history and information, and that is very important.  While people have the right to object, and certainly use it very frequently, many difficulties can be avoided by having access to information before a project commences.</P>
    <P>Section 43 refers to protected roads. This is a new and interesting concept which will apply to new or existing roads. The explanatory memorandum states that the protected road is a new concept which must be distinguished from a motorway.  Does that mean that roads <Col N="47" /> adjoining motorways can be described as national primary roads and that a new national primary road will be a protected road?  For instance, the N5 leading into Castlebar is a newly created road.  The former Minister refused to develop the old N5 to a proper standard and a new road was built, either side of which no development has taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>With no potholes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is guaranteed that there will be no potholes in it.  I would like to know whether this new road will be protected road.  Section 52 provides for service facilities on motorways.  If these facilities are to be provided we should ensure it is done in a proper fashion rather than relying on the use of section 4 provisions under the new Act.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we will deal in further detail with protected roads and their definition, taking into account county development plans, service sites and so on.</P>
      <P>Sections 66 and 68 give power to the National Roads Authority to remove temporary dwellings such as caravans and so on from the roadsides.  One draw-back as far as the thousands of people who visit this country every year are concerned, or indeed the people who travel from one part of Ireland to another, is the sight of caravans and travellers' vans alongside the roads leading to towns and villages. These people have no regard whatever for the normal rules of litter disposal.  It is a disgrace that where new roads are created local authorities have to build isolated islands at cutaway bends, with boulders and so on to prevent the roads being clogged up by travellers who park in an area for a week or ten days and leave it in a disgraceful condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to people availing of lay-bys or parking areas for an overnight stay, but I certainly object to people using these facilities with no regard for the litter laws.  Litter is an eyesore in many parts of the country.  I am sure that under the existing litter Acts local authorities are enabled to take action in <Col N="48" /> these cases.  When building new roads we should consider creating up-to-date lay-bys for caravans and people who wish to stop for a snack.  These lay-bys should be kept in good condition, unlike at present whereby many of them are strewn with litter.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether each local authority should be required to take a stand against travellers.  In many areas they put up signs prohibiting temporary dwellings and overnight parking but travellers ignore these signs, claiming illiteracy. They move from one point on the road to another and the local authorities and Garda seem powerless to remove them. Even though the Department provide 100 per cent funding for this purpose, it is obviously a matter of great sensitivity for many county councils.  I would like the Minister to consider the matter of temporary dwellings because it takes away from the attractiveness of the countryside.</P>
    <P>Section 67 deals with the removal of trees and dangerous buildings.  This is a very important provision.  Obviously, many farmers are not in a position to avail of the services of tree surgeons and may not be aware that older trees may fall in the event of storms.  Every year a number of deaths are caused by falling trees.  Under existing law if the local authority believe that damage may be caused by falling trees they are empowered to instruct the landowner to have the trees removed.  If the landowner is not in a position or fails to do so the local authority may remove them.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another minor point but one of some significance. People such as public representatives in particular have to do quite an amount of night driving.  There seems to have been an increase in the erection of spot lights, principally on buildings throughout the country.  A condition should be laid down that bright lights be angled in such a way as not to interfere with the vision of drivers.  Most of these lights which are used to light up buildings and stores are very bright, and they can be quite off-putting and dangerous for drivers.  In many cases all that is required is that <Col N="49" /> the angle of the light be altered slightly, making it safer as far as the driver is concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 13 concerns the responsibility for roads between the 27 county councils and the urban district councils. I am not at all clear about what is intended.  On the one hand, the Minister has responsibility to implement the draft, nonsensical concept of district councils &mdash; which appear to be jumping up from the minor party in Government, with no money, no teeth, no financial clout and no authority at all &mdash; and on the other hand he is taking the responsibility for roads from the county councils and giving it to the National Roads Authority.  At the same time, urban councils are to have responsibility for local roads.  The whole issue comes down to one of funding, the thread of money runs through it all.  It is obvious that in 1992 the Minister will not be able to lash out money in order to cater for that problem.  Perhaps the concept of urban district councils should be dropped and the new Minister should take a different course.  I believe that the principal development authority is the county council, and if that structure has the necessary political clout nationally then it is quite capable of dealing with county development on a proper scale.</P>
    <P>Having had the opportunity to travel in some other continental countries to a limited extent, I believe that Ireland should seriously consider road expansion in terms of tourist development.  I should not like our countryside to be destroyed, but it is evident that continental countries that have used Euro-funding to construct new roadways on coastal fringes have given access to a new kind of scenic tourism to thousands of tourists.</P>
    <P>Dr. Séamus Caulfield, the archaeologist who has done trojan work on the Céide Fields Project in north Mayo, and a former winner of the Mayoman of the Year award, recently said that the development of a mile or a mile-and-a-half of new road north from Belderrig along the coast would create one of the finest routes of cliff scenery in all Europe and would have the potential impact of <Col N="50" /> attracting thousands of extra tourists to that part of the country.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority should be able to consider expenditure on the creation of new routes, roads that obviously would not be of national primary standard, that would open up areas of the coastline in particular.  I am not suggesting that a road should run around the edge of our coastline &mdash; that would destroy many of the attractions that we should be promoting &mdash; but in certain locations the creation of new short routes would open up access.</P>
    <P>Having made those few points, I should like to say to the Minister, Deputy Smith, that there are few pleasures in life that equal travelling on a good road on a summer's morning with the wind in one's face.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours in the Department of the Environment, which is a huge and complex Ministry that demands a great deal of concentrated work.  Any constructive achievement made by the Minister will certainly have the support of this side of the House.  I wish Deputy Smith every success with his responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Smith, on taking up his new appointment.  I wish him well in his role as Minister for the Environment.  Coming as I do from County Longford, I have a particular interest in the county roads system there.  I do not know whether the Minister has already been informed of the issue, but I know that the former Minister was approached by groups of very frustrated people who have to live with an outrageous county roads system. Many of them have to travel, day in and day out, over potholed roads and families with small children have to negotiate flooded roads in order to avail of the school bus service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Potholes have been at the butt end of many jokes in the news media down through the years.  At this stage they may not be a very popular issue to talk about and when people talk about potholes they are inclined to say, &ldquo;Not again&rdquo;&mdash; an attitude which is all very well for those <Col N="51" /> who do not have to suffer that affliction, and it is an affliction.</P>
    <P>We ask people to pay car tax, and, by the way, that is to increase by 20 per cent. In a fair society when one is asked to pay car tax one would expect fair play.  I am glad to have the opportunity to tell the new Minister for the Environment that the people of the northern part of County Longford in particular are not getting fair play.  That is not to say that any part of the county roads system in County Longford is good, but those in rural areas are particularly disadvantaged.  Longford County Council have not as yet received their budgetary allocation.  I ask the new Minister to seriously consider making an extra allocation to that county.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraig Flynn, announced to the nation that the end of the day of the pothole was in sight.  He must be very long-sighted because the day of the pothole is far from over.  If the new Minister for the Environment wishes to do something that will be remembered by the rural community of Ireland then he could do no better than improve the road system.  He should be particularly interested in that idea as he comes from a rural part of Ireland himself.  For example, the Minister could leave the revenue received from car tax with each local authority.  I know that it can be argued that that revenue has to go into central funds and that a balance has to be struck on the amount that goes back to each county.  However, I propose that for two years the Minister should leave the car tax revenue with each local authority and tell the local authorities to spend the money as they see fit on their county road system.  Such a step would be a good start.</P>
    <P>People talk about the development of tourism.  In the northern part of my county there are several rivers and lakes that have absolutely no access routes.  In the summertime, many English fishermen who come here find it extremely difficult to find a way to get to those lakes.  The social employment scheme has <Col N="52" /> enabled useful work to be done in conjunction with the local authority but they cannot go as far as improving the roads.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity today to tell the Minister that the county roads system in my county is in a very serious position. County councillors are being blamed for the state of the roads at public meetings, meetings which TDs are also asked to attend.  People are at last beginning to realise, though, that the funds to carry out the necessary work simply are not available to local authorities from the Department.  I look forward to the Minister making an extra allocation to Longford County Council.  Some counties are not so affected but counties such as Longford definitely need extra funding.</P>
    <P>While one has to welcome the National Roads Authority and one has to keep an open mind, to a certain extent I am disappointed that an overall approach to transport was not taken.  The railways should have come under this Authority. Mr. David Waters, the head of Iarnród Éireann, at a meeting in Longford recently quite rightly pointed out that they have to fund and maintain the railways and provide a public service.</P>
    <P>When funds were available from Europe it was a great pity that we did not see the railways as a vital part of communications.  A lot of money which has been lost could have been put into the railways.  The railways are an asset which we did not appreciate.  That is why they were run down and why there is now grave concern about the Dublin/Sligo line.  It is estimated that a sum of £20 million could modernise that line to give an efficient service.  A sum of £20 million would not go very far in building some of the bypasses planned.  I know that people welcome the by-passes and the progress they represent, but the railways and the roads should both be seen as a necessary part of our infrastructure and we should spend the money on both systems of transport.  If we had done that over the years we would be in a better position today and there would not be any anxiety about the Dublin/Sligo line. The railways might not overly concern the Minister in this Bill, but in the overall <Col N="53" /> context of transport infrastructure the railways have not been seen as a priority.</P>
    <P>The Longford by-pass is now going ahead and I expect that it will be going for tender this year.  This is a welcome development.  There is no doubt that there have been traffic problems in the town of Longford.  Business people expressed anxiety about by-passes and how they would affect the life of the towns, but experience has shown that they do not really affect business in towns and that as a matter of fact they add to the general accessibility of the town.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to some roads in my county.  The Mullingar-Roscommon road goes through County Longford from Ballymahon to Lanesboro.  This road carries a huge amount of traffic to the west.  Part of the road goes through the Bord na Móna bog so it is accepted that extra funding is needed for the road.  Will the Minister consider upgrading that road to national secondary status?  The Longford-Arva road is a route that should be upgraded also.  In dealing with the county roads I would ask the Minister to give consideration to that proposition.  The roads action committee have requested a meeting with the Minister and I hope the Minister will be able to meet them.  As a member of Longford County Council, I know that councillors there are extremely concerned that we should get extra funding.  I hope the Minister will not let us down.</P>
    <P>In this debate a colleague referred to dangerous trees and to the fact that new legislation would be introduced to deal with that problem.  Trees in certain areas have been the cause of serious accidents and the councils and landowners always seem to be at sixes and sevens as to how they should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that temporary dwellings along our roads have created a lot of hassle and that they are highly dangerous in some cases.  When people move from these temporary dwellings they often leave a lot of refuse behind and the area becomes unsightly.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new job and I look forward to the Minister being <Col N="54" /> regarded as the Minister who seriously tried to deal with our county roads system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Tuigim go bhfuil an tAire bréan den méid atá ráite le cúpla lá agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine eile lag freisin, agus ní bheidh mise ach cúpla nóiméad mar tuigim go maith go bhfuil gach rud ráite cheana.</P>
      <P>I will emphasise a few things, but I will not repeat many of the points I would have made had I been in earlier. I support the concept of advancing our roads structure; that is a <i>sine qua non.</i> I would emphasise that every person counts.  It is a motto about which the Minister will hear more.  Where people are being completely inconvenienced by roads, I wonder at times is the balance right?  A new roadway can cut through virgin territory and farms can be split and then we will have regulations saying that nobody can cross at a certain point and a bridge will not be provided.  I am talking about Glenmore at the end of my constituency where there is a beautiful roadway and where farms have been split. People are supposed to bring cattle down a sideroad and come on to the main roads In this day and age it is criminal to ask farmers to do that because cattle cannot be controlled on a main road like that. They want a bridge.  In their case they deserve the bridge for the sake of safety. They need another one further on where there is a huge slope coming into Glenmore and where young people have to cross the road to get to the hurling pitch. This practice is highly dangerous for young people coming and going there. A pedestrian bridge should be provided here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be strong resistance to pedestrian bridges once one moves out of Dublin.  Travelling towards Dublin Airport one will see bridges across the main road and the same applies on the main road down to Bray; but when one mentions putting a footbridge across a road in the country we get all kinds of arguments about the aesthetic appearance of it and so on.  I am all for aesthetic <Col N="55" /> values, but if people have to cross very busy roads they must be able to do so in safety.  A new motorway must not be an inconvenience to the people living in the area.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the upgrading of the road from Rosslare to the west which goes through Carlow and carries much traffic in the summer.  While there has been improvement of that road, especially on the Carlow side, the road from Carlow to Portlaoise is not as it should be.  I would be very happy if the National Roads Authority would look at that section of road.  I suggest that Carlow is the ideal location for the headquarters of the new Authority.  They would be in an area where the importance of roads would be recognised.  The city does not give a proper perspective to anybody.</P>
    <P>About 80 per cent of our people depend on county roads which have been neglected for many years.  EC funding has enabled works to be carried out on national primary routes, but we must look after the county roads which are used by the majority of people.  Our engineers have built up expertise, as have road workers, in the building of bridges and so on.  I hope the National Roads Authority will not take up all the money, leaving nothing for county roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the power in the Bill to grant permission to councils to shift caravans etc. off the roads.  This has become an increasing problem.  The legal process is almost as slow as a funeral in that it takes 12 months to get anybody moved.  The Authority must be able to act quickly to move people in Hiace vans who set up shop at the roadside.  The normal legal process is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I condemn the concept of district councils. I have been a member of a county council for 11 years and during that time money has become scarcer and scarcer.  It is questionable whether county councils can be justified in view of the cutback in finance.  If district councils are introduced they cannot be given money which councils could use.  They might simply become <Col N="56" /> expensive talking shops.  I hope the Minister's views on this matter differ from those of his predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the National Roads Authority and I hope they will competently discharge the functions designated to them.  As we become part of a more integrated Europe and a Single Market and begin to feel the effects of peripherality, the case for the development of our infrastructure comes into focus. In terms of the degree of infrastructural development currently taking place, we are light years away from achieving anything like the development necessary to compensate for the cold winds of peripherality.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday I was in Ballina at one of a series of meetings convened by the western conference of bishops in regard to the death, decay and very visible decline of the west.  The population graphs show starkly that, except for a very brief period in the mid-seventies following access to the EC, there has been a downward spiral in population statistics.  There were only two minor growth areas, one around Galway city and the other around Sligo.  County Leitrim has a population of 15,000 and is over-represented in the Dáil.  The population of Mayo is only enough to sustain five Deputies.  Were it not that Deputy Flynn happened to be Minister for the Environment when the constituencies were redrawn Mayo would be a five-seat constituency.  Thanks to the inclusion of parts of Galway east and Galway west we have managed to retain two three-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamental to the development of the west is the construction of roads. Recently I asked the Minister's predecessor to give a county-by-county breakdown of grants allocated in 1991 for national primary and national secondary roads.  Let us take the five Connacht counties in comparison with two eastern counties.  Last year Mayo received £4,172,000 for national primary roads; Galway received £3,100,000; Roscommon received £510,000; Leitrim <Col N="57" /> £1,205,000 and Sligo £1,735,000.  More than £10 million was paid to the five western counties.  Dublin received £31,567,000 and Kildare received £15,869,000.  Those two eastern counties got £47 million as against £10 million for five western counties.  The point is well made by the statistics.  The west is not getting the necessary infrastructural development to sustain its population. Unless ease of access is provided we will not attract tourists or industrialists and it will be impossible to keep people here.</P>
    <P>I accept that we must give priority to the capital city and I accept that ease of access to the port of Dublin is vital.  If we are to stop the irreparable damage being done to the west we must secure EC funding.  I would make the point that if, as a result of our membership of the EC, we now suffer the cold winds of the joint pressures of the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT, if our traditional industries are going to the wall, if Europe has not been able to compensate us by way of jobs, then they have a moral, social and political obligation to develop our infrastructure to enable us to put in place our integrated plans, to use our energies and latent resources in an endeavour to develop our potential, realising the internal dynamic within each region.</P>
    <P>If one examines the map of Europe in terms of ascertaining where are their priorities in terms of spending, one sees that there is a Euro-route running from Dublin to Dundalk to the Border, from Dublin to Kildare town, from Dublin to Rosslare, while the remainder of the country does not appear on that map.  I am making a special plea to the new Minister to put a very strong case in Brussels for additional funding for infrastructure for the regions.</P>
    <P>I welcome and congratulate the Minister to his new portfolio.  I know he is a man of considerable skill and ability.  I have no doubt that he will undertake his task in the Department of the Environment with considerable aplomb.</P>
    <P>Again I make a special plea on behalf of the regions for additional resources. As a Mayoman once said: &ldquo;They are <Col N="58" /> going, going, going and no one bid then stop&rdquo;, which is very much the case in the west at present.  We look to the new National Roads Authority but unless that body discharge the functions allotted to them, they will not be able to work effectively. Indeed, unless the National Roads Authority are given the requisite money they will be unable to fulfil their functions. Perhaps the Minister would clarify whether the National Roads Authority have power to take certain decisions about changing the status of roads.  I might give one good example.  There is an office of the Department of the Environment located in Ballina, County Mayo dealing with all the grants administered by the Minister's Department, employing in the region of 400 people, a welcome development in the Government's decentralisation programme.  Yet this office of the Department of the Environment, based in the town of Ballina, is served by one of the worst regional roads nationwide, one that carries the highest statistical volume of traffic in terms of heavy and ordinary domestic traffic.  Yet we have repeatedly made unavailing attempts and pleas to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, to have that road upgraded.  I accept that it is extremely difficult to expect a Minister from Tipperary North to see the merits of the argument when a Minister from our county could not see them.  Unfortunately, there has obtained within the county of Mayo a terrible parochialism between the two county towns of Castlebar and Ballina.  It would appear that the former Minister was unable to break his way out of that cast to enable that road to be upgraded to at least national secondary status.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there are two very noble precedents within the county of Mayo for changing roads' status.  The two last roads nationwide to be upgraded were the N83 and N84; they had been omitted from the original maps in 1989.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to take a fresh look at this.  If it is not possible for him to do so, perhaps he would clarify whether the National Roads Authority <Col N="59" /> will be in a position to accept representations from local authorities in relation to the upgrading of various roads from regional to either national secondary or national primary status.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill, the Minister and the Authority well, particularly the Minister, in the discharging of his functions.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Members from all sides of the House who contributed to this debate and indeed for their words of congratulation on my appointment as Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Both myself and my predecessor, Deputy O'Hanlon, listened with great care to what was said.  I will endeavour to respond as positively and constructively as possible.  In replying, I will endeavour to deal with the main themes running through the debate and answer as many of the specific issues raised as I can.  Needless to say, in the journey we have travelled over the past couple of days, it would be impossible to get down to the specifics of the various matters raised by all Deputies.  I hope to go as far as I possibly can down that road and, in the context of Committee Stage, tease out the finer points in a manner which will enable Members on all sides of the House to do the very best job we can in ensuring that the provisions of this Bill will withstand the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of contributors to the debate called for an integrated transport policy. Some sought a single Department of Transport.  Fine Gael speakers proposed <Col N="60" /> a national roads and rail authority while The Workers' Party suggested a national transport authority.  I might make a number of brief comments in response to those suggestions.  It is my belief that, in large measure, we have an integrated transport policy.  The Operational Programme on Peripherality covering the years 1989 to 1993, in which my Department act as the lead Department, is an integrated medium-term investment programme dealing with roads, rail, ports and airports.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis in phase 2 of the Dublin transportation initiative, announced recently, is on an integrated approach to ongoing transport planning in the greater Dublin area.  I would argue that the place to take strategic decisions on issues which go to make up an integrated transport policy &mdash; such as the distribution of scarce resources and selection of priorities &mdash; is around the Cabinet table.  There is merit in a number of Departments and Ministers having transport responsibilities, as this encourages a greater degree of informed debate on relative priorities and allocation of resources, whereas a single Department, with a corporate view, might not facilitate the same level or quality of debate.</P>
    <P>Indeed, whatever Government structures we adopt it will be possible for somebody to point to problems.  There had long been calls for a single Department of the Marine.  Now that we have one, Members want to strip it of its transport responsibilities.  It has been argued that land use and transportation planning should be integrated, something which would be directly contradicted by the allocation of roads functions to a new Department of Transport.  What about the synergy between tourism and transport? The only solution to all these organisational problems would be one, massive Government Department, something which even the most corporate-minded among us would not support.  There would appear to me to be also a curious contradiction between The Workers' Party proposal for a national transport <Col N="61" /> authority and their criticisms of the proposals for the National Roads Authority as being anti-democratic.</P>
    <P>During the debate, there has been criticism of the funding of road improvement and maintenance ranging, from allegations that net State spending on national roads has decreased with the advent of 75 per cent EC grants to calls for increased assistance for county roads. Total Exchequer expenditure on improvement works on national primary roads in the period 1984-88 was £369 million with EC aid commitments of £173 million, giving an average annual State expenditure, net of the EC aid, of just over £39 million.  Equivalent figures for the period 1989-93, including projected expenditure for 1992 and 1993 in the Operational Programme on Peripherality, are total Exchequer expenditure of £646 million with EC aid commitments of £411 million, giving an average annual expenditure, net of EC aid, of £47 million.  Therefore, not only has total expenditure increased by three-quarters but net State expenditure has also increased significantly.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to comment on a suggestion by Deputy Yates that the Government had reduced the 1989 to 1993 expenditure commitment for national roads from an original figure of £687 million to £511 million.  In fact he is not comparing like with like.  The £687 million is the total planned improvement expenditure for national roads in the period 1989 to 1993 while the £511 million is the figure included in the Operational Programme on Peripherality for national primary roads only.  The £511 million figure excludes all 1989 expenditure on national roads which was included in the national programme of Community interest on road development rather than the operational programme and also excludes expenditure over the five year period on national secondary roads which is dealt with elsewhere in the operational programme.  I also want to make it clear that, contrary to suggestions from some quarters, expenditure to date on national roads is exactly in line with the commitments in the operational programme <Col N="62" /> and it is my intention to continue to meet those commitments.</P>
    <P>In addition to increased funding for national roads, the Government have also provided substantial extra funding for non-national roads.  Since 1986 the discretionary grants paid to county councils for county and regional roads has trebled.  A Government commitment to a £150 million three year investment programme for the years 1989 to 1991 has been more than fulfilled, with a total of £182 million provided.  These substantial increases have been provided during a period of financial restraint and are a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to an improved road network.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Yates proposed the establishment of a local roads fund to be financed from motor tax receipts and which would replace the present State road grants for non-national roads.  If we accept the figures put forward by Deputy Yates, for the purposes of debate at least, Fine Gael are proposing to give £160 million in motor tax revenue to local authorities for non-national roads and to abolish the £80 million State road grant.  In simple arithmetic this would mean a nett revenue loss to the Exchequer of £80 million and I have to ask the Opposition how they would propose to make up this loss. Indeed, this is a general point I want to make about extra road funding.  It is easy for people to call for more finance while at the same time looking for lower levels of taxation.  Government have to deal with the real world and the figures show that, even in difficult financial circumstances, we have in recent years provided significant additional funding for roads from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the question of funding, some Deputies commented on the availability of EC assistance for non-national roads.  Under the Operational Programme on Peripherality just over £50 million in EC grants was made available in the period 1989 to 1993 for roads other than national primary roads, that is national secondary, regional, county and urban roads.  That assistance is being used to <Col N="63" /> support improvement works which contribute to economic development, particularly industry and tourism.  About £6 million in EC aid is also available under the rural development operational programme and the Interreg cross-Border initiative.  I want to stress the importance of local authorities carrying out high quality works which satisfy the relevant EC criteria and which will strengthen our case for additional aid when we begin negotiations for the next Community Support Framework, 1994 to 1998.</P>
    <P>There were a number of references to the need for rail development which I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. My only comment at this point is that roads are, and will continue to be, the predominant national mode of surface transport, carrying 96 per cent of passenger traffic and 90 per cent of freight and requiring long term investment of £9 billion.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to some of the specific issues raised in relation to the Bill.  References were made to the need to have a genuinely independent National Roads Authority.  Concern was expressed that it should not just be another arm of my Department and that it would adopt a more coherent approach to the development of the national network. There was also a concern as to the impact of the National Roads Authority on local democracy and criticisms of its powers to override local authorities, as some Deputies saw it.</P>
    <P>The Authority will take over all the functions exercised by my Department in relation to the development of the national roads system and my Department will no longer have any function in this area.  As Minister, I will of course continue to exercise overall policy supervision and certain quasi judicial functions. I am happy to assure the House that the Authority will be a statutory body which will be genuinely independent in the exercise of its functions.  I am also happy to confirm that Exchequer funding for it will be in the form of a <Col N="64" /> block grant, the allocation of which will be entirely the business of the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Authority will provide a renewed emphasis on the improvement of the national roads and that it will carry out its task in a coherent and co-ordinated fashion.  It is only in recent years that we have started to make a major investment in the national network. Before that successive Governments gave investment priority to other areas of our economic and social infrastructure &mdash; housing, telecommunications, energy and so on &mdash; achievements, which as Deputy Quinn acknowledged, we can be proud of.  Another problem in addition to low levels of funding was the absence of a firm medium-term planning and investment framework.  Now that we have a national consensus on the importance of investment in the network, a single-minded Authority with the power to do an effective job and firm medium-term framework through the Operational Programme on Peripherality and its successors, we will very quickly put in place another vital element of our national economic infrastructure of which we can be justifiably proud.</P>
    <P>The Bill is structured so as to foster a spirit of common purpose and co-operation between the NRA and local authorities, to make continued use of the skills and expertise of the local authorities and to avoid overlap or duplication of effort.  Local authorities will continue to acquire land and carry out a range of functions under the supervision of the NRA.  However, at the end of the day the buck has to stop somewhere and it seems logical that the NRA, which is being given the overall responsibility for national road development, should have the reserve &mdash; and I stress the word &ldquo;reserve&rdquo;&mdash; powers necessary to implement its mandate from the Oireachtas.  I would be surprised if the NRA will have to use these powers often, if at all; but it is essential that they have them.  My Department have had few problems with local authorities when exercising their supervisory role in <Col N="65" /> relation to national roads and the Minister has not to date had recourse to his directive powers under the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974.  I would add at this point that there are no plans for a mass relocation of local authority design staff, through the NRA will, no doubt, want to examine how expertise in one area can be made available more effectively to others.</P>
    <P>I also reject the criticism about so-called democratic deficit.  The NRA will, I hope, be set up by the Oireachtas, acting as the elected representatives of the people.  There are ample powers in the Bill for public consultation and for consultation with local authorities &mdash; for example, in relation to a draft plan under section 18; before issuing a direction under section 18; under section 20 before carrying out works which would materially contravene a development plan.  I am prepared to look constructively at suggestions as to how these consultative provisions might be strengthened, but to give local authorities a veto would be contrary to the whole intent of Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority are not being given a totally free hand however. They will be obliged to consider what is said to them during consultation and to have regard to the relevant local development plan and to the possible environmental impact of proposed road projects. In carrying out their mandate they will also have regard to the wider public good and will have to weigh in the balance local and national impacts.  At the end of the day the Authority will have to live in the real world like the rest of us and be sensitive to genuine public concerns.  In reality they will no more be able to ride roughshod over such concerns, as some contributors seemed to suggest, than would any local authority.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies suggested that this Bill was a road builders' charter and that the Authority would be used to push a policy of road building to the exclusion of other areas of transport.  That is simply not true.  Successive speakers have acknowledged the deficient state of our national <Col N="66" /> road network and the need for a co-ordinated and concentrated programme to remedy these deficiencies.  This programme is vital to our economic wellbeing, especially since these roads carry more than one third of all road traffic. As Minister for the Environment with responsibility for the built infrastructure, environmental protection and physical planning, I am well aware that road construction does not in itself solve traffic and transport problems in major urban areas, and I can assure the House that the establishment of the Authority does not imply a roads-only policy for cities, such as Dublin.  The Dublin Transportation Initiative demonstrates my commitment to a balanced and integrated transportation strategy for the metropolitan area.  They will look in an integrated way at all transport modes &mdash; road, rail, bus, cycling and walking.  They will examine all the options &mdash; new road construction, light rail, busways and the better use of our existing infrastructure and facilities.  The Eastern By-Pass, to which a number of Deputies referred, will be among a range of options to facilitate north-south movement and port access which will be evaluated by the initiative.</P>
    <P>During the debate Authority membership was sought for representatives of various organisations and I have taken note of these suggestions.  My concern is to ensure that the members of the Authority will be of high calibre who will bring a wide range of relevant expertise and experience to bear on their activities. I do not want an authority comparised of mandated representatives of various interest groups pursuing their own sectoral agendas, though I will of course be happy to listen to suggestions from such groups as to persons suitable for appointment.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that staff transfers to the Authority should be subject to the consent of the individuals concerned. While I am prepared to consider an amendment to provide for prior consultation with staff interests, I do not think it would be practical or appropriate to give individuals a veto.  This certainly <Col N="67" /> has not been the approach adopted in the case of a range of State bodies established by the Oireachtas such as An Post, Telecom Éireann, Coillte and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  A criticism was made of the provision for the secondment of employees of the Authority once they were nominated as candidates in local authority elections.  I am prepared to look again at this, but in fairness I should point out that the Minister can designate grades of employment to which this restriction would not apply.  I am also prepared to look at section 33 again in so far as it applies to candidates for election as distinct from those already elected.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of and will review the various suggestions made regarding the specific functions of the National Roads Authority, including proposals to give it powers relating to improved design, road safety, training of local authority staff, harmonisation of standards and so on.  Some of these are already covered in the existing text.  The general obligation to provide a safe and efficient network of national roads encompasses road safety, while road design and the setting of standards are specifically mentioned in section 19.  Section 19 (3) gives the Authority wide ancillary powers to do things connected with their overall functions.  My only reservation is that the Authority should avoid overlap and duplication with bodies such as the National Safety Council, the Environmental Research Unit and the Institute of Public Administration &mdash; all of which have functions in the areas referred to.  I also want to assure Deputy Yates that any assignment of additional functions to the Authority would, under section 7 (3), require the approval of the Oireachtas.  In response to Deputy Howlin's and others' concern about signposting, section 19 (1) (c) empowers the Authority to prepare co-ordinated schemes for traffic signs, while section 68 prohibits unauthorised signs and gives local authorities enforcement powers.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed reservations about the proposed assignment <Col N="68" /> to the Authority of tolling powers in respect of national roads.  I want to begin my response by emphatically rejecting the allegation that tolling represents extra or double taxation.  Tolling is nothing of the kind; instead it is a method of raising additional funds for the development of the road network.  It has been the policy of successive Governments, including those with Fine Gael and Labour representation, to seek toll-based investment in roads and it has been the consistent policy of successive Governments that revenue obtained through tolling should be used to accelerate road development.  In my view logic dictates that tolling powers should be available to the Authority as part of their overall financial responsibilities, which include the powers to allocate State grants, borrow money and promote EC investment in national roads.  I would remind the House that this is not an unfettered power.  The Authority are obliged to consult with the appropriate local authority.  There is a public consultation process.  The Minister must hold a public local inquiry into any objections and tolls cannot be levied without ministerial approval.  Members should also note that the scope for tolling here is very limited and that there are no projects on national roads which could be fully funded by toll-based private investment &mdash; all would need a contribution from public funds.  I also want to assure Deputies that the Authority's borrowing power is not a backdoor method of Government borrowing; it is a genuine part of the authority's financial armoury.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes asked about Government tolling policy.  Broad statements of policy are to be found in the 1985 road plan and in the 1989 roads operational programme.  I assure the Deputy that toll agreements are public documents.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn briefly to the remaining Parts of the Bill which concern the general law on public roads.  First, I want to try to clear up some confusion about the classification of public roads. Public roads will be of three classes &mdash; national, regional and local &mdash; and the <Col N="69" /> purpose of this is to allow for the assignment of responsibility to various categories of local authorities.  In addition to the road classification, there are also roads with special characteristics &mdash; motorways, busways and protected roads.  These are two entirely separate issues.  For example, a motorway will also have to be classified as a national, regional or local road.  Designation as a motorway only ensures that frontage development is prohibited and that it is restricted to certain types of traffic.  It does not determine which category of local authority is responsible for it &mdash; this is decided by its classification.</P>
    <P>As is the case at present, the Minister will classify national and regional roads, while all other roads in the charge of local authorities will be automatically classified as local roads.  The existing national primary and national secondary roads will continue in large measure to be designated as such under the new Act. An administrative classification of regional roads carried out by my Department has existed for many years.  The new Act will give a legal basis to the Rnumbers we are all familiar with and have been using on our signposts for some time.</P>
    <P>Before formally establishing the Authority, I will complete a review of the national road classification.  Roads serving the State airports and the key commercial seaports will be classified as nationals, if they are not classified as such already.  I will also be looking at what other changes are required to take account of new construction, changed traffic management arrangements and changed traffic patterns.  I regularly receive requests for reclassification and some suggestions as to correction have also been made in this debate.  I want to urge caution.  We already have a very extensive network of national primary and secondary roads, over 5,600 km in length.  It was selected after a long period of study and is intended to meet our strategic transport needs.  Reclassification as a means of getting funding for a particular road is, ultimately, self-defeating. Resources are allocated on the <Col N="70" /> basis of priorities and newly classified roads would simply join the end of the line for funding.  Adding roads willy nilly would also dilute the available funding for the network &mdash; if we spread our money too thinly we will end up with an extensive but mediocre network of strategic roads.</P>
    <P>There also seems to be some confusion about the declaration of public roads or their abandonment.  Both functions will be the responsibility of the elected members of local authorities, with provision being made for prior public consultation. The only restriction is that the abandonment by a local authority of a national road or regional road will require ministerial approval, since the Minister would have been originally responsible for their classification as such.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about roads improved under the local improvements scheme.  These must be non-public roads when assisted under the LIS.  These roads could in principle subsequently be declared to be public roads provided they satisfied the criteria in section 11, which include the general public utility of the road and the financial implications for the local authority.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of Deputy Howlin's comments on local authorities as custodians of public rights on way and I hope to be able to respond in an appropriate way on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The concept of a protected road presented difficulties for Deputy Dukes. It is designed to be a much more flexible instrument than a motorway in its control of access.  Controls will be tailored to suit the particular road and may apply to a new or existing road.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the need for improved co-ordination of road openings. Statutory undertakers such as ESB, Telecom Éireann and Bord Gáis have statutory powers to open public roads and, unlike other persons, do not require a licence from a local authority to do so.</P>
    <P>There are controls of their activities however.  Section 101 (d) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the <Col N="71" /> Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act, 1987, enables prescribed local authorities to issue directions to statutory undertakers and others for the purposes of co-ordinating road openings and minimising traffic disruption.  In September 1988 the Minister made regulations prescribing Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation as authorities who could exercise these directive powers and my Department have recently written to local authorities asking if any more of them wish to avail of these powers. Arrangements are also in place in Dublin to ensure the advance notification of planned works to enable them to be co-ordinated as far as possible.  Section 71 of this Bill updates and strengthens the powers of local authorities to temporarily close roads.  They will be able to impose conditions when closing a road to facilitate works and will also be able to recover the cost of any damage done to the road arising from the works.</P>
    <P>Suggestions were made that the seasonal sale of fruit and vegetables should not be prohibited under section 68.  In fact, under the section as it is drafted at present, they are not.  Trading of this type is permitted under the Casual Trading Act, 1980, which is the primary legislation in this area.  Trading with such lawful authority is not affected by the new provisions in section 68.  Under the section it is also possible for the local authority to consent to trading activities which would then not be affected by the section.  I have received a large volume of representations on this section and I will be looking at it again before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that my response has been of assistance to Deputies.  I have tried to deal as comprehensively as possible with the main issues raised and to touch on as many as possible of the less important points.  Any points I have neglected to mention will no doubt be raised on Committee Stage and I will respond to them then.  My thanks to Deputies for their contributions and their attention to my <Col N="72" /> response.  I hope we will have an opportunity over the next few few weeks to complete the final Stages of this important Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and a division being demanded, it was postponed in accordance with the Order of the Dáil of 20 February 1992 until 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 February 1992.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to bring the Bill before the House.  Its main purpose is to streamline and speed up the appeals stage of the development control process under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts so that planning appeals and other matters can be determined by An Bord Pleanála within a much shorter period than at present.  It also proposes new procedural arrangements for legal actions challenging the validity of planning decisions, the aim of which is to facilitate the expeditious determination of such proceedings.</P>
      <P>The essential function of the physical planning system under the Planning Acts is to bring about orderly development and appropriate and efficient land use which is environmentally acceptable.  I believe that the system has by and large fulfilled this task well over the years by subjecting development proposals to detailed scrutiny by reference to considerations of proper planning and development in the context of planning authorities' development plans. Nevertheless, the operation of any system must be kept under review to ensure that it operates as efficiently and effectively as possible at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key tests of the effectiveness of the planning process is its ability to give final decisions on development proposals within a reasonable timeframe.  While the need for rigorous examination of proposals is beyond dispute, a developer is legitimately entitled to expect that he will <Col N="73" /> receive a final and conclusive decision on his proposal within a clearly defined period.  Undue delays in the planning process cause understandable frustration for developers and can lead to the abandonment of worthwhile projects with consequent loss of investment and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The need to avoid delays in the planning system is all the greater in Ireland because of this country's need for substantial new development in tackling the pressing unemployment problem.  In addition, delays in the planning system or any perception that our system is ponderous or dilatory would would put us at a serious competitive disadvantage in seeking to attract internationally mobile projects.</P>
    <P>There is some concern about the efficiency of the planning process, directed in the main at the length of time that it can take to process appeals against planning authorities' decisions on planning applications.  The Government share this concern and the Bill addresses the problems in this area by proposing to redraw the appeals procedure in a way that will allow An Bord Pleanála to determine almost all appeals within four months.  I am satisfied that this four months period is reasonable and that it will be achieved without undermining the essential thoroughness and fairness of the planning appeals process.</P>
    <P>The Bill's proposals in relation to the appeals process arise from a comprehensive review of An Bord Pleanála's systems and procedures which was carried out with the board's co-operation and agreement.  This review made various recommendations about the board's management and administration and these have largely been taken up by the board.  However, the review also drew attention to features of the existing legislative framework within which the board have to operate which inhibit the speedy determination of appeals.</P>
    <P>The board's performance has shown a marked improvement since the review was carried out.  For example, between September 1990 and December 1991 the number of appeals on hands fell from <Col N="74" /> 1,703 to 1,300 and the proportion of cases on hands for more than six months fell from 21.4 per cent to 2.8 per cent.  This is a significant change for the better and the board are to be commended for it. Nevertheless, the time taken to deal with individual appeals still cannot be regarded as satisfactory.  It has to be acknowledged, however, that the law as it stands at the moment inhibits the achievement of further significant improvement.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear at the outset that the Bill does not diminish or curtail existing rights of appeal to the board.  The present position is that any person may appeal to An Bord Pleanála against a planning Authority's decision on a planning application.  This will continue to be the case &mdash; the Bill seeks only to create a more orderly and effective procedural framework for the determination of appeals by the board.</P>
    <P>The approach in the Bill is to set out strict time limits for the various stages of the appeals process.  These time limits will be reinforced by a clear statement of the rights of participants in appeals as regards submissions to the board and of their obligations in relation to the timeliness and completeness of submissions. It is because of these changes that it it possible for the Bill to propose a statutory objective of four months for the determination of appeals by the board.</P>
    <P>The Bill's measures relating to court challenges to the validity of planning decisions will require these challenges to be taken only by way of the more expeditious judicial review procedure and will make the High Court's decision final, except in cases which involve a point of law of exceptional public importance.</P>
    <P>I should like now to outline the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section and defines certain terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 will establish the board's duty and objective in relation to the determination of planning appeals and the various other matters which come before them for decision.  I should explain that these other matters include references under section <Col N="75" /> 5 of the 1963 Planning Act as to what is or is not development or exempted development land requests for determination of certain issues.  However, these other matters constitute only a small proportion of the board's business and the Bill, apart from section 2, is generally concerned only with appeals against planning authorities' decisions on planning applications.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 it will be the general duty of the board to ensure that all appeals and other matters are disposed of as expeditiously as possible and to avoid delays.  This is a restatement of the board's existing duty under section 4 of the 1983 Planning Act.  However, section 2 goes further and establishes an express objective for the board to determine any appeal or other matter within four months or such other period as the Minister for the Environment may prescribe by regulations.  If the board considers that it will not be possible or appropriate to meet this objective in a particular case, they will have to notify the parties involved and specify the date by which they intend to give their decision.  They must then take all such steps as are open to them to ensure that the appeal or other matter is decided by that date.</P>
    <P>I am aware that it has been suggested from time to time that an absolute time limit should be laid down for the determination of appeals by the board.  I have been advised, however, that such an approach would not be satisfactory or acceptable, given the nature of the board and their functions.  Such a time limit could, for example, prevent the board from giving full and proper consideration to all relevant issues in an exceptionally complex case and would, therefore, be problematical in legal terms.  For this reason I am satisfied that the objective proposed in section 2 goes as far as possible in terms of laying down time limits for the appeals process.  I should add that the board will be expected to comply with the four month objective in all but the most exceptional cases and that their performance in meeting this objective will be monitored by my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The new objective will apply to appeals and other matters received by the board on or after six months after the passing of the Act.  In the intervening period the board will be expected to gear up their operations to meet the objective and to dispose of cases on hands.</P>
    <P>Section 3 amends section 26 of the 1963 Planning Act, which is the basic provision relating to appeals to An Bord Pleanála against decisions on planning applications. The main change made is an increase from 21 days to a month in the period in which persons other than the applicant for planning permission, colloquially known as &ldquo;third parties&rdquo;, can appeal to the board.  This increased period is being introduced because of the stringent new requirements in relation to the grounds of appeal proposed in section 4.  The appeal period will, therefore, be one month for all persons.</P>
    <P>Section 4 lays down requirements for the making of an appeal.  The central requirement is that an appeal must state in full the grounds of appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which they are based.  There is already a provision in planning law, in the 1977 planning regulations, that an appeal must state the grounds.  However, the courts have held that this provision is directory only and that an appeal can validly be made by giving notice of appeal within the appeal period and submitting the grounds subsequently.  This has caused problems in practice because of delays on the part of some appellants in submitting their grounds.  Section 17 of the 1983 Planning Act was enacted in response to these problems and allows the board to serve a notice on an appellant requiring him to submit his grounds of appeal within a specified period.  However, this mechanism places the onus for ensuring submission of the grounds on the board. I consider that it would be preferable and more conductive to the effective operation of the appeals process to establish a binding requirement that the full grounds of appeal must be stated in the appeal and to provide that an appeal will be invalid unless this requirement is complied with. <Col N="77" /> I know that there have been some expressions of concern that the requirement to submit full grounds of appeal within a month may be unduly onerous for appellants.  I am satisfied, however, that this period will allow appellants adequate time to prepare and submit appeals, and that it strikes a fair balance between the rights of appellants and the public interest in having conclusive decisions on development proposals within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>The section lays down also, in light of the new provision for setting out the full grounds of appeal when appealing, that there will be no right for an appellant to make a further written submission except where the board exercise their discretionary power under section 9.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 place new obligations on planning authorities which will facilitate the operation of the streamlined appeals mechanism proposed in the Bill. Under section 5 a planning authority will have to make all relevant documents relating to a planning application, including any internal reports prepared on the application, available from the day they give their decision on the application. This is to ensure that all appropriate papers are available without delay to any person who wishes to consider appealing to the board against the decision.  Section 6 requires a planning authority to submit all relevant documents to An Bord Pleanála within 14 days of being notified of an appeal and is intended to overcome certain difficulties that the board have experienced in this connection.</P>
    <P>Section 7 regulates the right of the other party or parties to an appeal to respond to the appeal.  I might explain here that where the appeal is made by the applicant for planning permission, the other party will be the planning Authority concerned.  If the appellant is not the applicant for planning permission, then the other parties are the applicant and the planning Authority.</P>
    <P>A period of one month, running from the day on which a copy of the appeal is sent to the party by the board, will be allowed for the making of submissions or observations to the board.  The board <Col N="78" /> will be prohibited from considering any submissions or observations received after that period has expired.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with submissions or observations to the board by persons other than the parties to an appeal.  It is well established in practice that such persons have a right to make submissions to the board, but this right is expressly stated in planning law only for appeals involving environmental impact assessment. This section thus puts the matter on a formal legal footing for all appeals and in most cases will require submissions to be made within one month of receipt of the appeal by the board.  As in the case of section 7, submissions received by the board after the end of the specified period may not be considered.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 both prohibit the making of further written submissions, except in the circumstances contemplated by section 9.  This is because of the difficulties posed for the board and the delays which arise when they receive further submissions at an advanced stage in their consideration of an appeal.  I am satisfied that this limitation is necessary for the effective operation of the appeals process and that these sections nevertheless afford parties and other persons a reasonable opportunity to make their case to the board.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from the foregoing that all participants in an appeal will be entitled to make one written submission to the board.  Circumstances could arise, however, in which it would be appropriate to allow some participants an opportunity to make further submissions. for this reason, section 9 gives the board discretion, exercisable where they consider it appropriate in the interests of justice to do so, to request any participant in an appeal to make submissions or observations within a specified period on any matter which has arisen in relation to the appeal.  If the person does not respond within the specified period, the board will be authorised by section 11 to go ahead with determination of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 10, which replaces section 18 of the 1983 Planning Act, allows the <Col N="79" /> board to require any person involved with an appeal to submit documents or other information which the board consider necessary for determination of the appeal.  If the person does not do so within the period allowed by the board, the board will be able, under section 11, to proceed to determine or dismiss the appeal as it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes new provision for oral hearings of appeals and replaces section 15 of the 1983 Planning Act.  It establishes a new requirement that any request for an oral hearing will have to be made at the outset of the appeals process to overcome the difficulties faced by the board when such a request is received at a late stage in their consideration of an appeal.  An appellant's request for an oral hearing will have to be made when appealing and any other party will have to make a request during the period of one month allowed for making submissions to the board.  The new section does not retain the Minister's unused power under section 15 of the 1983 Act to prescribe classes of cases for which oral hearings must be held, on the basis that it should be entirely a matter for the board to decide by reference to the circumstances of a particular case whether it is necessary or appropriate to hold an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>Section 13 restates, with some procedural modifications, the board's power under section 17 of the 1976 Planning Act to take account of matters other than those raised by the participants in an appeal.  If they propose to do so the board will have to allow an opportunity for comment, either at an oral hearing or by way of written submissions according to the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Sections 14, 15 and 16 draw together powers of the board under the 1982 and 1983 Planning Acts which facilitate speedy determination of cases.  Section 14 allows the board to dismiss vexatious or ill-founded appeals.  Section 15 allows the board to deal with an appeal which relates only to conditions attached by a planning authority without having to <Col N="80" /> consider the entire case <i>de novo.</i> Section 16 gives the board power to declare an appeal, or an application to which an appeal relates, to be withdrawn if they consider that it has been abandoned.</P>
    <P>Section 17 makes supplemental provisions relating to the time for doing certain things in the appeals process.  It specifies, <i>inter alia,</i> that an appeal received by the board after the one month appeal period has expired will be invalid.  However if the last day of the appeal period falls on a day when the board's offices are closed, the appeal will be considered to be in time if it is received on the next day on which the board's offices are open.</P>
    <P>Section 18 empowers the Minister to make regulations prescribing supplemental procedural matters in relation to appeals or establishing procedural requirements in respect of other matters dealt with by the board.  Any regulations made under this section will have to be laid before both houses for 21 days in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The main provision of section 19 is an amendment of section 82 of the 1963 Planning Act which establishes new procedural arrangements for legal actions challenging the validity of decisions by planning authorities or An Bord Pleanála. As I indicated earlier, any such proceedings will now have to be taken by way of an application for judicial review. The existing two month time limit on the institution of proceedings is being retained.  An application for leave to apply for judicial review will have to be by motion on notice to interested parties and the High Court will have to be satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision challenged is invalid before it grants leave to apply for review.  The High Court's determination on the application for leave to apply for review or on the application for review will be final unless the High Court gives leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance.</P>
    <P>Section 20 deals with repeals and revocations. Section 21 makes transitional <Col N="81" /> provisions and section 22 contains the usual provisions relating to short title, commencement etc.</P>
    <P>While concern about delays in the planning process has rightly focused on the appeals stage, it is of crucial importance also that the process operates effectively and without delays at the planning authority stage.  Planning authorities are required to decide planning applications within two months, unless the applicant agrees to a longer period or the authority has to ask for further information.  If the authority needs further information, the legal requirement is to determine the application within two months of receiving the information.  My Department have indicated to planning authorities that it should be their objective to determine as great a proportion as possible of applications within the initial two month period and have conveyed to them the recommendation of the Special Task Force on Employment that cases where further information is requested should, as far as possible, be decided within a month of receipt of the information.  I intend to monitor the performance of planning authorities in this regard and I will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that no avoidable delays arise at this stage of the development control process.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of Deputies to a provision in the review of the Programme for Government, 1989 &mdash; 1993 to the effect that access will be granted for all parties to the Circuit Court for injunctions against unauthorised development.  I propose to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment of the Bill to deal with this matter.  The existing provision granting access to the High Court for orders against unauthorised or non-conforming development has proven to be very effective and allowing access to the Circuit Court for such orders will serve to enhance its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that this Bill underlines the Government's commitment to an effective physical planning system.  I believe that the measures in it will lead to a better ordered and more expeditious appeals process.  I <Col N="82" /> am satisfied also that these measures will speed up the appeals process without compromising the ability of the process to subject appeals to thorough and rigorous scrutiny in a fair and objective way.  Furthermore, the proposals in relation to court proceedings will facilitate expeditious determination of such proceedings, thus ensuring finality and certainty as to a developer's right to proceed with a permitted development.  I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome opportunity for the House to discuss in very general terms the whole issue of planning and development in this country. My sympathies lie with the idea of trying in so far as possible to expedite the decision making process.  In doing so we must not provide a regime in which bad planning decisions are made, short cuts are taken and where the legitimate rights of people to scrutinise and, where necessary, object to planning permission are compromised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that there are many more problems in the planning area than are addressed in this Bill.  For instance, An Bord Pleanála's performance is not open to democratic scrutiny.  I am very disappointed that the Bill does not provide for some form of answerability by An Bord Pleanála &mdash; I am not talking about answerability in specific cases but answerability to this Parliament for their overall policy and approach to planning matters and for the speed, efficiency and fairness with which they discharge their functions. An Bord Pleanála have power at present to grant decisions which are in breach of the county or county borough development plan.  We have already circumscribed the powers of the local authorities to materially contravene their own development plans.  Yet no provision is made in this Bill to circumscribe the much more wide ranging power of An Bord Pleanála to grant permissions which are in breach of the existing county development plans.  I will be proposing on Committee Stage that this power of <Col N="83" /> An Bord Pleanála be eliminated.  An Bord Pleanála should not have power to initiate breaches of county development plans, at least not without some form of approval from the locally elected authority.</P>
    <P>I shall be proposing in the course of the debate in this House that An Bord Pleanála be made answerable for their actions.  In order that the planning appeals procedure be more efficient and fair I will be proposing the setting up of an environment committee of this House to which An Bord Pleanála will be generally accountable.  Second, I shall be proposing that we remove from An Bord Pleanála the power to initiate material contraventions of county or of county borough development plans.  Third, I shall be proposing amendments that give to local authorities the power to request by two-thirds majority the board of An Bord Pleanála and/or their inspectors to appear before the local authority to justify appeals decisions that vary decisions of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Those proposals would bring a great deal of answerability and accountability to An Bord Pleanála and they would contribute greatly to the sharpening up of the performance of An Bord Pleanála in terms of time taken, of fairness and of good planning procedures.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 November 1991 firings close to positions occupied by Irish troops in Lebanon have occurred on 56 occasions. Most of these incidents, as well as the shooting which occurred on 15 November 1991 and which resulted in the death of an Irish soldier and the wounding of another Irish soldier, have been attributed to the <i>de facto</i> forces.</P>
      <P>As indicated to the House on 4 December last, the Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Israeli Ambassador to Ireland on 19 November 1991 and expressed the Government's deep sense of shock and anger at this outrageous incident.  Assurances were sought regarding the control of the <i>de facto</i> forces, the steps necessary to prevent a recurrence, and the action which was intended to punish the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the undertaking given by my predecessor to the House on 4 December last, he subsequently wrote to the Israeli Minister for Defence conveying the strong condemnation of the Government and the House of the activities of the <i>de facto</i> forces in this grave incident and in other recent firings.  He asked the Israeli Minister to indicate what action will be taken to curtail the activities of the <i>de facto</i> forces and bring to justice those responsible for the death of the Irish soldier.  A reply has not yet been received.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister not agree that a number of 56 occasions is absolutely unacceptable and outrageous; that the <i>de facto</i> troops and, indeed, the Israeli <Col N="85" /> Government are showing contempt and distain for the United Nations forces in the Lebanon; that, as the House condemns outright the actions of the <i>de facto</i> forces and the Israelis in the Lebanon, it is now time for the Government and for all EC member states combined to register their strongest possible protest to the Israeli Government?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the behaviour of the <i>de facto</i> forces, which are mainly controlled by Israel, as the Deputy knows, has been atrocious.  As the Deputy has emphasised, the issue has to be taken in the context of a United Nations operation.  As well as the action taken by the Irish Government the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence and the United Nations have been bringing pressure to bear in order to get the matter under control.  The matter is difficult and delicate.  The onus on the Government and on this House is to make sure by all power available to us that our troops, who are performing a peace keeping function for the United Nations, are protected.  The European Community is not a factor in this issue, but I would not disagree with the Deputy that if the voice of the EC, all of whose member states belong to the United Nations, could be added to the pressure on the <i>de facto</i> forces that would be all the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in June 1990 that an executive jet aircraft should be procured in accordance with the EC/GATT procurement procedures on the most favourable terms available.  Following a tender competition a total of 21 offers to supply various aircraft types was received.  A technical and economic evaluation of these aircraft was subsequently undertaken and a contract was placed with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation on 25 March 1991 for a new Gulfstream IV aircraft.</P>
      <P>Acceptance of the aircraft was completed on 19 December 1991 and, following pilot conversion training, the new aircraft will commence operational service in early March.  The Gulfstream III aircraft held on a monthly lease will be returned to the lessor at the same time. The Gulfstream IV is currently in the United States undergoing a warranty inspection.</P>
      <P>Maximum use was made of Irish fabrics and carpets in the specification for the outfitting of the interior of the aircraft. No additional cost of the overall completion price of the aircraft was incurred by this requirement.</P>
      <P>The Gulfstream IV aircraft is being acquired on the basis of a ten-year lease arrangement, with an option to purchase. This arrangement is in accordance with normal practice in the airline industry and the leasing cost will amount to about £2 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Other aircraft used for the purpose of the Ministerial Air Transport Service comprise a HS 125 jet aircraft and a Beech Kingair turbo prop aircraft which were purchased in 1980 at a total cost of £3.45 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there truth in the reports that the aircraft is costing the Government £15 million, that the Gulfstream IV coming into Ireland will be the only one in military use in all of Europe, that that kind of aircraft is commonly sold to some Republics in Africa and that outside of those sales its service is limited to private use?  Does the <Col N="88" /> Minister believe that the Government got the best value for money in relation to the acquisition of this aircraft?  Could not other aircraft such as the 737 and the 727 have been acquired at a third of the cost? Why was the decision taken not to acquire those planes and will the Minister ouline to the House the need for an aircraft with a transatlantic capacity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Tenders were invited and I mentioned the number of tenders received.  Assessment was made on the basis of those tenders.  I am not in a position to answer the Deputy with regard to who else purchased that aircraft, but from my time as Minister for Transport I know that the purchase of the Boeings mentioned would have been ridiculous in that they are capable of carrying from 70 to 125 passengers and there would not be any need for that.  It would be very costly, in running terms, to purchase one of those.  Those planes were assessed and rejected by the assessors.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste on his appointment as Minister for Defence.  Would the Minister not agree that at a time when the Government reneged on their pay obligation to public servants and cannot afford to provide finance for local authority housing affecting up to 30,000 applicants throughout the country and when we cannot afford hospital care for thousands of people, it is unacceptable to enter into an agreement to pay up to £20 million for a &ldquo;super <Col N="89" /> duper&rdquo; aircraft to bring Ministers all over the world?</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy a chance to welcome me in a moment.  I was expecting the prelude to the Deputy's question.  The Deputy should put the whole idea in context.  The purpose of purchasing a ministerial aircraft is to facilitate travel to the European Community mainly.  That would be quite an expensive, even if it was a practical, thing to do through commercial aircraft.  In the context of the European Community, if the Deputy examines the transfers from the European Community to aid all the social purposes he mentioned, he will see that they are well worth going after, well worth servicing and that we are very substantially net gainers by that and so are the various social areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unacceptable to the people on the ground to spend £20 million for this purpose given that Aer Lingus are one of the premier air companies in Europe.  The Minister referred specifically to the European Community.  Many flights are going from Dublin Airport to <Col N="90" /> Brussels and every other capital city in Europe.  I do not accept that there is a greater cost involved in using commercial aircraft.  If ordinary people are being asked to tighten their belts, Government Ministers should also.  A sum of £20 million is totally unacceptable given the present economic climate.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cur leis an méid atá ráite ag mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Kenny, agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as a phost úr mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Chuir sé áthas orm nuair a chuala mé an tAire agus an Tanáiste ag rá ar Raidió na Gaeltachta go mbeidh sé ag glacadh páirt ghníomhach in imeachtaí na Roinne agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar níos mó dul chun cinn ar an cheist atá á plé againn, fad agus tá an tAire ansin, ná mar a rinneadh le cúpla bliain anuas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is í an cheist a ba mhaith lion a chur ar an Aire ná, an bhfuil aon mholtaí ag Roinn na Gaeltachta féin nó ar chuir siad aon mholtaí dá gcuid féin ar fáil maidir <Col N="94" /> le seirbhís teilifíse trí Ghaeilge.  Tuigim gur cuireadh moltaí ar fáil agus gur cuireadh ar aghaidh chuig Roinn an Taoisigh iad, sin chuig an iar-Thaoiseach.

      <P>Is mian liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht na fáilte a d'fhear tú romham agus roimh mo leathbhádóir, an tAire Stáit. Tá súil agam go mbeimid ábalta feabhsú ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta. Níl mé ag admháil go ndearnadh faillí sna cúrsaí sin le blianta beaga anuas.  Mar is eol don Teachta, tá tuarascáil ann ón meitheal oibre a bunaíodh sa bhliain 1986 &mdash; sín nuair a bhí an Comhrialtas idir Fine Gael agus Páirtí an Lucht Oibre i gcumhacht &mdash; agus tá na moltaí sin againn sa Roinn.  Tar éis sin d'iarr an t-iar-Thaoiseach, a luaigh an Teachta, ar Údarás na Gaeltachta tuarascáil a ullmhú agus tá a fhios ag an Teachta gur ceapadh Stokes Kennedy Crowley chun an socrú sin a dhéanamh.  Chuir siadsan tuarascáil faoinár mbráid agus bhí an tuarascáil sin i bhfábhar bhunú telefís na Gaeilge nó na Gaeltachta &mdash; tá idirhealú le déanamh eatarthu.  Tá mise anois ag teacht isteach le grinnstaidéar a dhéanamh ar na moltaí sin agus tá mé a dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Cumarsáide, bean chumasach ó Chonamara, agus tá súil agam go n-éireoidh linn rud éiginn a dhéanamh.</P>

Tá sé déanta go príobháideach agam leis roimhe seo, agus tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil sé ansin fosta le tacaíocht a thabhairt don Aire san fheachtas seo, agus, mar a dúirt an Teachta Kenny &ldquo;tar éis na Féile Bríde tá súil agam go n-ardóidh tú do sheol&rdquo; agus go dtabharfaidh tú cuairt, ní amháin ar Chlár Cloinne Mhuiris agus Ghaeltacht Mhaigh Eo, ach ó thuaidh agus ó dheas chomh maith.  Agus é sin ráite agam, <Col N="95" /> ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire an mbeidh siad ábalta seasamh leis an gheallúint atá tugtha chomh minic sin ag an iar-Thaoiseach, go gcuirfí an tseirbhís seo ar bun i rith na bliana seo 1992, agus go mbeidh sé ag craoladh go rialta i 1993.</P>

Tá an dá b'fhéidir ann.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana agus mé ag tabhairt freagra, tá sé an-chostasach ar fad, agus tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil sé sin fíor.  Beidh mise ag dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Stáit agus leis an Aire Cumarsáide chun é seo a chur ar aghaidh.</P>

      <P>d'Aire na Gaeltachta an ndéarfadh sé faoi gach Gaeltacht sa tír, (1) cén méid acraí atá iontu, (2) cén líon daonra i ngach Gaeltacht acu i, (a) 1961, (b) 1971, (c) 1981 agus (d) 1991, (3) cén céatadán ardaithe nó laghdaithe a thaispeánann sé seo, (4) cén líon a bhí fostaithe go lán-aimseartha i ngach Gaeltacht ar an (i) 1 Eanáir, 1980 agus (ii) ar an chéad Eanáir de gach uile bhliain ó 1985 go dtí 1991; cén céatadán a thaispeánann sé seo; an bhfuil sé sásta <Col N="96" /> leis an treoir seo; agus an ndéanfadh sé ráiteas ina leith.</P>

      <P>Tá an t-eolas staitisticiúil a iarradh i dtáblaí a chuirfear timpeall sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil.</P>
      <P>Maidir le fostaíocht i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ó Údarás na Gaeltachta léiríonn an tábla iomchuí (Tábla 3) go raibh glanmhéadú carnach de thimpeall 25 faoin gcéad i líon na ndaoine a bhí fostaithe go lánaimseartha i dtionscail sa Ghaeltacht a fuair cúnamh ó Údarás na Gaeltachta ó bunaíodh é ar 1 Eanáir 1980 go dtí deireadh 1990.  Níl figiúirí cinnte ar fáil go fóill le haghaidh deireadh 1991 ach meastar go raibh glanmhéadú beag i líon na bpost a cruthaíodh sa bhliain sin.  Tá dul chun cinn suntasach bainte amach ag an Údarás ó 1980 i leith ag féachaint do na deacrachtaí móra a bhíonn le sárú ag an eagraíocht ina cuid iarrachtaí chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn, mar shampla, iargúlatcht na gceantar Gaeltachta, fad ó mhargaí, easpa bunstruchtúir, etc.  Is ábhar imní agus machnaimh don Údarás agus domsa mar Aire na Gaeltachta, cé go bhfuil líon maith post á gcruthú in aghaidh na bliana (mar shampla timpeall 900 post i 1991) go bhfuil líon maith post á gcailliúint freisin gach bliain.  Beidh an cheist sin á plé agam leis an Údarás d'fhonn feabhas a chur ar an scéal oiread agus is féidir.  Ar ndóigh caithfear smaoineamh air nach sa Ghaeltacht amháin a bhíonn sé seo ag tarlú.</P>

An dtuigeann an tAire nach bhfuair siad aon ardú, chomh fada agus is eol dom, ó bhí 1990 ann, agus nach bhfuil siad ag fáil in aghaidh an lae ach trí phunt agus caoga pingin, agus tá a fhios againn go bhfuil an costas maireachtála ag dul suas i rith na bliana.  Sílim go bhfuil sé thar am go dtabharfaí ardú do na mná tí seo.  Caithfimid an caighdeán a choinneáil suas.  Cuirtear lóistín maith ar fáil dóibh, cuirtear béilí maithe ar fáil dóibh agus d'iarrfainn ar an Aire athmhachnamh agus athscrúdú a dhéanamh ar an scéal agus fiú amháin ardú a thabhairt dóibh a choinneodh suas leis an ráta boilscithe.</P>

Tá cruthú de shórt éigin sa mhéid eolais seo, is é sin go bhfuil ardú ó 1986, ó 16,600 go dtí 20,594 d'fhoghlaimeoirí ag freastal ar na Gaeltachtaí.  Aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil jab maith á dhéanamh ag na mná tí sin.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil béilí maithe curtha ar fáil do na foghlaimeoirí.  Ná déan dearmad gur chaith mise mar ógánach seal i nGaeltacht Thír Chonaill, ní i nGaoth Dobhair, mo léan, ach i Rann na Feirste, agus tá eolas agam ar na mná tí sin, chomh cumasach agus chomh maith agus atá siad do na scoláirí.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 9, 25, 53 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputies to replies to questions on 31 October and 4 December 1991.  The advice of the Attorney General has been sought as to the legislative implications of the report on my Department which was submitted to the Taoiseach by <Col N="102" /> the Efficiency Audit Group last year.  As indicated to the House on 31 October 1991 a study is under way of the administrative systems and structures in the Defence Forces.  Implementation of the report's recommendations will be pursued in the light of the outcome of that study as well as legislative amendments deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have had substantial areas of financial management delegated to them, details of which were supplied to the House on 4 December last.  These include: Defence Forces allowances of the order of £16 million per annum; local contracts for Engineer Services up to £4,000 per annum per officer; and local military commanders may draw down on running contracts for components and spare parts for vehicles, local repairs of vehicles, solid fuel, petrol, oils, food items, aircraft spares, charts, laundry and dry cleaning and disposal of unserviceable tyres, waste oil etc., placed by my Department.</P>
    <P>In addition, proposals are at an advanced stage to increase delegation in relation to the placing of local contracts by military officers.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the administration of the Defence Forces in New Zealand was examined by the Efficiency Audit Group in the context of the scrutiny of my Department; the administration of the Defence Forces in Switzerland was not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the reply of the former Minister, Deputy Daly, on 3 October last, would the Minister not accept that it is now opportune that Members be given sight of this report and an opportunity to discuss it?  Would the Minister inform the House whether the necessary legislative amendment has been prepared in draft form.  Finally, and most importantly, is the Minister aware of the considerable concern felt by the Defence Forces staff of his Department, particularly in view of the fact that his Department have a small input only in relation to the implementation of the various proposals?  Is the Minister aware of the grave concern among Members of the Defence Forces at this major change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="103" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, I am studying the position and will update overall procedures as soon as possible. The Deputy will realise that I have been only a few days in the Department.  With regard to the Deputy's question about amending legislation, that matter is with the Attorney General's Office for advice as to what must be done on foot of the relevant report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to outline to the House the number of posts nationwide which will be closed under this rationalisation programme; in particular, is he aware of the grave concern among Army personnel, particularly on the part of their families, nationwide who are fearful of being transferred from their present bases to others well removed from areas in which they have lived for quite a number of years?  Is the Minister in a position to outline in detail to the House whether there is any truth to the many rumours prevailing with regard to the closure of posts and, if so, what posts it is proposed to close?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As will be inferred from my reply, I am not in a position to state what the consideration of legislation by the Attorney General will involve.  But I can assure the Deputy that my Department will not take any action without full consultation with the new representative bodies or without taking cognisances of the humanitarian aspects of any given decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the full consultation with the representative associations, of which the Minister speaks, can he say whether a copy of the Efficiency Audit Group's report has been made available to those associations for their consideration.  Specifically, within the context of Question No. 25, can he say whether the Members of this House will be given sight of that report in the near future with a view to informing ourselves of the full implications of what is being proposed and undertaken?</P>

    <Col N="104" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that, as I study this report and familiarise myself with it, I will take all steps to ensure that the maximum amount of information is made available to Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the Efficiency Audit Group's report recommendations, would the Minister give the House an assurance that they will not be implemented in any shape or form in advance of the necessary legislation being introduced in this House and being discussed here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the logical position: one refers to the Attorney General and asks him, in the context of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1984 and the Defence Act, 1954 &mdash; what is necessary by way of legislation.  No action will be taken without the necessary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in requesting, for the third time, a copy of the Efficiency Audit Group's report which we have not had an opportunity of reading.  Is the Minister suggesting that Army barracks cannot be closed without legislation first being brought to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vitally important that serious discussions take place between all the personnel in the barracks throughout the country because closing barracks and transferring people is not a simple matter.  It is not good enough just to discuss it with the representative <Col N="105" /> bodies.  I suggest direct consultation take place between the personnel in the variousu barracks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Regular meetings are held between representatives &mdash; civil and military &mdash; of my Department and both the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association.  A wide range of matters coming within the scope of representation of the associations is dealt with at these meetings.  At a less formal level there is almost daily contact between both sides and excellent working relationships have been established with each association.</P>
      <P>I have not had a meeting with the associations since my recent appointment as Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister been made aware of the symbolic difficulties which currently exist &mdash; and which existed up to the last time his predecessor in office spoke in this House at Question Time &mdash; with regard to the refusal of the general staff commanding to allow PDFORRA members, in particular, to meet at headquarters in civilian attire? In order to break that logjam, would he consider convening an early meeting with PDFORRA at general headquarters and <Col N="106" /> inviting them to come, in the way it was always envisaged they could come to such meetings, in civilian rather than military attire?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister meets these organisations will he discuss with them, first, their lack of freedom to discuss all matters with him; second, women in the Army, as he must be aware there is grave dissatisfaction among women in relation to how they are being treated in the Army at present. The jobs being assigned to them are affecting their promotion prospects in the future and there is serious discontent in relation to that matter.  Third, will the Minister discuss with them the health and safety regulations which apply in normal practice and whether they are properly applied in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a question about women in the Defence Forces later on the Order Paper.  I am not aware there is a feeling that women are getting less than their fair due in the Army.  My view is that equality of opportunity should obtain.  I say that having studied the role of women in armies.  A friend of mine was relieved in Buchenwald by Russian infantry women after the last war. Women in the partisans in Yugoslavia also had a very fine record in the anti-Nazi movement.  There is no way we could philosophically think of them as less than equal to male soldiers.  As far as I know that is the philosophy of the Army and certainly it is the philosophy of my Department.  There are specific questions on this matter later which deal with that matter.  It was through studying those that I was assured that that was the case.  If there are individual cases of lack <Col N="107" /> of equity &mdash; equality of treatment &mdash; I would like to know about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments in relation to his attitude on equality.  I should like to inform the Minister that a macho culture exists in the Army which delineates people into certain categories and does not allow women into the combat category which, in turn, is affecting their promotion prospects.  I assume, given the Minister's reply, he will take this issue on board as a priority.</P>

In that context will he confirm that he fully endorses the philosophy behind the 1990 Act that soldiers are entitled to their representative associations and that they will be given the fullest status and accord by his Department during his term as Minister in the Department?</P>

The board, which comprised senior military officers and a civilian member, interviewed participants in the competition.</P>
      <P>The arrangements involved in the competition were worked out in the course of lengthy discussions with the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and were in line with the recommendations of the Gleeson Commission regarding promotion on merit for officers of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>That is true in regard to the recent promotions but I put it to the Minister in relation to the promotions which were made five or six months ago, from the rank of lieutenantcolonel to colonel, that different guidelines were put in place, without consultation, which were the cause of major dissatisfaction and discontent within the Defence Forces.  Seniority was not taken into account and that is not entirely the case now.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the promotions which have been made should remain unaltered and the question of reviewing promotions could not be contemplated?  Given that there is talk about guidelines and arrangements and, indeed, a reference at some stage to regulations in the Minister's earlier response, can the Minister tell us if the criteria in relation to all promotions within the commanding ranks of the Defence Forces have been reduced to written signed regulations promulgated from his office and available to all for consideration?  If that is so, will the Minister make a copy available to me or anyone who wishes to see them and, if not, will he ensure regulations set out the criteria to be used in making promotions?</P>

Given the inevitability that barracks will be closed, will the Minister agree that the better proposition and way forward is to produce a plan of rationalisation covering the whole country and which shows this is not simply a localised, piecemeal approach to the question of rationalisation? Will he also agree that it is incumbent on him to put in place in such a plan proposals for dealing with the very difficult local problems which will emerge, such as the loss of local employment and the displacement of families? Whatever comes from the Department cannot involve the simple closing of structures, it must also present proposals for alternative employment and plans for dealing with other social disruptions which will occur.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in <Col N="115" /> regard to all those implications, including the not inconsiderable one of the economic benefit of a military post in a town; indeed, the smaller the town the more traumatic it will be if the post is removed. In the short time I have had to consider the matter, I have been thinking of initiating a study into the whole situation and building decisions on an internal or external assessment of the position of the 28 barracks and military posts.  It is something I will keep in mind.</P>

Military considerations will, of course, be important and the Deputy and the House will be aware that, because of the unfortunate situation in relation to the Border, there is considerable concentration of troops in Border countries.  Solely military considerations cannot be applied to the proposed action and the thrust of suggestions from Members of the House has been that social implications, while not of paramount importance, are almost equally important to military considerations. Needless to say, the wisdom of our military authorities will be brought to bear on the matter, including that of the representative organisations.</P>

    <P>The number of actions represented by these figures was 30, 40, 55 and 74 respectively.  The expenditure was appropriated against subhead BB2 in 1988 and subhead AA2 in the remaining years. The number of cases awaiting hearing is estimated to be about 150.  Judgment is awaited in only one case.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the foregoing figures between Na Buan-Óglaigh and the First and Second Line Reserves is not readily <Col N="118" /> available but it can be stated that only a very small proportion of claims would be from members of the reserves.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Commission examined the subject of compensation for injuries sustained by members of the Permanent Defence Force in the course of duty and recommended that a scheme similar to the Garda scheme should not be introduced for the Defence Forces.  The commission did, however, consider that there may be a case for extending to the Defence Forces the same limited occupational injuries cover as applies to members of the Garda Síochána.  That matter is being examined.</P>
    <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts, a disability pension may be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force who, on retirement or discharge from the force, is found by the Army Pensions Board to be suffering from a permanent disablement of not less than 20 per cent due to a wound or injury attributable to military service.  Such a pension is payable whether the injury was accidentally or maliciously inflicted. Most disability pensions are granted in respect of accidental injuries.  The cost of such pensions in 1992 will be approximately £3.5 million.</P>

Does he not accept that when they do fundamentally the same work on behalf of the State &mdash; protect the institutions and people of the State &mdash; they should be dealt with in a similar way?  Finally, would he not accept that the system whereby every soldier who seeks compensation must heap blame on his superior officers and prove negligence has a debilitating effect on the morale of the force?

Is the Minister satisfied that Army personnel should have to pursue their cases in the civil courts when the Garda Síochána have a special facility within the force to deal with their compensation cases? What is the Minister going to do to ensure that compensation for soldiers is processed faster than has been the case in the past?  In some instances cases can be on the civil list for up to five years and, as the Minister said, there are now 150 cases awaiting hearing.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing the question and Deputy Noonan for enabling me to comment on the matter in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Greencore prospectus included the statement that the Minister had no current intention of disposing of the shares he retained after the offer for sale and that in the absence of unforeseen circumstances he would retain them for not less than two years.  There was, however, a significant change in circumstances between the time the prospectus was published in April 1991, when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> negotiations were also completed, and in January of this year when this year's budget was being finalised. In drawing up the budget it was found necessary to change the intended timing of implementation of certain elements of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The budget in addition reflects income to £53 million to be generated by asset disposal. This sum includes a figure of £35 million miscellaneous capital receipts as a target to be realised by the disposal of Greencore shares.</P>
      <P>During the last few months the Government received two separate approaches to buy part of their stake in Greencore.  In the light of the changed circumstances it was decided to investigate the feasibility of such a sale.  Legal advice was sought on the statement contained in the prospectus, and it was deemed that a sale of Greencore shares was in order at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the method of disposal, the Government were guided by the desire to minimise the impact on the market demand for Greencore shares.  The company are now reviewing their business strategy under new management and the Government did not wish to be seen to cut across any plans the company might have to raise further equity.  Furthermore, by delaying the sale of Greencore <Col N="123" /> shares to the end of the second year since March 1991 an overhang might become evident by the autumn of 1992.  Accordingly, a swift single transaction should leave market demand intact.  Furthermore, had the Government announced their intention to sell these shares in advance, the potential impact on the market would be greater and the price achieved might have been affected. No further sales of Greencore shares will take place this year.</P>
    <P>The practice followed in selling the shares was perfeclty normal and proper. A shareholder in a public listed company is free to accept an offer for the purchase of his shares.  Such an offer was made to me at a fair price and thrre was no good reason why I should reject it.  The sale took place at a discount of 3.3 per cent on the market quotation prior to sale of 4.7 per cent on yesterday's quoted price. Sale by way of placement is always on the basis of a discount and by reference to normal practice the discount granted in this case was a modest one.  There is no obligation on any shareholder, notably a major shareholder, to offer his shares for sale to a number of bidders.  Placement of shares by a major shareholder in the manner I have done is perfectly normal and accepted practice and was followed with a view to the least disruption of the market.</P>
    <P>The sale reflects the confidence of investors in the company and I am satisfied that the successful placing of this block of shares will be welcomed generally by the investing public and will underpin the value of these shares.  The new management structure which has been put in place in the company in recent months has contributed greatly to the perception of the company as having considerable potential for growth and development.  The recent annual report and accounts of the company show their financial strength.  I, like other investors, have every confidence in the future of the company.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the manner in which <Col N="124" /> he organised the sale of these shares is seen on the market in Dublin and internationally as outrageous, underhand and in bad faith?  I would put it to the Minister that the Government are not in a position similar to that of any other shareholder and that he is in clear breach of Government policy in playing favourites with this tranche of shares and not offering them at public tender.  I would further put it to the Minister that the discount of £1.87 million on yesterday's quoted price is very bad value for the taxpayer Is the Minister aware that this afternoon the shares are being sold at £2.70 each which represents a capital gain of £625,000 to IBI, the company which the Government favoured in this deal?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is an excellent price and it is holding up extremely well.  The Deputy will acknowledge that if 12.5 million shares were put on the market, from advice I have received, it would cause great disruption and whether or not we could sell them would have led to a big debate.  Second, it would have had a greater effect on the price. Therefore, it is better to deal with one reputable client who buys shares for several pension holders and holds them on the market rather than trading them.  If they were to be traded as individual shares day after day for a number of weeks it would have an adverse effect. The logic which is always followed when a large tranche of shares are sold is that they are dealt with on one exchange, particularly if the buyer is likely to hold them for a considerable length of time, which is obviously what will happen in the case of IBI who intend to hold the shares in trust for pension funds.</P>

My original intention was to hold the shares until the end of the year.  However, I was advised legally and professionally by a number of people that to do that would not result in the best price for the State and the taxpayer, but by selling them now to a reputable bidder we would get a much better financial deal, and that is what I did.</P>

In effect, the arrangement has been made between two subsidiaries of the same bank.  Now that the Minister has confirmed that before he came into the House the Reuter's price was £2.72 per share, would he agree that the discount was excessive considering that the purchase price has increased from £2.65 this morning to £2.72 at present, resulting in a profit for IBI of approximately £900,000 on this deal and that this is very bad value for the taxpayer?</P>

    <P>I would put it to the Minister that it was absolutely outrageous for himself and his Department to sell shares so close to the publication of the High Court report on the scandals in Greencore.  Considering that certain Government Ministers already have access to the information in this report, it amounts to little short of insider trading for the Government to proceed with the sale of these shares. Finally, I put it to the Minister that the commitment in the prospectus of the <Col N="126" /> company is clear-cut, that the Government had no intention of diminishing their tranche of shares and, even in changing circumstances, they had no intention of diminishing their shares within a two-year period.  A similar commitment, in exactly the same words, is given in the prospectus of Irish Life.  There is now a wide mistrust of the Government's word. As the public and the international financial community cannot trust the word of the Government I put it to the Minister that he has inflicted serious damage on the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of points.  The discount of 3.3 per cent yesterday and 4.7 per cent today is quite low and is a very attractive offer when compared with the 12 per cent difference between the price of the shares when floated last April and the price in early dealings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much lower than any price mentioned to me in discussions since budget day.  I have already said that my original intention was to hold the shares until later in the year when we would be nearer the April 1993 deadline, but I have been advised, both legally and professionally, that that was not the best deal for the taxpayer and was not the best way to handle the issue.  I absolutely refute any question of insider trading, which, if I understand Deputy Noonan correctly, he is alleging on the basis that some members of the Government &mdash; not necessarily myself, who made this decision &mdash; would have knowledge of the report.</P>
      <P>No member of the Government has knowledge of the High Court Greencore Report.  Therefore, although I accept that the Deputy is making his allegations in good faith, I presume that he will equally withdraw the allegations on the basis that no member of the Government has knowledge of the contents of the report.</P>

Could the Minister tell the House whether it is now part and parcel of Government policy to sell State assets to meet current expenditure?  Would the Minister agree that in the light of the promises made in the prospectus what has happened today has resulted in there being a whiff of financial sleaze coming from this Government?</P>

      <P>Naturally, the Government did not identify the company involved, but it was not very difficult to make a deduction; and I am sure that most people involved in the marketplace were fairly clear on it because it was mentioned to me several times at various meetings in recent weeks.  I did not confirm or deny that issue because it could have concerned other companies and it would have been wrong for me to do so.</P>
      <P>I have been advised, as I said earlier, both legally and professionally that this procedure was the best way to get the best value, as Deputy Noonan has said, for the shares.  If that amount of shares, approximately 15 per cent, were put in the open market then the recovery of price would not have been achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer Deputy Shatter's final question.  I listened carefully to the questions.  It is the policy of the Government, and it has been for several years, to sell State assets on an annual basis, apart from major sales such as the Irish Life flotation or the original Greencore flotation.  In some years those assets might be Garda houses, Army houses and so on.  At one stage my predecessor mentioned an ongoing figure of £50 million.  This year there was no other major sale.  I have to consider two particular areas.</P>
      <P>I think I have clarified what was a fair question from Deputy Noonan.  He asked me to give a clear statement and I have done so.  I have achieved the figure referred to on this sale.  I do not intend to sell either further shares in Greencore or Irish Life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to ask the Minister for Finance a supplementary question.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that the Government have effectively broken their own rules by giving privileged information to one investor to buy the shares? The Minister stated in the House today that he has done nothing wrong and that the deal represents exceptional value for the taxpayer.  Would he confirm that the Association of Investment Managers have been in contact with him today to ask him to revoke the deal?  Why would they be doing so if they felt that everything was in order and that the investment was good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to <Col N="130" /> say that it is not a question of the Government just dealing with someone on the market.  As I said in my original reply, the Government were approached by two different investors and are responding to an offer made.  Frankly, a few weeks ago I should not have thought that we would get such a good offer.  In responding to the offer made I was very careful to check both the legal and the professional advice as to whether the circumstances of budgetary matters permitted the Government to make a decision. I checked and rechecked that advice. I was advised from all quarters that this matter was not in bad faith, was not in any way legally wrong and was an acceptable practice.  I made sure of that before any decision was made.</P>

Moreover, would he not agree that concern is all the more justified by the fact that last April the Government gave their word that there would be no further sale of these shares for two years, yet only ten months have elapsed?  How can the Minister's word be trusted again?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for affording me the opportunity to refer to one further matter which I had intended to address at the outset of the debate.  I wish to let Deputies know that I intend to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment proposing increases in the maximum fines that may be imposed under the Planning Acts.  At present the <Col N="187" /> maximum fine on conviction on indictment is £10,000.  This would apply in the case of very serious offences such as carrying out development, including demolition, without the proper permission. I consider that recent events have shown that the present maximum fine may not be sufficient deterrent to developers intent on flouting the law. Accordingly, I will be proposing a new limit of £1 million.  I will propose also that the maximum fine for a summary offence should be raised from £800 to £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill is before the House, if only because it gives the House an opportunity for a wide-ranging debate on questions affecting the built environment.  It is right to have this debate in parallel with the debate on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which addresses many environmental questions but which is deficient in dealing with question on the built environment.</P>
      <P>However, this Bill as it stands is potentially unconstitutional and could worsen planning.  I welcome in principle any attempt to tighten up the time-scale for planning decisions and appeals but I strongly oppose short cuts in the planning system, and parts of this Bill are planning short cuts.  The Bill is defective in that it does not commit the necessary staff and other resources to the board to ensure that deadlines are met and therefore many time limits could be reached without the board having had time for a proper analysis.  Moreover, the rights of appeal of first, second and third parties against decisions of the local authority could in many circumstances be greatly restricted by the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to staffing and other resources for An Bord Pleanála, given the history of budgets in recent years and the sort of decisions forced on Governments to meet budgetary deadlines, just like the recent decision to prematurely sell shares in Greencore to help the budgetary arithmetic, it is entirely possible and almost likely, given the outlook <Col N="188" /> for the 1993 budget, that there will be further cutbacks in the public service.  For that reason already, many laws enacted by this House are not enforced or are inadequately enforced.  Very often lack of staff and finance is the most pressing reason why the intentions of this House are not put into effect.  It is ironic that this is happening at a time of record unemployment.  On Committee Stage I will propose amendments to ameliorate peoples' fears and to remove any constitutional doubts.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also defective in that it fails to make any provision to make An Bord Pleanála democratically accountable.  In order to achieve accountability I will propose four amendments on Committee Stage.  I will propose that a Dáil environment committee be established and that An Bord Pleanála will be subject to its scrutiny, not in relation to any specific decision but in relation to general planning policy, efficiency and fairness.  I will also propose that the board's power to initiate material contraventions of county or county borough development plans in their appeal decisions will be removed &mdash; in other words, the board will not be permitted to breach development plan zonings except in consultation with the elected local authority.  I will also propose that local authorities will be empowered by a two-thirds majority vote to require the board to appear before them and to answer questions in relation to appeal decisions in their functional areas.  I will also require the publication of the board's inspector's report on each appeal case. Those amendments to deal with An Bord Pleanála performances, and to make them more answerable, will greatly improve the planning process and public participation in planning matters.</P>
    <P>There are other defects in this Bill, particularly its failure to distinguish between routine planning applications &mdash; for instance, domestic extensions and large-scale applications for new housing or industrial estates.  The smaller applications should have less restrictive requirements applied and they should be put on a fast track.  This should be the case not only in respect of the planning <Col N="189" /> applications process but also in relation to the building by-law process or in future building regulations.  There needs to be a clear time limit and a much speedier process for these routine applications which do not cause any difficulty in the vast majority of cases.</P>
    <P>A matter which has troubled a great number of public representatives and the public at large is the suspicion of corruption in the planning process in certain areas.  It is my experience that in general the overall performance of local planning officials, the elected local authorities and An Bord Pleanála has been of a high standard but it is still open to corruption and suspicion.  The changes last year in the requirements for section 4 motions in planning and rezoning matters are an improvement, but there is still a large cloud hanging over certain decisions in certain areas in recent years.  I am surprised and disappointed that the new Minister for the Environment did not see this as an issue to be addressed in his first speech on planning and development matters.  Many of the section 4 rezonings approved by Dublin County Council up to last year have left a very poor taste. Other planning decisions, especially in Dublin but also elsewhere, have been the subject of well-informed private discussions for some time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many of those who could best give evidence of corruption in the planning process may themselves be compromised by the fact that the very nature of their best evidence would incriminate themselves.  A strong case exists for some form of amnesty power to be granted to the DPP for those guilty of minor planning corruption as a tradeoff for substantial evidence of more serious planning corruption.  I would urge the Minister to consider this point for inclusion on Committee Stage.  I do not wish to dwell any further on this matter, except to say that the recent spate of public scandals has seriously undermined public confidence in our political and administrative process.  One of the key areas in which there has been a `drip drip' effect of well-founded suspicion is the area of planning decisions and appeals, <Col N="190" /> material contraventions and some zoning decisions.  I hesitate to propose a commission of inquiry because of the cost and the ineffectiveness of that mode of operations but we should consider an amnesty in return for evidence.</P>
    <P>The decision to impose a five-year limit on the life of any planning application was generally welcomed.  It had the benefit of encouraging early development and discouraging on going dereliction and undeveloped sites.  However, it has also been grossly unfair and unjust in a particular type of case about which I have received correspondence and representations from all parts of the country. It is particularly unfair in the case of less well-off people who may have bought a site and been unable to raise the money to build a house within the five-year limit. Such people lose their planning permission in that case.  Their inability to build may have been due to the loss of a job, for example.  The expiry of the planning permission has been a severe penalty for many people.  I know several people who are in severe financial difficulties. They raised money to buy a site in the expectation that they would soon be able to raise further funds to build a house, but they found that because of changes in agricultural incomes or loss of employment they were not in a position to proceed.  They then lost the planning permission.  Sometimes they were refused permission on reapplication because of a change of heart on the part of the planners.  Most of the sites in question had been acquired at a price which took into account the planning permission; they were sold at the development price rather than the agricultural price.  There is an injustice in these instances and accordingly I intend to propose an amendment on Committee Stage which in the case of single house developments would reinstate the validity of any planning permission extant at any time in the past ten years or a further period of two years from the enactment of this legislation in order to allow the aggrieved parties one further opportunity to retrieve this loss.  I hope the Minister will accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> There has been a great deal of discussion during the past six or nine months on the role of local authorities.  We had the Bill recognising local authorities which purported to delegate more power to local authorities, to remove the <i>ultra vires</i> rule, to give them a representational role and to move decision-making to the lowest level.  Fine Gael have argued persistently that unless we delegate fund raising powers we cannot delegate real powers.  The two are inextricably bound and governed by the principle that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  I am very strongly committed, as are Fine Gael, to the principle of delegating downwards decision-making powers.  That includes the delegation of discretion in relation to the rate support grant, the road fund grant and the national lottery grant.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Government have taken on board our proposal that national lottery grants should be made <i>en bloc</i> to local authorities to permit the disbursal of those grants locally at the discretion of the authority.  I very much favour that trend.  It is the sort of policy which, if pursued fully, would liberate the local authorities and transform them from generally inert bodies to dynamic entities which would further the regrowth of this economy and society.</P>
    <P>The principle that local people should have local power over local matters is crucial in all aspects of local government but particularly in relation to planning matters.  I proposed earlier that An Bord Pleanála should be accountable or answerable in some democratic way, but there is a great need to take further steps to permit maximum participation by local people in local planning matters. There is a need to improve public awareness of planning application and appeals which potentially affect them. The provision of the Bill are inadequate in that respect.  I propose that, in future, local authorities be required to publish each week, a full list of all planning applications received, in the same newspapers, and in a fixed place so that people will know where to look for the list of planning applications.  I also propose <Col N="192" /> that clearly visible signs of a standard design and lay-out, be posted at all entrances to buildings or sites, the subject of such planning applications or appeals, that such signs be put in place for a fixed period, of a determined size, so that they cannot be mistaken.</P>
    <P>We must remember that local authorities constitute the principle vehicles of our planning laws.  Yet much of the worst dereliction in many of our cities and towns derives from two factors, one, long term road plans or aspirations of local authority officials and, second, from the lack of any pro-active development unit within such local authorities.  Indeed these are specifications one might well have expected would be included in any planning and development Bill.</P>
    <P>I have in mind in particular Dublin but these comments apply equally to other cities and towns.  For example, the Dublin quays, from the East Link Bridge to Heuston Station could form a magnificent spine right across the city centre which, properly planned and developed, could transform our city in every respect.</P>
    <P>When our party were in Government we introduced the Urban Renewal Bill, 1986, since enacted, whose provisions designated large stretches of the quays for redevelopment.  Unfortunately, the provisions of that Bill did not go far enough.  Admittedly, at the same time, we established the Metropolitan Streets Commission, giving them the task of uplifting the cross spine of the city, from O'Connell Street, across by D'Olier Street and Westmoreland Street up to Grafton Street.  Regrettably that commission were abolished by the incoming minority Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 so that the very good work in train was halted in its tracks.</P>
    <P>The continued dereliction of Dublin's quays must be a matter of the gravest public concern to all who live in or love Dublin.  It is true to say that the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act led to a certain amount of development along the quays, some individual developments not at all bad in their own right.  Such has been that development, which covers a small portion of the quays only, it has <Col N="193" /> been unco-ordinated, no one building co-ordinated with the adjoining one, no overall theme or style to the quays; it is a hotch-potch.  A major opportunity was lost, with the implementation of the provisions of the Urban Renewal Act and the establishment of the Metropolitan Streets Commission, not to require one or other of them, or both, to seek an overall design for the city's quays running from Heuston Station to the East Link Bridge accompanied by a pro-active planning and development unit within Dublin Corporation or, by way of the reinstatement of the Metropolitan Streets Commission, to seek developers to put such plans into effect.  Apart from grand schemes for locations such as Dublin's quays &mdash; and there will be other places in Dublin and other cities and towns where that sort of co-ordinated plan or internationally-competitive design will be required if we are to maximise the potential transformation of our cities and towns &mdash; there are smaller areas in need of pro-active development to be undertaken by such a unit within respective local authorities.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks I walked about certain parts of my constituency of Dublin Central with residents and planning officials of Dublin Corporation.  It is a very historic part of the city, where residents for five, six or more generations are interspersed with small factories, old mills and the like, interspersed also with many derelict buildings and undeveloped sites.  Those undeveloped buildings and sites are owned by different people, many of whom do not have much means and, even when they have, the development of one small site in their ownership might not make much financial sense to them, so the dereliction continues.  I have inquired of Dublin Corporation, at the planning committee meetings which I attend, of planning officials privately and of the urban renewal section thereof in their development unit, whether there is anybody &mdash; and I am thinking now of the area of Kilmainham in particular &mdash; saying: &ldquo;This is what we want for Kilmainham: to blend in with the Royal <Col N="194" /> Hospital, with Kilmainham Jail, with Kilmainham Tower, with Islandbridge House and the approaches to the quays; this is highly desirable; that is what we want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such officials should consult with owners of such properties in an endeavour to persuade them to agree to such plans and their promotion.  Unfortunately, no such unit exists, no such official exists in the planning department of Dublin Corporation.  They do not have somebody who could even conceive such an overall development plan for an area and promote it.  Rather it is left to individual planning applications.  Almost always, when planning applications are lodged for neighbouring sites they are absolutely unrelated.  Usually this means that there will be a house of one design right beside another of a totally different design, a house with one facade right beside another with a totally different facade; one house built with, say, a reddish-type brick right beside another with a yellowish-type brick, a hotch-potch, resulting from poor planning.  The individual buildings will have reasonable merit in their own right but, once one is faced with varying planning applications in respect of many neighbouring sites, the final impact on any one area can leave much to be desired.</P>
    <P>It will clearly be seen there is a need for a pro-active development unit within local authorities.  I propose that such units be incorporated in the provisions of this Bill. I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage, giving local authorities not only a role but a duty to take a pro-active stance in planning matters and, where appropriate &mdash; for instance in the case of Dublin's quays &mdash; to have an overall design objective.  Members might think this is pie in the sky but I might add that this is not new thinking.  For example, in past centuries the Wide Streets Commission were established, whose role was to achieve just this type of overall effect or design for our city.  Indeed many of our Georgian squares and wider boulevards, now such a treasured part of our city, were achieved by those Wide Streets Commissioners.  We had a similar role in <Col N="195" /> mind when we established the Metropolitan Streets Commission in 1986.  The only valid criticism of their establishment was that we were taking that role away from the local authority.  I would argue strongly the urgent need to have the idea of the Metropolitan Streets Commission embedded in our planning laws, indeed in the psyche and conception of the role of our planning officials.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some other matters in the planning sphere before dealing with the points made by the Minister for the Environment.  As I said, a central theme of Fine Gael local government policy is the restoration of power and influence over planning matters to local people.  Otherwise the quality of such people's lives could be seriously affected in ways they cannot influence or redress.  On the other hand, Fine Gael are conscious that there can be vexatious objections to planning proposals.  We do not intend to promote, encourage or facilitate vexatious opposition to proposals which are entirely within good planning, zoning and environmental norms.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, apart from advertising much more widely planning applications, decisions and appeals, should be required to have the services of architects with the relevant specialist knowledge to improve design and appearance factors and to deal with planning applications at different levels.  Frequently local authorities do not have the necessary architectural expertise on their staff, or available to them, to have an adequate conception of what is needed in particular areas in order to vet planning applications. Sometimes they will need specialist architectural advice particularly in the area of environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>We have to differentiate between the requirements of historic parts of our cities and towns and those of other parts of the town and the countyside.  Different factors can and do apply in these cases. We must have a heritage and cultural dimension to our planning decisions, which is not always the case in the current <Col N="196" /> process.  It is necessary to import recognition of cultural and historic factors into the planning process.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for pro-active units to encourage improvement in the appearance of urban areas or schemes for city quays.  Anyone going out to the villages of Dublin will see the disparate shop fronts: nice wooden signs here and plastic signs there a proliferation of which has destroyed the appearance of many old historic and beautiful villages.  I have already cited Kilmainham, an historic village with buildings going back to Viking times and beyond.  Not only has my own village of Inchicore been destroyed by heavy traffic &mdash; which we are trying to deal with &mdash; but it also has absolutely unco-ordinated shop front design.  The local authorities should have the powers and a duty to go out to the local communities and say: here is what this place looks like at present and here are some designs of how we think it could be improved.  We want to encourage you over, say, the next three years to improve your shop premises or perhaps industrial premises and sometimes households, so that the whole appearance of a particular place can be either restored or transformed. That is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I proposed at Dublin City Council that we have a development action plan for the Inchicore area to achieve this type of development but I find that the local authority have no role in the matter.  It will take six to eight months to have the main points of an action plan drawn up. Thereafter there is no power to require shopkeepers or householders to meet the requirements, there are no funds available, and there is no belief among planning officials that it is any of their business.  Yet if there is no co-ordinating body, nobody with a clear view of what should be done, individuals will go away and do their own thing and that is what has happened.  Consequently many of the villages of Dublin have been destroyed, for example, Rathmines, Terenure, Coolock, Phibsboro, Drumcondra and Ringsend.  Yet, there are individual developments which are magnificent.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing that we have for all <Col N="197" /> the villages of Dublin a grandiose plan such as that for the Temple Bar area. Were it not for the co-ordinating body that exists in Temple Bar the resurgence of Temple Bar would not be possible.  We need that general approach, albeit on a smaller scale, to reinstate the villages of Dublin and we need a plan to divert traffic out of them.  As chairman of the traffic committee of Dublin Corporation I am aware that many plans are in hand to try to reduce traffic flows but we also need a pro-active planning approach so that we can say to people: I know you have no plans to develop your shop or change it but we invite you to a meeting where you can examine our plans and if you agree with them we may aid and assist you in the design to meet with our requirements becaused we believe it is in the common interest.</P>
    <P>A clear plan is needed for the improvement of streetscapes in our city centres and suburban villages.  A vital part of urban environmental improvement is the removal of the tattiness in the built environment, the removal of the shutters that deface so many of our shops and industrial buildings.  This will not happen unless there is a clear plan.  I will be asking the Minister on Committee Stage to consider imposing this as a duty on local authorities and to provide incentives for property owners to participate in urban improvement.  This is not a matter I am speaking about for the first time but one I have already included in the published Fine Gael plans for local government and for Dublin.  It is a matter I shall be pursuing at each Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Last year I tabled a planning and development Bill which is on the Order Paper.  I intend to put down the proposals contained in that Bill as amendments to the Bill now before the House.  This is the type of Bill on which the Minister should indicate a willingness to accommodate amendments from the Opposition, apart from minor ones.  He should show himself as being ready and willing to enter into discussions with the parties in this House and with groups outside the House who have an interest in the environment and in planning matters for <Col N="198" /> example, An Taisce, with a view to arriving at a consensus on the planning process so that when the Bill is enacted we will have achieved a great improvement in the planning code.</P>
    <P>I read with great interest the observations of An Taisce on this Bill.  They are concerned that it may be unconstitutional and have prepared a detailed submission which they have forwarded to the Minister, myself and, I am sure, other Deputies.  I propose to have discussions with An Taisce in regard to their detailed observations and to the amendments which they propose should be made to the Bill prior to Committee Stage.  One of the questions they dealt with was the question of staff resources to which I referred earlier in my contribution.</P>
    <P>In order to protect the board against cutbacks that may be made in the future it may well be necessary for us in amending the Bill to remove whatever authority the Minister for the Environment has to make appointments to the board, who, like so many other State bodies, have to get the go ahead to hire staff. Provision will have to be made to ensure that the board not only have adequate staff but that they are of sufficient quality and competent to deal briskly and effectively with the matters before them.</P>
    <P>It is the fear of An Taisce and so many other bodies that the time limits imposed in the Bill will lead to bad planning and the granting of planning permission by default due to the lack of adequate resources to carry out adequate analysis of the proposal within the prescribed time.  That cannot be the intention nor should it be the effect of this Bill.  That is one of the central criticisms and we owe it to the country to carefully analyse the Bill and to try to improve it on Committee Stage.  I will address this point at that stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise another matter which was decided on in the High Court a few years ago.  The decision made was that the time limits laid down in the Planning Acts apply from the time the person concerned receives notice of the local authority's decision, even though the local authority may have made their <Col N="199" /> decision some time before.  For instance, the local authorities normally send their planning decisions to the relevant parties by registered post; but, because of the possibility of delays in delivering post, strikes, and that the person concerned may be away for a few days, the High Court decided in the Feeney case that the time limit runs from the time the person actually receives notice.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that we would have tried to clarify the position in this Bill.  I would have thought also that the local authority had given due notice to the person concerned by sending the letter by registered post.  Perhaps we could add on two days for posting, but it seems there is a need to clarify when the time limit commences and ends.  This could be a great loophole in that a person could be away on holidays to avoid receiving notice from the local authorities. That is a defect.  It should be adequate to send the notice by registered post, by courier or some other clearly defined method.  The matter should be clarified in the legislation.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the time limit in respect of decisions made by An Bord Pleanála runs from the time they make their decisions, not from the time the local authorities are informed of the board's decision.  Therefore the provisions of the law are inconsistent and this needs to be changed.  The provisions in relation to giving the local authorities notice should be clarified so that the time limit runs from the time that they receive notice rather than from the time the board make their decision.  If a secretary is out sick, if there is an oversight or a delay, the gap between the time the decision is made and is notified to the local authorities could be quite significant.</P>
    <P>Given that we are trying to tighten up the times within which decisions have to be made, which I agree with, this is an area of the Bill which needs to be tightened. That is a valid criticism.  If we expect the local authorities to react within a specified time we need to make sure that they receive the material from <Col N="200" /> An Bord Pleanála and that the time ticks away from the time they receive it.  They should receive notice as soon as feasible from the time the decision is made by the board.  Again, this brings us back to the question of staff, which is not dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of some concern that people continually flout the planning laws.  I had hoped that any new legislation dealing with planning and development would empower the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to take into account the bona fides and the track record of planning applicants.  For instance, there is a number of well known developers who keep setting up new companies to construct new developments and whose past developments are nothing short of a disgrace.  People who are well known have left housing estates unfinished or in a very poor state so that many years will elapse before the local authority will be able to take those estates in charge.  Furthermore, promises made to house purchasers in regard to open spaces and other matters are completely ignored once they move in and pay over the price of the house.  There is a small group of people who will then move on to a new development under a new company name and deal with the same planning officials. These officials are aware of the track record of these people but they are not empowered to take that track record into account in coming to planning decisions. This is a major omission.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that our planning laws are effective and that a coach and four cannot be driven through our planning laws by unscrupulous developers. Some of these unscrupulous developers are very close to the planning corruption about which I spoke earlier.  Many of their deeds and-or omissions have caused a great deal of heartache and annoyance for many householders.  I hope that it will be possible for us on Committee Stage to improve the Bill by permitting the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to take the suitability and track records of applicants for planning permission into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Killinarden is a Dublin Corporation estate in Tallaght where people got together some years back and, by dint of very great local effort, collected money and organised the building of their own community hall.  This was a rare enough event in Dublin city and county, for residents of a corporation estate to be able to do this.  However, they have a great sense of local pride and tremendous effort and endeavours were employed.  The Killinarden parish community council duly opened their hall a couple of years ago.  They do wonderful work, they run advice services, help the people of the area, run social functions and youth functions and employ people on SES schemes.</P>
      <P>Certain disturbing events took place there on Tuesday, 14 January 1992. According to the information furnished to me, at about 9.30 a.m. some ten members of the Garda Síochána Special Branch raided the Killinarden parish community hall, some of them openly carrying Uzi submachine guns.  They produced a search warrant which indicated that the search was being carried out under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.  In the community hall on the occasion there were three members taking part in a special employment scheme of the Department of Labour in addition to a few members of the parish community council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the special employment scheme workers was extremely shocked when she saw an armed man going to the pool room where she was sweeping up and closing the door behind him.  Despite her request the armed officer gave the woman no explanation as to who he was or what he was doing.  The member of the council present &mdash; and who saw the warrant &mdash; said that there was no need for the Garda Special Branch officers to openly display <Col N="202" /> their weapons and requested that they be put away.  However, this request was ignored.</P>
    <P>A general search of the community centre ensued; the officers did not search the shower area where chairs were stacked, not, for some inexplicable reason, a number of lockers.  However, they searched through certain private papers relating to certain individuals in the community.  As I said, the community council operate an advice service and would have documents and papers relating to the private affairs of individuals. I am informed that these papers were examined although they are the property of the local community council.</P>
    <P>The whole episode lasted approximately 40 minutes and the whole community council committee are appalled at this sinister development.  They are ordinary, local, hardworking people, virtually all of whom I have known for many years, dedicated to local community work and, as far as I know, have no criminal or political involvement.  The members of the community council feel that there has been an ongoing campaign over the last few months by certain members of the Garda Special Branch who pay visits to some members of the community council and to members of other committees in the area.</P>
    <P>Shortly before the events which I have narrated, three young children going into the centre were approached and questioned about meetings held in it and about who the committee members are, although these matters are all above board as the members are elected at annual general meetings in the normal way.  The residents of this corporation estate feel that they are being intimidated; they promote, in accordance with the requirements of their constitution the general, social and economic interests of the people in all things for the attainment of those objects.  The committee are nonpolitical, the information they acquire is confidential and nothing of any substance was discovered.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Garda have their job to do, they indicate that information had <Col N="203" /> been passed to them, but very often information is passed on a mischievous basis and it is a sad day when hard working local members of a corporation estate feel intimidated by members of the Garda Síochána.  I express the strong and sincere hope to the Minister that he will ensure the pressure and intimidation which they feel is dissipated and discontinued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Taylor, I am familiar with the Killinarden community centre and its operations.  I agree with the views expressed by my colleague in the constituency, Deputy Taylor, regarding the efficient centre and the excellent contribution it has made over the years to the development of the Killinarden parish area, which is very substantial.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has been informed by the Garda authorities that the search in question was carried out by members from Tallaght Garda station and members of the Special Detective Unit in accordance with the law and was duly authorised by a warrant issued under section 29 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It has never been the practice to disclose the specific information available to the Garda which causes such a warrant to be issued and, as the Deputy will appreciate, there are very good reasons for that.  The basis on which a warrant can be issued is set out in the relevant provision of the 1939 Act which specifies generally that such warrants may be issued where a senior Garda officer is satisfied that there is reasonable grounds for believing that evidence relating to the commission of certain serious offences is to be found in a particular building or place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has also been informed by the Garda authorities that, prior to the search being carried out, the caretaker of the premises was asked to attend to open the building.  After the search had been completed, the chairman of the parish community council, who had arrived on the scene, was asked if <Col N="204" /> he had any complaints about the way in which the search had been conducted. He replied to the effect that he had no complaints but that he objected to the search itself.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Garda in Tallaght have regular meetings with representatives of the Killinarden parish community council to discuss matters of mutual interest related to policing.  The subject of this search was raised at a meeting on 15 February when objections were made to the fact that gardaí engaged in the search were armed and that their weapons were visible.  The Garda undertook to consider the various points made and to respond at a suitable opportunity and I think it is appropriate that the considered Garda response take place in that regular and agreed forum.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the Garda Síochána Complaints Board were established by law to investigate complaints by members of the public against the Garda Síochána.  If persons concerned about the issues raised by the Deputy are alleging Garda misconduct in the way the search was carried out then the board will consider that complaint if it is brought to their attention in writing, by calling to their offices or by informing the Garda. The Minister for Justice cannot pass on a complaint to the board on a person's behalf as it is a condition of the relevant legislation that the complaint must be made in one of the ways described.  Of course, any such complaint must relate to alleged misconduct on the part of the Garda and not merely to the fact that they were carrying out their duty in accordance with the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the inadequate and dangerous conditions prevailing in Crinkle national school, Birr, County Offaly.  The school has a large number of major structural defects. The prefabs at the school are in a particularly bad condition.  The windows in one of the prefabs are rotten, with holes <Col N="205" /> under the window sills.  The roof is leaking in several places, the doors are rotten and emergency repairs have had to be carried out.  The walls of the building are dangerous and there are numerous holes in different parts of the walls.  During heavy rain the teacher has to collect the water in buckets and basins.  Water is running down the walls beside electric wires and a builder has warned of the danger of the collapse of the roof.</P>
      <P>The prefabs and the school itself are inadequately furnished and the furniture is in a very bad condition.  Toilet facilities are totally insufficient and of a very poor quality.  The school lacks basic hygiene in terms of toilet facilities, drinking water, hot water for washing, etc.  There is no adequate storage space for equipment. Because of dampness, the equipment frequently cannot be used in classes.</P>
      <P>Crinkle school was originally built to accommodate 90 pupils.  Today there are 170 pupils in attendance, and all the classrooms are grossly overcrowded. Playing facilities are practically nonexistent. The concrete in the yard is very dangerous as it is subsiding and is worn in many places.  The playing area is mucky and dirty and it is impossible for children to keep their clothes clean because of the damp and muck.</P>
      <P>I first raised this matter with the then Minister for Education on 18 October 1989.  I put down a question to her on 24 October 1989 and a further question on 14 February 1990.  I continually kept in touch with the Minister to highlight the serious problems in the school.</P>
      <P>The parents, teachers and pupils are anxious to retain their school in Crinkle. While the physical condition of the school has been particularly bad, through a combination of excellent teachers and population growth the school has been quite successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in proceeding with this extension and renovation of the school has been, and continues to be, a matter of major concern to the parents, pupils and teachers.  Right through the intervening period I have kept this matter to the forefront with the Department of <Col N="206" /> Education on a continuous and regular basis.</P>
    <P>Following this continuous pressure, I was delighted and pleased for everybody concerned when on 30 April 1991 I received a letter from the then Minister for Education, paragraph 2 of which stated: &ldquo;tender documents have been completed for the scheme and I am glad to inform you that I have now approved the invitation of tenders&rdquo;.  I was equally pleased to learn that Crinkle got the go-ahead in the 1991 allocation, according to an article in the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of 11 May 1991.</P>
    <P>What concerns me now is why the money that was allocated in 1991 for Crinkle national school was not spent on the work at that school.  Can the Minister explain why moneys which were specifically allocated for Crinkle national school were not spent on the school?  I consider it grossly unfair that money which were allocated for Crinkle were obviously spent elsewhere.  Why was Crinkle so badly treated?  It is the duty of the Minister to explain what happened.</P>
    <P>The people of Crinkle have been most tolerant, patient and understanding, but enough is enough.  They are not prepared to allow a further year pass without a contract being placed immediately and the work commenced.</P>
    <P>Matters have come to a head in the school.  The children and teachers had to evacuate the school following an invasion of rats and mice.  In fact, a mouse ran up one school girl's clothes and bit her.  She developed a rash from this bite.  This is an indication of just how bad the problem is.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Deputy Davern, read a list of the schools on which money had been spent.  Even though £20 million was spent by him in one day and a long list of schools was mentioned, Crinkle national school was not referred to; he merely said that it may be included in the list of projects. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister here this evening to confirm once and for all (1) if moneys have been allocated in the £20 million sanctioned for school building work on <Col N="207" /> 10 February, (2) when one of the tenders which have already been examined in the Department will be approved and (3) when work will commence on Crinkle school.  Planning permission is in order, parish funds are available and everything possibly required from the parents has been properly and efficiently looked after.  The parents, pupils and teachers in Crinkle are awaiting a reply from the Minister.  I put it to the Minister that the people of Crinkle demand that construction work start immediately to ensure that these 170 students and their teachers do not have to spend another winter in conditions which are so appalling that they resemble a Third World country rather than Ireland in 1992.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments. I wish them every luck.  I assure both of them that they will have the good wishes of the people of Crinkle if they proceed with the construction of Crinkle school immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Aylward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his very kind remarks.  I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's intentions in relation to the proposed extension and improvements to Crinkle national school, Birr, County Offaly.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to acknowledge what the Deputy has said in relation to the conditions at the school.  I accept fully that conditions are not satisfactory and that the provision of the extension and associated improvements is fully warranted and is now an urgent matter.  The Deputy has covered much of the detail in relation to the existing facilities which consist of a permanent building containing three classrooms and two prefabricated units. I am also aware of the concerns of the chairperson of the board of management, the teachers and parents who have been in constant contact with my Department in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> As a response, my Department have received and examined tenders for the project, which consists of three standard classrooms, a general purposes room, which will be funded locally, a teachers' room, essential improvements to the existing building, the provision of a ball court and staff car parking.  I am confident that when the project is completed it will be a source of great pride to all concerned in Crinkle.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the delays in planning.  I acknowledge that there have been delays, but I am sure he will appreciate that the whole process of architectural planning, securing of planning permission, invitation of tenders and their examination is necessarily time consuming. He will also appreciate that some of these arrangements are outside the control of my Department.  There is also the important factor that there is a large number of primary school projects on hand and each school makes the case to my Department that their case is worthy of priority.  In the present circumstances where there are scarce financial and manpower resources I think the Deputy will accept that some delay is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The present position is that tenders have been received and examined for the project.  As the Deputy is aware, a capital provision for the scheme has been made in this year's allocation for primary school buildings.  The next stage is the collection of the local contribution from the school authorities.  My Department will be in touch with the chairperson in this regard at an early date.  On receipt of the local contribution, the formal arrangements for the placing of the contract will be put in hands.</P>
    <P>I know all involved locally will expect from me this evening an indication as to when building works will actually commence. However, as there is a large number of formalities still to be gone through I am unable at this point to give a precise date for the commencement of the work.  Nevertheless, I can assure the Deputy and all concerned that the further procedures will be concluded with the minimum of delay.  I have no doubt that <Col N="209" /> the patience and the undoubted commitment of the school authorities and parents will be rewarded by the presence of the builders on site in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I regret very much having to use what might seem to some people as an extreme way of trying to resolve what is in the first instance a parochial but nonetheless important matter.  I equally regret having to raise this matter in the House because the school involved, Greendale community school, is renowned for its achievements not only in education and sport but also as the school in which Mr. Doyle, the author and scriptwriter of the film &ldquo;The Commitments&rdquo; and his colleague, Mr. Mercier, teach.</P>
      <P>In May last year the school took a decision, which was ultimately confirmed in June, to suspend three pupils.  One of them was readmitted in September but the other two are spending their time sitting on street corners with nowhere to go and no prospect of education.  The school simply will not listen to their case.</P>
      <P>I wrote first to the principal of the school on 4 July 1991 asking simply to meet with him and the board of management to try to resolve the matter, but I was refused this request.  I wrote to the then Minister for Education on 18 October of last year asking her to investigate the matter.  I appreciate that since then there have been two changes in the Department of Education, but my simple achievements to date have been to receive three acknowledgments from two Ministers indicating that the matter would be investigated.  Throughout all of this time the pupils are sitting on the street corner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts simply surround an allegation of stone throwing in the school in April of 1991.  It is alleged that a stone or stones were thrown at a teacher's motor car.  A separate and unrelated incident is alleged to involve the use of bad language by a number of pupils.  Five students were <Col N="210" /> accused of being involved not specifically in any one of the two incidents but in the crowd from which the trouble emanated on both occasions.  They were brought before the board of management, and they denied all knowledge of or involvement in the two incidents.  However, the board of management and the principal took a different attitude.  In a letter to the parents of the pupils the principal of the school stated:</P>
    <P>I said that [name of student] was in the group which threw the stones and shouted the abuse.  Whether or not he is innocent, he certainly knows who is guilty.  By identifying the guilty party or parties he would help establish his own claimed innocence. </P>
    <P>That is inverting the process of accusation and proof in terms of fair procedures. The approach of the principal and the board of management appears to be that by bringing the pupils before them they would attempt to establish the full facts, not necessarily prove the case against them.</P>
    <P>The pupils were brought before a board of management meeting on 25 or 26 May and were suspended for a period of two weeks.  They were then paraded before their own class, told that they would be held on probation for that period and that they would have to carry a tally book that would be marked each time they passed a teacher in the corridor. Subsequently at a meeting on 24 June at which the pupils were not present and to which they were not allowed make representations, three of the pupils were suspended without further notice.  One of these pupils has been readmitted but the other two remained suspended. Despite all the efforts on my part in my contact with the principal of the school and the Department I have made no progress, and the two pupils concerned want to go back to school.</P>
    <P>The penalties imposed, even if the facts were proved, are wholly inappropriate and excessive in the circumstances.  The two pupils who now stand penalised, aged 15 and 16 years, are without schooling. They should not be left standing on <Col N="211" /> the street with no prospects of education. There is a total departure in this case from the recognised procedures laid down in guidelines by the Department as to how to deal with disciplinary matters. There seems to be a history in the school of taking a rather heavy-handed attitude to discipline on occasions.  Finally, there has been a total denial of the right to be heard.  The alleged witnesses to these events were never produced.  Mr. Doyle, one of the alleged complainants confirmed to the principal outside of the meeting that he was not in a position to name anyone involved in the bad language incident.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister cannot dictate to any principal of a school as to what he or she should do.  However, I am asking him to intervene and try to resolve this problem which is utterly ridiculous and totally untenable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries in this matter and understand that following the suspension of the three pupils in question by the school principal they were reinstated on Monday, 13 May 1991 on a trial basis.  Despite repeated warnings the disruptive behaviour continued, and since it was interfering with the progress of other pupils in the school, the board of management were obliged to expel the pupils concerned.</P>
      <P>The general position is that the day-to-day running of community schools, including such matters as discipline, is a matter for the school principal and the board of management.  Section 10 (2) of the Article of Management in the school's deed of trust provides for the suspension or dismissal of pupils by the school principal subject to the approval of the board of management.  Guidelines on discipline were issued to all post-primary schools in 1988.  These guidelines indicate that school management are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of discipline applies in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1991 a further circular was issued by my Department containing <Col N="212" /> guidelines towards a positive policy for school behaviour and discipline.  I am satisfied that the correct procedures were followed in this case and that the action taken was appropriate.  An offer of counselling and advice was made by the school to the parents of one of the dismissed pupils, and the school's career guidance counsellor is prepared to meet the pupil's parents with a view to advising on the options available in regard to his future education and training.</P>
    <P>I understand that the secretary of the board of management has written to Deputy McCartan explaining the position. However, in view of what the Deputy has said here and the concern expressed by him, I will have the matter further investigated and will report back to him as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter this evening and to congratulate the newly appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs who is present in the House for this short debate.  His long overdue promotion is much welcomed and acclaimed throughout the country. The Government's gain in this instance is the loss to Comhchoiste na Gaeilge on which he served as a distinguished chairman for the past year or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to reduce by 75 per cent the grant payable to voluntary and charitable organisations in the United States working with Irish immigrants will have disastrous repercussions on the services available to young Irish immigrants throughout the United States.  Such a drastic reduction from £200,000 to £50,000 per annum at this time is incomprehensible.  We all know of the severe economic depression throughout the United States at present, with employment almost impossible to obtain, low wages and increasing living and accommodation expenses.  There was <Col N="213" /> never a greater need for the services provided by these organisations and indeed never was the demand greater.</P>
    <P>This afternoon I had discussions with the project Irish Outreach Catholic Charities in New York who confirmed to me that they are receiving on average between 300 and 400 new callers per month.  This organisation has been in receipt of $70,000 per annum from the fund to finance the extremely valuable service they provide.  If the grant is reduced, much of their work will be severely curtailed and our emigrants will be the ultimate sufferers and losers.  The same fate awaits every other organisation engaged in this type of work throughout the United States.</P>
    <P>It is generally expected that the situation could deteriorate in the future, with 16,000 Morrison visas per annum being granted over the next three years. At this time we should be increasing the allocation to meet the extra demands being made on the organisation in the United States.  If this cut is implemented many of the people working on behalf of our emigrants will be made redundant. We have already failed our people by being unable to provide employment at home.  Let us not fail them again.  Our assistance is urgently required.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision and to not only restore the fund to its original level of £200,000 per annum but to substantially increase it to meet the greater and more urgent demands being made on it.</P>

      <P>From poacher to gamekeeper. I am most grateful for the Chair's kind remarks.  I thank Deputy McGinley, an old parliamentary friend, for his kind remarks, too.  They are much appreciated. In my role as chairman of Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge I always received valuable and valued assistance <Col N="214" /> and guidance from the Deputy in his capacity as vice-chairman.</P>
      <P>I realise the Deputy's deep concern on matters regarding emigrants.  With that in view, I asked my Department to prepare a statement in reply to the Deputy's concern.  It may be a statement that the Deputy considers to be less than hopeful but it should be helpful.  I first remind the Deputy that my predecessor responded to the matter on 29 January, when a similar question was raised.</P>
      <P>The reduction the Government have been obliged to make in the allocation is, as the Deputy will agree, primarily a reflection on the current budgetary position. I am conscious of the very worthwhile work being done by various emigrant groups in the United States and I have every confidence that the moneys made available by the Government are being wisely and well spent.  It would certainly be a cause of regret if the reduction in the grant level were to lead to cutbacks in the services provided by those groups.  I assure the Deputy that the welfare of our emigrants will continue to be a Government priority and that every effort will be made to ensure that their welfare concerns will continue to be met.  With that in mind, the Government will be keeping the position in the United States under very close review.</P>
      <P>When discussing this issue we should not overlook the major improvement in the position of many of our emigrants in the US as a result of the introduction of the Morrison visas in particular.  Many of the out of status emigrants are now able to adjust their status to that of permanent resident and others going to the US for the first time will have the right of full permanent residency from the date of their arrival.  As a result of those improvements, I am hopeful that over time there may be an easing of the need for the services provided by the various groups active on behalf of emigrants. That said, however, I reiterate the Government's intention to monitor the position closely.  If problems do arise, I would very much hope that the Government will be in a position to take corrective action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> In that regard, I had a meeting with the new Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs who has been charged, and has very kindly accepted responsibility for the emigrant problem as it relates to the Department.  I am sure Deputy McGinley will have close contact with the new Minister in relation to the responsibilities with which he has been charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Andrews on being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In my opinion, his appointment was long overdue. I wish him every success for the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk about the issue of cross-Border roads.  I have raised the issue in both Houses of the Oireachtas on numerous occasions since being elected.</P>
      <P>Leitrim is the only Border county that has no direct access into Northern Ireland.  At present there are 12 crossings between Leitrim and County Fermanagh but, unfortunately, none is opened.  One crossing in particular, between Rossinver and Garrison, would be of great benefit to the area if it was opened.  The British Government have on occasions said that none of those crossings is to be opened for security reasons.  I wish to point out to the Minister that the most recent serious crime to occur in that area was in 1972 in Garrison, when paramilitaries carried out an execution.  No serious crime has happened in the area since then.  We are all aware of the appalling atrocities that have been carried out in Northern Ireland since that time.</P>
      <P>An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Tuesday, 12 March 1990 under the heading, &ldquo;Where all Roads Lead to Ghost Towns&rdquo; sums up the economic situation of both County Leitrim and County Fermanagh, which border one another.  The small villages have been denuded of people and lack economic development.  For those reasons, I am very anxious that some progress be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister will be attending an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting in <Col N="216" /> the near future and I should be grateful if he would raise the matter again.  I know the Minister's predecessors raised the matter.  I should also like the Minister to report back on any progress made.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his kind remarks in respect of my position, which I much appreciate. I have great regard for Deputy Reynolds and, indeed, for his family.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Reynolds for raising this important matter.  I have noted his comments carefully and I will ensure they are brought to the attention of the Anglo-Irish Conference, which, as the Deputy said, will meet in the not too distant future.  I shall probably deal with the matter generally rather than specifically. The Deputy will recognise why I should approach it in that fashion.  He may be assured that when the meeting concludes I will report to him the outcome of my discussions with my British counterpart within the Conference.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy for people in the Leitrim-Fermanagh Border area and I can assure them that the Government are fully aware of the difficulties caused to local communities in the Leitrim and Fermanagh Border areas by closed Border roads.  I fully appreciate the frustration felt by the local communities in having to shoulder the negative economic and social consequences arising out of the closure of Border roads in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> The question of closed Border roads has been repeatedly raised with the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, where the matter receives detailed and ongoing consideration, and where the officials take every opportunity to impress upon the British authorities the social and economic disruption caused to the people of Leitrim and Fermanagh by closed roads.  The issue has also been discussed at several meetings of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, and I should like to assure Deputy Reynolds that the issue will continue to receive both my attention within the conference and the close attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Reynolds knows, the Government take the view that all road closures, including those in the Leitrim-Fermanagh area, should be kept under careful review and should be maintained only where security considerations clearly outweigh the inconvenience to the local community.  Deputy Reynolds has made a strong case in his speech for the reopening of the closed Border roads between Leitrim and Fermanagh.  There are, however, serious security considerations arising from the continuing campaign of violence which make it difficult to make progress on this issue, and recent attacks have undoubtedly placed further obstacles in the way of progress in that regard.  These considerations must be weighed carefully against the negative economic and social effects of the crossings remaining closed.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the British authorities are keeping the situation under review and I will continue to draw attention through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference to the problems experienced by the communities most affected in counties Leitrim and Fermanagh and to their views on particular road closures as articulated by Deputy Reynolds.  I will also continue to urge that road closures should be maintained only where there are most persuasive security reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Deputy <Col N="218" /> Reynolds for raising the matter, ably supported by my colleague Deputy Matt Brennan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance and I congratulate him on his re-appointment.</P>
      <P>Tonight I wish to refer to a former Member of the House who served here from 1927 to 1942 and raise the issue of the pensions of widows of former Deputies who ceased office before 1960 and who had served here for at least five years.</P>
      <P>Under section 29 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, a special non-contributory pensions scheme is provided for widows.  However, the pension is means tested.  As there are very few of those widows living I request that the means test for those pensions be abolished immediately and that the widows be given due recognition by payment of the pension.  I particularly speak of the widow of a Member who served in this House from 1927 until his untimely death in 1942.  His widow is getting nothing for the years he spent here.  The TD's salary under the Oireachtas (Payment of Members) Act, 1923 was £30 per month.  This Act provided first class free travel for TDs from their constituency to this House.  Under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938 TDs were awarded an increase to £40 per month.  It was further increased by 30 per cent in 1947.  They were not really working for money at that time.  There are very few of those widows living.  I ask the Minister to abolish the means testing and recognise these people by giving them some sort of pension for their last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brennan for raising this issue and for his kind remarks.  On all sides of the House there is considerable concern about different aspects of pensions, particularly spouses pensions.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are putting much time and effort into this.  This aspect of pensions however would not be within their ambit because <Col N="219" /> section 29 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963 provided a special non-contributory scheme for former Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas whose service ceased before 30 April 1960 and who were not accordingly eligible to join the contributory Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme which was introduced in that year.</P>
      <P>The making of an award under the section 29 scheme is at the discretion of the Minister for Finance having regard to the financial circumstances of the grantee. In practice, the applicant furnishes particulars of means and the Minister for Finance, in consultation with a special committee of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, decides on the grant.</P>
      <P>The scheme also applies to widows of Members.  The maximum pension payable to such a widow is the equivalent of the minimum pension payable to a widow under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme.  The current rate is £2,889.48 per annum.  At the moment there are four widows in receipt of the pension.  The pension is subject to a means test.  If the claimant is in receipt of other income in excess of the means test limit, no pension is paid.  While I have every sympathy for the period involved, and with Deputy Brennan's proposal, in present circumstances we cannot ignore the fact that these people are linked to many more cases.  I could not readily agree to Deputy Brennan's proposal which would require amending legislation and would raise serious and potentially costly policy issues such as the social welfare means test and the position of public servants and their spouses who do not benefit from pension schemes because they retired before the schemes were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter which will be continually looked at by Members of the House.  We will look at all the schemes. If we were to change the rules now for only four people it would raise problems because of the link to a huge number of <Col N="220" /> people in a related area.  I hope to look further into the matter and to talk again with Deputy Brennan and, perhaps, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at a later date.</P>

      <P>The Bonet drainage scheme in County Leitrim started in 1982 and ceased in December or January last. Workers were handed redundancy notices stating that the scheme had ceased due to there being no finance available.  In June last year the Taoiseach who was then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, wrote to Deputy Ellis stating that funding would be given to complete the scheme.  Unfortunately that commitment has not been fulfilled.  I am not raising this just for the sake of the workers but because farmers in the areas where the work has not been completed are suffering serious flooding. This is a political question.</P>
      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister could inform me if extra funding will be made available to complete the work as set out in the first schedule of the scheme. If that money is not forthcoming we will have all sorts of difficulties and problems in the area.  Numerous commitments were given by the Minister's predecessor to the effect that money would be made available.</P>

      <P>Work on the Bonet catchment drainage scheme was suspended indefinitely last month with almost 91 per cent of the scheduled works completed.  The reason for the suspension was based on economic and environmental considerations.  Costly claims would arise from damage to fisheries if work in environmentally sensitive areas went ahead.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to resume work at this stage so the question of providing funding at this time does not arise.  I will pass the Deputy's comments to the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the statutory authority for the establishment of representative associations for members of the Defence Forces rests with the Minister for Defence.  The drafting of Defence Force regulations to provide for the formal establishment of a representative association for members of the Reserve Defence Forces, is at an advanced stage in my Department.  Meetings between representatives &mdash; civil and military &mdash; of my Department and representatives from An Fórsa Cosanta Áit-iúil and An Slua Muirí in regard to the content of these draft regulations were held on 1 May 1991 and 6 November 1991.  In addition there has been a considerable amount of communication by letter and phone between my Department and the representatives.</P>
      <P>The present situation is that draft Defence Force regulations, modified to take account of the views expressed at the meetings, were forwarded to the representatives on 17 December 1991.  Their further comments are awaited.</P>

      <P>As at 31 December 1991, seven members of the Permanent Defence Force were serving overseas with non-United Nations missions, six with the EC Monitor Mission to Yugoslavia and one officer in Vienna acting as Military Adviser to the Irish delegation to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).  On 29 January 1992, three officers took up duty with the EC Task Force for Food Aid to Russia, bringing the total number of Irish military personnel currently with non-UN missions to ten.  All the Military personnel concerned are serving in a voluntary unarmed capacity.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the Defence Act, 1954, for military service within the State as well as service outside the State in certain circumstances.  Provision for service overseas under the aegis of the United Nations is contained in the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1960.  These provisions do not preclude service otherwise outside the State on a voluntary basis.</P>

      <P>Efforts are ongoing to improve communications between Irish troops serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and their families. Existing facilities include one free five minute telephone call home per month for each member of UNIFIL and the use of a special radio system linked to the telephone system in Dublin which is used as required for contact between personnel in Lebanon and their families in Ireland.  There is also a family support system in Ireland whereby relatives of personnel serving with UNIFIL can be put in urgent contact with them in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>While there are no plans for an overseas radio service, as such, overseas requests recorded by RTE are sent to the Irish contingent in UNIFIL for rebroadcast. The main GAA and soccer matches are transmitted by telephone to Lebanon and are relayed to the Irish Battalion by UN radio.  A news digest of extracts from Irish newspapers is sent to Lebanon every day.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of £4.5 million in the Defence Estimate for this year for capital building works will be expended on the most urgently needed requirements, and the demands of Collins Barracks, Cork, will be taken into account in the allocation of these resources.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the importance of recreational facilities in Army barracks generally throughout the State and due regard will be had to the provision of such facilities within the limits of the available resources.</P>
      <P>I am continuing my efforts to obtain special funding for the construction of such facilities within the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>While the perception of the risk of nuclear war is less than it has been for many years, the State must also be prepared to respond to the consequences of a peacetime industrial nuclear accident such as occurred in Chernobyl.

      <P>Unit funds, which are established in each unit of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, are composed mainly of grants from public funds and moneys transferred from the welfare fund of the unit concerned.  The expenditure from unit funds is intended to meet such costs as fuel, light, cleaning of halls, postage, stationery and so on and to meet such other expenses as may be authorised by the officer commanding the command FCA in the case of the FCA and by the flag officer in the case of An Slua Muirí.</P>
      <P>The amount of grant from public funds allocated to units in 1991 was £20,000.</P>

      <P>Defence Forces Regulations provide for the payment to a person who has been appointed to be an officer of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil or An Slua Muirí, of an initial uniform allowance towards the cost of providing himself with a uniform tunic and trousers.</P>
      <P>Defence Forces Regulations also provide for the payment of an allowance to an officer, for the purpose of replacing the uniform tunic and trousers, in respect of each year in which he completes a continuous period of at least seven days full-time training or instruction or attends at least 24 local training parades or the equivalent in hours of training.</P>
      <P>Officers of the reserve of officers (first line) retain their uniform on transfer to the reserve and receive one third of the Permanent Defence Force replacement allowance each year in which they undergo seven days training.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 39 (1) of DFR R5 states:</P>
      <P>A member may, with his own consent, be required to attend on one occasion, as soon as possible after the commencement of his service, for a course of basic training or intruction for a continuous period of not less than fourteen and not more than thirty days at such time and at such place as the Officer Commanding the Command FCA concerned may determine. </P>
      <P>Because of the restrictions that have applied to annual training for members of the reserve since 1983 as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure it is not always possible to facilitate recruits on a course of annual training in their first year of service.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to annual training is kept under constant review with the objective of restoring normal arrangements as soon as circumstances allow.</P>

    <P>There are no officers of the reserve of officers serving in acting ranks.  Promotion to acting rank mainly arises when officers are promoted to fill temporary vacancies created by assignment of personnel to United Nations duty.  On 31 December 1991 there were 145 officers serving with United Nations missions. Pay and allowances are the same for acting and substantive ranks.</P>
    <P>Officers promoted on an acting basis <Col N="169" /> to serve with the United Nations revert to their substantive rank on return from overseas duty; they may compete for promotion to vacancies in the rank in which they were acting.  Other officers promoted on an acting basis are normally made substantive in their new rank after a period of service in an acting capacity.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence is the promoting authority for officers of the Defence Forces; the financial sanction of the Minister for Finance is required for promotions.</P>

      <P>The Santry complex was acquired in 1983 for the purpose of accommodating the barrack master's stores and offices, garage and ancillary services and a divisional headquarters station for the north central division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A section of the complex was developed/refurbished in 1984 and the divisional headquarters was accommodated in this area.  It was estimated at that time that it would cost £4 million to develop the remainder of the complex to accommodate the barrack master's requirements and those of the Garda garage.  When it became apparent that there would be some delay in commencing this project due to other demands on available funds, it was agreed to make available on a temporary basis a section of the lower half of the <Col N="173" /> complex for storage for other Government Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fee of £200 which the Deputy refers to is the fee paid by a candidate who remains in school in order to repeat the leaving certificate examination. The fee is made up of two components. A sum of £100 was paid by the candidate in respect of the examination entry fee and a further £100 was paid in respect of the course fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the examination entry fee, the position is that the candidate did not sit the examination, but my Department was not informed at any stage of his intention not to sit.  Futhermore no application for a refund was made to my Department.  In any event such an application would only have been considered in exceptional circumstances, <Col N="174" /> e.g. if the candidate was unable to sit because of illness.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to the course fee is that payment of this fee is one of the conditions under which pupils are enrolled on repeat leaving certificate courses.  This enables my Department to pay a <i>per capita</i> grant to the school and to include the pupil in the count for teacher quota allocation, though, of course, it covers only a small part of the resultant costs.  There is no provision for a refund of fees in the case of a pupil who does not complete his final year's study.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 29 December 1988 and claimed an invalidity pension on 26 August 1991.  He was examined by a medical referee of the Department on 8 October 1991 who expressed an opinion that he was incapable of work, but not permanently incapable.  He was informed of this decision, and of his right of appeal, on 3 December 1991.</P>
      <P>There is no trace of an appeal having been received from him.  The Deputy's question is now being accepted as an appeal and the case is being referred to the independent social welfare appeals office.  In connection with this appeal, arrangements are being made to have a further medical examination carried out by a different medical referee on 24 February 1992.</P>

The scheme is funded by the Community and the categories of people covered are set out in EC regulations.  These regulations state that the scheme applies only to people getting social assistance payments and not to other groups.  Invalidity pension is not a social assistance payment and consequently butter vouchers cannot be issued to people in receipt of that pension.</P>
